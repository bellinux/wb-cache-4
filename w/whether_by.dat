5|$|Camouflage is the {{concealment}} {{of animals}} or objects of military interest by {{any combination of}} methods that helps them to remain unnoticed. This includes the use of high-contrast disruptive patterns as used on military uniforms, but anything that delays recognition {{can be used as}} camouflage. Camouflage involves deception, <b>whether</b> <b>by</b> looking like the background or by resembling something else, which may be plainly visible to observers. This article lists methods used by animals and the military to escape notice.|$|E
5|$|In some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is {{required}} {{as well as}} royal assent. In other monarchies—such as Sweden—the government officially promulgates laws. In both cases, however, the process of royal assent is usually a formality, <b>whether</b> <b>by</b> constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (<b>whether</b> <b>by</b> land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E

50|$|On August 16, 1898, German surgeon August Bier (18611949) {{performed}} surgery under {{spinal anesthesia}} in Kiel. Following {{the publication of}} Bier's experiments in 1899, a controversy developed about <b>whether</b> <b>Bier</b> or Corning performed the first successful spinal anesthetic.|$|R

5|$|Macedonism (Македонизъм) is the {{political}} ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians, with their own separate language, history and culture. It {{is also used to}} describe what Bulgarians view as the falsification of their history <b>whether</b> <b>by</b> Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the Macedonist point of view. It carries strong negative connotations.|$|E
5|$|There {{are areas}} which people {{believe to be}} {{protected}} from tornadoes, <b>whether</b> <b>by</b> being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.|$|E
5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, and the primary function of camouflage is to deceive the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (<b>whether</b> <b>by</b> countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light Rail to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light rail to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, <b>whether</b> <b>by</b> light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, <b>whether</b> <b>by</b> side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|The {{first line}} of defence {{consists}} in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, <b>whether</b> <b>by</b> advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and by living in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and {{the likelihood that the}} predator will attack some other individual.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} repeated, random clearing (<b>whether</b> <b>by</b> natural disturbance or human activity) is that contiguous cover can break down into isolated patches.
