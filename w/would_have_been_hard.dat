25|$|As {{stated the}} 1775 Armstrong map of Ayrshire clearly shows a 'Chapel' marked, {{so it was}} known to exist at this time, however the remains would have been mined/removed {{over the years by}} local farmers and used for {{building}} work, etc. The remains of the chapel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to locate by the early 18th century. Arrowsmith's 1807 map shows Chapel marked near Linshaw (Lainshaw) and no Laigh mentioned, while Ainslie's 1821 map shows a Chapel and a Laigh. It is likely that the term Chapel on most maps could be referring to a dwelling or farm and not the Chapel on the mound.|$|E
25|$|By {{separating}} Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud {{wanted to}} capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities {{and turn it into}} political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to manipulate it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> for Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo as drawn by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta. On the other hand, Damascus, which is basically an oasis on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to lure Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so that it would never want to unite with Damascus again.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{and long}} history shaped Polish attitudes towards the Jews and Jewish attitudes towards the Poles, but the anti-Jewish {{sentiment}} in Poland had reached its zenith {{in the years}} leading to the Second World War. Between 1935 and 1937 seventy-nine Jews were killed and 500 injured in anti-Jewish incidents. National policy was such that the Jews who largely worked {{at home and in}} small shops were excluded from welfare benefits according to American commentators. Nevertheless, the impact of right-wing extremism <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to substantiate in towns with percentage of Jews equal or even higher than that of the non-Jewish Poles. In the provincial capital of Łuck Jews constituted 48.5% of the diverse multicultural population of 35,550 Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and others. Łuck had the largest Jewish community in the voivodeship. In the capital of Brześć in 1936 Jews constituted 41.3% of general population and some 80.3% of private enterprises were owned by Jews. The 32% of Jewish inhabitants of Radom enjoyed considerable prominence also, with 90% of small businesses in the city owned and operated by the Jews including tinsmiths, locksmiths, jewellers, tailors, hat makers, hairdressers, carpenters, house painters and wallpaper installers, shoemakers, as well as most of the artisan bakers and clock repairers. In Lubartów, 53.6% of the town's population were Jewish also along with most of its economy. In a town of Luboml, 3,807 Jews lived among its 4,169 inhabitants, constituting the essence of its social and political life.|$|E

The bulk of the building was made of brick, faced with ashlar stone, with external walls [...] thick. Two walls ran alongside either side of the blockhouse, parallel with the river, forming part of the adjacent platforms for mounting additional guns; in 1600, the east platform was described as being [...] long and [...] wide.

500|$|The {{character}} routes {{were divided}} between Takeshi and the Kid {{according to what}} made sense for the plot, rather than {{in an effort to}} pair up the player characters with specific female characters. Although the routes were given a recommended playing order, this did not occur until around the time the scenario was finished. According to Nakazawa, bad endings were painful to write, but were included both as foils to the good ending to increase the sense of accomplishment in reaching the good ending, and as [...] "what if?" [...] events that give the story variety, showing what would have happened had events played out differently. The game's epilogue was not originally planned, but was written by Uchikoshi in three days after being advised by Nakazawa. When a PlayStation Portable version was developed, Nakazawa was asked to create new content for it; as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to expand the story or add new event computer graphics artwork (CGs), it was decided to create an in-game dictionary explaining terms used to allow players to enjoy the game on a deeper level.|$|E
500|$|Thank Me Later {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 26 reviews. Tim Sendra of AllMusic complimented its [...] "rich and nuanced production and Drake's thoughtful, playful, and intense lyrics", writing that his [...] "willingness to be introspective and honest ... makes [...] unique and helps make Thank Me Later special." [...] Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal said [...] "Drake vies for superstardom while embracing his non-drug-dealing, non-violent, non-dire history-- one that connects with most rap fans {{in a completely}} reasonable way." [...] In The A.V. Club, Rabin wrote that [...] "on his cohesive, bittersweet, assured debut, he proves himself worthy of the sometimes-blinding spotlight." [...] Rosen, writing for Rolling Stone, found Drake to be [...] "in total command of a style that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to imagine dominating hip-hop a few years ago". In the opinion of Ben Detrick from Spin, Thank Me Later had [...] "dynamics like few other hip-hop albums before it", and while [...] "Drake's personal anecdotes lack the bravado of bullet-wound boasts", they were [...] "intimate and lyrically detailed enough to draw blood." [...] Prefix critic Wilson McBee deemed {{it one of the}} few pop-rap records [...] "that comes close to being a classic".|$|E
50|$|The film {{performed}} reasonably at the box-office and in 1979 {{reported that}} it had just broken even. It also rated highly on television, the rights for which earned Hexagon $70,000.

500|$|Paige {{transferred}} to the New York production of Sunset Boulevard to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've come home at last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was just the most perfect time to go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was the most terrible feeling.... I'd felt I'd lost something so very important to me. I thought it had died and gone away." ...|$|E
2500|$|It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> {{for anyone}} {{to step into the}} shoes of Dr Price, but the {{minister}} from 1778 to his death in 1799 was a remarkable character in his own right. Joseph Towers was born in about 1738, the son of a poor bookseller, and was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Goadby of Sherborne. [...] Lacking formal education, he read all he could and educated himself, eventually writing learned works such as Criminal Libel and the Duty of Juries, and being awarded a Doctor of Law degree by Edinburgh University. Towers assisted fellow minister Andrew Kippis in developing the Biographia Britannica, a forerunner of the Dictionary of National Biography. [...] He was secretary of the highly respectable Society for Constitutional Information, which lobbied for political liberties, but it was suppressed by the authorities, who lived in fear of the Reign of Terror crossing the Channel. Towers was put under arrest until the Archbishop of Canterbury intervened on his behalf.|$|E
2500|$|The Zephyr flew for {{the first}} time with Paul Bulman in control on 3 September 1923, with just over a month before the start of the Lympne Trials on 8 October. It was {{certainly}} later than intended, for the Zephyr had been registered as a competitor in the Vauvilles (near Cherbourg) Light Plane and Glider event which ended on 26 August. The first flight went well, and Bulman reported excellent handling. However, by this time the Aero Club had designed and built the much more modern looking Hurricane, a cantilever monoplane with less air resistance and slightly lower weight, though no lightweight. The Zephyr was therefore even more underpowered than the Hurricane, and it was decided to put the Douglas engine into the latter aircraft and enter it for the trials. The wing area of the biplane was more than three times that of the Hurricane, making for such a low wing loading (2.54 b/sq. ft. or 12.4kg/m2) that the Zephyr <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>hard</b> to fly except in a dead calm. [...] With the loss of its engine the sole Zephyr, registered G-EBGW was abandoned, though not destroyed until 1925.|$|E
