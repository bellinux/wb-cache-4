5|$|Clemson {{received}} Georgia Tech's kickoff with 1:20 {{remaining in}} the game. On the Tigers' first play, they committed a 10-yard penalty.

This set up a fourth-and-two for the Tigers, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> to gain a first down to keep their potential game-winning drive going. Instead, Parker was stymied {{in his attempt to}} run for the needed yards, and Clemson turned the ball over on downs.

5|$|Harold {{had spent}} mid-1066 {{on the south}} coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The bulk of his forces were militia <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold {{dismissed}} the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the state of long-term care service use by individuals certified as requiring lower care and, from the viewpoint of their relationship with society, to clarify why individuals do not use services. A questionnaire using un-named, individually filled-in forms via mailing was administered targeting 2, 355 elderly people who maintain an at home lifestyle and receive approved Needing support 1 and 2 and Long-term care 1 and 2. We have received the following results. ① Participants not using had higher IADL scores. Also, the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> support showed a significantly higher rate in living alone, and the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> long-term care had a lower average age and showed a significantly higher rate in residency of 10 years or more. ② The group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> support responded, “Having discussion with family members” while the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> longterm care responded, “no discussion with family members and other people. ” Thereby, showing a relation to unused long-term care service. From the above results, we have determined that the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> support and the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> long-term care have different backgrounds, revealing the possibility that the groups require separate support measures. Moreover, there is a possibility that those not using but belonging to the group <b>who</b> <b>need</b> long-term care may be isolated from family and neighbors. Hence it may be required to create a mechanism in which we can gain an understanding of their situation and build an individual relationship with them through house-calls, etc...|$|R
5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E

5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external modem port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot for consumers <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> traditional functions.|$|E

Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.

5|$|The sea {{appears in}} human culture in {{contradictory}} ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous.

It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Scylla in Greek mythology, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology.

5|$|To secure phenol for aspirin production, and at {{the same}} time {{indirectly}} aid the German war effort, German agents in the United States orchestrated what became known as the Great Phenol Plot. By 1915, the price of phenol rose to the point that Bayer's aspirin plant was forced to drastically cut production. This was especially problematic because Bayer was instituting a new branding strategy in preparation of the expiry of the aspirin patent in the United States. Thomas Edison, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> phenol to manufacture phonograph records, was also facing supply problems; in response, he created a phenol factory capable of pumping out twelve tons per day. Edison's excess phenol seemed destined for trinitrophenol production.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{as active}} in routine business, Johnson still took an {{interest}} in political events. For example, he spearheaded the efforts of the booksellers of London and Westminster to appeal a new copyright law in 1808. Moreover, although Johnson did not publish controversial political works after his imprisonment, he still undertook important publishing ventures. For example, he administered the publication of a forty-five volume work entitled The British Essayists, edited by Alexander Chalmers; the complete works of Samuel Johnson; and a ten-volume set of Shakespeare. Johnson published in more congers during the last decade of his life than at any other time. He also occasionally published important new authors, such as the political economist Thomas Malthus, whose Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) sparked a long debate between idealists and pragmatists. His emphasis on educational books continued or even increased as his interest in publishing contentious political works diminished. He also continued to support his friends, as with Godwin, <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> financial rescue after his play, Faulkener, cost him £800.|$|E
