5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized {{the books of}} the cathedral library, taking them to Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on that cold <b>winter</b> <b>day,</b> were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, {{who claimed to be}} a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part of it as a stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E

25|$|Average summertime on or next to {{the water}} brings days around 80°F (26°C), with {{overnight}} lows around 65°F (18°C). Less than one-half mile (800 m) away from the water, days can be warmer and nights cooler by several degrees.

25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One <b>winter</b> <b>day,</b> with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E

500|$|The {{little brown}} bat lives in three {{different}} roosting sites: day roosts, night roost and hibernation roosts. Bats use day and night roosts during spring, summer, and fall while hibernacula are used in <b>winter.</b> <b>Day</b> roosts are usually in buildings or trees, under rocks or wood piles and sometimes in caves. Nursery roosts are in natural hollows and buildings (or at least close to them). They have been found under the sheet metal roofs of trappers' caches and attics of buildings. Night roosts tend {{to be in the}} same buildings as day roosts, but these roosts tend to be in different spots that are more constrained and the bats pack together for warmth. Bats rest in night roosts after feeding in the evening which may serve to keep their feces away from the day roosts and thus less noticeable to predators. Brown bats typically hibernate in caves and perhaps unused mines. Northern populations of bats enter hibernation in early September and end in mid-May while southern populations enter in November and ends mid-March. Little brown bats are true hibernators. [...] As observed in the Mid-Atlantic States during periods of warming during the winter, typically over 50 degrees (F), little brown bats emerge from their winter torpor and hunt insects that have emerged as well in response to the warmer conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Taipei has a monsoon-influenced humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen: Cfa). Summers are long-lasting, hot and humid, {{and accompanied by}} occasional heavy rainstorms and typhoons, while winters are short, generally warm and generally very foggy due to the northeasterly winds from the vast Siberian High being intensified by the pooling of this cooler air in the Taipei Basin. As {{in the rest of}} Northern Taiwan, daytime temperatures of Taipei can often peak above 26 degrees Celsius during a warm <b>winter</b> <b>day,</b> while they can dip below 26 degrees Celsius during a rainy summer's afternoon. Occasional cold fronts during the winter months can drop the daily temperature by 3 to 5 degrees Celsius, though temperatures rarely drop below 10 degrees Celsius. Extreme temperatures ranged from [...] on February 13, 1901 to [...] on August 8, 2013, while snow has never been recorded in the city besides on mountains located within the city limit such as Mount Yangmingshan.

2500|$|Reliefs {{from the}} wall of the temple of Soleb in Nubia and scenes from the Theban tomb of Kheruef, Steward of the King's Great Wife, Tiye, depict Amenhotep as a visibly weak and sick figure. Scientists believe that in his final years he {{suffered}} from arthritis and became obese. It has generally been assumed by some scholars that Amenhotep requested and received from his father-in-law Tushratta of Mitanni, a statue of Ishtar of Nineveh—a healing goddess—in order to cure him of his various ailments which included painful abscesses in his teeth. A forensic examination of his mummy shows that he was probably in constant pain during his final years due to his worn, and cavity-pitted teeth. However, more recent analysis of Amarna letter EA 23 by William L. Moran, which recounts the dispatch of the statue of the goddess to Thebes, does not support this popular theory. The arrival of the statue is known to have coincided with Amenhotep III's marriage with Tadukhepa, Tushratta's daughter, in the pharaoh's 36th year; letter EA 23's arrival in Egypt is dated to [...] "regnal year 36, the fourth month of <b>winter,</b> <b>day</b> 1" [...] of his reign. Furthermore, Tushratta never mentions in EA 23 that the statue's dispatch was meant to heal Amenhotep of his maladies. Instead, Tushratta merely writes, ...|$|E

2500|$|General Murray survived two plane crashes in his lifetime. The {{first was}} before the {{ejection}} seat and took place when he was instructing a student {{that was one of}} The Tuskeegee Airmen. They were flying in a single-engine, two-seater trainer with a slide-back canopy over Florida. An oil hose broke and they lost engine power. Murray was able {{to take control of the}} plane and land it in a swampy field, causing severe damage to the engine and belly of the plane. They were not injured. The second plane crash was when General Murray was an executive for an aerospace company and was aboard the company's business jet as a passenger. The plane began its descent for landing on a very cold <b>winter</b> <b>day</b> in Michigan. General Murray, concerned about an ice buildup, looked out the window over the wing and noticed large sheets of ice on the wings. He quickly notified the pilots, but it was too late. General Murray then observed the ice breaking off of the wings and being sucked into the jet engine intakes. The engines shut down, and the plane had to make an emergency landing on a partially iced-over lake. Upon the plane crashing, it immediately burst into flames. General Murray quickly opened the door and ushered out the pilots and the other executives he was traveling with. The water was now covered in aircraft fuel. The fuel ignited, leaving General Murray no escape. His only option was to dive into the flames that were on top of the water. He suffered burns that were, fortunately, not serious. He said that swimming in the icy waters was the worst of it! ...|$|E
