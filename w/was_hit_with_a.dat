5|$|McGee's first post-TUF {{fight was}} against UFC veteran, Ryan Jensen at UFC 121. Early {{in the first}} round, McGee <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stiff shot that dropped him and later {{suffered}} a minor cut below his eye. In the second round, Jensen began to visibly tire and after being hit, began to bleed from the nose. McGee won the second round after a takedown just before the bell. In the third round, McGee successfully executed a takedown and a full mount, where he secured an arm triangle choke to force the tapout at 1:21 of the final round.|$|E
5|$|On the April 2, 2007, {{episode of}} Raw, the Hardys won the World Tag Team Championship {{for the sixth}} time in their career after winning a ten team battle royal. After losing singles bouts to both Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, The Hardys {{retained}} their World Tag Team Championship at both Backlash and Judgment Day against the team of Cade and Murdoch. At One Night Stand, Hardyz retained the titles against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) in a ladder match. The next night on Raw, however, the Hardys lost their championship to Cade and Murdoch, when Jeff missed a Swanton Bomb and was pinned by Cade after Murdoch pushed his foot off of the bottom rope of the ring. Cade and Murdoch attacked the Hardys with the championship belts after the match. The Hardys got a rematch at , but was unsuccessful after Jeff <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sitout spinebuster from Cade.|$|E
5|$|She {{was part}} of the Neutrality Patrol at the {{beginning}} of World War II and supported Allied landings at North Africa, and then conducted convoy patrol duty to North African and European ports throughout 1943. On 6 June 1944, she supported Operation Overlord, covering Allied landings on the beaches of Normandy, France, in particular the battle at Pointe du Hoc. Later that month on 25 June, she supported the bombardment of Cherbourg and there was damaged when she <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> German artillery shell. In July she moved to support Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Following extensive repairs and training, she moved to the Pacific and supported the invasion of Iwo Jima in February 1945. She then moved to support landings on Okinawa in April. Following the end of the war, Texas was decommissioned and in 1948 she was moved to San Jacinto State Park and converted into a museum ship, where she remains today.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{headed for}} Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Fearing the Japanese Navy, {{they sought to}} travel via the Lingga Islands hoping that the island group it sat in {{could be used as}} a hiding place. As they {{approached}} on 14 February, Judy indicated the approach of Japanese aircraft and the anti-aircraft gunners took up their positions in readiness. The Grasshopper <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single bomb before the planes departed. Judy was below decks when the planes returned. The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs and sank quickly. The Grasshopper was hit by a further two bombs, and the order was given to abandon ship as a fire spread close to an ammunition compartment. Boats were lowered and the crew and evacuees were ferried just over a hundred yards to shore whilst the Japanese planes strafed the vessels. It was only when they were ashore that they realised Judy was not with them.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson's withdrawal, Humphrey <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{barrage of}} media {{interest}} and fanfare. His aides Max Kampelman and Bill Connell began {{to set up}} an organization and held meetings with Humphrey and his advisors, encouraging him to start a campaign. Humphrey set up offices for preparation, and unsuccessfully courted Larry O'Brien as campaign manager. O'Brien explained that his loyalties lied with the Kennedy family, leaving Humphrey undecided on whom to hire. Connell added lawyer and former DNC Treasurer Richard McGuire, who established the temporary campaign headquarters at his law firm. Eventually, Humphrey decided to embrace the youth of politics, adding Senators Fred R. Harris and Walter Mondale, who agreed to lead the Democrats United for Humphrey organization. Harris was put in charge of winning delegates, and Mondale prepared for the convention, helping to keep an organization in place. Kampelman, Connell and McGuire questioned Humphrey's decision to hire the Senators, explaining that they had no organizational experience. Humphrey worried about his organization in the state of Iowa, but Harris and Mondale assured him that what would be lost in the state would be made up in Maryland. The campaign believed they could build a coalition of southern and border state Democrats as well as Union and Civil rights leaders to win the nomination. Mondale and Harris also desired to add a few anti-war liberals to the coalition. Meanwhile, Humphrey's office constantly received calls urging him to announce. Congressman Hale Boggs and Senator Russell Long, both of Louisiana, warned Humphrey that if he did not declare his candidacy soon, Kennedy would secure the nomination. Labor leader George Meany also called for Humphrey to announce immediately, but when Humphrey explained {{that he did not want}} to rush into a campaign, Meany called President Johnson to demand that Humphrey announce. Johnson refused, and never explicitly asked Humphrey to run. Governors Harold Hughes of Iowa and Philip H. Hoff of Vermont, each advised Humphrey to resign as Vice President to separate himself from Johnson, but he declined. Before the official announcement, Humphrey met with Johnson and discussed the future. The President advised Humphrey that his biggest obstacle as a candidate would be money and organization, and that he must focus on the Midwest and Rust Belt states in order to win.|$|E

25|$|In 1224, a Mongol envoy {{was killed}} in obscure {{circumstances}} and Korea stopped paying tribute. Ögedei dispatched Saritai (Sartaq) to subdue Korea and avenge the dead envoy in 1231. Thus, Mongol armies began to invade Korea in order to subdue the kingdom. The Goryeo King temporarily submitted and agreed to accept Mongol overseers. When they withdrew for the summer, however, Choe U moved the capital from Kaesong to Ganghwa Island. Saritai <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stray arrow and died as he campaigned against them.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Cambodia <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> malaria epidemic. The {{situation}} of the epidemic was aggravated {{by a lack of}} qualified practitioners and poor quality control which led to a market of fake antimalarial drugs. Counterfeit antimalarial drugs were {{responsible for the deaths of}} at least 30 people during the epidemic. This has prompted efforts by MSF to set up and fund a malaria outreach project and utilise Village Malaria Workers. MSF also introduced a switching of first-line treatment to a combination therapy (Artesunate and Mefloquine) to combat resistance and fatality of old drugs that were used to treat the disease traditionally.|$|E

25|$|When the California {{electricity}} crisis {{slammed the}} state in 2001, Davis was blasted for his slow and ineffective response. His approval rating dropped into the 30s and never recovered. When the energy crisis settled down, Davis's administration <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fund-raising scandal. California had a $95 million contract with Oracle Corporation that {{was found to be}} unnecessary and overpriced by the state auditor. Three of Davis's aides were fired or resigned after it was revealed that the governor's technology adviser accepted a $25,000 campaign contribution shortly after the contract was signed. The money was returned, but the scandal fueled close scrutiny of Davis's fundraising for his 2002 re-election bid.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1949, Texas <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> devastating drought that {{extended}} until 1957. Rainfall decreased 30 to 50 percent, while temperatures rose, killing crops, livestock, and triggering {{a rise of}} dust storms. As a result, the number of Texas farms and ranches declined by nearly 100,000, and Texas experienced a period of mass urbanization as the rural population moved {{to the city to}} rebuild their livelihoods. The state's rural population declined from {{more than a third of}} the population to a quarter. As a result, the Texas Water Development Board was created in 1957, and the state began a period of building a diverse system of water conservation plans. This included increasing access to groundwater, and creating lakes by damming rivers.|$|E
25|$|Not {{being an}} economist, Louis resented the preponderant {{share in the}} French market, taken by the Dutch, on {{basically}} emotional grounds, but his new Superintendent of Finances, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, gave focused impetus to this resentment by a well-organised complex of economic policies, of a mercantilist nature. The first of these was his tariff list of 1664, which was calculated to just wrest away important French markets from the Dutch, without completely closing down trade (except for the trade in refined sugar, which <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prohibitive tariff). However, in 1667 this was followed with a much more draconian list that doubled tariffs on Dutch fine cloth, linen, and Delftware; quadrupled them on whale products (for which France was Holland's biggest customer); and raised them sevenfold for tobacco products.|$|E

25|$|In January 1942 the {{division}} became the 109th Rifle Division. On 1 June {{the division}} withdrew back to Cape Kherson {{after the final}} German offensive, holding positions between Streletskaya Bay and Firsovo Farm. After the evacuation of Filipp Oktyabrsky and Ivan Yefimovich Petrov Novikov was appointed commander of the Sevastopol Defense Region by Petrov. On 2 July he left Sevastopol with other officers in subchaser SKA-112 and was intercepted by S-boats off Yalta. The subchaser was sunk after a running battle with the German boats and Novikov was captured. He {{was transferred to the}} Hammelburg camp. In December 1942, Novikov was transferred to the Flossenbürg concentration camp. He was killed by camp guards in August 1944. According to postwar testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Kalanchuk, Novikov died when he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stool by a camp guard near the furnace of Flossenbürg's 5th Block. Generals Ivan Muzychenko and Ivan Skugarev testified that Novikov died of overwork and exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|Altogether thirty-six sailors of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines {{were killed}} in action, another ninety-three were wounded. The main action lasted over a half hour and only two Americans were killed and seven wounded in total, {{including}} Reid who <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> musket ball. Reid's men fired nails, knife blades, brass buttons and other makeshift projectiles from their cannon which reportedly caused severe pain to the surviving British. After being repulsed the British slowly rowed back to their ships and it was 2:00 am on September 27 when they found them. Captain Loyd's response to the defeat was to send the Carnation back to destroy the General Armstrong after daylight but when she arrived, American fire caused further damage so Carnation broke off the attack. A little later the Carnation appeared again but Captain Reid had already chosen to scuttle his brig by firing one of his swivel guns straight through the hull. The vessel was boarded while it was sinking and the British set the sails on fire.|$|E
25|$|Francis M. Walker's men, which {{included}} his 19th Tennessee Infantry {{as well as}} Maney's old brigade, had not been engaged that day since they had been marched and countermarched almost back to their original position. Cleburne placed Walker's brigade on the left front of the attacking force. The attack was launched with about 3,500 men in total, with 2,000 more in a second wave, at about 6:00p.m. Cleburne himself led the attack with Walker's brigade. The Union force had about half {{the number of men}} but they were behind their defenses. Emerging from a stand of woods, Walker's men were hard hit and began to retreat before Cleburne and Maney rallied them. Then they moved with a two-sided assault with troops to their right toward the Union line. Despite taking about 100 casualties in their previous advances, Walker's men followed Walker, who was waving his sword in encouragement, toward the crest of the hill. As they reached the crest, Walker's brigade <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tremendous volley from defenders over the crest. Walker was killed by that volley. He had been appointed a brigadier general the previous day but he had not yet received written notification of his appointment. Walker's commission arrived at his headquarters the day after he was killed. After Walker's death, many of his men diverted to another point of attack to try to take a Union battery and suffered severe casualties. As night fell, the Confederates could not continue the attack and the Union troops held their fort {{at the top of the}} hill. The Confederates had sustained over 600 casualties while the Union defenders had endured about 550 casualties in the Battle of Bald Hill, which was but a small part of the overall Battle of Atlanta.|$|E
