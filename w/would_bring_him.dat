5|$|Faramir's {{decision}} {{to reject the}} One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon. By not taking the Ring, Faramir rejects the desire for power and glory {{and the desire for}} renown which a defeat of Sauron <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Earldom of Northumberland {{was then}} one of the {{greatest}} landholdings in northern England; Percy also became Lord Poynings on his marriage. This title <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> into direct conflict with the Poynings family themselves, and indeed, feuds with neighbouring nobles, both lay and ecclesiastical, would be a key occupancy of his youth.|$|E
5|$|Three of Galileo's five {{siblings}} survived infancy. The youngest, Michelangelo (or Michelagnolo), {{also became}} a noted lutenist and composer although he contributed to financial burdens during Galileo's young adulthood. Michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father's promised dowries to their brothers-in-law, who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due. Michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from Galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions. These financial burdens {{may have contributed to}} Galileo's early desire to develop inventions that <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> additional income.|$|E

60|$|Frank was {{friends with}} many of the fishermen, and these <b>would</b> often <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> strange fish and sea creatures brought up in their nets, instead of {{throwing}} them back into the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{your brother}} returns, as return he will, {{it will not}} be through Mr. Washington's help," [...] said Madam Esmond. [...] "He neither defended George on the field, nor <b>would</b> he <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> out of it." ...|$|R
5|$|Ronny is stabbed by a gang {{while trying}} to protect Tariq and has to have his kidney removed. However, it is {{discovered}} {{he was born with}} just one and will need a kidney transplant. None of his siblings are a tissue match, so Ash, Adi and Kareena visit their mother, but her kidney is not a match either. Tariq is forced to reveal that he is Dan's son, and he donates his kidney to Ronny. He explains that he thought having a mildly romantic relationship with his half sister <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> closer to the family. Adi dislikes the fact he and Tariq are half brothers, but mellows towards him eventually. When bailiffs arrive to evict the family from their home, they board themselves into their living room, but eventually admit defeat and move into a flat with Sasha, starting a minicab firm called Toucan Cars.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{resumed his}} duties in early November, by now {{promoted}} to major-general. He hoped his new rank <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> a corps or brigade command, but none was forthcoming as the Allied armies retreated {{slowly through the}} Netherlands towards Germany. By February 1795, they had reached Hanover. Ernest remained in Hanover over the next year, holding several unimportant postings. He had requested a return home to seek treatment for his eye, {{but it was not}} until early 1796 that the King agreed and allowed Ernest to return to Britain. There, Prince Ernest consulted a notable eye doctor, Wathen Waller, but Waller apparently found his condition inoperable, as no operation took place. Once back in Britain, Ernest repeatedly sought to be allowed to join the British forces on the Continent, even threatening to join the Yeomanry as a private, but both the King and the Duke of York refused. Ernest did not want to rejoin the Hanoverian forces, as they were not then involved in the fighting. In addition, Freytag was seriously ill, and Ernest was unwilling to serve under his likely successor, Count von Wallmoden.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2001, it was {{reported}} General Gennady Troshev, then-commander-in-chief of Russian forces in Chechnya, had offered a bounty of one million dollars to anyone who <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> the head of Basayev.|$|E
50|$|Rob Gier {{was born}} to Robert Gier and Rosario {{and grew up in}} Ascot, England. Upon coming from work, Rob's father <b>would</b> often <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> to {{football}} training. His mother, Rosario is a Waray-waray from Tacloban, Leyte.|$|R
60|$|This put {{life and}} mettle into {{the heels of}} the bonnet maker, who, turning his back on the {{supposed}} danger, set off at a pace which the smith never doubted <b>would</b> speedily <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> to his own house.|$|R
6000|$|... "There now, Mary, don't let {{yourself}} be overcome. You <b>would</b> not <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> back again, I know. Come, {{lie down and}} rest. There--that is right--and don't think of coming down stairs. You think your mamma had better not, don't you?" ...|$|R
25|$|During {{the same}} visit, Greenwald intervened with the Prime Minister {{to prevent the}} desecration of the Jewish {{cemetery}} in Vilnius. The Lithuanian government was going to raze the cemetery and erect a shopping mall on the site. Rabbi Greenwald contacted the Prime Minister's office and promised the Prime Minister that saving the cemetery <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> great blessing. As Greenwald had previously interceded on Lithuania's behalf as it sought to enter NATO, his words carried strong influence with the Prime Minister and his request was heeded.|$|E
25|$|Bellamy {{was born}} at Canada West, which would later be the {{province}} of Ontario. The son of an English immigrant, he entered the woodworking industry after finishing school. After returning to farming briefly, he moved to Manitoba where established an agricultural product dealing business and later worked for the Massey Harris agricultural supply company. His employment with that company <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> to Edmonton where he continued {{to work for them}} until he left to start his own business, the Bellamy Company, which manufactured agricultural products, establishing himself as a prominent Edmonton businessperson.|$|E
25|$|Nelson {{took them}} up on their offer and soon began {{training}} at the Freetown facility. It was there that he met Nick Steel and Brian Brieger who, in addition to Evans and Lazon, became his principal trainers. One of his earliest matches was against his former trainer Bob Evans whom he defeated at a show in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He eventually made his debut in 1994, under the name Tully McShane, and {{spent some time in}} Coastal Pro Wrestling before meeting Tony Rumble who <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> into his emerging Boston promotion, the Century Wrestling Alliance.|$|E
60|$|His {{interest}} in the material world, {{in the war of}} trade, was gone. His vast wealth <b>would</b> still <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> dividends, and his clerks and partners would still consult him, still demand his signatures, but the ones who made all these matters worth doing had vanished.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} slowly, [...] "I <b>would</b> not <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> to his death, but {{to life and}} honour and--love, and one day I shall be Pharaoh. Only, Asti, if you betray me to him I swear that I will bring you to your death, although you are so dear." ...|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic gave a {{thoroughly}} warm retrospective {{review of the}} album, praising its mellow and laid-back tone. They also considered the album a precursor to Scaggs's greatest artistic achievement, saying that it [...] "found him sketching out the blue-eyed soul that <b>would</b> eventually <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> fame when he streamlined it for 1976's Silk Degrees." ...|$|R
25|$|Parma's next task {{would be}} to take on Grosseto's fellow Serie B side Verona, who had emerged victorious over Sassuolo on a penalty {{shoot-out}} after a 3–3. A much-changed Ducali side included club legend Hernán Crespo, who {{went in search of}} an 11th Coppa Italia goal for the club that <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> level with all-time top scorer Alessandro Melli, while Verona sought a first appearance in the last 16 since 1996–97 after six consecutive Serie B victories. The second tier side were successful in realising that first appearance in fifteen years with a goal in either half against a poor Parma side.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{how much}} energy he put into this venture, which he hoped <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> some {{commercial}} success, Kees {{found time to}} produce a fine series of collages. He even had two more one-man shows in New York City as well as shows in San Francisco, including an impressive installation at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. He had also exchanged his film camera for a still camera, and began taking the photographs that would illustrate the book Nonverbal Communication (Berkeley:, University of California Press, 1956), which he wrote with Jurgen Ruesch, psychiatrist and semiotician. Many of these photographs would qualify as art photography as well as scientific data.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, certain {{leaders of}} the Arya Samaj held {{discussion}} and debate with Ghulam Ahmad about the truthfulness of Islam {{and asked for a}} sign to prove that Islam was a living religion. In order to dedicate special prayers for this purpose and so as to seek further divine guidance, Ghulam Ahmad travelled to Hoshiarpur upon what he claimed was divine instruction. Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as chilla-nashini. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> food and leave without speaking to him as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for Jumu'ah (Friday prayers). It is during this period that he declared God had given him the glad tidings of an illustrious son.|$|E
60|$|Sheldon {{looked into}} her clear eyes as she favoured him with a direct, untroubled gaze that threatened, he knew from experience, to turn teasingly defiant on an instant's notice. And {{as he looked at}} her it came to him that he had never half-anticipated the gladness her return <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> to <b>him.</b>|$|R

He is but a child, and no doubt was wrought with by sweet looks, and I trust my Lord will not be hard with him." ...|$|R
25|$|Born on 23 May 1795 in Bridge Street, Westminster (opposite {{the future}} {{site of the}} Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster), he was the fourth son of Walter Edward Barry (died 1805), a stationer, and Frances Barry née Maybank (died 1798). He was baptised at St Margaret's, Westminster, into the Church of England, {{of which he was}} a lifelong member. His father {{remarried}} shortly after Frances died and Barry's stepmother Sarah <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> up. He was educated at private schools in Homerton and then Aspley Guise, before being apprenticed to Middleton & Bailey, Lambeth architects and surveyors, at the age of 15. Barry exhibited drawings at the Royal Academy annually from 1812 to 1815. Upon the death of his father, Barry inherited a sum of money that allowed him, after coming of age, to undertake an extensive Grand Tour around the Mediterranean and Middle East, from 28 June 1817 to August 1820.|$|E
500|$|Elijah Muhammad {{told the}} annual Savior's Day {{convention}} on February26, [...] "MalcolmX got {{just what he}} preached", but denied any involvement with the murder. [...] "We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him", Muhammad said. [...] "We know such ignorant, foolish teachings <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> to his own end." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Johnson {{auditioned for}} {{the roles of}} Lex and Clark, before finally being cast as Whitney Fordman. When the {{producers}} called him in for a third audition, Johnson informed them that if they wanted him then they <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> in for a screen-test. After the screen-test, Johnson was cast and spent only one day filming his scenes for the pilot. The producers, along with Johnson, wanted to portray Whitney as {{more than just the}} [...] "stereotypical jock" [...] that he could have easily become, {{in an effort to make}} sure Lana did not look stupid for going out with him. Whitney was given multiple storylines in season one in an effort to get audiences to view the character in a more pleasant light, but Kristin Kreuk feels that it was all for naught, as the audience only sees him through Clark's eyes.|$|E
60|$|Closer {{and closer}} danced the hideous chief, his yellow, sharp-filed teeth {{showing in the}} firelight between his thick, red lips. Now bending double, now {{stamping}} furiously upon the ground, now leaping into the air, he danced step by step in the narrowing circle that <b>would</b> presently <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> within spear reach of the intended feast.|$|R
50|$|After {{his death}} {{his family and}} {{relatives}} put his body on a high tower, believing that the spirits <b>would</b> descend and <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> back to life. His brother was Manuel Mamikonian.|$|R
5000|$|The {{naming of}} the album was {{influenced}} by this excursion, but also by a telescope which qualified astrophysicist and keyboard player Rob Coombes, <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> with <b>him</b> to the recording studio {{in order to see}} the planets; [...] "...we got fascinated on everything above us and came up with the title," [...] explained Mick Quinn.|$|R
500|$|In {{his last}} years, Bax {{maintained}} a contented retirement {{for much of}} the time. Walton commented, [...] "an important cricket match at Lord's <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, [...] "I ought perhaps to be thinking of an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. [...] He wrote in 1952, [...] "I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said all I have to say and it is of no use to repeat myself." [...] Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.|$|E
500|$|Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity {{deals with}} the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, {{stationed}} on Hawaii {{in the months leading}} up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as [...] "Maggio" [...] in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he [...] "learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is [...] "simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant", commenting that his death scene is [...] "one of the best ever photographed".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, Sacramento County {{improved}} the county road along the levee of the Sacramento River between Sacramento and Rio Vista, which crossed the river twice on free ferries near Paintersville and Isleton. A toll ferry across the San Joaquin River connected Sherman Island, south of Rio Vista, with Antioch, where drivers could head west through the Broadway Tunnel {{to reach the}} San Francisco Bay, but the road between Rio Vista and the ferry was poor. In 1922, the Victory Highway Association selected this [...] "Netherlands Route" [...] (through what was locally promoted as the [...] "Netherlands of America") for the Victory Highway west of Sacramento, as it was both shorter than the Lincoln Highway route via Stockton and more scenic. In particular, the river district would [...] "impress [...] with the enormous productive resources of this state as well as supply him with an unmatched scenic drive", and the Broadway Tunnel approach to the bay <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> [...] "over the Victory Highway {{to the end of}} his journey in such a fashion that he will never forget the view spread before him as he first comes into sight of the San Francisco Bay region".|$|E
60|$|So then, God may reprobate, {{may suffer}} the reprobate to sin, may pre-determine his infallible damnation, through the pre-consideration {{of him in}} sin, and may also forbear to work that effectual work in his soul that <b>would</b> infallibly <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> out of this condition, and yet neither be the author, contriver, nor means of man's sin and misery.|$|R
5000|$|Bolivar {{made sure}} that the untrained Irish lad stayed out of danger. [...] "I have numberless hardships to go through," [...] said Bolivar, [...] "which I <b>would</b> not <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> into, for the {{character}} of his father is well known to me." [...] But ceremonial duties soon bored the restless young Irishman, and after a year at Bolivar's headquarters Morgan left for Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Suffolk {{accepted}} {{a gift from}} the Spanish ambassador negotiating the peace treaty of 1604, but his countess proved a more valuable informant and Catholic sympathiser. Avaricious, she {{accepted a}}n annual pension of £1000 from the Spanish. While Suffolk was less pro-Spanish and pro-Catholic than his wife, she was felt to dominate her husband in matters of politics, a circumstance which <b>would</b> later <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> to grief.|$|R
