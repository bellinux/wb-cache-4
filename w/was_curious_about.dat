2500|$|The study Holy Feast and Holy Fast, my most {{influential}} book, arose almost seamlessly from [...] "Jesus as Mother." [...] Having explored the pressures and opportunities that led certain groups of religious men to use explicitly gendered images {{for themselves and}} for the divine, I <b>was</b> <b>curious</b> <b>about</b> whether religious women did so. And I discovered, again to put it a bit simply, that what seemed distinctive about woman-authored texts and male accounts of women was not awareness of gender or complex and self-conscious use of gendered language, but food images and food practices. Although misunderstood by some critics as [...] "essentializing" [...] (this was a nasty charge in the 1990s) or as a glorification of female masochism, {{it was in fact}} neither. The argument that women’s texts were characterized by specific metaphors and their lives by specific behaviors was not the imposition of modern assumptions about [...] "woman." [...] It was empirical, based on a careful comparison of female-authored texts about the divine, female-authored texts about women, and male-authored texts about women, with texts about men by religious men, such as St. Francis of Assisi or Heinrich Suso, who appeared to be closest in their spirituality to that of women.|$|E
