40|$|Research {{was carried}} out at IT Sligo to {{determine}} travel modes, and views and preferences of commuter stakeholders on sustainable transport provision. Findings were planned to provide inputs into development of a <b>workplace</b> <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> and targeted reduction in car travel to the Institute, due to a planning application and associated transport development control conditions relating to a major Institute building project. It was also considered that existing parking demand was excessive and unsustainable thereby the plan provided an opportunity to influence travel modes positively. Quantitative and qualitative survey methodologies were utilised in the initial stage of the study from November 2012 to February 2013. This included the identification of relevant stakeholder groups, the issuance of on-line questionnaires to determine modal choice and preferences of stakeholders, “live” interviews to gather real time journey characteristics, modal focus groups to determine concerns and attitudes, car parking accumulation surveys and comprehensive technical assessments of the Institute’s transport infrastructure. An analysis of public transport services, usage and facilities was also performed. As part of the Institute’s implementation of a Sustainable <b>Workplace</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>plan</b> under the Smarter Travel Campus programme, monitoring of travel modes and attitudes was instigated during November/December 2014. This included an extended on-line stakeholder survey based on the 2012 / 13 study with additional questions relating to sustainable travel facilities to increase cycling, walking and public transport uptake, and a technical review of transport facilities and services. It was found from the 2012 / 13 on-line (494 respondents/ 343 students) and 2012 live surveys (1346 interviewees) that the dominant travel mode to the Institute was by private car at 80...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a report}} {{published}} by SEA/Renue on behalf of Transport for LondonShortly after becoming Mayor of London in July 2000, Ken Livingstone noted that “the single biggest problem for London and Londoners is the gridlock of our transport system” and that “remedying this will be my first priority”. Although predominantly concerned with the inadequacy of public transport in the capital, the Mayor added that “traffic speeds in central London are now just 10 miles per hour, while congestion costs London business £ 5 billion per year. Residents and commuters alike suffer from delays, stress, discomfort and the overall poor urban environment. ”i To help address these problems,Transport for London (TfL) is encouraging businesses and other organisations to develop workplace travel plans. Developing and implementing a <b>workplace</b> <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> requires resources and expertise, {{so it can be}} easier for businesses located in the same area to get together and form a local travel plan group.

40|$|As {{transport}} {{planning and}} policy diversify from infrastructure development to demand management and Smarter Choices, {{there is also}} a need to diversify the research methods for transport studies. With the development of behaviour change as a fundamental part of the Smarter Choices programme, the use of psychology and behaviour change models has been accepted. It should therefore follow that where transport planning involves businesses, such as <b>workplace</b> <b>travel</b> <b>planning,</b> an approach that involves business studies is also needed. A project using aspects of Roger's Diffusion of Innovations, including the attributes of an innovation and the process of an innovation in an organisation will be used as an example to illustrate this. It shows how a business studies theoretical framework {{can be used as a}} structure to analyse qualitative data from case studies. The aim of the project was to understand how <b>workplace</b> <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> had developed and embedded into an organisation's processes and culture. To understand this requires an appreciation of the culture and structure of an organisation and how the <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> fits within them. To help explain this relationship another aspect of business studies, Mintzberg's Structure in Fives was used. The Mintzberg model describes different types of organisations, such as a professional or machine bureaucracy or a divisionalised form. These forms are then divided into five different parts, which group together the different functions of an organisation and show their interrelationship. This framework was used to help understand the impact of the position of the travel planner on the embedding of a <b>travel</b> <b>plan.</b> This paper will discuss how appropriate the use of business studies methods was for the analysis of the qualitative data for this project.

40|$|After having {{conducted}} {{two studies}} {{of the effectiveness of}} workplace travel plans for promoting active travel, we investigated health and transport practitioners' perspectives on implementing workplace travel plans to share some of the lessons learnt. The objectives of this study were to describe perceived elements of effective workplace travel plans, barriers and enablers to workplace travel planning, their experiences of working with the other profession on travel plan implementation, their recommendations for workplace travel planning, and also to explore similarities and differences in transport and health practitioner perspectives. Fourteen health and ten transport practitioners who had prior involvement in <b>workplace</b> <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> programs were purposefully selected from workplaces in Australia. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews since data saturation had been reached at this point, and data were subject to framework analysis. Perceived essential elements of effective workplace travel plans included parking management; leadership, organisational commitment and governance; skills and other resources like a dedicated travel plan coordinator; and, pre-conditions including supportive transport infrastructure in the surrounds. Recommendations for promoting travel plans included supportive government policy, focusing on business benefits and working at different scales of implementation (e. g. single large worksites and business precincts). Health and transport practitioner perspectives differed, with transport practitioners believing that parking management is the key action for managing travel demand at a worksite. Health practitioners implementing travel plans may require training including concepts of travel demand management, and support from transport planners on parking management strategies. Promoting an understanding of the shared travel behaviour change skills of transport and health practitioners may assist further collaboration. For take-up by organisations to be of sufficient scale to create meaningful population level reductions in driving and increases in active travel, promotion and travel plans should be focused on the priorities of the organisations.

40|$|Increasing {{population}} {{in urban areas}} necessitates increasing levels of mix and modes of transportation, roads, land use, which all lead to pollution and waste of all sorts. Usu- ally longer, wider and larger urban and interurban roads for motorized vehicles lead to further increases in number of cars with fewer, usually single, people in them, forming an unavoidable basis of an unsustainable society and mobility. In order to achieve sus- tainable cities and economies, in addition to smart use of land, intelligent transportation systems, clean and green vehicles, {{it is vital to}} achieve social behavioral change for shift- ing our modes of mobility from motorized means to cleaner, greener, healthier and more economic means such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. Economic, environ- mental, and social concerns about growth of traﬃc and congestion have caused several mega cities in the world and academics towards the investigations and introduction of diﬀerent policies and measures in urban areas. Among many policy options, Travel De- mand Management (TDM) policies mainly aim to promote the sustainable modes and to increase an eﬀective use of existing infrastructure by voluntarily controlling the de- mand. With such circumstances, the objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to review existing academic, industrial, governmental and non-governmental literature to examine and understand various sustainable society, sustainable development, sustainable mobil- ity concepts, mechanisms and policies developed and tested {{in other parts of the}} world; (2) to establish a framework of social behavioral change policies particularly developed and tested for urban mobility and traﬃc; (3) to compare various mega-cities on diﬀerent indicators to better understand the case of Istanbul; (4) to evaluate potentials of TDM policies in Istanbul as well as to ﬁnd out traﬃc congestion perception of the residents by conducting face-to-face surveys; (5) to determine current conditions of traﬃc congestion in Istanbul for the projections of traﬃc conditions in the coming years of 2018 and 2023, with the help of determined potentials from the survey results under diﬀerent scenarios by using a micro simulation program PTV VISSIM. As a result of this study, it was revealed that the traﬃc conditions in Istanbul tend to become worse year by year, but it was also seen that the TDM policies oﬀers noteworthy potential for increased use of sustainable mobility modes and to help signiﬁcantly reducing congestion levels.

More active promotion of the (mobility-) benefits of teleworking to employers and their staff or more flexible working hours may also constitute efficient means in reducing emissions associated with work-related mobility. Emissions could also be reduced by the provision of mobility trainings 17 for sustainable modes of travel from kindergarten upwards to retired citizens, including also trainings for people with reduced mobility.|$|R
40|$|<b>Workplace</b> <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> {{began in}} the UK in the early 1990 s. With over ten years of {{experience}} in <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> in the UK, this thesis demonstrates how they have developed, matured {{and the extent to which}} they have become embedded into the organisations working practices as a business management tool. This work is distinct from previous research, as it concentrates on the business perspective of <b>travel</b> <b>plans,</b> through a series of in depth interviews within organisations. These interviews were analysed using innovation and business models, such as elements of Rogers' (2003) Diffusion of Innovations and Mintzberg's (1983) Structure in Fives, Designing Effective Organisations, to explore the impact of the characteristics and structure of an organisation on the embedding of a <b>travel</b> <b>plan.</b> This thesis identified factors that have helped to organisationally embed <b>travel</b> <b>plans.</b> A key finding was to show that the motivations for a <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> change as it matures, from those of external regulation through the planning process, to internal goals such as corporate responsibility and the environment, business growth and human resources issues. This research has shown the importance of linking <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> to these organisational goals in the embedding process. However, successful embedding is not easy. A <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> can either remain siloed within an estates function or become so widely dispersed that the benefits are poorly visible. In either case the <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> runs the risk of being marginalised or lost. The research has also shown that this process of embedding is reliant on the adaptation of the <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> to match the culture and working practices within an organisation, and that this process of adaptation can be dependent on the position of the travel planner within a strategic area of the organisation. It is concluded that <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> policy is too focussed on the early stages of adoption and not enough on growing and maturing <b>travel</b> <b>plans,</b> with the result that they are too narrow, and unlikely to yield the business benefits that will secure their long term future.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of ICE, Urban Design and Planning [© Thomas Telford] and is also available at: [URL] residential car-free development projects generally take the form of larger car-free ‘districts’ that provide both lifestyle and mobility incentives to residents, including green space, a safer play environment for children, car clubs and improved public transport provision. In contrast, most car-free housing in the UK thus far has taken the form of small-scale infi ll developments that rely on existing public transport infrastructure and local amenities. This paper reviews the progress of car-free housing in Europe and the UK. The shortcomings of current forms of UK car-free housing are discussed and a methodology is presented for furthering car-free development through community <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> (CTPs), which are emerging as a progression of <b>workplace</b> <b>travel</b> <b>plans.</b> The paper suggests that the current UK ‘do minimum’ approach offers relatively little incentive to potential residents and is not an effective means of promoting the concept of car-free living. Furthermore, the lack of an integrated approach towards delivering mobility measures is a barrier to developing more extensive car-free neighbourhoods that would be more attractive to residents wishing to reduce their car use. The paper suggests {{that there is a need}} to adopt a European model for car-free housing, through the incorporation of area-wide CTPs.

40|$|Research {{into the}} use and {{behavioural}} effects of travel information has concentrated on top-down information from transport providers, but {{little is known about}} the role of informal information, shared through word-of-mouth, in everyday travel behaviour. Through our social interactions about travel we may exert not only an informational influence on one another (building our knowledge of other people‟s experiences into our active travel choices), but also a more subtle normative influence: conveying information about norms of behaviour within a particular social milieu. Drawing on theories of normative and informational social influence and self-categorisation, this paper explores some of the social processes occurring when a small group of commuter cyclists interacted with one another through a specially designed, map-based website over six weeks, sharing their routes and other cycling-related information. A mixed-method approach was adopted, comprising observation of website interactions, participant questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Although the main narrative on the website and in participants‟ subsequent reflections concerned the practical use of the information posted, a key finding was the role which the case-study system also played in building, or reinforcing a sense of “community” (group identification). Different, but overlapping aspects of this concept were detected: belonging to a community of cyclists generally, an emerging community of cyclists within the project, or a work-based community in which participants identified with one another as fellow workers rather than “cyclists”. Community-building was found to be associated with high levels of trust amongst group members. Thus it was found that the process of sharing information could perform not only a functional role in diffusing practical travel information, but also a social one whereby perceived in-group membership reinforced positive views of cycling as a commuter mode. Both roles were thought to offer particular encouragement to those who were new to cycling or new to a particular workplace, suggesting that web-based information-sharing might be developed as a useful tool within contexts such as <b>workplace</b> <b>travel</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

40|$|Continued {{demand for}} new housing {{development}} {{is expected to}} add further pressure to existing transport networks and services in many urbanised areas. Given these challenges and a limited ability to add more capacity to the transport network, {{it is appropriate to}} consider the role of demand-side strategies, such as <b>travel</b> <b>plans.</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>plans</b> aim to manage car use among building occupants by providing a package of site-specific initiatives and facilities that support access by more sustainable forms of transport. They can be required through the land use planning and approvals process for new and expanded buildings, such as offices, schools and residential developments. However, there is a limited understanding of the effectiveness of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> when applied to new residential developments. Furthermore, the implementation of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> at new residential developments has not been sufficiently explored. This thesis aims to assess the effectiveness of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> for new residential developments and identify opportunities to enhance their effectiveness. A mixed methods approach comprising five key research components is adopted to achieve this aim, including the application and integration of both implementation theory and planning enforcement theory. The first component involves a survey of councils to examine the scale of <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> practice for new urban developments in Victoria, Australia. Results show that half of the councils had previously required a <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> for a new development, primarily to offset the impact of less car parking being provided. Around 100 <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be required during 2010 - 12 alone, yet 80 % of councils had not monitored any of those <b>travel</b> <b>plans.</b> The second component develops an appreciation for the perspectives of industry actors involved in <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> for new residential developments through a set of interviews. This shows general support for <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> at new residential developments, but limited confidence in the ability to implement them successfully. Implementation challenges were found to centre on a lack of enforcement, uncertainty regarding implementation responsibilities, and a general of lack of ownership of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> when applied to residential settings. The third component provides an assessment of the quality of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> prepared for new residential developments against a best practice framework. This shows considerable scope to improve <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> quality, particularly in estimating expected travel patterns of future building occupants, specifying how the <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> will be managed and implemented, and outlining clearer processes for monitoring and review. The fourth component provides an assessment of the effectiveness of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> at new residential developments. A set of multi-modal trip counts reveal that car use at new residential developments with <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> was 14 percentage points lower than matched control sites. In addition, it provides some preliminary evidence of residents ‘self-selecting’ into developments with <b>travel</b> <b>plans,</b> with this accounting for a relatively small yet non-trivial proportion of observed differences in travel behaviour. The fifth and final component views the research findings through the lens of both implementation theory and planning enforcement theory to identify opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> for new residential developments. Short-term enhancements include greater ownership and engagement of ‘implementers’, improvements to <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> quality, provision of guidance material and training, and a more pro-active and facilitative style of enforcement. Long-term enhancements include sound planning requirements, a stronger industry focus for residential <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> and ensuring an adequate number of technically competent staff are available for enforcement. An integrated theory of implementation and enforcement, with consideration to both top-down and bottom-up styles of implementation, and both facilitative and systematic styles of enforcement, is developed to guide future <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> practice. This thesis provides a number of original contributions to knowledge in the field of <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> for new residential developments. Overall, it is concluded that while <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> can be effective in reducing car use at new residential developments, a number of opportunities can be realised to enhance their effectiveness. Acting on these opportunities will require sufficient resources and commitment. However, this will ultimately improve the way in which <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> are developed, implemented and monitored at new residential development into the future, thereby supporting a greater uptake of more sustainable forms of transport...|$|R

40|$|A <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> is a {{mechanism}} for delivering a package of transport measures at a site to manage car use and {{encourage the use of}} more sustainable forms of transport. In recent years, <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> have been required for new infill and greenfield developments through the land-use planning and approvals process, predominantly in the United Kingdom, the United States, continental Europe and Australia. This paper contributes to the literature by providing a global review of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> for new developments. The results show that while <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> for new developments share a common set of elements with those for pre-existing sites, differences within each element are notable, particularly in the types of <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> measures adopted, processes for managing the <b>travel</b> <b>plan,</b> and approaches to monitoring and review. Results of previous evaluations have varied considerably, although most have reported a reduction in car driver trips of 10 – 20 percentage points. Despite this, most evaluations lack rigour, with a paucity of robust evidence. Key success factors identified by the literature, such as the provision of an explicit policy supporting the role of <b>travel</b> <b>plans,</b> should be embedded within the <b>travel</b> <b>planning</b> process where possible to ensure best outcomes for new developments...|$|R

40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the 12 th WCTR, July 11 - 15, 2010 – Lisbon, Portugal. The current reliance on private vehicles is a major contributing factor to congestion, environmental degradation and energy use. A number of measures, most notably fuel taxes, parking policy, traffic management schemes and more recently road user charging have been implemented in a number of cities as a means of addressing the situation. At the same time ‘softer’ options, such as <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> have been applied in an increasing number of cases, in a bid to resolve the issues caused by accessing workplaces, schools and other trip generators by the private car. A <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> comprises a package of measures tailored to the needs of individual organisations and aimed at promoting greener, cleaner travel choices and reducing reliance on the car. Unlike the traditional approach to counteract transport problems of providing more capacity, <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> can be relatively quick, inexpensive, effective and a more acceptable option. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the current situation and future direction with respect to <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> within a European context. In order to assess the situation in-depth face-to-face and telephone interviews were undertaken with 20 <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> experts from Europe and the USA. Interviewees were selected based on a careful study of the literature and the authors’ detailed knowledge of transport policy and <b>travel</b> <b>plans.</b> Interviewees highlight the need for an action-based approach to ensure that <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> have an impact, with communication being key to success. They emphasise the need for standardised monitoring and evaluation to assess the cost saving ability of <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> adoption to organisations, and carbon reduction potential. For the future there is agreement that there will be a growing demand for mobility management measures and the implementation of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> and <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> networks are expected to play an increasing role. For this to occur it is argued that there needs to be greater support from Government, local authorities and within organisations, so as to provide continuity in funding and targeted provision...|$|R

The take-up of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> is {{increasing}} across the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, yet {{their impact on}} reducing car use is relatively low. Previous studies have investigated the determinants of generic <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> but lacked {{an appreciation of the}} unique context of healthcare settings. This study investigated NHS <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> co-ordinators' views on hospital <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> to identify the factors affecting the success of <b>travel</b> <b>plans</b> in changing <b>travel</b> mode choice behaviour. A nationwide survey was conducted among NHS <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> co-ordinators in England, with a response rate of 51 % (n = 47). Findings suggest that despite having the potential for promoting walking as a key travel option among the hospital staff, measures to promote walking were reported as the least effective. Spearman correlation tests show that the effectiveness of measures to promote walking and reduce car use was positively associated with each other - highlighting the significance of designing effective travel measures to promote walking to attain the overall success in changing travel mode choice behaviour. Shift working patterns, personal circumstances, high car use, and staff attitude towards car use were reported as the key barriers to change travel mode choice behaviour among the NHS hospital staff. The use of robust methods, and evidence-base to develop, and monitor <b>travel</b> <b>plan</b> measures were found to be the key determinants of the success of <b>travel</b> <b>plans.</b> The provision of off-site car parks around 10 - 15. min walking distance away from the hospital site will not only encourage the car users to walk but also provide a realistic solution to the transport issues experienced by the hospitals.
