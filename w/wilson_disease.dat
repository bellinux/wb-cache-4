40|$|AbstractThe {{pathogenesis}} {{of human}} Menkes and <b>Wilson</b> <b>diseases</b> depends on alterations in copper transport. Some reports suggest that intracellular traffic of copper might be regulated by kinase-mediated phosphorylation. However, {{there is no}} evidence showing the influence of kinase-related processes in coupled ATP hydrolysis/copper transport cycles. Here, we show that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulates Ccc 2 p, the yeast Cu(I) -ATPase, with PKA-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved serine (Ser 258) being crucial for catalysis. Long-range intramolecular communication between Ser 258 and Asp 627 (at the catalytic site) modulates the key pumping event: the conversion of the high-energy to the low-energy phosphorylated intermediate associated with copper release...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B are P-type ATPases {{required}} for copper homeostasis {{and involved in}} the etiology of Menkes and <b>Wilson</b> <b>diseases.</b> We used heterologous expression of ATP 7 A or ATP 7 B in COS- 1 cells infected with adenovirus vectors to characterize differential features pertinent to each protein expressed in the same mammalian cell type, rather than to extrinsic factors related to different cells sustaining expression. Electrophoretic analysis of the expressed protein, before and after purification, prior or subsequent to treatment with endoglycosidase, and evidenced by protein or glycoprotein staining as well as Western blotting, indicates that the ATP 7 A protein is glycosylated while ATP 7 B is not. This {{is consistent with the}} prevalence of glycosylation motifs in the ATP 7 A sequence, and not in ATP 7 B. ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B undergo copper-dependent phosphorylation by utilization of ATP, forming equal levels of an “alkali labile” phosphoenzyme intermediate that undergoes similar catalytic (P-type ATPase) turnover in both enzymes. In addition, incubation with ATP yields an “alkali stable ” phosphoprotein fraction, attributed to phosphorylation of serines. Alkali stable phosphorylation occurs at lower levels in ATP 7 A, consistent with a different distribution of serines in the amino acid sequence. Immunostaining of COS- 1 cells sustaining heterologous expression shows initial association of both ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B with Golgi and the trans-Golgi network.
