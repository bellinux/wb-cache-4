5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or <b>wooden</b> <b>boarding</b> are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E
25|$|The main {{applications}} for methanol are {{the production of}} formaldehyde (used in construction and <b>wooden</b> <b>boarding),</b> acetic acid (basis for a.o. PET-bottles), MTBE (fuel component and replacement for the very volatile diethyl ether) and more recently {{for the formation of}} methyl esters in the production of bio-diesel. In China, demand is expected to grow exponentially, not only caused by a growing internal market of the traditional applications, but accelerated by new applications, such as direct blending (with gasoline), Methanol-To-Olefins (e.g. propylene) and DME. Methanol {{can also be used to}} produce gasoline.|$|E
25|$|From November 1886 to 1890, he was Director of Naval Ordnance, {{responsible}} for weapons and munitions.

The Navy did not have responsibility for manufacture and supply of weapons and ammunition, which was {{in the hands of the}} War Office. Fisher began a long campaign to return this responsibility to the Admiralty, but did not finally succeed until he later became First Sea Lord. He was appointed Aide-de-Camp to the Queen in 1887, and promoted Rear-Admiral in August 1890.|$|E

25|$|The Nelson A. Holmes {{farmhouse}} {{sits on a}} low open hill near other farm buildings, {{including a}} wellshed, chicken coop, and summer kitchen. The farmhouse is a -story, timber-framed house with clapboard siding on a fieldstone foundation. It was constructed in 1890 around an 1884 log cabin. The flank-gable roof is covered with asphalt shingles, and a hipped roof front porch covers {{the front of the}} house. The windows are still the original double-hung, two-over-two or six-over-six panes, with dentil molding in each lintel. The summer kitchen and the chicken coop are both constructed of dovetailed logs with <b>wooden</b> <b>boarding</b> at the gable ends. The wellshed features a jerkinhead roof with exposed rafters, and is covered with narrow horizontal boards.|$|E

50|$|Modern rural houses {{differ from}} simple rural houses above {{all in the}} wall {{cladding}} and roof covering. Wood is still used for the main structure, the only difference being that the piles stand on individual prefabricated concrete foundations. Instead of the original homemade palm matting, <b>wooden</b> <b>boarding</b> is used for wall cladding. Windows and doors remain as structural openings, but sometimes they are equipped with shutters. Clay tiles or corrugated tin roofing replace the conventional roof covering that simply provided protection against the sun. Tiles are not homemade {{and have to be}} purchased.The use of modern building materials and the consequent alteration in the basic structure of the building increases the need for ventilation.|$|E

Miikse cemetery is situated behind the church. A monument to the fallen in the Second World War is also located in the cemetery. The church is situated by Miikse stream at an intersection of roads. 80 metres southwest from the church, by the Miikse stream is Miikse jaanikivi (St. John's rock), a historical sacrificial stone. Once, Miikse tsässon was also situated by the sacrificial stone. 500 metres south from Miikse church is Miikse village square, where people celebrate old Midsummer Day as the most important holiday.|$|E
50|$|The London was a twin-engined triplane {{with equal}} span, two-bay wings, {{powered by the}} new ABC Dragonfly radial engine. It was {{designed}} for ease of production, and was built of wood with use of metal fittings minimised. The angular fuselage was covered by ¼ inch (6 mm) thick <b>wooden</b> <b>boarding</b> joined by Tongue and groove joints, techniques more usually found in furniture manufacture. The fabric covered wings were unstaggered and had ailerons fitted to each wing, while the tail unit had a prominent ventral fin similar to that fitted to Folland's S.E.5 and Nighthawk fighters. Bombload was 2,250 lb (1,023 kg), while as the London was solely intended to operate by night, defensive armament was limited {{to a pair of}} Lewis guns in the nose.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} of the school building consists of one large room and an enclosed annex at the back, originally intended for hand basins and hats and coats. The main area of the school is a large hall with high coved ceilings. The walls are sheeted internally by <b>wooden</b> <b>boarding</b> that sits horizontally; the boarding on the ceilings follows {{the curve of the}} coved ceilings. The interior is illuminated by two sets of large, timber framed casement windows with extra top lights. The set on the west of the room are built high to sit above the blackboard. The set on the east of the room are the same size but sit lower on the parallel wall. The students were originally seated facing the west wall, where the blackboard is still situated. The set of windows on the south of the building have exterior timber and iron window hoods.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the existing building has high coved ceilings in the front two rooms. The walls and ceilings are sheeted internally by vertical <b>wooden</b> <b>boarding.</b> The boarding on the walls sits vertically; the boarding on the ceilings follows {{the curve of the}} coved ceilings. The divide between the front and middle room has been extended to provide two large rectangular arches, lined with pine wood, placed there for the ease of movement around the library. The present library utilises all the rooms, with large bookshelves and a librarian's desk. The rear room, the [...] "kitchen", has a wooden partition built from the rear wall to the next wall {{in the direction of the}} front of the building, the ceiling boards slope at the corners to create an arched appearance. The west side of this partition once held the stove, and this is apparent due to the large panel of fibrolite placed over the stove culvert. On either side of this culvert are two small windows. Fibrolite panels have been used on the east wall of the rear room in contrast to the other three wooden board walls.|$|E
