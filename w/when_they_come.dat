5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E

Gabrielle, afraid of him, gives him her money and lies to the agents about his location <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to see her. In actuality, Eladio {{has returned to the}} camp where Maria died, where Lozano tries to spur Soledad on in killing his brother. Soledad finds he can't do it, and Lozano struggles with him, being accidentally killed when the gun goes off. Soledad becomes a carrier of the fungal growth himself and flees with Eladio towards Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius funalis {{mushrooms}} leave a white spore print. The individual basidiospores are ellipsoidal, {{and measure}} 6.5 to 8 by 4 to 5micrometres (μm). They have thin cell walls, {{and they are}} smooth and colourless. The spores are inamyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} stain <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on club-shaped basidia measuring 20 to 25 by 4.5 to 7μm, with two spores per basidium. There are also club-shaped basidioles (under-developed basidia).|$|E
5|$|The three episodes {{were tied}} {{together}} by {{the story of a}} murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson, played by Jones. Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate the Wilson family out of respect for their success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore, which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within the police department. The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on racism and classism, even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from the best of intentions.|$|E

When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. They get the C4 but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> out they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|The Alexander Stadium in Perry Barr is the {{headquarters}} of UK Athletics, and {{one of only two}} British venues to host fixtures in the elite international IAAF Diamond League. It is also the home of Birchfield Harriers, which has many international athletes among its members. The National Indoor Arena hosted the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships and 2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships, as well as hosting the annual Aviva Indoor Grand Prix – the only British indoor athletics fixture to qualify as an IAAF Indoor Permit Meeting – and a wide variety of other sporting events. The venue will host the World Indoor Athletics Championships for a second time, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to Birmingham in 2018.|$|E
5|$|The {{edge of the}} gill is sterile, {{made up of a}} mass of cystidia (cheilocystidia). The {{club-shaped}} cheilocystidia measure from 10 to 25 by 7 to 12μm, {{and sport}} multiple cylindrical appendages on their tips, measuring 1 to 7 by 1 to 1.5μm. The cheilocystidia are colourless, with cell walls of variable thickness, and are inamyloid. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of the}} gills). The caulocystidia (cystidia in the stem) measure 60 to 200 by 4 to 7µm. They are cylindrical and erect, forming the visible bristles. The tip is either pointed or rounded, and the cell walls are smooth and colourless, up to 2µm thick. They are dextrinoid, meaning they stain a reddish-brown <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution.|$|E

5|$|Both species {{usually are}} solitary foragers, {{although}} the northern giant mouse lemur {{tends to be}} the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> into contact, and according to radio-tracking and direct observations at Analabe near Kirindy, they form pair bonds, sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season. However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other agonistic behavior, and only rarely social grooming. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic hyphae are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from the north or northwest {{as a result of}} a trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E
5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower scape and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the bracts of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> in contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in aseptic tissue culture, proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs to be proven that they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some competitive advantage.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
