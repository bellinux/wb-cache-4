5|$|After {{just over}} a year in office, Cook was forced to call a new election, the first double dissolution. Labor won back its {{majority}} in the House, and Fisher returned for a third term as prime minister. He struggled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> Australia's participation in World War I, and in October 1915 resigned in favour of Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66. In total, Fisher served as prime minister for just under five years; Bob Hawke is {{the only member of the}} Labor Party to have served for longer.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{presents}} a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments to cope <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> Paris–Roubaix {{have included the}} use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed {{to cope with the}} demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.|$|E
5|$|Season two {{begins with}} Coach Taylor {{living and working}} in Austin as an {{assistant}} coach at fictional TMU, while wife Tami remains in Dillon with daughter Julie and newborn baby Gracie. Tami is struggling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> the new baby and Julie's rebellious behavior. The Panthers' new coach, Bill McGregor, creates friction between Smash and Matt by showing blatant favoritism to Smash, drives Tim so hard he passes out during practice from dehydration and is hospitalized, alienates assistant coach Jason Street by his condescending manner, and alienates Boosters president Buddy Garrity by barring him from team practices. When Smash and Matt actually come to blows on the field and a crucial game is won by Smash, Buddy engineers the firing of the new coach and persuades Taylor that both the team and his family are suffering in his absence. Taylor agrees to return.|$|E

5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{school was}} re-established in 1946 as No.1 FTS at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, and {{transferred}} to Point Cook the following year. Under a restructure of flying training to cope <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, No.1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS); it moved to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, in 1958. For much of this period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers. Its pilot trainees included Army, Navy, and foreign {{students as well as}} Air Force personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS), which transferred to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No.1 AFTS was re-formed as No.2 Flying Training School and No.1 BFTS was re-formed as No.1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No.1 FTS in 1993.|$|E

40|$|Scarf’s min-max order {{formula for}} the distribution-free risk-neutral newsvendor {{problem is a}} {{classical}} result {{in the field of}} inventory management. The min-max order formula provides, in closed-form, the order quantity that maximizes the worst-case expected profit associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> a single product when only the mean and variance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product’s <b>demand</b> distribution, rather than the full distribution itself, is assumed to be known. It has been a long-standing question whether a similar closed-form order formula exists for the distribution-free risk-reward newsvendor problem; that is, for the order quantity that maximizes the worst-case risk-reward associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> a single product when only the mean and variance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product’s <b>demand</b> distribution is assumed to be known. The main contribution of this work is to extend Scarf’s closed-form order formula {{to one of the most}} important risk-reward criteria, namely when the reward is defined by the expected profit, and the risk by the profit’s standard deviation. Furthermore, we provide managerial insights associated with this result. Key words: Distribution-free, newsvendor, risk-averse, mean-standard deviation, closed-form, min-max rule 1...|$|R
