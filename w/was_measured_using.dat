The radioactive cloud from Buffalo 1 (One Tree) reached {{a height of}} , exceeding the predicted , and radioactivity was detected in South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland. All four Buffalo tests were criticised by the 1985 McClelland Royal Commission, which concluded that they were fired under inappropriate conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{the first}} {{ionization}} energy of lawrencium <b>was</b> <b>measured,</b> <b>using</b> the isotope 256Lr. The measured value, , agreed {{very well with}} the relativistic theoretical prediction of 4.963(15)eV, and also provided a first step into measuring the first ionization energies of the transactinides. This value is the lowest among all the lanthanides and actinides, and supports the s2p configuration as the 7p1/2 electron {{is expected to be}} only weakly bound. This suggests that lutetium and lawrencium behave similarly to the d-block elements (and hence being the true heavier congeners of scandium and yttrium, instead of lanthanum and actinium), and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to the alkali metals sodium and potassium in some ways. Given that the s2p configuration is correct, then lawrencium cannot be regarded as a transition metal under the IUPAC definition ("An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell"), unlike its lighter homolog lutetium and the group 3 elements, with which lutetium and lawrencium are sometimes classified. It is nevertheless quite likely that metallic lawrencium will behave similarly to curium, which has an 5f76d17s2 configuration, and show the expected 5f146d17s2 configuration, which is supported by the earlier volatility experiments.|$|E

The Greeks measured the value of objects or fines using certain valuable objects, such as oxen, tripods, and metal spits, as units of account. As in the Near East, precious metal bullion was used as a medium of exchange, principally gold at first, but mainly silver by {{the beginning}} of the sixth century. The weight of this bullion (often known as hacksilber) <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> standard units, named for their value in terms of metal spits (obeloi) and handfuls (drachmai) of metal spits; these terms would later be used as names for Greek coin denominations.|$|E

25|$|Dry bone {{exhibits}} some piezoelectric properties. Studies of Fukada et al. {{showed that}} these are not due to the apatite crystals, which are centrosymmetric, thus non-piezoelectric, but due to collagen. Collagen exhibits the polar uniaxial orientation of molecular dipoles in its structure and can be considered as bioelectret, a sort of dielectric material exhibiting quasipermanent space charge and dipolar charge. Potentials are thought to occur when a number of collagen molecules are stressed in the same way displacing significant numbers of the charge carriers from the inside {{to the surface of the}} specimen. Piezoelectricity of single individual collagen fibrils <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> piezoresponse force microscopy, and it was shown that collagen fibrils behave predominantly as shear piezoelectric materials.|$|E
25|$|A highly publicised {{extension}} to the experiment, {{in which a}} simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife—with the ultimate aim of one day creating a form of telepathy or empathy using the Internet to communicate the signal from afar—was also successful in-so-far as it resulted in the first direct and purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans. Finally, {{the effect of the}} implant on Warwick's hand function <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> the University of Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). It was feared that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference, but no measurable effect nor rejection was found. Indeed, nerve tissue grew around the electrode array, enclosing the sensor.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself precesses around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating dipole sound field. Studies of this whistle have shown that dynamic similarity based on the pipe diameter d as the characteristic length scale, and inlet mean flow speed U as the characteristic speed was not achieved, {{as shown in the}} lower figure on the right. A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound <b>was</b> <b>measured.</b> <b>Using</b> the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E

25|$|In J. R. R.

Time from that point <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> Valian Years, though the subsequent history of Arda was divided into three time periods using different years, known as the Years of the Lamps, the Years of the Trees and the Years of the Sun. A separate, overlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves during the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries of the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the Years of the Sun. Most Middle-earth stories take place in the first three Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar.|$|E
500|$|Surface {{displacement}} {{during the}} earthquake <b>was</b> <b>measured</b> <b>using</b> SAR interferometry. The computed area of uplift is elongated W-E, {{with a maximum}} value of about [...] centered over {{the eastern end of}} the Latif anticline. A smaller area of subsidence was observed to the south of the uplifted area, and the lack of a sharp boundary between the two suggests that the fault does not come to the surface. The pattern of displacement is consistent with a north-dipping fault rupturing between about [...] and [...] in depth, which also provides a good match to the results of seismic modeling using body waves, although a SSE-dipping plane remains possible. This depth range strongly suggests that the fault affected {{the lower part of the}} sedimentary cover, while not ruling out some basement involvement. The mismatch between the orientation of the fault planes that caused the earthquake and the observed surface folds suggests that deformation at these two levels is decoupled by the presence of a detachment, possibly within marl layers.|$|E

Pain decreased by more than 90%, in 9–14% of duloxetine patients vs. 2–4% of placebo patients. Most of the response was achieved {{in the first two}} weeks on the medication.
