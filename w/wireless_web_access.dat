40|$|M. S. thesis {{directed}} by Dr. Ing-Ray Chen A mobile user may voluntarily disconnect {{itself from the}} web server to save battery life and also to avoid the high communication price. To allow web pages to be updated while the mobile user is disconnected from the web server, updates can be staged in the mobile unit and propagated back to the web server upon reconnection. In this thesis, we investigate methods for supporting disconnected write operations and develop a performance model which helps identify the optimal length of the disconnection period under which the cost of update propagation is minimized. We validate the analytic model with simulation in the thesis. We also show how {{the result can be}} applied to real-time web applications with a deadline requirement to propagate updates of web pages. The analysis result is particularly applicable to web applications which allow wireless mobile users to modify web contents while on the go. The algorithms that we have developed can be generally applied to other data items such as files and databases.

While the power limits are directly related to the heating of the mobile device, the energy limit is related to the operating time. As the mobile device is filled with several new features and high data rate wireless access, the stand by time will even decrease, especially if we consider that the wireless communication capabilities of a modern mobile phone could require more than a half of the overall power consumption [4].|$|E
40|$|A compact, low-profile, two-port {{dual-band}} {{circularly polarized}} (CP) antenna for portable RFID readers is presented. The radiating element for the UHF-RFID band (902 - 928 MHz) has been realized through a circular array of four inverted-F meandered monopoles, where the array elements are excited with a 90 ∘ phase offset (sequential rotation feeding technique) through a microstrip feeding network.

The meandered monopoles and the patch are both etched on the same layer of an FR 4 substrate, so getting a significant antenna compactness (60 mm× 60 mm× 7 mm). The patch loading effect on the monopoles can be compensated by adjusting the meandered monopole length. Reflection coefficient, port isolation, axial ratio and radiation patterns are evaluated by numerical simulations and compared with measurements on an antenna prototype...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Our goal is {{to explore}} {{characteristics}} of the environment that provide opportunities for caching, prefetching, coverage planning, and resource reservation. We conduct a onemonth measurement study of locality phenomena among <b>wireless</b> <b>web</b> users and their association patterns on a major university campus using the IEEE 802. 11 wireless infrastructure. We evaluate the performance of different caching paradigms, such as single user cache, cache attached to an access point (AP), and peer-to-peer caching. In several settings such caching mechanisms could be beneficial. Unlike other measurement studies in wired networks in which 25 % to 40 % of documents draw 70 % of <b>web</b> <b>access,</b> our traces indicate that 13 % of unique URLs draws this number of <b>web</b> <b>accesses.</b> In addition, the overall ideal hit ratio of the user cache, cache attached to an access point, and peer-to-peer caching paradigms (where peers are coresident within an AP) are 51 %, 55 %, and 23 %, respectively. We distinguish wireless clients based on their inter-building mobility, their visits to APs, their continuous walks in the wireless infrastructure, and their wireless information access during these periods. We model the associations as a Markov chain using as state information the most recent AP visits. We can predict with high probability (86 %) the next AP with which a wireless client will associate. Also, there are APs with {{a high percentage of}} user revisits. Such measurements can benefit protocols and algorithms that aim to improve the performance of the wireless infrastructures by load balancing, admission control, and resource reservation across APs.

40|$|Mobile {{computing}} {{has attracted}} {{attention in the}} past few years owing to technology advances. However, viewing documents on a mobile device isn’t easy because of the limited display size, CPU power, and bandwidth. This is an obstacle for <b>wireless</b> <b>Web</b> browsing because there is no automatic transformation of HTML 1 documents designed for display on large screens to small PDA screens. The same problem occurs in devices for <b>Web</b> <b>access</b> (or Web-like access) on television. Although televisions are generally larger than most computer monitors, the relatively low resolution and long viewing distance reduces the amount of information they can display. In this article, small displays are devices that display a small amount of information for comfortable user viewing, because either the screens are physically small or they have very low resolution. Small displays increase the burden on Web page authors and application designers because they must consider all possible display capabilities of user devices when creating a Web page.

Considering its great potentials to be applied in business systems, we have devised an innovative model, based on the IWW services, for a typical mobile real-time supply chain coordination system which has been developed and tested in a real operational environment. Our article investigates the proposed system in this way: at the start, {{the building blocks of}} the IWW are discussed in detail.

The vision of intelligent <b>wireless</b> <b>web</b> services, as discussed in this paper, centers on the need to provide mobile supply chain members highly specific data and services in real-time on an as-needed basis, with the flexibility of use for the user.
