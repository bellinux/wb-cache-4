5|$|Spam {{filtering}} imports users' {{address books}} {{to compile a}} <b>whitelist</b> of allowed senders. Addresses to which users send mail and e-mail tagged as valid mail can be automatically added to the <b>whitelist.</b> Using several thousand messages, PC Magazine found that Norton marked over 40 percent of valid e-mail as spam. Over 80 percent of valid newsletters were marked as spam. Norton did correctly identify 90 percent of spam e-mail.|$|E
5|$|Parental {{controls}} {{no longer}} support browsers other than Internet Explorer and Edge, {{and the ability}} to control browsing by a <b>whitelist</b> was removed. Also removed were the ability to control local accounts, {{and the ability to}} scan a machine for applications to allow and block.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a <b>whitelist</b> of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
50|$|Amazon.com uses <b>whitelists</b> {{to limit}} {{access to its}} Kindle {{e-reader}} devices. Besides Amazon itself, only e-mail addresses <b>whitelisted</b> by the device's registered owner can send content ("personal documents") to that device.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, AdBlock Plus and Eyeo {{attracted}} considerable controversy {{from its}} users when it introduced an [...] "Acceptable Ads" [...] platform to [...] "allow certain non-intrusive ads" [...] (such as Google AdWords) {{to be allowed}} (<b>whitelisted)</b> under the extension's default settings. While participation in the <b>whitelisting</b> process is free for small websites, large advertising companies are required to pay a fee. <b>Whitelisting</b> was enabled by default for AdBlock Plus users.|$|R
5000|$|Google, a major {{provider}} of services on the Internet, experiments with using a type of DNS <b>whitelisting</b> on a per-ISP basis to prevent this until the World IPv6 Launch. In the DNS <b>whitelisting</b> approach, ISPs are determined from DNS lookup source IP addresses by correlating them with network prefixes derived from routing tables. There is an IETF draft entitled [...] "IPv6 AAAA DNS <b>Whitelisting</b> Implications" [...] that describes the issues around <b>whitelisting.</b> AAAA records are only sent to ISPs that can demonstrate that they are providing reliable IPv6 to their customers. Other ISPs are sent only A records, thus preventing users from attempting to connect over IPv6.|$|R
5|$|Other {{features}} include Bloodhound technology, which looks for virus-like behavior to better find zero day viruses. The Security Inspector looks for common vulnerabilities, including insecure user account passwords and browser insecurities. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. Parental controls, an optional component, can block certain programs from accessing the Internet, such as IM clients, and restrict newsgroup access. Restrictions {{can be assigned}} to different Windows users accounts. Sites are classified in 31 categories, and the four profiles which can be assigned each block different categories of sites. Supervisors define exceptions, add global blocked sites, or block all access to sites not on a user-created <b>whitelist.</b> Both PC Magazine and PC Pro noted the exclusion of time-based restrictions. Information filtering can be controlled on a per-user basis.|$|E
5|$|Other new {{features}} include Internet Worm Protection to block worms, which scan IP addresses for open ports. It also blocks inbound ports based on known and suspected exploits using signatures and heuristics. The {{addition of the}} feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response to emerging privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal confidential information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a <b>whitelist</b> of sites where confidential information can be transmitted. Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. The Browser Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as the browser and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements.|$|E
25|$|The Domain White List (DWL) was {{released}} in October 2010 and is a <b>whitelist</b> of domain names. The DWL enables automatic certification of domains with DKIM signatures. Only verified legitimate senders with clean reputations are approved for whitelisting and there are strict terms to keeping a <b>whitelist</b> account.|$|E

25|$|The Spamhaus White List (SWL) was {{released}} in October 2010 and is a <b>whitelist</b> of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The SWL is intended to allow mail servers to separate incoming email traffic into 3 categories: Good, Bad and Unknown. Only verified legitimate senders with clean reputations are approved for whitelisting and there are strict terms to keeping a Spamhaus <b>Whitelist</b> account.|$|E
25|$|The program, when installed, prompts {{the user}} to create a <b>whitelist</b> of devices that are allowed to connect to the {{computer}} via its USB ports, which it checks at a default sample rate, a rate which can be adjusted. The user may also choose what actions the computer will take if it detects a USB device not on the <b>whitelist</b> (by default, it shuts down and erases data from the RAM and swap file). Users need to be logged in as root. Hephaest0s cautions users they must be using at least partial disk encryption along with USBKill to fully prevent attackers from gaining access; Gizmodo suggests using a virtual machine {{that will not be}} present when the computer reboots.|$|E
25|$|Internet Explorer uses a zone-based {{security}} {{framework that}} groups sites based on certain conditions, including {{whether it is}} an Internet- or intranet-based site {{as well as a}} user-editable <b>whitelist.</b> Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.|$|E

25|$|The program's developer, {{who goes}} by the online name Hephaest0s, created it in {{response}} to the circumstances of the arrest of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, during which U.S. federal agents were able to get access to incriminating evidence on his laptop without needing his cooperation by copying data from its flash drive after distracting him. It maintains a <b>whitelist</b> of devices allowed to connect to the computer's USB ports; if a device not on that <b>whitelist</b> connects, it can take actions ranging from merely returning to the lock screen to encrypting the hard drive, or even deleting all the data on it. However, it can also be used as part of a computer security regime to prevent the surreptitious installment of malware or spyware or the clandestine duplication of files, according to its creator.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} {{basis for}} these requirements is incompatibility with 32-bit EFI and 32-bit kernel extensions (most importantly, drivers for GPUs shipped in some older Macs). In {{order to prevent}} potentially incompatible systems from installing 10.8, the installer contains a <b>whitelist</b> of supported motherboard IDs. Users have bypassed these limitations so that 10.8 may run with varying functionality on some officially unsupported computers.|$|E
500|$|The Family Edition adds parental {{controls}}. Parental {{controls are}} {{backed by a}} quality control team of 10 searching the web for inappropriate content. Found content is categorized in subject matter and placed on a blacklist of about 36,000 sites. A designed administrator can add blocked sites, however the pre-supplied blacklist cannot be viewed or edited since it is hard coded. Administrators can block certain subject matters. Another option is to block all sites, then create a <b>whitelist</b> of allowed sites. Family Edition can also block transmission of specified personal information. Such information is replaced with the letter [...] "X". However, CNN noted X-rated sites are retrieved when personal information is queried by a search engine.|$|E
50|$|Another use for <b>whitelists</b> {{is local}} area network (LAN) security. Many network admins set up MAC address <b>whitelists,</b> or a MAC address filter, to control who is allowed on their networks. This is used when {{encryption}} is not a practical solution or in tandem with encryption. However, it's sometimes ineffective because a MAC address can be faked.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{concerns}} were {{been raised about}} the practicality of DNS <b>whitelisting</b> as a long-term large-scale solution, such as scalability and maintenance issues relating {{to the maintenance of}} large numbers of bilateral agreements. In 2010, several of the major web service providers met to discuss pooling their DNS <b>whitelisting</b> information in an attempt to avoid these scaling problems.|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : CONTROL SYSTEMS SECURITYInternational audienceThe {{security}} of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks has attracted considerable attention since {{the discovery of}} Stuxnet in 2010. Meanwhile, SCADA networks have become increasingly interconnected both locally and remotely. It is, therefore, necessary to develop effective network intrusion detection capabilities. Whitelist-based intrusion detection has become an attractive approach for SCADA networks. However, when analyzing network traffic in SCADA systems, general properties such as TCP handshaking and common ports are insufficient to create flow <b>whitelists.</b> To address the problem, this chapter proposes a methodology for locality-based creation of flow <b>whitelists</b> and conducts experiments to evaluate its effectiveness in seven SCADA systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the methodology generates effective <b>whitelists</b> for deployment in SCADA networks...|$|R
