It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
25|$|Fujishima was {{responsible}} for designing eight characters including Ogami and Sakura, along with formal and casual clothes, and accessories. The supporting cast was designed by Hidenori Matsubara. Matsubara also helped with general animation. As the character concepts had been firmly established before the design stage, Fujishima was able to create the characters with ease, creating them so players could easily understand <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> their minds. Due to the game's Taishō period setting, Fujishima needed to stop himself from adding anachronistic elements such as fasteners. Hiroi made character sheets for each character, which Fujisaka used to create each character and their various designs, noting Sumire as a character whose personality was communicated through her clothes. Each character had distinct traits, such as a ponytail and hakama kimono for Sakura, so Kujishima simply combined these elements with his own design ideas. The Taishō period meant that Fujishima could combine traditional Japanese clothing with Western accessories such as shoes, allowing the female characters an otherwise improbable range of movement. His design for each main protagonist—from Ogami to the Flower Division members—directly mirrored Hiroi's concepts for them. The Flower Division's battle dress was modeled after tuxedos, and compared by Kujishima with the costumes of the Takarazuka Revue.|$|E

500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E
