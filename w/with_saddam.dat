5|$|Following the {{disbanding}} of the Iraqi Army, insurgent activity increased, {{especially in}} Fallujah. Initially, armed resistance groups could {{be characterized as}} either Sunni nationalists who wanted {{to bring back the}} Ba'ath Party <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E
25|$|During the 1991 First Gulf War, France {{chose to}} {{dispatch}} several Pumas {{in support of}} coalition forces engaged in a conflict <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's Iraq.

50|$|The {{rivalry between}} General Hussein Kamel and Uday spirals out of control, as the heir {{apparent}} pelts the general with food {{at a dinner}} <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> closest allies. The frustrated Hussein Kamel states his disillusionment <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime, which allows the spoiled Uday to run wild with impunity. His patience finally ends when Uday hijacks a shipment of medical supplies intended for Hussein Kamel's brother, Saddam Kamel. The brothers discuss Hussein Kamel's plan to cooperate with Ekeus and the CIA, hoping {{that he will be}} installed as Iraq's new president after Saddam is overthrown.|$|R
50|$|A {{distant cousin}} of Saddam Hussein, {{observers}} regarded Mahmud as being Hussein's right-hand man. He always maintained constant contact with Hussein and {{acted as a}} gatekeeper, controlling access to him. He was trusted <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> son Qusay Hussein, in overseeing the Iraqi Special Security Organization.|$|R
50|$|During {{the rule}} of Saddam Hussein, the al-Nujaifi family largely {{remained}} out of politics, returning to the public scene following his toppling in 2003. They were however accused of harboring sympathies for Saddam's Baath Party, and were indeed involved in horse trades <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> sons Uday and Qusai.|$|R
25|$|An {{agreement}} on intelligence cooperation between Russia and China {{was signed in}} 1992. This secret treaty covers cooperation of the GRU GSh VS RF and the SVR RF with the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Military Intelligence Directorate. In 2003 {{it was reported that}} SVR RF trained Iraqi spies when Russia collaborated <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein. The SVR also has cooperation agreements with the secret police services of certain former Soviet republics, such as Azerbaijan and Belarus.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. doesn't always follow {{international}} law. For example, {{some critics}} assert the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq {{was not a}} proper response to an imminent threat, but an act of aggression which violated international law. For example, Benjamin Ferencz, a chief prosecutor of Nazi war crimes at Nuremberg said George W. Bush should be tried for war crimes along <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein for starting aggressive wars—Saddam for his 1990 attack on Kuwait and Bush for his 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} of Saddam Hussein's rule of Iraq through the Ba'ath Party, Sistani was {{untouched}} during the violent Ba'athist repression and persecution that killed many clerics including Mohammad Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr in 1999, for which Saddam denied any involvement. His predecessor, Khoei, sat down <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> on state TV. After the death of Grand Ayatollah Khoei in 1992, Sistani emerged as the prominent Shia cleric to guide the Shia people under Saddam's rule, although Sistani's mosque was shut down in 1994 and did not reopen until the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|Romanska {{wrote that}} Layal [...] "struggles to {{maintain}} a coherent self-image" [...] because she feels trapped by the conflicting perceptions of herself being a victim, collaborator, and critic of Saddam's government, and that Layal operates on a survival mode because she is so deeply traumatized by what she has experienced. [...] Billington wrote that even though Layal is [...] "apparently compromised by her complicity <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime" [...] she [...] "defends herself vigorously and, through her painting, brings to life {{a wide range of}} oppressed Iraqi women". John Lahr of The New Yorker wrote that [...] "Of the many atrocities that the women report, the most compelling is the spiritual mutation of Layal, whose collaboration <b>with</b> <b>Saddam’s</b> regime leaves her internally empty and morally bankrupt. She is beyond shame or pity." [...] Hirschhorn argues that Layal is the [...] "most fascinating personality" [...] of the play. Romanska also wrote that Layal both subtly criticizes Saddam's government and sympathizes with it at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|Former {{government}} officials, including Khidir Hamza his successor, {{have claimed}} that he was imprisoned for his refusal to cooperate <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> WMD program and his intentions to build nuclear weapons.

[...] "While imprisoned and tortured at Abu Ghraib prison for 11 years under Saddam Hussein he refused {{to help build a}} nuclear weapon for the country." ...|$|R
50|$|Both {{countries}} are major {{oil and gas}} exporters and have clashed over energy policy. Saudi Arabia, with its large oil reserves and smaller population, has a greater interest in taking a long-term view of the global oil market and incentive to moderate prices. In contrast, Iran is compelled to focus on high prices {{in the short term}} due to its low standard of living given recent sanctions after its decade old war <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Iraq.|$|R
25|$|After the Gulf War in 1991, Kuwait {{conducted}} {{a campaign of}} expulsion against the Palestinians living in the country, who before the war had numbered 400,000. Some 200,000 who had fled during the Iraqi occupation were banned from returning, while the remaining 200,000 were pressured into leaving by the authorities, who {{conducted a}} campaign of terror, violence, and economic pressure {{to get them to}} leave. The Palestinians expelled from Kuwait moved to Jordan, where they had citizenship. The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein.|$|E
25|$|During to the Gulf War in 1990–91, Arafat {{supported}} Saddam Hussein's {{invasion of}} Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. The policy which partly {{led to this}} exodus {{was a response to}} the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO which brought the PLO to the brink of crisis.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Staller {{was among}} the founders of another Italian {{political}} movement, called Partito dell'Amore ("Party of Love"), which was spearheaded by friend and fellow porn star Moana Pozzi. In January 2002, she began exploring the possibility of campaigning in Hungary, her country of birth, to represent Budapest's industrial Kőbánya district in the Hungarian parliament. However, she failed to collect enough petition signatures for a non-partisan candidacy. In the same year, she ran in local elections in Monza, Italy, promising to convert a prominent building into a gambling casino, but she attracted few votes. In 2004, she announced plans {{to run for mayor}} of Milan with a similar promise. She renewed her offer to have sex <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein in October 2002, when Iraq was resisting international pressure to allow inspections for weapons of mass destruction, and in April 2006, she made the same offer to Osama bin Laden.|$|E
5000|$|This {{claim was}} reiterated by Jordanian King Abdullah II in an {{interview}} with Al-Hayat. Abdullah revealed that Saddam Hussein had rejected repeated requests from Jordan to hand over al-Zarqawi. According to Abdullah, [...] "We had information that he entered Iraq from a neighboring country, where he lived and what he was doing. We informed the Iraqi authorities about all this detailed information we had, but they didn't respond." [...] Abdullah told the Al-Hayat that Jordan exerted [...] "big efforts" [...] <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> government to extradite al-Zarqawi, but added, [...] "our demands that the former regime hand him over were in vain." ...|$|R

25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Democratic {{leadership}} as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA's passage in 1993. For his work as a back channel to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico's highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milošević. In 1996 he played a major role in securing the release of American Evan Hunziker from North Korean custody and for securing a pardon for Eliadah McCord, an American convicted and imprisoned in Bangladesh. Due to these missions, Richardson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times.|$|E

During his later years, Kennan concluded that [...] "the general effect of Cold War extremism was to delay rather than hasten the great change that overtook the Soviet Union". At age 98 he warned of the unforeseen consequences of waging war against Iraq. He warned that attacking Iraq would amount to waging a second war that [...] "bears no relation to the first war against terrorism" [...] and declared efforts by the Bush administration to associate al Qaeda <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein [...] "pathetically unsupportive and unreliable". Kennan went on to warn: ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1993, {{he became}} one of the 18 cabinet ministers in the {{caretaker}} government that succeeded Nawaz Sharif's first abridged premiership.

After Bhutto's election, he served as her Investment Minister, chief of the intelligence bureau, and the head of the Federal Investigation Agency. In February 1994, Benazir sent Zardari to meet <b>with</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein in Iraq to deliver medicine in exchange for three detained Pakistanis arrested on the ambiguous Kuwait-Iraq border. In April 1994, Zardari denied allegations that he was wielding unregulated influence as a spouse and acting as [...] "de-facto Prime Minister".

She is based on an Iraqi artist, Layla Attar, who died in 1993 after her house was bombed by American missile.|$|R
500|$|Soon {{after his}} resignation, Agnew moved to his summer home at Ocean City. To cover urgent tax and legal bills, and living expenses, he {{borrowed}} $200,000 from his friend Frank Sinatra. He had hoped he could resume {{a career as}} a lawyer, but in 1974, the Maryland courts disbarred him. To earn his living, he founded a business consultancy, Pathlite Inc., which in the following years attracted a widespread international clientele. Describing his business methods, Agnew said: [...] "I have one utility, and that's the ability to penetrate to the top people."

40|$|This work is, essentially, an {{assessment}} of Saddam's regime in Iraq, one of the cruellest and most violent regimes of modern times, and the Ba'th Party policies and ideological principles, recognised by Saddam as the theoretical basis for his practices. These policies and practices have had catastrophic consequences for Iraq, "home of ancient civilisations", jeopardising its sovereignty and future and permitting {{the west and the}} west-sponsored states in the region to gain favourable concessions at the expense of Iraq's interests. This thesis is divided into nine chapters: The first deals with the Ba'th Party, its founding, ideology, set-backs and seizure of power. The second deals with the founding of the Ba'th Party in Iraq, its political development throughout the Monarchy regime, Qasim's regime and the period during which the Ba'thists came to power on 8 February 1963. The third deals <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> early life and his political activities throughout 'rif's regime. The fourth deals with the circumstances in which the Ba'th Party returned to power. The fifth deals with the presidency of Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr and examines Saddam's role {{and the nature of the}} Ba'thist authority during that period. The sixth deals <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> presidency and his assumption of all responsibility for the state and the Party. The seventh and eighth deal with the first and second Gulf wars, the occupation of Kuwait and the results these two destructive wars, embarked upon at the whim of one man, have imposed upon the Iraqi army and people. The ninth comprises a summary of the thesis, in which Saddam's strange and unstable personality will be analysed and a possible solution will be suggested for the future of Iraq - a community different in composition and circumstances from any other countr...|$|R

5000|$|These attacks {{resonated}} with conservative Muslims {{and the problem}} did not go away <b>with</b> <b>Saddam's</b> defeat either, since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed. Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas {{around the world and}} even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced. [...] One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in Egypt, a bloody civil war in Algeria and Osama bin Laden's terror attacks climaxing in the 9/11 attack.|$|R
