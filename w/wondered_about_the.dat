5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> masque in Act 4, which some think was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates more problems than it solves.|$|E

Cagney was still struggling against his gangster typecasting. He said to a journalist, [...] "It's what the people want me to do. Some day, though, I'd like to make another movie that kids could go and see." [...] However, Warner Bros., perhaps searching for another Yankee Doodle Dandy, assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture, 1950's The West Point Story with Doris Day, an actress he admired.|$|E

Chaney and Slezak both <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> extra girls in the number, but Lynch simply said, [...] "Nice {{to get a little}} Troubletones action separate from (but still part of) the New Directions".

500|$|After {{waiting for}} Darwin, the Beagle sailed on 11 November {{to survey the}} Chonos Archipelago. From here they saw the {{eruption}} of the volcano Osorno in the Andes. They sailed north, and Darwin <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fossils he had found. The giant Mastodons and Megatheriums were extinct, but he had found no geological signs of a [...] "diluvial debacle" [...] or of the changed circumstances that, in Lyell's view, led to species no longer being adapted to the position they were created to fit. He agreed with Lyell's idea of [...] "the gradual birth & death of species" [...] but, unlike Lyell, Darwin was willing to believe Giovanni Battista Brocchi's idea that extinct species had somehow aged and died out.|$|E

500|$|Also {{writing for}} Mania Entertainment, Kim Wolstenholme {{was worried about}} how much Kira's and Athrun's {{relationship}} would be focused in Gundam SEED, but liked that Lacus Clyne's introduction added tension to it. Ever Cheung from Animefringe who <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future of Kira and Lacus because the two are about to embrace in the anime's opening sequence. He said, [...] "If that's real, this story may be more interesting than I thought..." [...] Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network enjoyed Kira's and Athrun's rivalry which resulted in well-done fight scenes from each of their mobile suits. Liversidge praised the development from such rivalry as the two started hating each other and their battle. DVDTalk writer Don Houston considered Kira {{to be similar to}} other anime protagonists because he fights for peace and not glory, labeling him the [...] "reluctant hero".|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was listed}} on The New York Times Best Seller list, the book {{received}} poor reviews {{from the popular}} press, although better reviews from Hemingway scholars. In a pre-publication review for The New York Times, Ralph Blumenthal said that True at First Light was {{not as good as}} Hemingway's earlier autobiographical fiction, and he questioned whether Hemingway would have wanted his [...] "reputation and last printed words entrusted solely to any editor, even a son". Blumenthal <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> autobiographical aspects of the work: the relationship between Hemingway and Debba; the background of the Look magazine photoshoot; the safari itself; and the subsequent plane accidents. In the 1999 The New York Times review, James Wood claimed Hemingway knew True at First Light was not a novel though the editors billed it as one. He believes Hemingway's later work became a parody of the earlier work. [...] True at First Light represents the worst of Hemingway's work according to a review in The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|By 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} by Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ants on Trial; Carson characterized it as [...] "flagrant propaganda" [...] that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially dieldrin and heptachlor) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington Post, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations—in her words, the [...] "silencing of birds"—to pesticide overuse. That was also {{the year of the}} [...] "Great Cranberry Scandal": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying.

500|$|Madonna: Like an Icon was {{released}} on 27 August 2007, in the United Kingdom by Bantam Press. The book cover was designed by Holly MacDonald, with an image of Madonna from 2002, during the premiere of her film, Swept Away. It {{was released}} {{more than a year}} later in the United States. The biography faced mixed reviews from critics. Sarah Churchwell from The Guardian criticized O'Brien's extended commentary about Madonna's recording process. She believed that more emphasis should have been given on Madonna's personal life as well. Pointing out examples like Madonna's relationship with actor Warren Beatty, which was widely covered in the media but was only lightly touched in the book, Churchwell <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> claim of the book in its press release: [...] "This is the closest you will ever come to Madonna's autobiography". The reviewer concluded by saying, [...] "Since her voice is nowhere in evidence, this book, however capable and intelligent its writer, is probably about the farthest you will ever get from Madonna's autobiography." ...|$|E

[...] Scholars have developed a few possibilities for the identity of Mr. W.H., such as William Herbert and Henry Wriothesley. Critics have also <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> woman who came between Shakespeare and the boy: [...] "And of course there is the dark lady, identified alternatively as a nameless aristocrat, a commoner, Queen Elizabeth, her maid of honor Mary Fitton, the London prostitute Lucy Negro, the poet Aemilia Lanyer, and so on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, {{two games}} were released: Theme Aquarium, and Populous: The Beginning. Theme Aquarium {{was an attempt}} to [...] "cross barriers" [...] between the United Kingdom and Japan.

A small group was set up to do this. Theme Aquarium was released as a Theme game in Japan only; western releases removed the Bullfrog branding. As of 2012, many ex-Bullfrog employees were not familiar with the game. Shortly before Molyneux left, Bullfrog announced that the games then in development may be the final ones released for MS-DOS. It was [...] "quite likely" [...] that all future games would be Windows-only. The reason for the change in platform focus was so Bullfrog could create games with Windows in mind, and to use [...] "powerful features" [...] (such as 3D acceleration) which were difficult to use with DOS.|$|E

[...] The letter shows Emma's tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas.

The Gospel of John says [...] "Love one another" [...] (13:34), then describes Jesus as the Word Incarnate saying [...] "I am the way, the truth and the life: no man comes to the Father, except through me." [...] (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues [...] "Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"(15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could [...] "hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished.

2500|$|The {{character}} has also received comments by publications for manga, anime and other media. When Gundam SEED was {{during its first}} episodes in Japan, Ever Cheung from Animefringe <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future regarding Lacus and Kira as he noticed the two about to embrace in the anime's opening theme. He commented if his doubts may be right, he would find the story more interesting that he thought. Kim Wolstenholme from Mania Entertainment liked Lacus's introduction to the series as it added tension to it the friendship between Kira and Athrun. Kim noted that while Lacus and Athrun were engaged, he wondered how Lacus and Kira started relating in the series. Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network stated he did not expect Lacus's faction entrance {{to the war in}} the last episodes from Gundam SEED as it emphasized the disasters happening within the series. Wolstenholme liked how Lacus started to take place in the war as it contrasted her actions in the series' first episodes, while also delivering surprising revelations. Moreover, Chris Beverdige, also writing for Mania, found Lacus' development throughout these episodes interesting {{and at the same time}} comical due to the design of her ship and how it is decorated by the Haros she possesses. While reviewing Gundam SEED Destiny, Liversidge stated that Lacus had become [...] "a cult" [...] within the series' setting due to how besides being pop-idol, she is backed up by a large number of soldiers. Lacus' public appearance in the series to reveal that Meer Campbell was impersonating her and state her true intentions was also called [...] "totally mesmerising" [...] by Liversidge. Chantal Strand was praised for her performance as both Lacus's and Meer's English voice actress by Anime News Network writer Theron Martin for giving them quality distinct from the original Japanese version despite finding it varying at some points.|$|E
2500|$|The book sold very well, {{and while}} some {{anatomical}} experts hostile to Haeckel's evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed what they already knew about similarities in embryos. The first published concerns came from Ludwig Rütimeyer, a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy. At the end of 1868 his review in the Archiv für Anthropologie <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> claim that the work was [...] "popular and scholarly", doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man's place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts. Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost [...] "scrupulosity and conscientiousness" [...] and an artist must [...] "not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes" [...] which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors. In particular, [...] "one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader {{three times in a}} row and with three different captions as [...] embryo of the dog, the chick, [...] the turtle." [...] He accused Haeckel of [...] "playing fast and loose with the public and with science", and failing {{to live up to the}} obligation to the truth of every serious researcher. Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned [...] "embryo of a mammal or bird". Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes (clichés) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos. In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this [...] "extremely rash foolishness" [...] had occurred in undue haste but was [...] "bona ﬁde", and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception.|$|E
