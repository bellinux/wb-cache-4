40|$|The {{recycling}} of <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> {{has become an}} increasingly important issue in recent years due to the enormous use of plastics in {{almost every aspect of}} modern life. Considering current conditions and expected future trends of the Saudi economy, the coprocessing of <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> with petroleum resid appears to be an attractive option for further studies. Our present ongoing study evaluated the effects of three different catalysts on the conversion and product distribution obtained from the coprocessing of heavy petroleum resid and <b>waste</b> <b>plastics.</b> The plastics used in this study were model polyethylenes (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene, and polystyrene as well as post consumer <b>waste</b> <b>plastics.</b> The coprocessing of various plastics with petroleum resid was found to be affected by catalyst type. The presence of hydrocracking selectivities during reaction increased conversion and product distribution of hexane soluble materials. At reaction conditions of 60 min and 430 °C, catalysts with substantial hydrocracking activity yielded high levels of conversion to liquid fuel products. The coprocessing of <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> with resid appears to be a feasible process by which to convert resid and <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> simultaneously to liquid fuels and to upgrade both the resid and <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> materials...|$|R

Environmental {{impacts of}} <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> are raised concern about {{all over the}} world for safe and {{friendly}} environment. Due to dense population and environmental effects of the major city in the world dumping, incineration and land filling are faced difficulties and challenges. At this circumstances vast of <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> are remained vulnerable and as solid hazardous materials in the environment. Incineration could be happen ruptures and bad atmospheric impacts with poisonous gases such as Carbon monoxide, Carbon dioxide, Oxide of Nitrogen are released in the environment. Lack of land, dumping and incineration space some development countries throwing the <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> into the deep sea water.

40|$|After {{the first}} oil crisis many {{companies}} in Japan started on projects to recycle <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> by transforming them into oil. These projects, however, were disrupted {{after the fall}} of oil price in the successive periods of the oil crisis. This disruption was mainly caused by inefficiency of the recycling technology in those days. Recently a new technology for recycling, which uses artificial zeolite as catalyst, has been developed and an experimental plant has been constructed. Although the technology has high efficiency in transforming of <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> into oil, it cannot produce value added. However we have to understand the difference between the efficiency for value and for material. In this paper, we investigated on the oil efficiency of the technology. The oil efficiency was measured by the quantity of oil which was directly and indirectly necessary to produce one unit of oil by recycling <b>wasted</b> <b>plastics.</b> We use 1985 Input-Output Table and a linear programing model is constracted. Since <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> are produced as joint products, we cannot avoid to use linear programming models. The result showed that recycling technology had high efficiency in saving oil. If the total of the <b>waste</b> <b>plastics</b> generated in Japan would be processed by this technology, the amount of oil savings would be 7. 57 million Kl which would be 4 % of the total amount of oil used in 1985. ...|$|R

40|$|Plastic has {{achieved}} such an extensive market due to {{fact that it}} is lightweight, cheap, flexible and reusable. But now it is regarded as a serious hazard. All recommendation for and against plastics finally land up on the reality that plastics are slow to degrade. By the end of the 20 th century, plastics are found as persistent polluters of many environmental niches, from Mount Everest {{to the bottom of the}} sea. There are numerous ways by which plastic pollution can be controlled. Pyrolysis is referred to as polymer cracking and its main advantages are that it can deal with <b>plastic</b> <b>waste.</b> This paper provides an overview of the science and technology of pyrolysis of <b>waste</b> <b>plastics.</b> The major advantage of the pyrolysis technology is its ability to handle unsorted, unwashed plastic.
