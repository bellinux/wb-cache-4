40|$|The {{relationship}} between protein structure and aggregation, {{as well as}} heat-induced gelling properties, of seven dried egg <b>white</b> (<b>DEW)</b> products was investigated. Strong correlations were found between average molecular weight and hydrophobicity plus surface SH groups of DEW-soluble protein aggregate (SPA). This suggests that hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bond formation between protein molecules {{were involved in the}} aggregation. The average molecular weight of DEW products with alkaline pHs was relatively higher than those with neutral pHs and the same degree of protein unfolding, probably because of more disulfide bond formation between protein molecules. In addition, strong correlations were found between hydrophobicity, surface SH groups plus average molecular weight of DEW-SPA, and physical properties of the gels from DEW products. These data indicated that controlling the aggregation of DEW proteins in the dry state is crucial to controlling the gelling properties of DEW...|$|E

40|$|Duck egg <b>white</b> (<b>DEW)</b> hydrolysates were {{prepared}} by five enzymes (papain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, alcalase, and flavourzyme) and their antioxidant activities investigated in this study. DEW hydrolyzed with papain (DEWHP) {{had the highest}} peptide content among the five enzymatic treatments. Besides, the peptide content of DEWHP increased when the enzyme to substrate ratio (E/S ratio) increased. It was suggested that higher E/S ratio contributed to elevate the degree of hydrolysis of DEW effectively. Similar results were also obtained by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. In addition, SDS-PAGE patterns indicated papain {{was the only one}} amongst all enzymes with the ability to hydrolyze DEW. In antioxidant properties, DEWHP showed more than 70 % of inhibitory activity on linoleic acid peroxidation and superoxide anion scavenging. Moreover, the Fe(2 +) chelating effect of DEWHP was greater than 90 %, while no significant difference was observed in DPPH radical scavenging and reducing ability. The results of peptide contents, antioxidant activities and electrophoresis suggested that the higher the peptide content, the stronger the antioxidant activities in DEWHP...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{due to the}} {{specific}} health benefits associated with bioactive peptides and the reduction of protein allergenicity by enzymatic hydrolysis, the utilisation of protein hydrolysates in the intermediate-moisture food (IMF) market, such as high protein nutrition bars (HPNB), has significantly increased. Currently, no reported study {{is related to the}} storage stability of dried hen egg <b>white</b> (<b>DEW)</b> and its hydrolysates (HEW) in an IMF matrix. Therefore, three DEW/HEW dough model systems (100 %HEW + 0 %DEW, 75 %HEW + 25 %DEW and 50 %HEW + 50 %DEW) were established using two commercial spray-dried egg white powders to study the effect of temperature and fraction of HEW on these IMF models (water activity (a(w)) : similar to 0. 8). During storage at three different temperatures (23, 35 and 45 degrees C) for 70 days, the selected physicochemical properties of the dough systems were compared. Overall, kinetic analysis showed an apparent zero-order model fit for the change in the colour (L*), fluorescence intensity (FI) and hardness, as a function of time, for different dough model systems. As expected, the L*, FI and hardness increased as a function of time mainly due to the Maillard reaction. The amount of free amino groups decreased, with an increase in rate of loss, as temperature increased in the 100 %HEW + 0 %DEW model. When DEW was substituted for some HEW, the regeneration of the free amino groups after loss was observed as a function of time. Furthermore, when the percentage of HEW was decreased, the incidence of mouldy samples occurred sooner, which indicates that HEW has some antimicrobial ability, especially in the 100 %HEW + 0 %DEW system where mould growth did not occur...|$|E
40|$|The earth tunnels {{for adult}} Brachytrupes Portentosus are deeply created inside the ground. On the one hand, it offer as safe living spaces or feces {{treatment}} zones.

All adults are died out after <b>white</b> <b>dew</b> festival(白露), while new born lavae climb up to soil surface to build their own tunnels. It is coincidently the season of the east Asian rainy season(梅雨季) coming firstly and the typhoon rains coming immediately afterward. Those functions of the tunnels are, therefore, dramestically changed and essentially critical to ecology and soil erosion problems. How the crickets overcome or escape from these impacts. The mode of cricket’s tunnel shape was obtained by pouring the liquidized cement into the earth tunnel, and waited until dried out. The tunnel looked like” Y” in the nymphs period. The two upper ends of Y mode ranged from 20 to 40 cm. The mode changed into a complex structure in mature period [...] The new tunnel models followed a vertical framework used to create for the purpose to produce new generation after matching. A soil dome over the through hole which piled around soil particles in nymphal or mature period. The total length of the earth tunnel might be over 1. 5 meter. The tunnel was used only for about one month, then gave up forever. Biodiversity was benefited due to the abandoned tunnels became homes of other microorganisms in the soils. The soils from dome in the upper part of soil tunnel will mix up if rains come during the young stage of nymphs while drain firmly during near-mature or mature stages. The infiltration test for connection of the tunnel shows a final stable infiltration rate, after 2 hours escape time, tunnel seems like a maceopore, and lead to a conclusion that seepage is not at all directly or indirectly formed and no soil ruin occurs, thus, no erosion potential is expected and it is stable even after a long rain during cricket in mature stage [...] The important reason of transfer action in nymph period is due to uncomfortable and dirty，while adult male is never change. The tunnel again. The evolution of earth tunnel sighificently occurred in diameter enlargement one reason is water dissipation,an additionl reason perhapes the construction action for a femal adult after matching. The variation of diameter curve is proposed in the shape to account these influences. 木賊葉木麻黃森林草坪為重要台灣大蟋蟀棲地，森林草坪(forest lawn) 一般意指墓園，但本文係指有林木的草地。台灣大蟋蟀成蟲身長約 4. 5 公分，深入土中建構的地道，一方面提供棲身安全、儲糧、進食、活動、交配、 排洩之處理，二方面兼作為儲蛋與孵育場所。由於成蟲在每一年白露節氣即會死亡。而台灣大蟋蟀若蟲幼蟲絕大部分在白露節氣後才會陸續出土，此時氣候上，先有梅雨後有颱風雨，短期內地道功能任務繁瑣，變化巨大懸殊，種族繁衍又如何以賴？ 本研究首先取得木賊葉木麻黃森林草坪棲地內台灣大蟋蟀成蟲地道形狀，方法是採用水泥和水，以重力方式灌入地道中，俟水分脫乾後挖取水泥模型。在若蟲期，模型有如「y」。且Y字二頭相距以 20 cm為主，至 40 cm。成蟲期配對時，這種基本造型，在雌蟲進入雄蟲洞中後，有革命性變化。雌蟲依垂直擴充框架挖出另一地道，準備生產；地道深入地下可超過 1. 5 m。本文根據現場資料模擬出典型結構進行滲透測定，成蟲期地道通水 2 小時餘後依然安穩，而有一穩定終滲透率；依其功能尚可歸入為土壤粗孔隙。是以本研究做成台灣大蟋蟀成蟲地道不會間接或直接形成滲流的結論；不僅如此，也不會引發土壤沖蝕或其他可能結構崩潰災害。 若蟲期，當地道因處理排洩物而失去部分空間後，如已造成地道環境不佳，台灣大蟋蟀會抛棄該舊地道而另築新地道；但成蟲期台灣大蟋蟀除非是母蟲，否則即不再遷移，一但決定藏身地道中必在進洞時均以土粒形成土塚保護在地道穿口外，土塚土粒含有養分常低於鄰近土壤。台灣大蟋蟀成蟲常擴大地道半徑來因應氣候上大量水的衝擊，另一個原因引起地道的演化是因為母蟲在配對後，在地道的新建築行為，這些行為影響地道直徑曲線之形狀。目錄 摘要……………………………………………………………………Ⅱ Astract…………………………………………………………………Ⅳ 目錄………………………………………………………………………Ⅵ 表目錄……………………………………………………………………Ⅷ 圖目錄……………………………………………………………………Ⅸ 照片目錄……………………………………………………………Ⅹ 第一章 前言…. …………………………………………………………. 1 第二章 前人研究. ……………………………………………………… 4 第三章 材料與方法………………………………………………… 6 第一節 樣區概述…………………………………………. … 6 第二節 地道模型複製………………………………………. 8 第三節 滲透試驗……………………………………………. 9 第四節 土壤分析………………………………………… [...] . 11 1 、地道土塚取樣……………………………………… 11 2 、地道底土取樣. ……………………………………… 12 3 、一般區土壤取樣………………………………… [...] . 13 4 、採樣試體自然風乾…………………………………. 14 5 、土壤有效肥份分析…………………………… [...] . 14 6 、地道直徑測量…………………………… [...] … 15 第四章 結果與討論…………………………………………………… [...] . 16 第一節 地道形狀模型與地道功能區……………………. 16 第二節 稚蟲地道通水時間…………………………… [...] . 18 第三節 成蟲期滲透率……………… [...] ……………… [...] 19 第四節 土壤分析…………………………… [...] ………… [...] 21 第五節 地道直徑曲線……………………………………. 27 第五章 結論與建議……………………………………………… 29 第一節 結論………………………………………. ……… 29 第二節 建議………………………………………. ……… 31 參考文獻…………………………………………………………… 3...|$|E

AramouniTo find {{an optimal}} {{formulation}} of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion pourable dressings containing 60 % and 70 % soybean oil, nine stabilizers {{common to the}} dressing industry were tested, each at three concentrations. The stabilizers tested were xanthan gum, propylene glycol alginate (PGA), a xanthan gum/guar gum/sodium alginate blend, a viscosifying modified corn starch, an emulsifying modified corn starch, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), liquid salted egg yolks, liquid salted whole eggs, and dried egg <b>whites</b> (<b>DEW).</b> The emulsions were made with a laboratory high shear disperser and evaluated over 8 weeks by measurement of creaming in 100 - mL graduated cylinders and by change in viscosity as measured by a Brookfield viscometer. The stabilizers and concentrations most effective at preventing separation and maintaining viscosity were MCC at 1 %, 2 %, and 3 % in the 60 % oil emulsion and 0. 25 % xanthan gum in the 70 % oil emulsion. Average viscosities ranged from 3300 - 23, 400 centipoise (cP). The emulsifying starch and dried egg whites were also effective at preventing creaming, but failed to maintain viscosity. The other ingredients showed some initial emulsion stability followed by either a gradual or sudden decrease in stabilization, as seen by decreasing viscosity and eventual separation...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} by greenhouse producers that adding sugar to a stomach poison insecticide enhances {{the efficacy of the}} insecticide in controlling western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). As such, a series of laboratory, including no-choice and multiple-choice assays, and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine if adding sugar-based compounds to insecticides enhances efficacy against western flower thrips. The sugar-based compounds evaluated were Mountain Dew, Diet Mountain <b>Dew,</b> <b>white</b> sugar, and brown sugar at two rates [initial (0. 18 mL/ 100 mL and 0. 12 g/ 100 mL) and high (0. 36 mL/ 100 mL and 0. 24 g/ 100 mL) ]. A water control was also included in all the assays. In the laboratory experiments, western flower thrips adults and nymphs were not attracted to any of the sugar-based compounds with < 60 s (out of 300 s total) spent in any of the treatments, and ≤ 29 s (out of 300 s total) spent in the treatments when the sugar-based compounds were mixed with three insecticides (tau-fluvalinate, pyridalyl, and spinosad). In the greenhouse experiments, the addition of the high rate of Mountain Dew (0. 36 mL/ 100 mL) and brown sugar (0. 24 g/ 100 mL) did not enhance the efficacy (based on percent mortality) of the insecticides against western flower thrips. There {{was no significant difference between}} the individual insecticide treatments and the mixtures with either Mountain Dew or brown sugar. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate that western flower thrips adults and nymphs are not attracted to sugar-based compounds and that it is not warranted to add these types of materials to spray solutions targeted for control of western flower thrips...|$|R
