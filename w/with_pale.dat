5|$|Up to six {{eggs are}} {{laid in the}} nest. The bushcrow's eggs are cream-colored <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> lilac blotches that {{concentrate}} into a ring at the wider end.|$|E
5|$|A young white-bellied sea eagle in {{its first}} year is {{predominantly}} brown, <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> cream-streaked plumage on their head, neck, nape and rump areas. The plumage becomes more infiltrated with white until it acquires the complete adult plumage by the fourth or fifth year. The species breeds from around six years of age onwards. The lifespan is thought to be around 30 years.|$|E
5|$|The red-cracked bolete (Xerocomellus chrysenteron) has an olive-brown {{cap that}} cracks, exposing flesh that ages to pinkish red. Boletellus chrysenteroides, {{found only in}} eastern North America, has a velvety to smooth, dark reddish brown, cracked cap <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> exposed flesh.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-18 mm. Female have dark brownish-gray forewings <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> {{veins and}} pale yellow strip along the costa. Males have <b>pale</b> grayish-brown forewings <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> veins. They lack the pale costal strip. Adults are on wing from May to October.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are <b>pale</b> yellow, <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> grey fasciation. The hindwings are paler yellow.|$|R
50|$|It is 15cm {{long and}} is dark brown <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> underparts {{and a white}} throat.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, {{the female}} purple-throated cotinga {{is a dark}} brown <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> buffy margins on the upperparts. The underparts are a buffy {{cinnamon}} with black barring. The throat is a deeper, unbarred rufous in coloration. The female's tail feathers are longer and more pointed at the tip {{than those of the}} male. The juvenile purple-throated cotinga resembles a paler, buffier female; the plumage of the immature is undescribed.|$|E
5|$|The Irish {{version of}} FES is brewed <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> malt, 25 per cent flaked barley (for head {{retention}} and body) and 10 per cent roasted barley, {{the latter being}} what gives the beer its dark hue. It uses the bitter Galena, Nugget and Target hop varieties which have undergone an isomerized kettle extract process. There are about a third more hops than in Guinness Draught and the beer has 47 Bitterness Units. The beer is force carbonated.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> areas and bill colour.|$|E
50|$|This {{damselfly}} is {{long and}} thin. The body is black <b>with</b> a <b>pale</b> blue face, and the wings have yellow edges. The female is larger, <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> yellow on the wings. This species lives along springs and drying ponds.|$|R
50|$|Pale {{toadflax}} (Linaria repens), {{a species}} from western Europe similar to L. purpurea, but <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> flowers.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 34-43 mm. It {{is similar}} to Rethera brandti, but larger and <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> markings.|$|R
5|$|The female is {{very similar}} to the male but the upper parts are {{somewhat}} more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male's winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly {{similar to those}} in Xerocomus, species in this genus do not have the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), and differences in ecology.|$|E
5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|E
5000|$|... == Description == The male {{is black}} and white while the female is brown <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> underparts.|$|R
25|$|In this species, {{the color}} of the soft parts is dark purple or violet, <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> pellucid (translucent) parapodia.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 8-9 mm. Adults are bronzy metallic <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> metallic markings. They are on wing in May.|$|R
5|$|However, in a {{field study}} {{published}} in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers; their proposal that these birds be classified as a single species, has been followed by least one field guide. Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the scarlet ibis has been introduced into wild populations of American white ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Tricholoma pardinum can be {{confused}} with T.nigrum and forms of T.virgatum that have more streaked rather than spotted caps. A form of T.pardinum in North America can be nearly white <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> scales, and may {{be confused}} with the whitish edible species T.resplendens. Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets T.pardinum apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) T.venenatum also has them. According to Alexander H. Smith, T.huronense is closely related, but can be distinguished from T.pardinum by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.|$|E
5|$|The American robin (Turdus migratorius) is a migratory {{songbird}} of the thrush family. It {{is named}} after the European robin because of its reddish-orange breast, though the two species are not closely related, with the European robin belonging to the Old World flycatcher family. The American robin is widely distributed throughout North America, wintering from southern Canada to central Mexico and along the Pacific Coast. It is the state bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. According to some sources, the American robin ranks behind only the red-winged blackbird (and {{just ahead of the}} introduced European starling and the not-always-naturally-occurring house finch) as the most abundant extant land bird in North America. It has seven subspecies, but only T. m. confinis of Baja California Sur is particularly distinctive, <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> gray-brown underparts.|$|E
50|$|Uvularia grandiflora {{has gained}} the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. There exists a {{cultivar}} 'Pallida' <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> coloured flowers.|$|R
5000|$|It is a 38 cm. Medium-sized, dark megapode <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> head. Mostly brownish-black <b>with</b> short <b>pale</b> grey crest. Yellow bill, red facial skin showing through thin feathers. Unusually large, dingy yellow {{legs and}} feet. Similar spp. Could be {{confused}} with dark morphs of Red Junglefowl Gallus gallus (or feral domestic stock)[...]|$|R
50|$|Females and immatures {{are mainly}} green, <b>with</b> <b>paler,</b> faintly {{streaked}} underparts. The legs are red-brown in the female, and brown in young birds.|$|R
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by Other Worlds, to a white spine with red or blue lettering.|$|E
5|$|The floury baker's {{distinctive}} {{appearance and}} loud call make it popular with children. Both the common and genus name {{are derived from}} the white, flour-like filaments covering the adult body. Its body and eyes are generally brown <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> patterns including a light-coloured line along the midline of the pronotum. Its forewings have distinctive dark brown patches {{at the base of}} two of their apical cells. The female is larger than the male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive genitalia and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent buckling of ribbed tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs.|$|E
5|$|FES is {{the oldest}} variant of Guinness that is still available, {{although}} its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an original gravity (OG) of 1082. After a peak in strength in 1840, when the beer had an OG of 1098, by 1860, the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG. FES was originally brewed <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> and brown malts. Black malt was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt. In 1883, the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent roasted malt. From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using roasted malt in the beer's production to roasted barley. Amber malt continued {{to be added to}} the grist until 1940. Flaked barley was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.|$|E
50|$|The {{color of}} this sea hare is very often brown <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> spots, {{but it can}} be various other shades {{including}} plain black all over.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} about 6.1 mm. The forewings are densely covered with graphite grey scales <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> bases. The hindwings are dirty whitish.|$|R
50|$|This fish {{measures}} about 5 cm (2 in) in length. It {{is similar}} to its relative, the goldstripe darter (Etheostoma parvipinne), but <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> coloration.|$|R
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} (Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema) is {{a species of}} bird in the cotinga family, Cotingidae. It {{is found in the}} western Amazon {{rainforest}} of South America; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil. It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The purple-throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies. It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism. Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers and a white belly with some black barring on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male has a powerful voice.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a bench chair inside a pale-blue room, {{surrounded}} by interior waterfalls. Glitches of Hamasaki appears, and she starts singing the song while seated. The next scene features damaged–archive footage of a destroyed town, fenced in with barbed wires. A young boy, <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> white skin, blonde dreads, and angel wings, appears in the distance. Several scenes features the boy looking towards the camera, which then inter cuts to scenes with Hamasaki singing the song in the room. The young boy wonders through the destroyed town, observing damaged homes and objects. The boy places his hands upon a dying tree, where he envisions the events of how the town became destroyed and dismantled. These scenes include burning flowers, falling construction, and broken religious statues. The second chorus has Hamasaki singing, and the song break shows the boy observing a blossoming flower which hasn't died. Smiling, he walks towards it, unbeknown that there is sharp barbed wire surrounding it. Scenes features Hamasaki singing, and shows brief inter cut scenes of barbed wire wrapped around the young boy. Struggling to become free from the wire, the young boy dies and leaves behind a large pile of angel feathers. The final scene features Hamasaki wearing exactly the same outfit as the angel, trapped in a large bird cage, in the room the video started with. The video zooms out on the overall appearance of her.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{majority}} of specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of head and facial markings), the color pattern may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish ground color, which is overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands {{on either side of the}} body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the ground color, often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal banding pattern fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with dark spots, and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is a more or less uniform brown color, especially in A. p. piscivorus. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix, but sometimes these are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered <b>with</b> <b>pale</b> pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 9.9 mm. The forewings are slate-grey with a blackish-grey costal margin, interspersed <b>with</b> <b>paler</b> scales. The hindwings are greyish-silvery white.|$|R
