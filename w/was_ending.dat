5|$|In early 2011, the Rage {{along with}} the Fresno Monsters, Wenatchee Wild, and Alaska Avalanche, all {{declared}} dormancy for various reasons, not committing to playing the next season; the Rage were pursuing entry into the AJHL. As the season <b>was</b> <b>ending,</b> the other teams in the division came out of dormancy; the Wenatchee team had their BCHL move denied and the Fresno Monsters were able to secure a lease agreement for their arena. The bid by the DC Rage Society to move the team into the AJHL, by purchasing {{the rights to the}} St. Albert Steel, failed as the Steel were moved to Whitecourt. While the team was achieving the expected levels of corporate sponsorship and had an average attendance of 1,010 people (13th best in the league of 28 teams), the Rage's costs (especially the travel costs) were higher than expected. In the first week of April 2012, a final appeal by the DC Rage Society to the City of Dawson Creek to cover certain fees was denied and the society announced the team <b>was</b> <b>ending</b> operations.|$|E
5|$|As Carlson's {{battalion}} <b>was</b> <b>ending</b> its patrol, Shōji and his surviving {{troops were}} reaching friendly positions {{west of the}} Matanikau. In addition to the losses sustained from attacks by Carlson's raiders, a lack of food and tropical diseases felled many more of Shōji's men. By the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse in December 1942 and January 1943.|$|E

5|$|As the war <b>was</b> <b>ending</b> in 1945, Silverman {{was on the}} road, {{traveling}} through all the countries of Central America, in South America, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa on fund-raising missions. Then in 1946, she was in Europe visiting refugee camps in Sweden and Occupied Germany, before returning to Palestine. By {{the end of the}} war, she had traveled 600,000 air-miles having visited every state in the United States, each province of Canada, Mexico, all of the countries in Central and South America, the West Indies, almost all of Western Europe, parts of Eastern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Iran, Palestine, Morocco, and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, as World War I <b>was</b> <b>ending,</b> the Royal Air Force {{built an}} {{airfield}} for two planes, and in November the Ottomans retreated from Zor Sanjak without a fight. The Syrian Emirate's army entered Deir ez-Zor on 4 December, and Zor Sanjak {{became part of}} Syria. In 1919, as the British and French argued over {{the borders of the}} planned mandates, the British permanent military representative to the Supreme War Council Henry Wilson suggested adding Palmyra to the British mandate. However, the British general Edmund Allenby persuaded his government to abandon this plan. Syria (including Palmyra) became part of the French Mandate after Syria's defeat in the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur was {{responsible}} for confirming and enforcing the sentences for war crimes handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March and Manila massacre. The trial in Manila of Yamashita was criticized because he was hanged for Iwabuchi's Manila massacre, which he had not ordered and {{of which he was}} probably unaware. Iwabuchi had killed himself as the battle for Manila <b>was</b> <b>ending.</b>|$|E

5|$|Other {{tensions}} included Donen's hit films {{compared to}} Vincente Minnelli's Brigadoon (which Kelly was closely involved in and {{had wanted to}} direct) flop, and Kelly's own ambitious film Invitation to Dance, both financially unsuccessful. During the shooting of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Donen often complained about his budgetary constraints, while Brigadoon had a much larger budget. Around that time Kelly's unsuccessfully attempted dramatic acting with The Devil Makes Three and Seagulls Over Sorrento also flopped, and his marriage to Betsy Blair <b>was</b> <b>ending.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tensions were renewed at the {{beginning}} of 1995 as Croatia sought to put increasing pressure on the RSK. In a five-page letter on 12 January Franjo Tuđman formally told the UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali that Croatia <b>was</b> <b>ending</b> the agreement permitting the stationing of UNPROFOR in Croatia, effective 31 March. The move was purportedly motivated by actions by Serbia and the Serb-dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to provide assistance to the Serb occupation of Croatia and allegedly integrate the occupied areas into Yugoslav territory. The situation was noted and addressed by the UN General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The 1975–76 {{season was}} Orr's final {{season with the}} Bruins and it was tumultuous. Orr's {{contract}} <b>was</b> <b>ending</b> after the season, potentially making him a free agent. The Bruins were sold by Storer Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr {{as a condition of}} the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as to whether it would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league would approve it.|$|E

On October 21, Wolf announced he <b>was</b> <b>ending</b> {{his campaign}} for governor, {{due to the fact that}} even though the Ethics Commission voted to change its rules, the implementation would have likely taken several months. On June 17, 2014, Wolf endorsed Don Berwick as the Democratic nominee for governor.|$|E

5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which {{was at that time}} a territory. He arrived as the brunt of the {{fighting}} in the territory <b>was</b> <b>ending.</b> Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days. Within a couple years, he laid out a town, built a grist mill and a saw mill, and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2015, Jones {{announced}} he <b>was</b> <b>ending</b> his college career {{to enter the}} 2015 NBA draft. He was selected with the 24th overall {{pick in the draft}} by the Cleveland Cavaliers, who then traded his draft rights to his hometown team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, in exchange for a 2019 second round draft pick and the draft rights to the 31st and 36th picks in the draft, Cedi Osman and Rakeem Christmas, respectively. On July 7, 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Timberwolves. Jones started in the preseason opener when Ricky Rubio was sidelined, but did not fare well against Russell Westbrook, going scoreless and nearly giving up a triple double. Jones began the season fourth on the Timberwolves depth chart at point guard (behind Rubio, Zach LaVine and Andre Miller) and was inactive for the October 28 season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers. Jones was active {{for the first time on}} November 7 when Kevin Martin had to be away from the team for the game against the Chicago Bulls. Two games later on November 10, he was active again when three starters were sidelined, including Rubio who was scratched from the lineup right before tipoff. He made his debut that night against the Charlotte Hornets, posting his first assist, steal, rebound and point. On December 5, using the flexible assignment rule, the Timberwolves assigned Jones to the Idaho Stampede, the D-League affiliate of the Utah Jazz. On December 22, he was recalled by the Timberwolves after he averaged 24.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.5 steals in 35.2 minutes per game in six starts in the D-League. He made his first NBA field goals on December 23 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring 6 points in 20 minutes. Jones didn't play in 17 consecutive games (since January 4) and then had a season-high 5 assists on February 8 against the New Orleans Pelicans. By late February, head coach Sam Mitchell noted that Jones would be getting sufficient playing time to be evaluated. He achieved a career-high on February 22 with 9 points on 4-of-7 shooting against the Boston Celtics. On February 28, he posted 6 assists against the Dallas Mavericks. Jones posted 6 assists and 10 points against the San Antonio Spurs on March 8. On April 7, Jones tallied 4 steals against the Sacramento Kings. On April 13, he closed out the season with a 12-assist effort against the New Orleans Pelicans.|$|E
