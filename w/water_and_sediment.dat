A recent study reported the presence of DCOI in both port <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> samples in Osaka, Japan, especially in weakly circulating mooring areas. Of environmental concern, DCOI levels predicted in marinas now are considered a threat to various marine invertebrate species. Isothiazolinones also are extremely toxic to fish.|$|E

25|$|Artificial levees block spring {{flood water}} {{that would bring}} fresh <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> to marshes. Swamps have been {{extensively}} logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for {{the oil and gas}} industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. And as the communities disappear, more and more people are leaving the region. Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry.|$|E
25|$|While {{creosote}} treated wood is {{no longer}} used {{in the building of}} structures and piers, old broken down piers still could contain these creosote preservatives. Many properties contain piers that were built before 2008 with creosote preservatives, and now remain in the water even if they are broken down. One simple remedy for this would be removing the pilings after they are broken down or are no longer in use. On the coast, after storms pass through, debris and wreckage breaks piers that are built on the water. One of the harder remedies is for pilings that have sunk {{to the bottom of the}} water and settled on the sediment. These pilings are not visible and are harder to detect. The pilings will then sit on the bottom and leach chemicals out into the sediment and ecosystem. A solution to the problem of hidden pilings could be an analytical method or technique that could be used to track creosote compounds or byproducts in situ (the original place of contamination). If there was a technique that could be used out in the field that could trace higher concentrations of the chemical in the sediment, then hidden pilings could be isolated and removed from the environment. Many methods, such as gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), have been used to identify creosote preservatives in the ground <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment,</b> but most methods must be taken back to the lab in order to be properly conducted due to the run time and size of the instrument. New studies have shown that the use of smaller, more user friendly bio-assays are available to researchers so they can be used in the field for faster identification of chemical compounds. A test that could identify creosote compounds or other toxic byproducts quickly and efficiently in the field would allow researchers to remove contaminated pilings before further damage can be done.|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} of trace elements and other analytes of environmental interest was determined in <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediments</b> of the Coya and Cachapoal rivers (VI Region, Central Chile), which {{corresponds to a}} location highly polluted by copper mining activity.

2500|$|Estuaries are {{an example}} of a coastal sink in that they tend to trap {{sediment}} which can be due to tidal circulations and the mixing of fresh and salt water, the injection of river sediment and the presence of mangroves. As the tide rises and falls <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> is pumped into the estuary. Because salt <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> particles are heavier than fresh water they tend to be carried [...] the bottom until the sediment sinks to the floor and is trapped within the estuary. The movement of sands and offshore material into an estuary generally depends on the direction of longshore drift and the movement of bottom waters across the continental shelf. Estuaries can often trap a lot of coarse bedload sediments that are fed down rivers, intercepting them before they reach the coast. The North Island of New Zealand experiences sediment sinks into estuaries often, enhanced by the presence of mangroves. Mangroves are sediment hungry and trap a lot of suspended sediment with their complex aerial root structure, thus functioning as land builders.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the changes in}} the time series of <b>water</b> discharge <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> load of the Yellow River into the Bohai Sea. To determine the characteristics of abrupt changes and multi-scale periods of <b>water</b> discharge <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> load, data from Lijin station were analyzed, and the resonance periods were then calculated. The Mann-Kendall test, order clustering, power-spectrum, and wavelet analysis were used to observe <b>water</b> discharge <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> load into the sea over the last 62 years. The most significant abrupt change in water discharge into the sea occurred in 1985, and an abrupt change in sediment load happened in the same year. Significant decreases of 64. 6 % and 73. 8 % were observed in <b>water</b> discharge <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> load, respectively, before 1985. More significant abrupt changes in <b>water</b> discharge <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> load were observed in 1968 and 1996. The characteristics of <b>water</b> discharge <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> load into the Bohai Sea show periodic oscillation at inter-annual and decadal scales. The main periods of water discharge are 9. 14 years and 3. 05 years, whereas the main periods of sediment load are 10. 67 years, 4. 27 years, and 2. 78 years. The significant resonance periods between <b>water</b> discharge <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> load are observed at the following temporal scales: 2. 86 years, 4. 44 years, and 13. 33 years. <b>Water</b> discharge <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> load started to decrease after 1970 and has decreased significantly since 1985 for several reasons.

2500|$|The Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula {{had been}} {{abandoned}} by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen. Williams in July 1862, but it {{had the potential to}} offer a route downriver that bypassed Vicksburg's guns. In late January 1863, Sherman's men, at the urging of Grant—who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea—resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work [...] "Butler's Ditch" [...] (since it was Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln's continuous inquiries as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant's Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam {{at the head of the}} canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with back <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediment.</b> In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, Hercules and Sampson, attempted to clear the channel, but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away.

Statistically significant spatial variations are indicated by two-way ANOVA in different geochemical forms of the metals and physicochemical parameters of <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>sediments</b> of the river Yamuna.
