5|$|In August 1982, MGM/UA {{contracted}} the distribution {{rights to the}} film. One Way Productions came to an agreement with MGM that it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of {{the costs associated with}} advertising and distributing the film, if MGM agreed to distribute Inchon for a profit share of only 15 percent. The normal fee for the film distributor was thirty percent of profits. The film, cut to 105 minutes, was released in the United States on the weekend of September 17, 1982. It was swiftly pulled from theater distribution because of its poor performance at the box office, and was never shown in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Not long after, {{the legend}} continues, {{a group of}} Sakalava (or, by some accounts, Vazimba) warriors were {{preparing}} to attack a village north of Alasora called Ambohipeno. Ralambo {{announced that it would}} be sufficient to throw a rotten egg at the warriors, and Kelimalaza <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the rest. According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse fell onto another warrior and killed him, and this corpse fell onto another and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom {{in the minds of the}} Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to have produced a massive hailstorm that wiped out the enemy warriors.|$|E
5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses and shapes. The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, {{was believed to be}} derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of his parents when they became old. Women govern the family, because men were usually away from home fishing.|$|E

5|$|The {{girls are}} soon {{captured}} by Fireflies, who restrain them; Marlene, {{the leader of}} the Fireflies, recognizes Ellie, and demands that she remain safe. When Riley claims she would like to join their group, Marlene refuses, and the two argue, resulting in Marlene threatening to shoot Riley. Ellie intervenes, demanding at gunpoint that Marlene explain how she knows information about Ellie. When Ellie finally lowers the gun, Marlene informs her that she knew Ellie's mother, and had promised her that she <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of Ellie. Ellie hands the gun to Marlene, who says that she would tell her more about her mother in the future, before telling the girls to leave. When Ellie and Riley reenter the quarantine zone, Riley says that there is no escape. Ellie suggests running away, but Riley informs her that this will just result in death. The two then walk back into the school.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{continued}} during autumn 1938. The Soviets {{reduced their}} demands: a Red Army operation {{was not an}} option anymore and the focus was shifted on securing the Gulf of Finland. The Soviets wanted to be informed of key elements of the Finnishâ€“Estonian Gulf blockade, the secret military plan against the Baltic Fleet. Furthermore, Yartsev suggested that the Finns fortify the Suursaari island, but that the Soviets <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of its defence. During the negotiations, Rudolf Holsti resigned as foreign minister, although not for reasons associated with the negotiations, and his place was taken by Eljas Erkko. Holsti was rather anti-German, so the resignation set off rumours, quickly quelled by the Finnish government, that he had been forced to resign by a Finnish government sympathetic to the Germans. The Finns attempted to appear even-handed, and the interior ministry issued an order banning the extreme-right IKL. The ban was reversed by the Finnish courts as being unconstitutional. Many years later, the minister in charge at that time, Urho Kekkonen, admitted that this was a simple gesture, to suggest to Moscow that Finland did not harbour a German fifth column.|$|E
5|$|The royalists {{under the}} command of Prince Mohamed's {{objective}} was to cut the Egyptians' line and force them to withdraw. They intended to take over the garrisons along this line and establish positions from which they could interdict the Egyptian movement. They had prepared the attack {{with the help of the}} Nahm tribe, who tricked the Egyptians into believing that they were their allies and <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the mountain pass known as Wadi Humaidat themselves. The royalist deal was that the Nahm would be entitled to loot the ambushed Egyptians. The Egyptians may have suspected something was up, as they sent a reconnaissance aircraft over the area a day before the attack. The royalists thus occupied two mountains known as Asfar and Ahmar and installed 75-mm guns and mortars overlooking the wadi. On April 15, the day after the last Egyptian convoy went through, the royalists launched a surprise attack. Both forces numbered at only a couple of thousands. The guns positioned on Asfar and Ahmar opened fire, and then the Nahm came out from behind the rocks. Finally, Prince Mohamed's troops followed. This time, the royalists' operation was fully coordinated by radio. Some of the Egyptians surrendered without resistance, others fled to Harah 800 yards to the north. Both sides brought reinforcements and the battle shifted between Harf and Hazm.|$|E

25|$|In 1919 Goddard {{thought that}} it would be {{premature}} to disclose the results of his experiments, because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report he had submitted in late 1916.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{said that}} the country must ensure that as it progresses, {{that no one is}} left behind, and to help those who have {{difficulty}} keeping up. He gives this reason for implementing the progress package that was given out. Lee {{said that the}} PAP government <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of older Singaporeans and help them work longer. PAP would install elevators on every floor of every HDB block, make the city barrier free and transport system wheelchair friendly.|$|E
25|$|Mid-game, {{a tribal}} shuffle managed to swap every {{contestant}} {{to the opposite}} tribe {{with the exception of}} Brkich, who remained on the Chapera tribe with Lex van den Berghe, Shii Ann Huang, Jerri Manthey, and Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien. The tribe went on to lose the next challenge and upon leaving, Mariano informed van den Berghe that he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of him if he took care of Brkich. Van den Berghe, Huang, and Vavrick-O'Brien voted out Manthey in hopes that Mariano would keep his word.|$|E

25|$|Anti-lock brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not be there to help in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{detachment}} {{attempted to}} fight {{its way through}} another eight miles (13km) of enemy-occupied territory to Yong Peng, this proved impossible, and Anderson had to destroy his equipment and attempted to work {{his way around the}} enemy. Anderson then ordered every able man to escape through the jungle to link up with the retreating main force in Yong Peng heading for Singapore. They {{had no choice but to}} leave the wounded to be cared for by the enemy, assuming the Japanese <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the wounded. But unfortunately, the Japanese unit at Parit Sulong later executed the approximately 150 wounded Australian soldiers and Indian soldiers next to the bridge of Parit Sulong, in the Parit Sulong Massacre.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, a young Jet Li {{arrived at}} the temple to shoot his feature film debut, Shaolin Temple. Though Shi barely noticed him at the time, the film's 1982 release was a major turning point for the temple, which {{experienced}} {{a significant increase in}} tourism. This in turn resulted in more positive attention to the temple by the Chinese government, which rebuilt the building, and in a change to the monks' daily routine, so that they could accommodate the tourists. Around this time, when Shi was 16, his parents, who held stressful jobs and were heavy smokers, died of lung cancer within six months of each other. Shi would then take care of his younger brother, while his older brothers <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the younger siblings, with whom Shi is still in contact today.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds and levels of loss in Albeeâ€™s play A Delicate Balance. Most obvious {{is the loss of}} balance that has been precariously maintained by Agnes, the main character in the play and mistress of the house in which the play takes place. Agnes begins the play musing about sanity, a condition, at least in Agnesâ€™s mind, that can easily be lost. Agnes wonders what would happen if she were to lose her sense of the rational. Who <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of things? The way in which Agnes maintains the delicate balance in her home, as well as the delicate balance of her sanity, is to lose contact with her own emotional reality. She also tries to convince everyone else to suppress his or her emotions. Agnes believes that by saying that the emotions are gone, circumstances will return to some condition that resembles normalcy.|$|E
25|$|Being easily led, and as keen {{on making}} money as Seddon was himself, Barrow was quickly persuaded by Seddon to sign {{over to him}} a {{controlling}} interest in all her savings and annuities, including Â£1,500 of India Stock, in return for which he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of her {{for the rest of}} her life, giving her a small annuity and allowing her to live in his home rent free. In August 1911, the Seddons, Barrow, and her young ward went on holiday together to Southend. On their return, Seddon's daughter Maggie was sent to buy a threepenny packet of flypaper from the local chemist. Shortly after, Barrow began to suffer from agonising stomach pains. The local doctor was called, who prescribed bismuth and morphine. On 9 September he visited her again, but by the following Monday her condition had deteriorated. However, she refused to go to hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} casamento poveiro (Povoan marriage), {{in which}} the newly-wed couple was covered by a fisherman's net and watered with vinho verde {{in order to bring}} fortune to the marriage, is becoming a forgotten practice. In PÃ³voa's tradition (that persists to the present day), the heir of the family is the youngest son (as in old Brittany and Denmark). The younger son is the heir because it was expected that he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of his parents when they became old. Also, unlike the rest of the nation, it is the woman who governs and leads the family â€“ this matriarchy is derived {{from the fact that the}} man was usually fishing at sea. The Danish professor Heningser noticed that several features in the Povoan fishermen cultural life were similar to those found in the Jutland fjords, one of which, the women's sign of mourning, putting the skirt on the shoulders and throw the head, was found only in Northern Denmark and PÃ³voa de Varzim.|$|E
