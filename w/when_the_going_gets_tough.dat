[...] He gets a job, and then helps to lift the family's spirits by organising a fireworks display, on which Sharma said, [...] "AJ is just trying to help out his family in his own, dysfunctional way." [...] In November 2012, Zainab makes a promise never to interfere in people's lives, so AJ decides to use the opportunity to test her. Sharma explained: [...] "He is ready to test her promise to the limits! AJ knows exactly how to push all of Zainab's buttons, and now he's going {{to take full advantage of}} the fact that she won't let herself be the control freak she normally likes to be!" [...] Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror said AJ is [...] "thoroughly enjoying" [...] testing Zainab's new policy.|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> <b>tough,</b> and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E

40|$|Imagine {{surviving}} in {{an environment}} that is neither truly marine nor truly terrestrial. That area just beyond the low-water mark of neap tides along the seashore is an example of just such an environment. The organisms living here have to cope with the combined extremes of both land and sea environments: salt spray, immersion in salt water, emersion in air, drenching by heavy rainfall, heating by the sun, freezing winter temperatures, unstable substrates (such as sand, gravel or boulders), and exposure to strong winds. Just how do they cope? Animals generally find it easier coping in this harsh environment because among other ways, they can simply get up and move <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> too tough. Plants (both terrestrial and marine) on the other hand, have to either tolerate, or succumb to it.

40|$|The United Nations {{was born}} in 1942, {{defeated}} the Axis Powers led by Germany, Italy and Japan and created today's UN system. This reality has been lost in modern scholarship.

In this way, the achievement of victory can be set {{in opposition to the}} United Nations and to multilateralism in general. But it should not be possible to separate victory in the war from the modern United Nations and its priorities, for these were the priorities set by the United Nations at war. America, Britain and the Soviet Union led a large coalition of states organised as the United Nations and this term was used routinely in military orders, in the instruments of surrender signed by the enemy and in political and social life. Bretton Woods and San Francisco were United Nations conferences, and interim United Nations organisations preceded the Charter. Understanding the wartime United Nations reframes our understanding of {{the second half of the}} last century and of our own.
