Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; <b>waste</b> <b>generation</b> should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.|$|E

25|$|Collocation of a waste {{generator}} with a waste-to-ethanol plant {{can reduce the}} waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business.

For example, millions of tons of wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions of gallons of biofuels.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>wastes</b> <b>generation</b> by amine {{degradation}} is {{an important}} issue to be addressed when considering CCS schemes. Biological treatment of amine wastes can be a strategy with reasonable economy and environmental sustainability. Both the aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment techniques can be used for amine wastes treatment, providing culture adaptation and maintaining suitable operating conditions. Aerobic treatment can, generally, provide higher biodegradation rates while anaerobic processes can be much more energy efficient. A combination of aerobic and anaerobic treatment is promising. Addition of a supplementary organic feed may facilitate the anaerobic digestion of amine wastes and this opens the possibility of using common industrial or municipal waste digesters for amine wastes treatment...|$|R
