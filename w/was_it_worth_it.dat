And they were powerless to persuade Dede to ride on Mab--Mab, whom he had bought, and who was unused and growing fat on pasture.

Thirty millions!--that made him come here and go there, that rode upon him like so many millstones, that destroyed him while they grew, that put their foot down and prevented him from winning this girl who worked for ninety dollars a month.|$|E

40|$|Background: Intrathecal drug {{delivery}} {{is known to}} reduce pain in patients where conventional systemic analgesia has been ineffective or intolerable. However, there is little information regarding the effects of intrathecal {{drug delivery}} on {{quality of life and}} function in those with advanced, incurable cancer. Aim: Retrospective exploration of the views of bereaved carers regarding the physical and psychosocial effects of external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery in patients with advanced incurable cancer. Design: Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with carers of deceased individuals who received percutaneous external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery as part of their pain management, within two UK centres. Setting: A total of 11 carers were recruited from two UK Palliative Care centres. Family carers of adult patients who had received external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery analgesia for cancer pain and had died between 6 and 48 months prior to contact were included. Carer relatives who were considered likely to be too vulnerable or who had lodged a complaint about treatment within the recruiting department or who had been treated directly by the interviewer were excluded. Results: In total, 11 interviews took place. The emerging themes were (1) making the decision to have the intrathecal – relatives described desperate situations with severe pain and/or sedation, meaning that the individual would try anything; (2) timing and knowing they were having the best – an increased access to pain and palliative care services, meant carers felt everything possible was being done, making the situation more bearable; (3) <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it?</b> – the success of the external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery was judged on its ability to enable the individual to be themselves through their final illness. Side effects were often considered acceptable, if the external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery enabled improvements in quality of life. Conclusion: Carers perceived external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery as most valuable when it improved quality of life towards the end of life, by reducing pain and side effects of conventional systemic analgesia to enable individuals ‘to be themselves’. Under these circumstances, the carers judged significant side effects to be acceptable.

40|$|The {{principle}} aim of {{this thesis}} was to investigate Integration, in particular the integration of Roman Catholic Schools in New Zealand. By March 1983 every Roman Catholic School had integrated (258). 1 Historically, in the 1960 's and early 1970 's, 252 teaching Religious left their schools, many left religious life. Their defection created a spiritual problem, disillusioned youth left the Church. At this point, the Catholic Authorities missed an opportunity: to investigate causes of the spiritual malaise and to ask serious questions about whether Catholic schools were the best solution to it. Instead they turned a spiritual problem into a financial one by replacing the religious with paid lay staff. In turn, this financial problem became a political one, with the Catholic Authorities seeking increased Government assistance to their schools. In 1973, the Labour Party, in Government, called a State Aid Conference from which a Steering Committee drafted the concept of Integration, in 1975, to become a Bill (Act?). This controversial Private Schools Conditional Integration Act, termed the 'shotgun wedding', steamrolled through the dying session of Parliament amidst continual protest from the National Party, in Opposition. The Act provided for the conditional and voluntary integration of private schools into the State system on a basis in which their special character is pre-served and safeguarded. Special character is the Trojan Horse inserted into a Bill that has {{had the effect of}} jeopardising the goodwill hard won by many Catholics in New Zealand regarding their schools. With Integration, the Roman Catholic Bishops agreed to meet the upgrading costs of all New Zealand Catholic Schools before the State is prepared to take over their future maintenance. Few non-Catholic Private Schools went ahead with this upgrading integration condition having got what they wanted: a continuance of State Aid. This serious financial commitment signed for all Roman Catholic schools has caused a financial crisis within the Catholic Church diverting money and energy from other Church projects and neglecting Catholic children in State schools. Besides the enormous cost to the Catholic Church, millions of dollars of Housing Corporation money is loaned to Roman Catholic schools for two-thirds 2 of their cost at a time of loan cut-backs. Whilst State schools are drastically cut back financially {{there appears to be no}} cut back financially of Government money to integrated schools. Bitterness and ill-feeling is mounting in the State sector. What a cost to the Catholic Church for it seems their spiritual problem that became a financial problem, then a political one is boomeranging back as a spiritual problem. A questionnaire on Faith (taken from the Baptismal questions) and on practice (from Canon Law) was given, as part of this thesis, to Catholic children in State schools and in Roman Catholic schools, under exactly the same conditions [State school Catholics score higher in Faith]. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> to pour millions of dollars into a system, from which 600 religious had left since Integration, and which still claims to have a special character belonging to the Roman Catholic church, with half its lay-staff non-Catholics...|$|E
