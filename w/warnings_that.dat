5|$|Despite her editors' <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> {{the book}} might not sell well, {{it quickly became}} a sensation, {{bringing}} acclaim to Lee in literary circles, {{in her hometown of}} Monroeville, and throughout Alabama. The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the Book of the Month Club and editions released by Reader's Digest Condensed Books.|$|E
5|$|The small {{particles}} in the smoke contained hydrocarbons, which can be an irritant but have a low toxicity and were not expected to cause any long-term harm. The Met Office issued <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> the smoke in the atmosphere could come down in rainfall during the night of 11 December.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was then declared {{at this time}} for the Yasawa Group, northern Viti Levu, Vanua Levu as well as smaller islands located nearby. Later that day, as Daman reached its peak, all areas of Fiji were under a gale warning. Early on December 7 RSMC Nadi canceled some of the warnings for Fiji, including the gale force warning for southwestern Viti Levu, and then later that day downgraded all the <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> were still in effect for Fiji to gale force as Daman was weakening.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Britain, between July and October 1940, RAF Fighter Command at RAF Bentley Priory {{received}} air threat <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> it filtered {{to remove}} duplication, doubt and confusion. These were then forwarded to the Operations Room at RAF Uxbridge, which allocated appropriate defence resources and passed orders on to No. 11 Group sector airfields. No. 11 Group personnel doubled to 20,000 between April and November 1940. The RAF officers' hospital was converted to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) hospital early in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who {{thought that he was}} reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E

5|$|Despite strong <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a}} bad idea, the War Cabinet {{decided to}} impose {{conscription}} on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn FÃ©in movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I {{and the prospect of}} a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and The Defender contained <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, but he did not denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E
5|$|Roman forces Sullivan to {{work with}} him in finding the treasure. Despite {{numerous}} <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> the treasure and the island are haunted, Roman continues to use his men in search of the treasure. Roman captures Fisher, but Drake and Sullivan catch up to him, {{just in time to see}} Roman about to leave with the statue. However, Navarro tells Roman the real treasure is inside the statue. Roman opens the statue to collect the riches inside. As soon as Roman does, he is cursed and zombified. Apparently angered at this betrayal, Roman savagely charges towards Navarro, who shoots Roman in the head and reveals to Drake that he intended to sell the statue as a weapon the whole time.|$|E

5|$|After filming commenced, Paramount Pictures {{brought in}} two African-American {{consultants}} {{to review and}} approve the depiction of the black characters: Willis Edwards, {{vice president of the}} local NAACP chapter, and David L. Crippens, the vice president and stage manager of the local PBS affiliate. In the end, they walked away with different views of the film. Crippens did not find the film to have any racist connotations, while Edwards found it inflammatory and felt it should not have been made, particularly not during that year, when a series of murders of black children was occurring in Atlanta. The two men provided a write-up of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to Davison along with <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> the studio feared a film boycott. But Fuller was neither told of these discussions, nor given the notes, until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude. Known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving black actors non-stereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio's actions insulting. He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{threw himself}} into Parliamentary work, begrudging the times when {{he was unable to}} attend debates and {{spending}} much time on committee work. When Austen Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer in the continued coalition government led by the Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George, tried to recruit him to serve on an additional committee, Neville Chamberlain informed his half-brother that he could only serve if it met between midnight and 7:30am. Chamberlain took time to assure the future of the Birmingham Savings Bank, and Parliament passed an act which removed onerous restrictions from the bank. In March 1920, he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister, but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George despite Bonar Law's <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> Chamberlain, now past fifty, might never be offered another chance to serve in government, as Lloyd George was likely to remain premier for a very long time. Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership, and when Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In Colchis, ruled over by Queen Imandra, Kassandra {{undergoes}} {{the rites}} of a priestess and is told that serving the Goddess is her destiny. At {{the age of}} fifteen, Kassandra is unhappily returned to her home. She arrives during a festival {{in time to see}} Paris win and be revealed to his true parents as their son. Despite the prophecy, Priam and Hecuba happily welcome him home. However, Hector and his other brothers, jealous of the attention and achievements Paris has suddenly garnered, suggest that he be sent abroad to treaty with King Agamemnonwho holds Priam's sister. Paris readily agrees. Meanwhile, Kassandra begins training as a priestess of the temple of Apollo, despite misgivings that she is abandoning the Goddess. Part of her duties include helping care for the temple serpentssymbols of Python whom Apollo is said to have slain. Paris returns to Troy with the beautiful Helen, wife of King Menelaus, and she is welcomed into the city. Kassandra's <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> Helen will destroy Troy go unheeded, and Paris denounces his sister as a madwoman.|$|E

5|$|Reaching {{the open}} fields again, the 21st was ordered by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny {{to fill a}} hole {{in the center of the}} Union line. As the 21st advanced, Kearny rode out in front of the regiment, strenuously urging them to hurry, and refuting <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> Confederates were close by. Kearny was killed by a volley from a force of Confederates {{concealed}} just inside a nearby tree line. Now in very close range to the enemy, a tense standoff ensued with leveled muskets as the 21st and the Confederate regiment each demanded the surrender of the other. Finally, the Confederate regiment charged on the 21st. It was the first time and last time, according to the regimental historian, that the 21st gave wounds with the bayonet. The hand-to-hand fighting was severe and great confusion resulted. Col. Clark was separated from the unit when most of the men around him were killed and he found himself lost in the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the unit again. This resulted in the mistaken printing of his obituary in Amherst.|$|E
5|$|Recalling his {{homesickness}} {{and loneliness}} {{the last time}} he had ventured abroad, for his next foreign trip Etty travelled in the company of Richard Evans, who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence. Despite <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> Italy would be uncomfortably hot, the two men set out on 23June 1822 with the aim of reaching Rome. Crossing to France by means of the recently developed steamboat, they arrived in Paris on 26June. They stayed in Paris for two weeks, visiting Versailles and the city's public art galleries; they also visited the much-reduced remaining exhibits of the Louvre. The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time, at which Etty felt a great dislike for the quality of portraiture in France, but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections, in particular Rubens's Marie de' Medici cycle, elements of which he would later reuse in many of his own works.|$|E
5|$|Rhonda Latimer, {{an aging}} {{reporter}} for Fox News Channel who is idolized by viewers {{because of her}} good looks, is dismissed when the network's first high-definition broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. Lois auditions for the part, ignoring Brian's <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> Fox News is a heavily biased network, and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an exposÃ© on Michael Moore {{to prove that he}} is a homosexual. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the both of them are portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.|$|E

5|$|The tunnel also suffers regular {{problems}} with strikes from over-height traffic, and vehicles {{running out of}} fuel. On 10 December 1996, a man drove a Mercedes truck supporting a crane towards the southbound tunnel, ignored <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> his vehicle was over-height, and struck a gantry, breaking a steel reinforcement frame in the process. The entire tunnel was immediately closed, not only to retrieve the vehicle, but to perform additional safety checks. Because the Limehouse Link tunnel, which runs near to {{the north end of}} the Blackwall Tunnel, and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, part of the Dartford Crossing, were also closed on the same day, the accident caused one of the worst traffic jams in the capital. In February 2011, TfL reported that the tunnel had been closed 1,200 times in the previous year for a total of 157 hours, while New Civil Engineer magazine claimed it shut 1,448 times in 2010. To try to prevent closures of this nature, an LED noticeboard was set up in the northbound approach, counting the number of breakdowns and accidents per month occurring inside the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units had been {{identified}} in AO Surfers, including the regular North Vietnamese 7th Divisionâconsisting of the North Vietnamese 141st and 165th Regiments {{under the command of}} Nguyen the Bon, the Vietcong 5th Divisionâconsisting of Viet Cong 274th and 275th Regiments, and the Dong Nai Regiment. These divisions were believed to have participated in the assault on Saigon and allied intelligence considered it likely they would attempt to withdraw through the Australian area of operations in order to regroup. Other forces included North Vietnamese 85th Regiment as well as the 165th, 233rd, 269th, 275th, D280 and 745th Viet Cong Infiltration Groups and various units used for reconnaissance, guiding, logistics, liaison and other tasks. In total, an estimated strength of 3,000 to 4,000 men. Regardless, despite earlier <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> they may concentrate up to regimental-strength, a breakdown in the passage of intelligence led the Australians to believe that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong would remain dispersed in small groups in an attempt to avoid detection. As such the Australians assumed that the communist forces would pose little threat and envisioned patrolling from company harbours to find and ambush them as they withdrew. Meanwhile, due to the risk of heavy ground fire, only a very limited aerial reconnaissance of the new area of operations was undertaken and this later had significant implications.|$|E
5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
