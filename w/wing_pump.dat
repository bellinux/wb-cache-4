40|$|Given the {{unstable}} {{state of the}} environment, there is an undeniable need {{for the development of}} sustainable technologies. This need affects all areas of everyday life, even the shower. Modern shower systems result in energy waste in the form of heat, which can be minimized through the implementation of a heat exchanger. In cooperation with Consat SES this project developed a system to implement a heat exchanger using an in-shower water transportation pipe. A fitting non-electrical pump and motor were also chosen. To develop these elements a general design methodology of defining the problem, identifying the solution space, developing concepts, testing concepts and proposing a design, was used with adaptations for the component at hand. By following this strategy for each component and then reviewing the system as a whole, a new shower system was developed with a trapezoidal water transport pipe, a <b>wing</b> <b>pump,</b> and a turgo turbine. ...|$|E
50|$|Most Learjet 25 {{aircraft}} were {{fitted with}} a fuselage tank. The fuselage tank can be filled by the <b>wing</b> boost <b>pumps</b> through the transfer line and the fuel transfer valve. When the tank is full, a float switch de-energizes the <b>wing</b> boost <b>pumps</b> and closes the valve. During fuel transfer, the fuselage tank transfer pump pumps fuel into the both wing tanks.|$|R

50|$|The chestnut-backed antbird is {{normally}} found as pairs throughout the year, but occasionally joins mixed-species feeding flocks or army ants. It feeds on insects, other arthropods, and sometimes small frogs or lizards taken from leaf litter and vine tangles in low vegetation {{or on the}} ground. It is easier to hear than see in its dense habitat, but can be attracted by imitating its whistled song. It may then give a territorial display with puffed-up body, drooped <b>wings,</b> and <b>pumping</b> tail.|$|R
50|$|Like {{other types}} of pupae, the {{chrysalis}} stage in most butterflies {{is one in which}} there is little movement. However, some butterfly pupae are capable of moving the abdominal segments to produce sounds or to scare away potential predators. Within the chrysalis, growth and differentiation occur. The adult butterfly emerges (ecloses) from this and expands its <b>wings</b> by <b>pumping</b> haemolymph into the wing veins. Although this sudden and rapid change from pupa to imago is often called metamorphosis, metamorphosis is really the whole series of changes that an insect undergoes from egg to adult.|$|R
50|$|Thai Airways International Flight 114, a Thai Airways International Boeing 737-400 {{bound for}} Chiang Mai from Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok, was {{destroyed}} by an explosion of the center wing tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank while the aircraft was parked prior to boarding on the ground on 3 March 2001. Officially, {{the source of the}} ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but the most likely source was an explosion originating at the center <b>wing</b> tank <b>pump</b> as a result of running the pump in the presence of metal shavings and a fuel/air mixture.

50|$|On August 2, 2010, Todd Reichert of the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies piloted a human-powered {{ornithopter}} named Snowbird. The 32 m wingspan, 42 kg {{aircraft was}} constructed from carbon fibre, balsa, and foam. The pilot {{sat in a}} small cockpit suspended below the <b>wings</b> and <b>pumped</b> a bar with his feet to operate a system of wires that flapped the wings up and down. Towed by a car until airborne, it then sustained flight for almost 20 seconds. It flew 145 metres with an average speed of 25.6 km/h (7.1 m/s). Similar tow-launched flights {{were made in the}} past, but improved data collection verified that the ornithopter was capable of self-powered flight once aloft.|$|R
50|$|Three-toed jacamars breed during Brazil's rainy season, with vocalizations {{and other}} {{courtship}} behaviors increasing between September and February. During courtship, rival males sit {{side by side}} on a branch, flicking their <b>wings</b> and <b>pumping</b> their tails as they sing. Territories are defended vocally, with rivals rarely resorting to physical confrontation. The species excavates a burrow nest, using one foot at a time to dig into an earthen bank; evidence (in the form of dirty and broken beaks on female museum specimens) suggests that the female may do most or all of the nest digging. Burrows are 6 cm wide and 6 - 9 cm high, and may extend as much as 72 cm into the bank. The species tends to nest colonially. The female lays 2-4 eggs.|$|R
50|$|In the US and Europe, {{agricultural}} aircraft are typically small, simple, and rugged. Most have spraying systems {{attached to the}} trailing edges of their <b>wings,</b> and <b>pumps</b> are usually driven by wind turbines. In places where farms are larger, such as New Zealand, Australia, the former Warsaw pact nations {{and parts of the}} developing world, larger and more powerful aircraft have been used, including turboprop powered aircraft such as the PAC Cresco, twin engined types such as the Lockheed Lodestar and the WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor - a turbofan-powered biplane. All tend to be of simple, rugged STOL design. Sometimes a Ram air turbine is used as an auxiliary power source for the pumping machinery instead of taking power directly from the engine (because this can be installed without any modifications of the airplane's mechanical systems). In places where dedicated use as an {{agricultural aircraft}} is uneconomic, utility types such as the Antonov An-2 biplane and De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver have been used.|$|R
40|$|Kite Power {{research}} group at TU Delft developed the KiteSim framework for dynamic simulation of crosswind kite power systems. Currently, KiteSim has {{the capability to}} simulate leading edge inflatable kites. The use of rigid wing kites in crosswind kite power systems is becoming widespread. Accordingly, KiteSim framework is planned to be augmented to simulate the rigid wing kite power systems as well. Therefore, objective of this thesis is set to enhance the KiteSim framework in order to include the capability of the dynamic simulation of a rigid <b>wing</b> <b>pumping</b> crosswind kite power system by developing a particle system model to represent the tethered rigid wing. The particle system model of rigid wing consists of 6 point masses and 13 spring-damper elements. Positions and masses of the discrete particles are calculated in order to represent the rigid wing properties accurately. The spring-damper elements are interconnecting the particles. Lifting line theory and Kirke’s post stall correlation methods are used to create the full angle of attack aerodynamic model for wings and tails. Available atmospheric, tether and winch models of the KiteSim framework are also used for rigid wing dynamic simulations. Equation of {{the motion of the}} particle system model is formulated as an implicit problem, which is simulated by implicit Runge-Kutta method of fifth-order. Validation simulations are conducted with the particle system model of NASA SGS 1 - 36 flight test sailplane. Validation cases show satisfactory results with the flight test data. For the remaining simulations, AP 2 PowerPlane of Ampyx Power is modelled as particle system and manually flown in KiteSim. Mass properties of the model is found to be highly accurate throughout the simulations. Power generation capabilities of the model is checked by flying figure-of-eight trajectories. Reel-out phases are investigated, a peak mechanical power of 45 kW and a mean power of 10 kW are obtained. Further comparison of the reel-out dynamic simulations with the quasi-steady theoretical calculations is done. Moreover, gliding and stalling manoeuvres are simulated for a plausibility check study. The developed particle system model for rigid wings shows satisfactory results and a potential for further development.

50|$|Originally {{located in}} Brooklyn, New York, the company moved its {{headquarters}} to Melbourne, Florida in 1998 {{where it is}} today. The company became Consolidated Macaroni Machine Corporation in 1926 and changed the name to Demaco in 1952. In World War II, Consolidated made tooling for the Norden bombsight, Grumman aircraft fighter <b>wings</b> and Worthington <b>pumps</b> {{as part of the}} war effort. In the 1940s, DEMACO introduced an automated spaghetti spreader with a continuous drive and trim handling system.This innovation permitted the first continuous production of long pasta on a manufacturing line instead of making product in batches. Also in the 1940s and early 1950s, DEMACO made significant improvements to pasta dryer automation and control as well as sanitary design of equipment.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the strong}} electron-phonon {{coupling}} of the emitting 3 d orbital in transition-metal (TM) ions, 3 d systems exhibit luminescence with typically several hundred nm of spectral bandwidth. TM-ion-doped materials are, therefore, of high interest for applications as tunable and short-pulse lasers. Whereas many TM-ion-doped systems suffer from excited-state absorption (ESA), systems with a d 1 electron configuration possess only one excited 3 d level and ESA into higher-lying 3 d levels is impossible. However, ESA can occur owing to transitions into the conduction band and conduction-band-related energy levels. Mn 6 + is a promising ion for a tunable laser system, and near-infrared emission from Mn 6 + was observed in several host lattices. In BaSO 4, the room-temperature stimulated-emission cross section {{is larger than the}} ESA cross section in the spectral range 920 - 1600 nm [bru 97 II]. Therefore, as a laser material BaSO 4 :Mn 6 + can offer a broad tuning range. The fabrication of Mn 6 +-doped BaSO 4 layers requires a particular growth method at low temperatures, since the Mn 6 + ions tend to reduce to Mn 4 + at T ≥ 600 °C. Moreover, this reduction is also time-dependent. The Mn 6 +-doped BaSO 4 layers have been grown at low temperatures using liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE). The eutectic CsCl-KCl-NaCl served as solvent for the LPE of BaSO 4 :Mn 6 + with a low eutectic temperature of 480 °C {{in order to keep the}} temperatures well below 600 °C to prevent chemical reduction of Mn 6 +. The initial Mn 6 + concentration was up to 1 mol% with respect to S 6 +. In contrast, the Mn 6 + concentration in the layers was maximum 20 % of the initial Mn 6 + concentration. High quality layers with thickness of up to 580 μm, lack of large-size inclusions, and low defect concentration were achieved [ehr 02]. The etch-pit density for the (011) face was 103 cm- 2. The Mn 6 +-doped BaSO 4 layers were investigated spectroscopically by absorption and emission measurements at room temperature and the incorporation of manganese solely in its hexavalent oxidation state into the layers was confirmed [ehr 02]. The Mn 6 + absorption bands are 2 E —> 2 T 2 at 700 - 900 nm and a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer band at 500 - 650 nm. Excitation into these bands leads to broadband Mn 6 + emission between 850 and 1600 nm. The fluorescence lifetime was measured to be 0. 56 μs [ehr 02]. A relatively small reabsorption from the ground state is visible in the region of the fluorescence emission. With the measured spectroscopic data, analytical and numerical simulations in order to investigate the future laser potential of BaSO 4 :Mn 6 + was performed. Since reabsorption at the laser wavelength from the ground state especially in the <b>wings</b> of the <b>pump</b> absorption may play a significant role in such a ground-state laser system, the rate equations for the excited-state population density and the photon density in the cavity were solved. The pump and laser wavelengths, the dopant concentration, and the length of the active medium were optimized with respect to minimize the laser threshold. Pumping around 800 nm and providing high reflectivity of the cavity mirrors at 1150 nm cannot enable laser emission, because the ratio of 3 : 1 between pump absorption cross-section and laser reabsorption cross-section is too small to allow for sufficient pump absorption and simultaneously avoid significant reabsorption of the oscillating laser light. In contrast, when pumping at 532 nm and providing high reflectivity at 1500 nm, this ratio becomes 143 : 1. In conclusion, laser oscillation of BaSO 4 :Mn 6 + at 1500 nm is more likely. The damage threshold was evaluated for the pump wavelengths of 532 and 1064 nm, 1. 6 × 106 W cm- 2 and 5. 2 × 108 W cm- 2, respectively. The damage threshold and the laser threshold are similar for pumping at 532 nm and 5 % Losses in the crystal.   References [bru 97 II] T. C. Brunold, H. U. Güdel, S. Kück, G. Huber, J. Opt. Soc. Am.
