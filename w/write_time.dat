50|$|For example, {{assuming}} an exposure area of 1 cm2, {{a dose of}} 10−3 coulombs/cm2, and a {{beam current}} of 10−9 amperes, the resulting minimum <b>write</b> <b>time</b> would be 106 seconds (about 12 days). This minimum <b>write</b> <b>time</b> does not include time for the stage to move back and forth, as well as time for the beam to be blanked (blocked from the wafer during deflection), as well as time for other possible beam corrections and adjustments {{in the middle of}} writing. To cover the 700 cm2 surface area of a 300 mm silicon wafer, the minimum <b>write</b> <b>time</b> would extend to 7*108 seconds, about 22 years. This is a factor of about 10 million times slower than current optical lithography tools. It is clear that throughput is a serious limitation for electron beam lithography, especially when writing dense patterns over a large area.|$|E

5000|$|The {{two most}} visible {{benefits}} of OPC are correcting linewidth differences seen between features in regions of different density (e.g., center vs. {{edge of an}} array, or nested vs. isolated lines), and line end shortening (e.g., gate overlap on field oxide).

For the latter case, [...] "dog-ear" [...] (serif or hammerhead) features may be generated at the line end in the design.

5000|$|The heap method {{suffers from}} a few {{inherent}} flaws, stemming entirely from fragmentation. Like any method of memory allocation, the heap will become fragmented; that is, there will be sections of used and unused memory in the allocated space on the heap. A good allocator will attempt to find an unused area of already allocated memory to use before resorting to expanding the heap. The major problem with this method is that the heap has only two significant attributes: base, or {{the beginning of the}} heap in virtual memory space; and length, or its size. The heap requires enough system memory to fill its entire length, and its base can never change. Thus, any large areas of unused memory are wasted. The heap can get [...] "stuck" [...] in this position if a small used segment exists {{at the end of the}} heap, which could waste any magnitude of address space, from a few megabytes to a few hundred. On lazy memory allocation schemes, such as those often found in the Linux operating system, a large heap does not necessarily reserve the equivalent system memory; it will only do so at the first <b>write</b> <b>time</b> (reads of non-mapped memory pages return zero). The granularity of this depends on page size.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Inverse {{lithography}} technology �ILT � is {{a procedure}} that optimizes the mask layout to produce an image at the wafer with the targeted aerial image. For an illumination condition optimized for dense pitches, ILT inserts model-based subresolution assist features �AF � to improve the imaging of isolated features. ILT is ideal for random contact hole patterns, in which the AF are not at intuitive locations. The raw output of ILT consists of very complex smooth shapes that must be simplified for an acceptable mask <b>write</b> <b>time.</b> It is challenging for ILT to quickly converge to the ideal pattern {{as well as to}} simplify the pattern to one that can be manufactured quickly. ILT has many parameters that effect process latitude, background suppression, conversion run time, and mask <b>write</b> <b>time.</b> In this work, an optimization procedure is introduced to find the best tradeoff between image quality and run time or <b>write</b> <b>time.</b> A conversion run time reduction of 4. 7 � is realized with the outcome of this optimization procedure. Simulations of mask <b>write</b> <b>time</b> quantify the ability of ILT to be used for full chip applications. The optimization procedure is also applied to alternate mask technologies to reveal their advantages over commonly used 6 % attenuated phase shif...|$|E

40|$|State-of-the-art diffractive optics are {{fabricated}} using {{e-beam lithography}} and dry etching techniques to achieve multilevel phase elements with very high diffraction efficiencies. One {{of the major}} challenges encountered in fabricating diffractive optics is the small feature size (e. g. for diffractive lenses with small f-number). It {{is not only the}} e-beam system which dictates the feature size limitations, but also the alignment systems (mask aligner) and the materials (e-beam and photo resists). In order to allow diffractive optics to be used in new optoelectronic systems, it is necessary not only to fabricate elements with small feature sizes but also to do so in an economical fashion. Since price of a multilevel diffractive optical element is closely related to the e-beam <b>writing</b> <b>time</b> and the number of etching steps, we need to decrease the <b>writing</b> <b>time</b> and etching steps without affecting the quality of the element.
