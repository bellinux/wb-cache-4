5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

She said, [...] " [...] is angelic... {{like you}} see [...] faces {{instantly}} when you hear it. [...] are basically saying that I had these walls built up about love; you completely tore them down and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you I see your halo, it's really beautiful." [...] Backed by a piano, claps and step stomps that set a spiritualized atmosphere, Beyoncé opens the song ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson protested {{against the}} major leagues' ongoing lack of {{minority}} managers and central office personnel, {{and he turned}} down an invitation to appear in an old-timers' game at Yankee Stadium in 1969. He made his final public appearance on October 15, 1972, throwing the ceremonial first pitch before Game2 of the World Series at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. He gratefully accepted a plaque honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of his MLB debut, but also commented, [...] "I'm going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that third base coaching line one day and see a black face managing in baseball." [...] This wish was only fulfilled after Robinson's death: following the 1974 season, the Cleveland Indians gave their managerial post to Frank Robinson (no relation to Jackie), a Hall of Fame-bound player who {{would go on to}} manage three other teams. Despite the success of these two Robinsons and other black players, the number of African-American players in Major League Baseball has declined since the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alex Berenson of The New York Times {{reported}} in 2003 that Fannie Mae's risk {{is much larger}} than is commonly held. Nassim Taleb wrote in The Black Swan: [...] "The government-sponsored institution Fannie Mae, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> its risks, seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite, vulnerable to the slightest hiccup. But not to worry: their large staff of scientists deem these events 'unlikely'".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1995 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Jagger said, [...] "I {{think that was}} taken from an old idea of Baudelaire's, I think, but I could be wrong. Sometimes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> my Baudelaire books, I can't see it in there. But it was an idea I got from French writing. And I just {{took a couple of}} lines and expanded on it. I wrote it as sort of like a Bob Dylan song." [...] It was Richards who suggested changing the tempo and using additional [...] percussion, turning the folk song into a samba.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2015, DeLillo {{received}} the 2015 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters at the 66th National Book Awards Ceremony. The ceremony {{was held on}} November 8 in New York City, and he was presented his award by Pulitzer Prize winner Jennifer Egan, a writer profoundly influenced by DeLillo's work. In his acceptance speech, DeLillo reflected upon {{his career as a}} reader as well as a writer, recalling examining his personal book collection and feeling a profound sense of personal connection to literature: [...] "Here I’m not the writer at all, I’m a grateful reader. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> my book shelves I find myself gazing like a museum-goer." [...] In February 2016, DeLillo was the guest of honor at an academic conference dedicated to his work, [...] "Don DeLillo: Fiction Rescues History", a three-day event held at the Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris, France.|$|E
