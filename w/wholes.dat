Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from <b>wholes</b> bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal <b>wholes.</b> Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.|$|E

25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their <b>wholes.</b> There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of the}} cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and <b>wholes.</b> Instead <b>wholes</b> are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the <b>wholes</b> are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.|$|E

25|$|It {{had very}} {{much in common with}} his {{philosophy}} of life as subsequently developed and embodied in his Holism and Evolution.

25|$|For Unger, society emerges {{not through}} {{compromise}} or the winnowing down of best options, but rather though conflict and struggle {{for control of}} political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the terms of social interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order Unger calls formative context. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come to believe and act as if their social words were coherent <b>wholes</b> that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They {{come to see the}} existing arrangements as necessary. Unger calls this false necessity. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition Unger calls negative capability.|$|E
25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured <b>wholes</b> and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, {{but it is not a}} part of the world.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>whole</b> grain foods {{may reduce the}} risk of chronic diseases; however, intake of <b>whole</b> grains in the UK is below optimal levels. This thesis has been primarily concerned with evaluating attitudes towards <b>whole</b> grain foods and measuring current consumption in an unstudied, culturally distinct region of the UK i. e. Northern Ireland. Qualitative focus groups and a cross-sectional survey were conducted to a) evaluate attitudes towards <b>whole</b> grains among various subgroups of respondents, b) measure <b>whole</b> grain intake, and c) evaluate health related factors influencing willingness to use breads with health claims and <b>whole</b> grain intake. Another cross-sectional study compared <b>whole</b> grain intake estimated using two dietary methods (a grain-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and seven day food diary) with plasma alkyl resorcinol concentrations (a potential <b>whole</b> grain biomarker). Results suggest that Northern Irish adults perceive <b>whole</b> grain foods to be 'healthy', but report many barriers to consumption, notably, a negative perception of the sensory qualities and an inability to identify <b>whole</b> grains. Respondents were either 'more' or 'less' favouring towards <b>whole</b> grains compared with refined grain foods. <b>Whole</b> grain intake was quite low; intakes were higher among those with 'more' favouring attitudes, and those broadly described as being 'health conscious' in terms of their socio-demographic, -economic, health and lifestyle profile. General food choice factors and health motivation influenced willingness to use breads with health claims, and <b>whole</b> grain intake. Lastly, the grain-specific FFQ correlated with other assessment methods, illustrating its ability to assess <b>whole</b> grain intake. This thesis provides an important insight into barriers and facilitators of <b>whole</b> grain consumption and demonstrates how attitudes and consumption differ among several subgroups. This information could be utilised by health practitioners promoting increased <b>whole</b> grain consumption, as well as the food industry when developing and marketing more acceptable <b>whole</b> grain products.

500|$|Complexity is {{understood}} as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This biocomplexity stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as transitional areas or ecotones spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy, and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts.

Recipes are grouped, in the case of fish by species, and they form a connected story. Acton adds comments where she sees fit, indicating anything from when the food is in season to where a recipe came from, and how much she likes it.
