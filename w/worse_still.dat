5|$|Bohr's {{model was}} not perfect. It could only predict the {{spectral}} lines of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> as spectrographic technology improved, additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain. In 1916, Arnold Sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model {{to explain the}} extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of his career Braham flew around the World. But, in 1968, Canadian policy pointed to the amalgamation of all the Canadian armed forces into one unified service. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow put an end to Canada's plan to build their own fighters which curbed Braham's ambitions as a test pilot. He resigned from the RCAF in January 1968 and settled in Nova Scotia with his wife and three sons. He had flown 5,370 hours in 66 types of aircraft with the RCAF.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{believed}} he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him, but carried on regardless {{in support of his}} party's nominee. Hancock (who remained on active duty) and the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield, did not campaign directly, in keeping with the customs of that time, but campaigns were conducted by other party members, including Randall. Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest, Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield, but without success. Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes—including those of Pennsylvania. <b>Worse</b> <b>still</b> for Randall, Garfield's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House, meaning Randall's time as Speaker was at an end.|$|E

5|$|The British, however, did not {{accommodate}} Tirpitz's projections; {{from his}} appointment as the First Sea Lord in 1904, Fisher began a major {{reorganization of the}} Royal Navy. He concentrated British battleship strength in home waters, launched the Dreadnought revolution, and introduced rigorous training for the fleet personnel. In 1912, the British concluded a joint defense agreement with France that allowed the British to concentrate in the North Sea while the French defended the Mediterranean. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> the British began developing the strategy of the distant blockade of Germany starting in 1904; this removed the ability of German light craft to reduce Britain's superiority in numbers and essentially invalidated German naval planning {{before the start of}} World War I.|$|E
5|$|The name Great Northern Highway was gazetted on 10 March 1944, under section10 of the Land Act, 1933–1939. However, {{the highway}} was mostly {{a series of}} tracks through remote {{pastoral}} areas, with the sealed road ending just past the Wheatbelt town of Miling in 1950. Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round. The road was very dusty in the dry season, and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand, while other sections contained limestone outcrops that damaged tyres. During the wet season, when rivers flooded, sections of road were essentially bogs, or <b>worse</b> <b>still,</b> were completely washed away.|$|E
25|$|AWPD-42 {{called for}} 177 targets to be hit, {{covering}} seven strategic areas, {{with the highest}} priority being enemy aircraft production. Other priorities were submarine pens and building yards, transportation systems, electric power generation and distribution, the petroleum industry, aluminum refining and manufacture, and the synthetic rubber industry. Hansell considered it a mistake to remove electricity from the top priority, and <b>worse</b> <b>still</b> to place submarine pens there. Political expediency dictated the shift in target priorities, not pure strategic considerations.|$|E

25|$|The use of German paratroopers in Rotterdam, where Fallschirmjäger {{landed in}} a {{football}} stadium and then hijacked private transport {{to make their way}} to the city centre, demonstrated that nowhere was safe. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> the airborne abduction attempt on the Dutch royal family had failed only because the Dutch had possessed detailed plans of the operation well in advance. To counter the threat of an airborne assault, the Home Guard manned observation posts where soldiers spent every night until almost the end of the war continuously watching the skies, and initially armed with shotguns.|$|E
25|$|Pontesbury was abbot from 1488 {{to about}} 1521. His failings {{seem to have}} been mainly in {{management}} both of resources and people, revealed in visitations in 1518 and 1521. Because revenues were being misapplied, the buildings were in need of repair, particularly the infirmary, dormitory, chapter house, and library. Pontesbury seems to have complained about this to the bishop as if he himself were not responsible. Liturgical life was suffering because of lack of instruction for the novices. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> canons were visiting Shrewsbury, a woman of ill-repute was frequenting the abbey, and there were boys in the dormitory.|$|E
25|$|By early August 1693, {{the four}} {{warships}} were sailing down the River Thames {{en route to}} Spain's northern city of Corunna. The journey to Corunna should have taken two weeks, {{but for some reason}} the ships did not arrive in Spain until five months later. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> the necessary legal documents had apparently failed to arrive from Madrid, so the ships were forced to wait. As months passed and the documents still did not arrive, the sailors found themselves in an unenviable position: with no money to send home to support their families and unable to find alternate sources of employment, they had become virtual prisoners in Corunna.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} season Wheldon had {{a rather}} thinner year, averaging under 20 despite making exactly 100 against Hampshire {{and in the process}} sharing in a sixth-wicket stand of 186 with William Lowe. 1901 was <b>worse</b> <b>still,</b> as he did not pass 51 in 26 innings, and 1902 was little better, but he returned to form at last in 1903 with 969 runs – the most of his career – including 112 against Somerset. He also collected his only first-class stumping that year, against Yorkshire: Thomas Straw had been due to keep wicket, but was delayed in arriving at the ground, so Wheldon replaced him both in the team and behind the stumps.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} Nattapara in Hooghly district, a remote village in Balagarh block. There are some 100 dhakis in the village. There {{is not a}} single family without a dhaki. All used to go out to work as dhakis during the festive season, but now the demand has {{declined}} {{to such an extent that}} many are forced to give up the traditional profession and work as wage labourers. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> a dhaki from the village was contacted by a well-known Durga Puja in Kolkata for Rs. 2,000.

25|$|Since 2011, several medical {{journals}} have declared {{that they would}} cease publishing articles related to organ transplantation operations in China due to concerns about violations of medical ethics. The Journal of Clinical Investigation, a prestigious publication on biomedical research, declared that China’s use of organs from executed prisoners “violates basic human rights. It violates core ethical precepts of transplant medicine and medical ethics. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> {{some of those who}} are killed may be prisoners whose ‘crimes’ involve no more than holding certain political or spiritual beliefs.” The journal decided that it would no longer accept manuscripts on human organ transplantation “unless appropriate non-coerced consent of the donor is provided and substantiated.” A similar decision was taken by the American Journal of Transplantation (AJT).|$|E

25|$|The modern rifles, {{despite being}} {{among the best in}} Europe at the time, still had issues of their own: they were {{introduced}} only two years before the outbreak of the war, and as such many of the soldiers were not well-trained in their use. More importantly, the theoretical capabilities of the rifle often misled the Serbian officers, who still lacked experience with it, into ordering volleys from distances of half a mile or more, wasting precious ammunition for negligible results. Furthermore, the quantity of ammunition purchased was based on the consumption of bullets by the previous, much older and slower-firing rifles. The situation was made <b>worse</b> <b>still</b> by the contemporary Serbian tactics, which emphasized firepower and downplayed hand-to-hand fighting, which contributed to heavy casualties in the fight for Neškov Vis in defense of Pirot.|$|E
25|$|When melanomas {{have spread}} to the lymph nodes, {{one of the most}} {{important}} factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. Extent of malignancy within a node is also important; micrometastases in which malignancy is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macrometastases in which malignancy is clinically apparent (in some cases cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is <b>worse</b> <b>still.</b> In addition to these variables, expression levels and copy number variations of a number of relevant genes may be used to support assessment of malignant melanoma prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Although KFUO {{was well}} {{received}} and well supported, Maier envisioned a broader audience {{than could be}} reached by constructing local radio stations. By 1929, {{with the goal of}} spreading the gospel from coast-to-coast, he was investigating the logistics of network broadcasting. At this time, the major radio networks donated air time to the Federal Council of Churches, but no single denomination had ever produced a nationwide radio show dedicated to spreading the gospel. Having persuaded the Missouri Synod of the validity of this project, Maier contacted the National Broadcasting Company early in 1930. He was disappointed to find that NBC would not donate air time to the Lutheran Church, or any other single denomination. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> they would not even allow the Lutheran Church to purchase air time. NBC’s policy, Maier was told, precluded putting religious time on a commercial basis.|$|E

25|$|By now {{the team}} was {{struggling}} with injury. Daniel Sandell had been sidelined {{for most of the}} season with a knee injury. The victory against the Riders marked his comeback and was a personal triumph as he came off the bench to turn the game around with some deadly three-point shooting. However, other team members, including Aaron Drakeford and Kenny Langhorne, were carrying injuries and being asked to play big minutes due to a short bench. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> Heat Captain Mike Martin injured his knee and was eventually forced to shut down for the season, making just three appearances after January. In his absence, Julius Joseph stepped up his game and carried the team on several occasions, going on to be the team's top scorer for the season with 17.6 points per game. Player-coach Chad McKnight also stepped up his game, hitting 30 points or more in three consecutive games, including a career-high 39 points.|$|E
25|$|After a {{redesign}} in 1983, the VIC-II was {{encased in}} a plastic dual in-line package, which reduced costs substantially, {{but it did not}} totally eliminate the heat problem. Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a heat sink. To avoid extra cost, the metal RF shielding doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in Europe shipped with a cardboard RF shield, coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and <b>worse</b> <b>still</b> it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips. The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers. The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic dual in-line package, but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.|$|E
25|$|Another post-war {{activity}} was Huxley's {{attack on the}} Soviet politico-scientist Trofim Lysenko, who had espoused a Lamarckian heredity, made unscientific pronouncements on agriculture, used his influence to destroy classical genetics in Russia and to move genuine scientists from their posts. In 1940, the leading botanical geneticist Nikolai Vavilov was arrested, and Lysenko replaced him {{as director of the}} Institute of Genetics. In 1941, Vavilov was tried, found guilty of 'sabotage' and sentenced to death. Reprieved, he died in jail of malnutrition in 1943. Lysenko's machinations were the cause of his arrest. <b>Worse</b> <b>still,</b> Lysenkoism not only denied proven genetic facts, it stopped the artificial selection of crops on Darwinian principles. This {{may have contributed to the}} regular shortage of food from the Soviet agricultural system (Soviet famines). Huxley, who had twice visited the Soviet Union, was originally not anti-communist, but the ruthless adoption of Lysenkoism by Joseph Stalin ended his tolerant attitude. Lysenko ended his days in a Soviet mental hospital, and Vavilov's reputation was posthumously restored in 1955.|$|E
