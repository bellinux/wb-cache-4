40|$|In Czech Republic, {{two species}} of savory namely summer savory (Satureja hortensis L.) and <b>winter</b> <b>savory</b> (Satureja montana L.) are grown. Aim of this work is to {{summarize}} information about biological characteristics and requirements of both species on environmental conditions, production of these drugs in the Czech Republic and abroad, effective substances and their effects and possibilities of savory utilization in manufacturing industry and agriculture. Overground parts and leaves of savory plants are exploited like a spice or a drug that positively influences digestion, reduces flatulence and has also anti?inflammatory effects. Major components of volatile oil savory are phenolic compounds carvacrol and thymol. Just carvacrol and thymol are considered as allelopathic compounds of mint, sweet basil, caraway and others.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the studies carried out in our laboratories on supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of volatile oils from seven aromatic plants: pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.), fennel seeds (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), savory (Satureja fruticosa Béguinot), <b>winter</b> <b>savory</b> (Satureja montana L.), cotton lavender (Santolina chamaecyparisus) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris), is presented. A flow apparatus with a 1 L extractor and two 0. 27 L separators was built to perform studies at temperatures ranging from 298 to 353 K and pressures up to 30. 0 MPa. The best compromise between yield and composition compared with hydrodistillation (HD) was achieved selecting the optimum experimental conditions of extraction and fractionation. The major differences between HD and SFE oils {{is the presence of}} a small percentage of cuticular waxes and the relative amount of thymoquinone, an oxygenated monoterpene with important biological properties, which is present in the oils from thyme and <b>winter</b> <b>savory.</b> On the other hand, the modeling of our data on supercritical extraction of volatile oil from pennyroyal is discussed using Sovová’s models.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{capacity of}} some herbs used in dietology practice {{was determined by}} the DPPH free radical method, which was calibrated with ascorbic acid. Partially hydrophilic phenolic compounds are the most active compounds in plants, and therefore water was used as the extraction agent. Besides antioxidant capacity, the content of total phenolic compounds was also measured and a strong correlation between these two variables was found. The extracts of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.), oregano (Origanum vulgare L.), Greek oregano (Origanum heracleoticum L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.) and <b>winter</b> <b>savory</b> (Satureja montana L.) showed very significant activity. It was comparable with the activity of green tea in the case of oregano and peppermint. Lower activity was observed in the case of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), marjoram (Majorana hortensis), hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis L.), sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum), and lovage (Levisticum officinale Koch.). The inhibitory activity of the herb extracts was monitored also during the autooxidation of lard. Very high antioxidant capacity was observed mainly in sage samples, but also in marjoram and Greek oregano. The extracts of peppermint, oregano, rosemary, <b>winter</b> <b>savory,</b> lemon balm and hyssop showed middle activity comparable to that of alpha-tocopherol.

40|$|The {{phytochemical}} {{composition and}} the antibacterial {{activity of the}} essential oils obtained from the aerial parts of two Lamiaceae species, <b>winter</b> <b>savory</b> (Satureja montana L.) and wild savory (Satureja cuneifolia Ten.) were evaluated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the isolated oils resulted {{in the identification of}} twenty compounds in the oil of S. montana representing 97 % of the total oil and 25 compounds of S. cuneifolia, representing 80 % of the total oil. Carvacrol was the major constituent of the S. montana oil (45. 7 %). Other important compounds were the monoterpenic hydrocarbons p-cymene, -terpinene and the oxygenated compounds carvacrol methyl ether, borneol and thymol. Conversely, the oil of S. cuneifolia contained a low percentage of carvacrol and thymol. The major constituents of wild savory oil were sesquiterpenes -cubebene (8. 7 %), spathulenol, -caryophyllene, followed by the monoterpenic hydrocarbons limonene and -pinene. The screening of the antimicrobial activities of essential coils were individually evalated against nine microorganisms, using a disc diffusion metod.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{evaluated the}} antimicrobial {{effect of the}} <b>winter</b> <b>savory</b> (Satureja montana L.) essential oil (EO) against Clostridium perfringens type A (ATCC 3624) inoculated in mortadella-type sausages formulated with different levels of sodium nitrite (NaNO 2 : 0 ppm, 100 ppm and 200 ppm) in addition to EO at concentrations of 0. 0 %, 0. 78 %, 1. 56 % and 3. 125 % stored at 25 °C for 30 days. The EO extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (CG–MS) was tested in vitro using an agar well diffusion method for determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on C. perfringens. According to compositional analysis of the <b>winter</b> <b>savory</b> EO, 26 chemical compounds were identified, and the major constituents were thymol (28. 99 %), p-cymene (12. 00 %), linalool (11. 00 %) and carvacrol (10. 71 %). The results obtained showed that EO applied at a concentration of 1. 56 %, which {{was defined as the}} MIC, exhibited antimicrobial activity against C. perfringens in the in vitro assays, and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed structural damage and cell lysis of C. perfringens caused by EO treatment. A synergistic effect between NaNO 2 and EO was observed. In mortadella-type sausages formulated with 100 ppm of NaNO 2 and EO at all concentrations tested, the population of target microorganisms was reduced (p≤ 0. 05) compared to control samples during all storage period. This data suggests the potential combined use of savory EO and minimal amounts of the synthetic additive, NaNO 2 to control C. perfringens in mortadella, which goes according to current market trends, where consumers are requesting natural products...|$|E
