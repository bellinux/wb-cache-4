40|$|The {{analysis}} of the loading of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) appears important {{for the study of}} joint failure. Reconstruction and animation of the TMJ with real anatomic and kinematic data is currently the only method allowing a non invasive, in vivo, three-dimensional, dynamic, real-time quantitative insight into the relationship between the articulating surfaces of a joint. It consists of the software reconstruction of the joint anatomy from tomography data and the application to it of the corresponding real movement data recorded with a tracking device. Because of the physical properties of the TMJ soft tissues, the reduction of the joint space can indicate compressive loads during function. Analyses of the variation of the TMJ space in ten asymptomatic subjects during unilateral mastication showed a TMJ space that was significantly smaller during closing than during opening (p< 0. 05) and significantly smaller on the balancing than on the <b>working</b> <b>joint</b> (p< 0. 05).

40|$|A major {{design and}} {{analysis}} {{challenge for the}} JWST ISIM structure is thermal survivability of metal/composite bonded joints below the cryogenic temperature of 30 K (- 405 F). Current bonded joint concepts include internal invar plug fittings, external saddle titanium/invar fittings and composite gusset/clip joints all bonded to M 55 J/ 954 - 6 and T 300 / 954 - 6 hybrid composite tubes (75 mm square). Analytical experience and design work done on metal/composite bonded joints at temperatures below that of liquid nitrogen are limited and important analysis tools, material properties, and failure criteria for composites at cryogenic temperatures are sparse in the literature. Increasing this challenge is the difficulty in testing for these required tools and properties at cryogenic temperatures. To gain confidence in analyzing and designing the ISIM joints, a comprehensive joint development test program has been planned and is currently running. The test {{program is designed to}} produce required analytical tools and develop a composite failure criterion for bonded joint strengths at cryogenic temperatures. Finite element analysis is used to design simple test coupons that simulate anticipated stress states in the flight joints; subsequently the test results are used to correlate the analysis technique for the final design of the bonded joints.

40|$|Aim: Professional {{education}} {{is one of}} the key requirements of a new diabetes service. To facilitate this, a bespoke university work-based learning programme was developed following a primary care training needs analysis. Methods: Four teaching modules – injectable therapy initiation, injectable therapy management, foot screening and caring for people with Type 2 diabetes – were developed by the University of Huddersfield in collaboration with local specialist diabetes teams. The University hosts the training and provides the infrastructure. A work-based learning approach to facilitate education in practice is supported by mentors from specialist services. Assessment of competence is measured against a validated tool and clinical management plans. Results: Nine practitioners attended the initial ‘Assessing for and Initiating Injectable TherapiesModule’ – six have completed. Nineteen practitioners attended the first‘ManagingType 2 Diabetes Programme’ and 22 practitioners have attended a ‘Managing Injectable Therapies Module’ – nine have completed. Ninety practitioners applied for the foot care programme. Thirty-eight practitioners attended two courses and are undergoing podiatry mentorship assessment. Conclusions: Collaborative working to develop bespoke courses ensures a consistent approach which is sensitive to local needs and supports local pathways. Student evaluations of the training programme are positive, particularly mentorship by specialist staff in practice which has fostered a climate of closer collaborative <b>working.</b> <b>Joint</b> working with pharmaceutical partners has assisted in course promotion and post course support.

Diagonalization implies that at each fixed time instant the equation at each joint is decoupled {{from all of}} the other joint equations. The equation involves two important variables: avector of total joint rotational rates and a corresponding vector of <b>working</b> <b>joint</b> moments. The nonlinear Coriolis term C (;) depends on the joint angles and the rates. The total joint rates are related to the relative joint-angle rates _ by a linear spatial operator m () mechanized byabase-to-tip spatially recursive algorithm. The total rate (k) at a given joint k re ects, in a very unique sense the total rotational velocity about the joint, and includes the combined effects from all the links between joint k and the manipulator base. This di ers from the more traditional joint-angle rates _ which only reflect the relative, as opposed to total, rotation about the joints. Similarly, the working moments = `T are related to the applied moments T by the spatial operator ` () = m, 1 () mechanized by a tip-to-base spatially recursive algorithm. The working moment (k) at a given joint k is that part of the applied moment T (k) which does actual mechanical work, while its other part affects only the non-working internal constraint forces. The diagonal equations are obtained by using the recently developed [1] mass matrix factorization M () =m () m () of the system Lagrangian. The diagonalization is achieved in velocity space. This means that only the velocity variables _ are replaced with the new variables, while the original configuration variables are retained. The new joint velocity variables can be viewed as time-derivatives of Lagrangian quasi-coordinates, similar to those of classical mechanics. The velocity transformations are shown to always exist for tree-like, articulated multibody systems, and they can be readily implemented using the spatially recursive ltering and smoothing methods [1, 4, 7] advanced by the authors in recent years...|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} construction practices, {{a longitudinal}} joint is sawed in a PCC (Portland Cement Concrete) pavement to control concrete shrinkage cracking between two lanes of traffic. Sawing a joint in hardened concrete {{is an expensive}} and time consuming operation. The longitudinal joint is not a <b>working</b> <b>joint</b> (in comparison to a transverse joint) as it is typically tied with a tie bar at 30 inch spacing. The open joint reservoir, left by the saw blade, typically is filled or sealed with a durable crack sealant to keep incompressibles and water from getting into the joint reservoir. An experimental joint forming knife has been developed. It is installed under the paving machine to form the longitudinal joint in the wet concrete {{as a part of}} the paving process. Through this research method, forming a very narrow longitudinal joint during the paving process, two conventional paving operations can be eliminated. Joint forming eliminates the need of the joint sawing operation in the hard concrete, and as the joint that is formed does not leave a wide-open reservoir, but only a hairline crack, it does not need the joint filling or sealing operation. Therefore, the two conventional longitudinal joint sawing and sealing operations are both being eliminated by this innovation. A laboratory scale prototype joint forming knife was built and tested, initially forming joints in small concrete beams. The results were positive so the method was proposed for field testing. Initial field tests were done in the construction season of 2001, limited to one paving contractor. A number of modifications were made to the knife throughout the field tests. About 3000 feet of longitudinal joint was formed in 2001. Additional testing was done in the 2002 construction season, working with the same contractor. About 150, 000 feet of longitudinal joint was formed in 2002. Evaluations of the formed joints were done to determine longitudinal joint hairline crack development rate and appearance. Additional tests will be done in the next construction season to improve or perfect the longitudinal joint forming technique...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} set in the context of government-led changes to working {{practice}} for health professionals in the UK. Policy documents relating to the National Health Service advocate that care should be increasingly delivered by <b>joint</b> <b>working,</b> however an examination of the literature suggests that this concept is currently unclear. This investigation considers one particular area of healthcare, the delivery of stroke services, where provision has been reorganised into specialist stroke units, and where teamworking is being associated with improved patient outcomes. The study aimed to analyse the meaning of <b>joint</b> <b>working</b> by exploring the elements of commonly-used terms such as teamworking and interprofessional working, seeking a greater understanding of the process of <b>joint</b> <b>working</b> by exploring staff and service user perspectives. A qualitative methodology was employed, using a multiple case study approach and data generation methods of fieldwork observation, interviews and visual imagery. Three case studies were carried out, examining services at different points along a stroke care pathway. The findings describe a framework of <b>joint</b> <b>working</b> practice in healthcare consisting of twenty-six elements within domains relating to: the organisation; team process; the individual; professionalism; communication, and the service user. It is proposed that by examining these elements, different types of practice can be distinguished, which can be termed teamworking and interprofessional network working. The investigation suggests that these different types of <b>joint</b> <b>working</b> need to be fully considered in evaluations of practice, {{if there is to be}} a greater understanding of links between changing staff working practices and patient care. It also highlights the importance of the interrelationship between elements identified, suggesting that attention to single aspects of practice without considering the individuals and context is unlikely to achieve the changes sought. The central purpose of the investigation was to understand <b>joint</b> <b>working</b> practice, however the findings also have application to the education of healthcare students. The study describes a proposed transition from network working to teamworking associated with experience, discusses the importance of professionalism, and considers changing professional role. Whilst focussing on professional perspectives, the work offers suggestions for further work on service user involvement, and also considers how the findings may offer additional insights into perceived benefits and losses associated with <b>joint</b> <b>working...</b>|$|R

40|$|Responsible and {{responsive}} government depends on effective accountability – {{at all levels}} within the state. To this end, democratic governments have typically established strong vertical or hierarchical accountability relationships. New Zealand has been no exception. Indeed, the state sector reforms introduced in the late 1980 s emphasised formal, vertical, straight-line accountability. Yet {{some of the work}} of government involves collaboration or <b>joint</b> <b>working</b> across multiple agencies. This implies the need for shared and horizontal accountability. It also casts doubt on the wisdom of relying too heavily on vertical accountability, not least because this may undermine <b>joint</b> <b>working.</b> How, then, should accountabilities be managed in the context of shared or <b>joint</b> <b>working</b> across agencies and what principles and considerations should guide policy makers when designing such accountability arrangements? With these issues in mind, this paper begins with an exploration of certain key concepts – vertical and horizontal accountability, responsibility, answerability and blame – and considers the limitations of vertical models of accountability within a Westminster-type parliamentary democracy. It then explores the nature and problems associated with <b>joint</b> <b>working</b> in the state sector where accountability for particular activities or outcomes is shared between two or more organisations.
