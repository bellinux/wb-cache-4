5|$|Before <b>we</b> <b>see</b> a {{full shot}} of Tracy, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> {{individual}} shots of her upraised {{right and left}} arms. This is reminiscent of our first views of Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford) in the 1932 film Rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons <b>we</b> <b>see</b> were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations <b>we</b> <b>see</b> are not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E

5|$|Burne-Jones's first sketch in oils {{dates from}} this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College {{the first of}} what was to be an immense series of {{cartoons}} for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the Prioress's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with endless subjects. Thus early, therefore, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the artist busy in all the various fields in which he was to labour.|$|E
5|$|Despite this trauma, Quatermass {{continues}} with his space programme, {{now called the}} British Rocket Group, and by Quatermass II (1955) is actively planning the establishment of Moon bases. In this serial <b>we</b> <b>see</b> his daughter, Paula Quatermass, who works as an assistant at the Rocket Group, {{but there is no}} sign of a wife or other children. In the fourth episode of the serial he mentions that he never reached his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, tying in with The Quatermass Memoirs later assertion of his wife's early death.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, Triassic and Jurassic (300 to 150 Mya), further {{episodes of}} desertification, {{subsidence}} and uplift occurred and Wales was alternately inundated {{by the sea}} and raised above it. By the Cretaceous (140 to 70 Mya), Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene (2.5 Mya to recent), it underwent several exceptionally cold periods, the ice ages. The mountains <b>we</b> <b>see</b> today largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation.|$|E

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features <b>we</b> <b>see</b> today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|Gore {{then begins}} his slide show on Global Warming; a {{comprehensive}} presentation replete with detailed graphs, flow charts and stark visuals. Gore shows off several {{photographs of the}} Earth taken from multiple space missions, as Earthrise and The Blue Marble. Gore notes that these photos dramatically transformed the way <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the Earth, helping spark modern environmentalism.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, the 9/11 Commission {{concluded}} that [...] "to date <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship.

60|$|Later <b>we</b> shall <b>see</b> {{this same}} Lucrezia, her illegitimacy notwithstanding, married into the noble House of Este and seated upon {{the throne of}} Ferrara. And before then <b>we</b> shall have <b>seen</b> the bastard Cesare married to a {{daughter}} of the royal House of Navarre. Already <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> the bastard Francesco Cibo take to wife {{the daughter of the}} great Lorenzo de'Medici, and <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> the bastard Girolamo Riario married to Caterina Sforza--a natural daughter of the ducal House of Milan--and <b>we</b> have <b>seen</b> the pair installed in the Tyranny of Imola and Forli. A score of other instances might be added; but these should suffice.|$|R

5|$|In the 12th century {{religious}} hermits started inhabiting {{the caves}} on Mount Carmel, {{and in the}} 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites. Under Muslim rule, the church which they had built on Mount Carmel {{was turned into a}} mosque, later becoming a hospital. In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery. The altar of the church as <b>we</b> <b>see</b> it today, stands over a cave associated with Prophet Elijah.|$|E
5|$|In {{the darkest}} night of hate and {{intolerance}} <b>we</b> <b>see</b> impossible love stories conquering what our governments and societies declare is legally 'allowed' to be love... It is for love that transcends the romantic conception {{of man and}} woman and stretches out into the impossibilities of the cosmos. It leaves room for failure but hopes for success.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> have <b>seen</b> railway trains {{rushing into}} {{each other at the}} rate of sixty miles an hour. <b>We</b> have <b>seen</b> houses blown up by {{dynamite}} two hundred feet into the air. <b>We</b> have <b>seen</b> the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the destruction of Pompeii, and the return of the British army from Egypt in one [...] "set" [...] each.|$|R

5|$|Nonviolent Communication (abbreviated NVC, {{also called}} Compassionate Communication or Collaborative Communication) is a {{communication}} process developed by Marshall Rosenberg {{beginning in the}} 1960s. It focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), empathy (defined as {{an understanding of the}} heart in which <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the beauty in the other person), and honest self-expression (defined as expressing oneself authentically {{in a way that is}} likely to inspire compassion in others).|$|E
5|$|One {{of the men}} {{helps the}} girl up, she spreads her wings and gives them a {{grateful}} smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is gone drifting upward into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. From a bird's-eye view, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> {{the shape of the}} car veering off the road and slowing to a stop in the grass.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the rest}} of the 20th century many {{recreation}} facilities were incorporated into the park. Parkland was levelled for football pitches in 1947. A second bowling green in the Recreation Grounds was laid out by the City Council in 1962 to join the green in the Museum Gardens laid in 1922. In 1972 the two fish ponds were reshaped and deepened to leave one pool (Beacon Pool) <b>we</b> <b>see</b> today. The golf course was laid out and opened in 1973.|$|E

5|$|The outer, {{irregular}} moons {{are thought}} to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit. Many are believed to have broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons <b>we</b> <b>see</b> today.|$|E
5|$|The {{progenitors}} of the Labrador retriever {{were actually}} from Newfoundland and Labrador exceptionally, the breed {{known as the}} Newfoundland was created near {{the same time in}} Labrador. The two breeds' names and origins were mixed once moved into England and the Americas. The dog from Labrador became the large, long-furred dog <b>we</b> <b>see</b> and know today, and the dog from Newfoundland became the Labrador.|$|E
5|$|The visible {{surface of}} the Sun, the {{photosphere}}, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, {{and almost all of}} its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light <b>we</b> <b>see</b> is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.|$|E
