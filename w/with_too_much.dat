Gruppe (3rd group) of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG26—26th Fighter Wing) from Major Josef Priller.

5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> confidence, since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt formed from the primordial solar nebula {{as a group}} of planetesimals. Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the {{asteroid belt}}'s original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.|$|E

25|$|In general, the stirrup {{is placed}} on the ball of the foot, {{allowing}} the rider to let his weight flow down the back of the leg into the heel by way of the flexible ankle.

25|$|Sunlight: Trees {{generally}} {{require a}} good deal of sun, and most bonsai need direct sunlight during the growing season to thrive. Some shade-tolerant species of bonsai cannot thrive <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> direct sunlight, however, and it is the grower's role to site the bonsai specimens to provide the correct lighting for each type. Most bonsai will be located in an area that gets several hours of direct daylight. Shade-tolerant bonsai can be placed behind barriers (walls, buildings), sited on shaded benches or stands, or shaded by netting to reduce the impact of direct sunlight.|$|E
25|$|The acidity in wine is an {{important}} component in the quality and taste of the wine. It adds a sharpness to the flavors and is detected most readily by a prickling sensation {{on the sides of the}} tongue and a mouth-watering aftertaste. Of particular importance is the balance of acidity versus the sweetness of the wine (the leftover residual sugar) and the more bitter components of the wine (most notably tannins but also includes other phenolics). A wine <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> acidity will taste excessively sour and sharp. A wine with too little acidity will taste flabby and flat, with less defined flavors.|$|E
25|$|Russia's aim of {{finishing}} the constellation in 2010 suffered a setback when a December 2010 launch of three GLONASS-M satellites failed. The Proton-M itself performed flawlessly, but the upper stage Blok DM3 (a new version {{which was to}} make its maiden flight) was loaded <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fuel due to a sensor failure. As a result, the upper stage and the three satellites crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Kommersant estimated the launch failure cost up to $160 million. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a full audit of the entire $2 billion program and {{an investigation into the}} failure.|$|E

25|$|In August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for Prague, {{to become}} the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux Henri d'Artois (1820–1883), the exiled Crown Prince and {{grandson}} of Charles X. As a professor of the École Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding {{that only a few}} of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> material. The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} {{launched}} by ND and Rolf Skår in 1987 {{as a way}} to utilize a tax break through investing in regional areas. He received support from Minister Finn Kristensen, although the project met with opposition from other government agencies and the data industry. The go-ahead was given in May 1988 and the centers opened in 1989, with the first on 31 January. The project costs the government 300 million Norwegian krone (NOK), but two government reports found the project to be a failure. The centers were established <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> capacity and were unable to cover their operating costs through securing sufficient projects.|$|E
25|$|Shells are carved {{soon after}} the tree is felled, while the wood still retains some {{moisture}} and is softer. This makes the wood easier to carve and avoids radial splits that tend to develop in logs that are allowed to dry naturally. Carvers use simple hand tools, such as axes, adzes, spoke shaves, and rasps to shape the shell. A well-carved djembe {{does not have a}} smooth interior but a texture of scallops or shallow grooves that influence the sound of the instrument. (Djembes with smooth interiors have tones and slaps <b>with</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> sustain.) Often, interior grooves form a spiral pattern, which indicates a carver taking pride in his work.|$|E

25|$|After {{attempting}} {{to develop his}} own version of the proposed show called House of Mystery, Barbera, who handled the development and sale of Hanna-Barbera shows while Hanna handled production, passed the task along to story writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears and artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their original treatment, based in part on The Archie Show, was titled Mysteries Five and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, Linda's brother W.W. and their bongo-playing dog, Too Much, who were all members of the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty dog. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead <b>with</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Much</b> being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.|$|E
