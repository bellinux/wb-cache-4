25|$|From 1980 to 1985, over 800 {{patients}} {{were treated with}} automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators. By 1988, nearly 5,000 people had benefited from the device. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has estimated that 416,000 AICDs <b>were</b> <b>implanted</b> between 1990 and 2002 in the United States. The device is now implanted in over 300,000 people worldwide and is 99% effective in correcting heart rhythm abnormalities and cardiac arrest. United States Vice President Dick Cheney received an implantable defibrillator in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of these {{external}} defeats, the Guangxu Emperor initiated the Hundred Days' Reform of 1898. Newer, more radical advisers such as Kang Youwei were given positions of influence. The emperor issued a series of edicts and plans were made to reorganize the bureaucracy, restructure the school system, and appoint new officials. Opposition from the bureaucracy was immediate and intense. Although she {{had been involved in}} the initial reforms, the empress dowager stepped in to call them off, arrested and executed several reformers, and took over day-to-day control of policy. Yet many of the plans stayed in place, and the goals of reform <b>were</b> <b>implanted.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{two were}} the result of an {{experiment}} in genetic recombination in which two parent cells were separated into complementary haploid gametes, and recombined into two embryos. The resulting zygotes <b>were</b> <b>implanted</b> in a woman and gestated by her, with the result that although both have the same mother and genetic parents, they are no more closely related genetically than any two people taken at random. They have been prevented from sexual relations by a chastity belt; but having confirmed that there is no risk of genetic disease in their offspring (described as the only valid reason against incest), Lazarus solemnizes their marriage and later establishes them as the owners and operators of a thriving business. At the end of the story, he reveals a belief that they were his own descendants, from an earlier period when he had been a slave on the same planet.|$|E
50|$|The Heartware HVAD works {{similarly}} to the VentrAssistâ€”albeit much smaller and not requiring an abdominal pocket to <b>be</b> <b>implanted</b> into.

50|$|An eyeball implant, or extraocular <b>implant,</b> <b>is</b> a {{cosmetic}} <b>implant</b> involving a {{tiny piece of}} decorative jewelry which <b>is</b> <b>implanted</b> within the superficial, interpalpebral conjunctiva of the human eye (the covering of {{the white of the}} eye, in the area that is normally visible between the eyelids). Such <b>implants</b> <b>are</b> illegal in the United States.|$|R
25|$|Cochlear {{implantation}} restores {{access to}} the acoustic signal in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. The acoustic information conveyed by an implant is usually sufficient for implant users to properly recognize speech of people they know even without visual clues. For cochlear implant users, {{it is more difficult}} to understand unknown speakers and sounds. The perceptual abilities of children that received an implant after the age of two are significantly better than of those who <b>were</b> <b>implanted</b> in adulthood. A number of factors have been shown to influence perceptual performance, specifically: duration of deafness prior to implantation, age of onset of deafness, age at implantation (such age effects {{may be related to the}} Critical period hypothesis) and the duration of using an implant. There are differences between children with congenital and acquired deafness. Postlingually deaf children have better results than the prelingually deaf and adapt to a cochlear implant faster. In both children with cochlear implants and normal hearing, vowels and voice onset time becomes prevalent in development before the ability to discriminate the place of articulation. Several months following implantation, children with cochlear implants can normalize speech perception.|$|E
25|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is {{a widely}} used {{biomaterial}} {{as a result of}} its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation. HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin <b>were</b> <b>implanted</b> into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension. These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Taylor re-appears at Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones) and Nick Marone's (Jack Wagner) wedding {{ceremony}} and is soon {{revealed to be}} alive. She {{had been removed from}} the hospital by Prince Omar after her apparent death and was kept alive in a coma before waking up. Taylor learns that Ridge is now married to Brooke and they share a son together. Ridge cannot decide between the two women, but after Stephanie fakes a heart attack and convinces him to choose Taylor, they renew their vows. Stephanie's lie is revealed; Taylor and Ridge work on their marriage, but after she kisses Hector Ramirez (Lorenzo Lamas) and confesses her infidelity with James years ago to Ridge, they divorce. Taylor becomes an alcoholic and while driving one night to Phoebe who is stranded on PCH, she accidentally hits Thorne's wife Darla Forrester (Schae Harrison) with her car. Darla dies from her injuries. Taylor bonds with Thorne and his daughter Aly, and they become involved. Taylor confesses the truth about Darla's accident and is sent to prison but is later released due to her death being accidental. Thorne and Taylor break off their engagement and she begins a relationship with sailor Nick Marone (Jack Wagner); they marry and she becomes pregnant with his child through in vitro fertilization. However after the birth of their son Jack Marone, it is revealed through a lab mix up that Brooke's eggs <b>were</b> <b>implanted</b> in Taylor. After overcoming alcoholism and depression again, Taylor starts a romantic relationship with Brooke's son Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder). She divorces Nick and decides to hand Jack over to Brooke. Taylor leaves Rick due to her feelings for Ridge. In late 2008, Phoebe (MacKenzie Mauzy) is killed in a car accident, where Rick had been driving.|$|E

500|$|Thus began {{what was}} {{described}} by John Morocco as [...] "the most concentrated application of aerial firepower {{in the history of}} warfare". On an average day 350 tactical fighter-bombers, 60 B-52s, and 30 light observation or reconnaissance aircraft operated in the skies near the base. Westmoreland had already ordered the nascent Igloo White operation to assist in the Marine defense. On 22 January, the first sensor drops took place and, {{by the end of the}} month, 316 acoustic and seismic sensors had been dropped in 44 strings. The sensors <b>were</b> <b>implanted</b> by a special naval squadron, Observation Squadron Sixty-Seven, VO-67.

500|$|After Dolly {{the sheep}} was cloned in 1996, {{scientists}} {{had managed to}} clone numerous other animals, including cats, cows, gaur, horses, mice, mules, pigs, rabbits and rats but {{had been unable to}} successfully clone a dog due to the problematic task of maturing a canine ovum in an artificial environment. After several failed attempts by other scientists, Woo Suk Hwang, a lead researcher at Seoul National University, were able to successfully create a clone using tissue from the ear of a 3-year-old Afghan hound. 123 surrogate mothers were used to carry the embryos, of which 1,095 <b>were</b> <b>implanted,</b> the procedure resulted in only three pregnancies; one resulted in a miscarriage, the other pup was born successfully but died of pneumonia three weeks after birth, the successful clone was carried by a Labrador Retriever.

2500|$|Beginning in 1990, Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Taylor {{would fight}} over Ridge's affection for years. In 2013, Tylo {{revealed}} {{that she and}} Lang would distance themselves from each other to make their on-screen rivalry convincing: [...] "We cannot look comfortable with each other. [...] We need to look like {{we are in a}} place of competition." [...] In 2007, Brooke and Taylor's rivalry intensified when Brooke begins pursuing Nick Marone (Jack Wagner) while he is married to Taylor. Soap Opera Digest noted that the women were [...] "crossing swords once again for the same man". Tylo observed that both Brooke and Taylor were being written with [...] "more intelligence" [...] this time around, and was happy in revisiting the rivalry between them as [...] "long as it wasn't over Ridge" [...] again. Taylor becomes pregnant with Nick's child through In vitro fertilisation (IVF), having struggled to conceive a child, and gives birth to Jack Marone. However, because of a mistake that Bridget had made in the lab, it was Brooke's eggs which <b>were</b> <b>implanted</b> in Taylor and not the donor's; making Brooke Jack's biological mother. She fears that her baby will be drawn to Brooke. Taylor begins drinking and becomes mentally unstable, with her parental rights being taken away. The scenes where Taylor loses custody and suffers a breakdown in court were filmed shortly after Tylo's own son died. Tylo told On-Air On-Soaps: [...] "I got a lot of emails from people worrying. They would go from worrying about me to saying, 'Was I okay with those scenes and after them?'" [...] The actress said that she tapped into her own tragedy when portraying those scenes, and allowed herself to feel the [...] "feeling that will never go away which is, 'It's not fair'". Taylor is soon awarded joint custody of Jack when she passes a mental health evaluation. However, she cannot bond with him and ends up giving Jack to Brooke in the end.|$|E
