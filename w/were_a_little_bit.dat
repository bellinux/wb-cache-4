500|$|Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk {{praised the}} acting, Feldman's {{screenplay}} and Donaldson's direction. He concluded {{by saying that}} Species makes for [...] "a very good time for the genre fans." [...] Mick LaSalle, writing for San Francisco Chronicle, was notedly less enthusiastic, quipping that if [...] "Species <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> worse, {{it would have a}} shot at becoming a camp classic." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Peter Rainer described Species as [...] "a pretty good Boo! movie", finding it an entertaining thriller while unoriginal and with ineffective tonal shifts.|$|E

His counterpart, Oxford cox Pearce, was jubilant: [...] "It was awesome. I didn't expect it {{work out that way}} but it was great. [...] All along we were the better crew. The bookies just got it wrong." [...] Cambridge Boat Club president Edwards said [...] "They handled the conditions better than us and that was it ... There was no more we could have done." [...] Oxford's president Barney Williams said [...] "We were pushed really hard" [...] while his French crew-mate Ripoll claimed [...] "the key moment was along the island, in a washing machine".|$|E
500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E

500|$|Overall, Yield {{resembles the}} {{straightforward}} rock {{approach of the}} band's early work. Gossard said, [...] "The songs <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more structured. I don't {{know if it was}} poppier, but it seemed more professional." [...] O'Brien noted that during the Yield sessions, the band made a conscious effort to create more accessible songs. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has [...] "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten." [...] "Given to Fly", the album's first single, was noted for its similarity to Led Zeppelin's [...] "Going to California" [...] from the 1971 album, Led Zeppelin IV.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. held test {{screenings}} {{and audience}} comments were largely mixed. The studio suggested re-shoots, but the Coens, who held final cut privilege, refused {{because they were}} very nervous working with their biggest budget to date and were eager for mainstream success. The producers eventually added footage that had been cut and also shot minor pick-ups for the ending. Variety magazine claimed that the pick-ups were done {{to try to save}} the film because Warner feared {{it was going to be}} a box office bomb. Joel Coen addressed the issue in an interview: [...] "First of all, they weren't reshoots. They <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of additional footage. We wanted to shoot a fight scene at the end of the movie. It was the product of something we discovered editing the movie, not previewing it. We've done additional shooting on every movie, so it's normal." ...|$|E
500|$|Hurley had {{objected to}} the violent and gory scenes seen in the first-season episode [...] "", written by Tracy Tormé, and Tormé {{continued}} to feel alienated by Hurley. Tormé stepped down from his role as co-executive story editor, taking credit instead as a creative consultant. Following Hurley's modifications to Tormé's scripts for [...] "The Royale" [...] and [...] "", Tormé elected to be credited under a pseudonym only. At one point, Roddenberry had thought that Tormé would become eventual showrunner, but the writer left due to the re-writes required under Hurley's tenure. Hannah Louise Shearer also left the team between seasons, due to differences with Hurley, but contributed stories in later seasons. Other writers joined the team during the second season, including The Tears of the Singers author Melinda M. Snodgrass, who sold the script for [...] "". Hans Beimler and Richard Manning were hired in the newly created positions of executive script consultants. They had both been story editors for the final eight episodes of the first season. Snodgrass later explained that, [...] "Once I came on board there suddenly seemed to be this climate of discussion among the writers about {{what we wanted to}} do with the show. My impression was that this was a new phenomenon. We <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more on the same wavelength." [...] She was hired as a story editor following the submission of her first episode, alongside Leonard Mlodinow and Scott Rubenstein. The other two editors left after four more episodes, with Snodgrass remaining as the sole story editor for the rest of the season.|$|E

2500|$|Former WCW and WWF rival Sean Waltman, in a 2014 interview, said of Benoit: [...] "He was a {{pleasant}} guy, but always had a darkness about him... a sadness, or something". Waltman added that Benoit had a bleak sense of humor, finding amusement in [...] "things that <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> bent." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{translating}} {{the show to}} animation, the characters' designs were solidified. [...] "Jim Jinkins is an illustrator and not an animator, so his initial drawings <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more of a wiggly line," [...] said Yvette Kaplan. The designs were inspired by Jinkins' period working for R. O. Blechman at the Ink Tank, incorporating Blechman's nervous line quality.|$|E
2500|$|With {{writing and}} {{recording}} commencing {{almost immediately after}} finishing touring, the band were inspired to capture the energy of their live performances. Despite having previously received acclaim for redefining their sound record-to-record, the band felt little pressure to repeat this, Brian Lane simple stated that as with previous recording sessions, the band had become bored of performing their older material, and would naturally look to write and record songs that were different. Guitarist Vincent Accardi commented that [...] "after The Devil and God, the structures of songs were a bit more complex and things <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> delicate. I think we all just had a great urge to try to write simple, loud rock songs and just get the point across immediately".|$|E

We were perfectly legal beforehand, which obviously or we wouldn’t have qualified.

Dr David Schwartz, writing for Cabaret Hotline Online said in his review, [...] "It is hard to describe her to you without sounding as if I <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> insane. Her performance provided me {{with one of those}} life-changing and totally defining cabaret experiences that was instantly committed to memory, along with my first exposure to Mabel Mercer, Julie Wilson, Sarah Vaughan, Sylvia Syms {{and a host of other}} greats. Gery Scott's set represented that rare moment in cabaret when the singer and her song are indistinguishable. This sort of alchemy comes only after many years; to witness it is to be blessed". [...] She was also special guest in a 2003 Sondheim review, and two fund raising concerts for fellow performers in 2004.|$|E

60|$|Alvina {{hurried to}} bed and slept well. And {{the next day the}} same, she was all icy pleasantness. The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> put out by her.

And she knew they were relieved that she had gone.|$|E
60|$|It was {{becoming}} cold. The cavalcade {{fell into a}} trot, Mr. May shaking rather badly. Ciccio halted, rested his lance against a lamp-post, switched his green blanket from beneath him, flung it round him as he sat, and darted off. They had all disappeared over the brow of Lumley Hill, descending. He was gone too. In the wintry twilight the crowd began, lingeringly, to turn away. And in some strange way, it manifested its disapproval of the spectacle: as grown-up men and women, they <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> insulted by such a show. It was an anachronism. They wanted a direct appeal to the mind. Miss Pinnegar expressed it.|$|E

I suppose that they think it proves they are not so very old, after all. And certainly he isn't too old to marry. If he were wise--which he probably isn't, if he's like other men in such matters--there wouldn't be any question about Mrs. Bowen. Pretty creature! And so much sense! Too much for him. Ah, my dear, how we are wasted upon that sex!" ...|$|E

[...] "Old Mr. Mink, the ever-so-great-grandfather of Billy Mink, couldn't do all the things that Billy can now. For instance, he couldn't swim. But he could do a great many things, and he was very smart. It has always run in the Mink family to be smart. He dressed very much as Billy does now, except that he didn't have the waterproof coat that Billy has. And he was a great traveler, just as Billy is. Everybody smaller than he and some who were bigger <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> afraid of old Mr. Mink, for he was quite as sly and cunning as Mr. Fox, and it was suspected that he knew a great deal more than he ever admitted about eggs that were stolen and nests that were broken up, and other strange things that happened in the Green Forest and along the Laughing Brook. But he never was caught doing anything wrong and always seemed to be minding his own business, so, all things considered, he got along very well with his neighbors.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we win {{you can do}} {{what you}} please," [...] said Lutyens, with a smile, as he slipped the loop of his stick over his wrist, and wheeled to canter to his place. The Archangels' ponies <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> above {{themselves}} on account of the many-coloured crowd so close to the ground. Their riders were excellent players, but they were a team of crack players instead of a crack team; and that made {{all the difference in the}} world. They honestly meant to play together, but it is very hard for four men, each the best of the team he is picked from, to remember that in polo no brilliancy in hitting or riding makes up for playing alone. Their captain shouted his orders to them by name, and it is a curious thing that if you call his name aloud in public after an Englishman you make him hot and fretty. Lutyens said nothing to his men, because it had all been said before. He pulled up Shiraz, for he was playing [...] "back," [...] to guard the goal. Powell on Polaris was half-back, and Macnamara and Hughes on Corks and Kittiwynk were forwards. The tough, bamboo ball was set in the middle of the ground, one hundred and fifty yards from the ends, and Hughes crossed sticks, heads up, with the Captain of the Archangels, who saw fit to play forward; that is a place from which you cannot easily control your team. The little click as the cane-shafts met was heard all over the ground, and then Hughes made some sort of quick wrist-stroke that just dribbled the ball a few yards. Kittiwynk knew that stroke of old, and followed as a cat follows a mouse. While the Captain of the Archangels was wrenching his pony round, Hughes struck with all his strength, and next instant Kittiwynk was away, Corks following close behind her, their little feet pattering like raindrops on glass.|$|E
