25|$|The {{roll test}} can {{determine}} whether the horizontal semicircular canal is involved. The roll test requires the patient {{to be in a}} supine position with their head in 30° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, and checks for vertigo and nystagmus. This is followed by gently bringing the head back to the starting position. The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side, and checks again for vertigo and nystagmus. In this roll test, the patient may experience vertigo and nystagmus on both sides, but rotating towards the affected side will trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated towards the affected side, the nystagmus <b>will</b> <b>beat</b> towards the ground and be more intense.|$|E

25|$|Project Plowshare “was named {{directly}} from the Bible itself, specifically Micah 4:3, which states that God <b>will</b> <b>beat</b> swords into ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks, so that no country could lift up weapons against another”. Proposed uses included widening the Panama Canal, constructing a new sea-level waterway through Nicaragua nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems. Other proposals involved blasting underground caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage. It was proposed to plant underground atomic bombs to extract shale oil in eastern Utah and western Colorado. Serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations. One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground aquifers in Arizona. Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of California's Sacramento Valley for a water transport project. However, there were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear explosions. Consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, tritium-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, {{due in large part}} to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.|$|E

Nevertheless, the beating continued and Alekry reported that a police officer told him: [...] "If you bleed in my chair with your dirty blood I <b>will</b> <b>beat</b> you to death!" [...] When an ambulance arrived, police allowed him and three other detainees to be taken to hospital.

First played in 1907, it is a game between the [...] "Goats" [...] (the bottom half of the senior (Firstie) class academically), and the [...] "Engineers" [...] (the top half). The game is played with full pads and helmets using eight-man football rules. The location has changed over the years, with recent venues being Shea Stadium, Michie Stadium, and Daly Field. Legend states that Army <b>will</b> <b>beat</b> Navy if the goats win, and the opposite if the engineers win. In recent years, female cadets have begun playing a flag football contest, so there are now two Goat-Engineer games, played consecutively the same night.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{have criticized}} the game for its high and unforgiving {{difficulty}} level especially late in the game, {{and it has been}} considered an example of [...] "Nintendo Hard" [...] video games. A review from 1UP.com referred to the latter levels as an [...] "unfair display of intentional cheapness". In his review of the Virtual Console version, GameSpot's Alex Navarro said [...] "the game <b>will</b> <b>beat</b> you to a pulp" [...] and that it [...] "assaults you time and time again with its punishing difficulty, insidiously placed enemies, and rage-inducing boss fights". According to his review, the game starts easy, but the difficulty starts to increase halfway through the second Act and continues through the sixth Act; Navarro describes the sixth Act's difficulty as being [...] "one of the bottom levels of gaming hell". IGN said that this game {{was one of the most}} difficult video games of all time, setting the trend for the rest of the series; however, they pointed out that its difficulty and graphics are [...] "defining characteristics [...] have carried over through the years into modern day [...] Gaiden sequels". ScrewAttack listed the game as the seventh hardest title in the NES library.|$|E
500|$|Bond {{is on an}} {{assignment}} in the Seychelles Islands; through Fidele Barbey, his influential and well-connected local contact, he meets an uncouth American millionaire named Milton Krest, who challenges the two to aid him {{in the search for}} a rare fish, The Hildebrand Rarity. Bond, Barbey, Krest and his English wife, Elizabeth, set off aboard the Wavekrest in search of the fish. During the journey, Bond learns that Milton verbally and physically abuses everyone around him, especially his wife—whom he punishes {{with the use of a}} stingray tail he dubs [...] "The Corrector". Krest finds the Hildebrand Rarity and kills it—along with many other fish—by pouring poison into the water. After finding and killing the Hildebrand Rarity, the Wavekrest sets sail for port. Along the way Krest gets very drunk, insults Bond and Barbey and tells his wife he <b>will</b> <b>beat</b> her again with the stingray tail. Later that night, Bond hears Krest choking; investigating, Bond finds that Krest has been murdered—apparently by having the rare fish stuffed down his throat. So as not to be entangled in a murder investigation, Bond throws Krest overboard and cleans up the scene of the crime, making it look as though Krest fell overboard after one of the ropes holding his hammock broke: Bond suspects both Barbey and Mrs. Krest, but is unsure which is responsible. However, when Mrs. Krest invites Bond to sail with her to Mombasa—his next destination—aboard the Wavekrest, he accepts her invitation with reservations.|$|E
