5|$|A {{petition}} to <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the Northern Victorian Pier Limited (the company {{used by the}} Sedgwick family to manage Blackpool North Pier) was presented on 17 September 2012 by Carlsberg UK Limited, a creditor of the company, and {{this was to be}} heard at Blackpool County Court on 15 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1907 {{the company}} was seeking to <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the Aston Cantlow Mill Ball and Bearing Company Ltd. Indeed, that company was wound up on 17 January 1908, {{although}} {{the reasons for this}} are unclear. Charles Henry Prideaux was appointed to represent the company on the liquidation committee for Leitner Electrical Company Ltd in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, Marge {{gets the}} family {{together}} to discuss romance, but they can only come up with vignettes from their failed relationships {{in the form of}} clips from previous episodes. Homer, however, saves the day when he brings up how he and Marge got together. Ultimately, the kids do not care for this one and <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> watching Itchy & Scratchy while Homer and Marge share a moment together.|$|E
5000|$|A {{company may}} go into <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> either voluntarily or {{by order of}} the court. [...] A company enters {{voluntary}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> by passing a special resolution to appoint a liquidator. If the company is solvent when it enters voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> {{it is said to}} be in members' voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> and if it is insolvent it is said to be in creditors' voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{accounting}} period ends {{and a new}} one begins with the commencement of a <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> For this purpose a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company, or on the presentation of a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose {{in the case of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.|$|R
25|$|During {{the course}} of a <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a company may make an {{estimate}} of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> turns out to be before the actual <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> had started with that accounting period.|$|R

5|$|One of {{her first}} acts in the post was to help launch an Irish Council for Civil Liberties booklet {{offering}} advice to older people on their rights concerning retirement, access to health and community care, pensions, and elder abuse. Shortly after this she was faced with one {{of her first}} major tasks when she was called on {{to play a role in}} helping to <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the affairs of Console, a suicide bereavement counselling charity, after the organisation was plunged into crisis by a scandal involving the misuse of funds. McEntee worked with the charity's chief executive to ensure the services it provided would continue to be available. Console's functions were taken over by Pieta House in July 2016.|$|E
5|$|When Willard {{tells her}} that the {{insurance}} company won't pay until her death, she dies of a heart attack. Her will stipulates that her killer must {{take care of her}} duck. After the duo spend a night in jail, the duck takes Willard to a brothel. After a wild night of partying, they <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in the desert, where the duck dresses Willard in women's clothing in an attempt to get a ride. After several encounters with an old prospector dying of thirst, a racist police officer, two lesbians, and a short Mexican man, they are finally picked up by a trucker.|$|E
40|$|I have {{my thesis}} {{dividend}} into two parts. In {{the first part}} (theory) I tried to draw up the legal background of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the commercial company, then I aimed to general aspects of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation (general reasons for <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> liquidator, insolvency proceeding), specifics of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation appertaining to particular type of commercial company and finally I described the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with the legal successor (legal forms of conversions). In the second part I made up an imaginary limited lability company (I couldn't get any real dates from the existing company because they are all subject of business secret) and tried to illustrate the process of <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with liquidation. I put emphasis on particular steps of liquidator and the formal standpoints of the liquidation process...|$|R
50|$|Ungoed Thomas J {{held that}} the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> {{petition}} could not succeed. It would be an abuse of process {{to ask for a}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition when a debt was bona fide under dispute. Here, the parties were actually disputing the existence of the debt, so the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition had to be rejected. His judgment was as follows.|$|R
25|$|Whether the {{liquidation}} {{process is}} initiated by {{an order of}} the Court or through a creditors' voluntary <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a liquidator will be appointed to administer the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of {{the affairs of the}} company.|$|R
5|$|Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from {{watching}} the Itchy & Scratchy Halloween special, removing the batteries from the remote control. When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's toolbox and hammers {{it into the}} remote's battery slot. When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back in the Simpson house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. They end up back at Itchy's house and urge Homer from inside the TV to use the remote to get them out, who eventually succeeds in doing so. Unfortunately, Itchy and Scratchy also escape. At first, the family is scared, but realize how small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October, Kaupthing {{was placed}} into {{receivership}} by the FME, following {{the resignation of}} the entire board of directors. The bank said that it was in technical default on its loan agreements after its UK subsidiary had been placed into administration. Kaupthing's Luxembourg subsidiary asked for, and obtained, a suspension of payments (similar to chapter 11 protection) in the Luxembourg District Court. Kaupthing's Geneva office, which was a branch of its Luxembourg subsidiary, was prevented from making any payments of more than 5000 Swiss francs by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission. The directors of Kaupthing's subsidiary on the Isle of Man decided to <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the company after consultation with the Manx authorities. The Finnish Financial Supervision Authority, Rahoitustarkastus, announced having taken control of Kaupthing's Helsinki branch already on 6th, to prevent money from being sent back to Iceland.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived that there was any problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} {{the most important}} grounds tend to be insolvency (the fourth ground) and just and equitable <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> (the sixth ground). Just and equitable <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is usually unrelated to the solvency of the company.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} issues arising in {{cross-border}} or international insolvency is the local recognition and effect of concurrent foreign insolvency proceedings. As a foreign company may be wound up in Australia (see Pt 5. 7 and Pt 5 B. 2 of the Corporations Law), a local liquidation may be taking place when {{the company is also}} being wound up in its place of incorporation. If this occurs, the foreign <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is regarded as the principal <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> and the local one as merely ancillary: Re English Scottish & Australian Chartered Bank [1893] 3 Ch 385. The local ancillary <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> concentrates on getting in and realising local assets and may result in funds being remitted to the principal <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> for distribution. If any issue in the local <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> comes before the local court, it must apply local law, including local insolvency law, to its resolution: Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 10) [1997] Ch 213. ...|$|R
50|$|Any {{disposition}} of a company's property and any {{transfer of shares}} or alteration in {{the status of the}} company's members made after the commencement of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is void unless the court otherwise orders, where the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is pursuant to a court order.|$|R
5|$|Vinnie runs off, finding {{himself on}} the black area of the beach where he bumps into rival gang leader Boogaloo Jones and his gang, the Chaplains. Boogaloo sets up a rumble between his gang and the Stompers. Vinnie later meets up with Roz and the girl Crazy dates, Eva; Crazy has {{meanwhile}} beaten all the mobsters. The four head out to a party, where Vinnie tells the Stompers {{that they are going}} to fight with the Chaplains, to which the gang responds negatively. Much of the gang and their girls head out to a rock and roll show. Vinnie is horrified at the idea of Crazy and himself having to fight the Chaplains alone. One of the Stompers named Sal and his girl have a run-in with Boogaloo while driving, and <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in a car crash. Vinnie finally persuades the Stompers to rumble with the Chaplains.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during volcanic eruptions and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term volcanic ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E

50|$|The House of Lords held clearly {{preferential}} shares {{were not}} debentures, they are equity, because the 5% preference {{would not be}} paid {{if there was no}} profit, whereas a 5% interest rate would have to be. To calculate their entitlement on <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> the court should begin the process of construction with a presumption of equality. Since it was deemed that the provision on 5% extra dividends was exhaustive, and there was no indication this should apply to <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> there was no automatic right to more preferential distributions on <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of a {{commercial}} company with liquidation. It consists of two parts [...] theoretical (chapters 2 to 5) and practical (chapter 6). In the theoretical part I start with introduction into the issue (legal background, basic concepts) and then I write about the reasons for <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> {{of a commercial}} company. Furthermore I focus on liquidation, the company liquidator and the liquidation process itself. I also briefly mention the procedure in case of <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of an insolvent company. In the practical part I show on {{an example of a}} particular commercial company how would its liquidation look like. We can see what steps the associates and the liquidator have to take between the decision about <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company and its erasure from the Companies register...|$|R
