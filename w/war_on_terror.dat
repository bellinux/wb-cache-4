40|$|This article {{contrasts}} {{the parallel}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror</b> 2 ̆ 7 that liberal and authoritarian states have prosecuted since 9 / 11 {{to determine their}} broader significance for the pursuit of 2 ̆ 7 purposes beyond ourselves 2 ̆ 7 in an increasingly multi-polar world. While acknowledging that states rallied to defend their monopoly on legitimate violence after 9 / 11, I maintain that the ensuing 2 ̆ 7 <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror</b> 2 ̆ 7 have simultaneously exacerbated longstanding disagreements between liberal and authoritarian states over the fundamental principles of international society. Under American leadership, liberal states have sought to eradicate jihadism through the transplantation of liberal values and institutions to Muslim-majority societies, countenancing sweeping qualifications of weak states 2 ̆ 7 sovereignty to advance this goal. Conversely, authoritarian states led by Russia and China have mounted a vigorous counter-offensive against both jihadism and liberal internationalist revisionism, harnessing counter-terrorism concerns to reassert illiberal internationalist conceptions of state sovereignty in response. Reflecting international division more than solidarity, the 2 ̆ 7 <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror</b> 2 ̆ 7 have illuminated a deeper triangular struggle between revisionist liberal internationalism, jihadist anti-internationalism and illiberal authoritarian internationalism that will significantly complicate Western efforts to promote liberal values in coming decades...|$|R

5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 {{attacks on}} the United States, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf {{announced}} {{his support for the}} US-led <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b> This declaration sparked conflict with the Lal Masjid, whose leadership was openly pro-Taliban. Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid denied having any links to banned terrorist organisations but were vehemently opposed to the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> and the conflict in Afghanistan. They openly condemned Musharraf and opposed Pakistani security forces, including the Pakistan Rangers and Islamabad Capital Territory police. The mosque became a source for speeches calling for the assassination of Musharraf. One of these speeches was delivered by Masood Azhar, whose Jaish-e-Mohammed group members were later involved in failed attempts to kill the president. In July 2005, Pakistani authorities attempted to raid the mosque in connection with their investigation into the July 7, 2005 London bombings, but the police were blocked by baton-wielding female students. After the raid, authorities apologised for the behaviour of the police.|$|E

2500|$|For many, the {{political}} context surrounding the 2005 summit — the stagnation of the Middle East Peace Process, the US-led <b>war</b> <b>on</b> Iraq, {{the lack of}} democratisation in Arab countries, and the <b>war</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror's</b> negative effects <b>on</b> freedoms and human rights, among others—proved for many the inefficiency of the Barcelona Process for fulfilling its objectives of peace, stability and prosperity. Given these circumstances, even politicians that had been engaged with the Barcelona Process since its very beginnings, like the Spanish politician Josep Borrell, expressed their disappointment about the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and its incapacity to deliver results. Critiques from Southern Mediterranean countries blamed the Partnership's failure on Europe's lack of interest towards the Mediterranean in favour of its Eastern neighbourhood; whereas experts from the North accused Southern countries of only being interested on [...] "their own bi-lateral relationship with the EU" [...] while downplaying multilateral policies.|$|R

50|$|Author Malcolm Hollick cites Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Islamic {{fundamentalist}} {{states as}} modern, though severe, examples of dominator societies. The Nazi claim to power, for example, was also {{accompanied by the}} call for women’s return to “traditional,” or subservient, places in family structures. However, manifestations of dominator culture are not always so extreme; the effects of dominator culture often manifest in pervasive and subtle ways in society. In the United States, the <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror,</b> drugs, and crime perpetuate {{the use of force}} to achieve an end and indicate a lessening of certain freedoms. On a larger scale, sex-slavery, forced marriage, and the acceptance of wife-beating persist around the world. Though the Western world has made considerable strides towards a more partnership society in the past few centuries—Western society boasts of freedom of speech, access to education, political participation, gay rights, and women in the workforce—the shift towards the partnership model is neither universal nor complete.|$|R

40|$|The article {{reviews the}} status of the highly diverse {{community}} of American Muslims, with reference to US national identity and immigration history, history of Islam in the USA, and civil society organization. It is found that on average, and after the civil right movement of the 1960 s, Muslims are very well assimilated into the US society and economy, in which the specific American civil society and religious organizations play an important enabling part, providing networks and inroads to society for newcomers as well as vehicles for preserving ethniccultural distinctiveness. This broad pattern of development has not changed in the aftermath of 9 / 11 and ensuing <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror.</b> Compared with the Nordic context, where Muslims are often considered challenging to a secular social order, American Muslims do not stand out as more or differently religious, or any less American, than other religious communities. It is tentatively concluded that, downsides apart, US national identity and civil society structure could be more favorable for the social integration of Muslims than the Nordic welfare state model...|$|R

40|$|Artists have memorialised war since ‘time immemorial’ but the {{collisions}} between {{artists and}} war {{did not begin}} with the modern era. This chapter reconsiders the various ways that anti-war artists have reframed public conceptions of war and heroism and loss and pain. War memorials and protest artworks in Australia and the United States are reevaluated here through the exploration of how the evocation of trauma is activated within public and private memories. The mechanisms of trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is often considered a private concern. A {{better understanding of how}} trauma works with public or collective memory will elucidate how a few anti-war artists have found traction for eliciting protest in their post- 9 / 11 artworks. The ongoing commemorations of 9 / 11 anniversary events in the US and throughout the world will continue to challenge artists to reconceptualise issues that arise from the <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>terror,</b> including social injustice, the powerlessness of women and children, the world’s refugee crises, and the difficulties of all civilians residing in war zones. Artists need to continue their work and reclaim public memories against the dominance of the media conglomerates during these anniversary events...|$|R

5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused on the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b> Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US.

40|$|A Looming Possibility: Towards a Theory of the Textile is, at its heart, a {{critical}} {{examination of the}} politics and aesthetics of desire. It positions 'the textile' as a material formed at the intersections of desire and modern politics, and it focuses attention on those instances where and when the textile's 'textility' (or texture) trumps its 'textuality' (or readability). It does this {{in an effort to}} reconsider the forms of relations that desire and politics typically take in modern, Western culture, and to propose that we must be prepared to address the 'consistencies' of these relations [...] should we ever hope to meaningfully reform them. The ways that fabric conditions and binds our bodies and desires is explored through close readings of fabrics that expose, supplement, and abstract the ways pleasure and felt experience adhere to one another through the body. The mid-century futurist fashion designs of Rudi Gernreich lay bear how the fashion system instrumentalizes the body's 'desire to move,' while inscribing it within the time-signatures of modern capitalism; the subversive and fetishistic figurations of modern military uniforms, produced in the wake of Liliana Cavani's 1974 film The Night Porter, reveal how the desire for flexibility is tempered by the physical comforts provided by discipline (and how the material conditions of the erotics of power and violence are made manifest); the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror's</b> (un-) uniformed 'unlawful enemy combatant' is cast alongside the fabrics used in the capture and detention of high value targets [...] high-tech 'digi-camouflages' and crude hoods fashioned from sand bags, laundry sacks, or disused towels. Finally, this work critically engages a host of contemporary artworks produced by the likes of Fernando Botero, Thorsten Brinkman, Elana Mann, and Allison Smith, and asks how it is in those moments, when few put stock in their leaders' words or their land's written laws, that our confidence in cloth and its ability to articulate something 'real' about our current condition becomes crucial...|$|R

40|$|Beyond the Erotics of Orientalism: Homeland Security, Liberal War and the Pacification of the Global Frontier {{traces the}} post- 9 / 11 {{ascendancy}} {{of a complex}} and seemingly contradictory U. S. national security imaginary and concomitant practices of <b>war</b> and violence. <b>On</b> the one hand, the U. S. security state supported at times quite radical transgressions from the gendered racial-sexual grammars of the usual “War Story” (Cooke, 1996), such as the active involvement {{of women in the}} torture of enemy prisoners, the repeal of the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy and more recently its support for overturning the Defense of Marriage Act. The U. S. social formation also took a seemingly great leap forward towards “post-racial triumph” (Ho Sang & LaBennett, 2012, p. 5) with the most diverse Presidential cabinet in U. S. history under Bush Jr. culminating in 2008 in the election of Barack Obama, the first American President racialized as Black. On the other hand, the U. S. security state aggressively pursued the racialized expansion and intensification of the (extrajudicial) use of military and carceral force in time and space, including selective deportations, indefinite detentions, the creation of an official torture policy and targeted killings of so-called enemy combatants outside of official warzones, including of US citizens. Beyond the Erotics of Orientalism explores these reconfigurations of law and belonging within broader shifts in contemporary liberal governance, in particular the promise that the 19 th century colour line (DuBois, 1903) has been transcended and no longer per se marks populations as in/violable. I show how in this era of post-racial/sexual/gender triumph, the liberal project of security governs not only through military and carceral force, but also affectively through self-rule and the promotion of social difference. The dissertation locates the U. S. <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror's</b> ambiguous promise of liberal freedom, equal inclusion and self-rule in the desires and disavowals of a White settler society in “the afterlife of slavery” (Hartman, 2007, p. 6). Building on the work of Native feminist and Afro-Pessimist theorists, this study suggests that we can only meaningfully interrogate the operations of power and violence in contemporary U. S. security making - including against Orientalized subjects - by accounting for the foundational role of anti-Black racism and the settler colonial character of the U. S. social formation. These interlocking racial-sexual logics mobilize knowledges of war and violence that facilitate not only the targeting of Muslim/ified people and spaces, but in turn also help secure the gendered racial-sexual order and property regime of the settler colonial homeland in this age of “post-everything” (Crenshaw, 2014) triumph...|$|R
