There, he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Experience.</b> In September, they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe au Go Go, as John Hammond Jr.'s backing group.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Cariappa was {{the first}} of two Indians {{selected}} to undergo training at the Imperial Defence College, at Camberly, in the UK, to attend the higher command courses. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> he had gained at the Imperial Defence College, Cariappa felt that dividing the Indian Army during the partition would have a devastating effect on both sides. He explained to the hierarchy that without the help of British officers, there was a risk of inexperienced Indian officers taking over higher commands. But his concern was not addressed. During the disquieting period of partition he handled the division of the Army and sharing of its assets between the two new nations as the officer in charge.|$|E

There were repeated raids on Spanish Republican Army armoured vehicles and later defensive positions by both bombers and fighters based at Salamanca. Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft were ineffective, despite Nationalist fears, compared with German aircraft. The Legion lost eight aircraft, but claimed 18 victories. German tactics were also improved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of Brunete, particularly the en masse use of tanks by the Nationalists.|$|E
5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Natalia Lafourcade joined Mexican {{orchestra}} conductor Alondra de la Parra on {{the musical}} project Travieso Carmesí, an album created {{as part of}} the Bicentennial of Mexico celebration. While conducting research to find songs for that album, Lafourcade studied Mexican singer-songwriter Agustín Lara catalog and decided to record a tribute album with his songs. Released in 2012, Mujer Divina earned her accolades for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Long Form Music Video at the 14th Latin Grammy Awards. Two years later, Lafourcade traveled to Veracruz (Mexico), Colombia, and Cuba in a search for musical inspiration and a balance between heart, mind and body. She has said that composition of her new music for Hasta la Raíz was closely woven <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of singing Lara's music.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{satisfaction}} with price affects overall customer satisfaction. In the internet market, customer satisfaction is determined by two separate measures: satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pre-purchase <b>experience</b> (e. g. ease of use, selection) and satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> post-purchase <b>experience</b> (e. g., delivery, order tracking, customer service). Using data collected by a commercial web satisfaction firm and the weekly price of a market basket of books, we model the impact of price and price satisfaction on these two measures of e-tailer satisfaction. We find that price has {{a negative impact on}} price satisfaction and satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pre-purchase <b>experience.</b> Satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> prepurchase <b>experience</b> has a positive carry-over effect on <b>the</b> satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> postpurchase <b>experience.</b> We also find that price satisfaction has a negative effect on satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> post-purchase <b>experience.</b> These results raise interesting questions about the nature of price satisfaction. They also have important implications for e-tailer pricing strategy. ...|$|R
5|$|Khonsari first {{discussed}} {{the game in}} February 2011, announcing it as 1979: The Game. It was initially intended to be episodic, consisting of three or nine episodes, but was later reduced to one game. A crowdfunding campaign for the game was launched on Kickstarter in 2013 with a goal of US$395,000, but failed to reach its goal, {{with a total of}} US$304,741 raised. Additional fundraising was set up on the game's website. Following the failed campaign, the team partnered with the New Frontier Story Lab at Sundance in 2014 and 2015, the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, and the Doris Duke Foundation. 1979 Revolution was approved through Steam Greenlight in July 2015, and was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on April 5, 2016, for iOS devices on June 10, 2016, and for Android devices on December 14, 2016; console versions are also in development. The game is also planned to have Oculus Rift support; the team rewrote one of the interrogation scenes to fit <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience.</b> 1979 Revolution runs on the Unity game engine. Khonsari has expressed interest in a sequel, stating that it depends on the commercial success of the first game. He is also interested in developing additional games about other historical events.|$|E

5|$|The {{season is}} the worst in Benfica history {{since the start of}} the Primeira Liga during 1934–35. The club {{switched}} managers two times. Jupp Heynckes was replaced by José Mourinho in September. Toni, who previously guided the club to a league title, took the reins in December. In the transfer market, young players like Marchena and Fernando Meira were brought in, and mixed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of 31 year-old, Pierre van Hooijdonk, who arrived to replace Nuno Gomes, were meant to improve the team competitiveness. However, the biggest event of the pre-season was the release of João Pinto, the longest-serving player on the club, and the incumbent captain. This decision was poorly received by the fans, who criticized Heynckes and the president for the move. Both would leave the club in the following months. In the league campaign, the team lacked balance year-round and only briefly entered the league race, spending all but three weeks out the top three. Even the successful partnership of Pierre van Hooijdonk and João Tomás, with 36 goals between them, did not prevent the club from finishing in sixth place, 23 points behind winner Boavista. Consequently, Benfica missed out on UEFA competitions for the first time in 51 years (since the 1959–60 season).|$|E
