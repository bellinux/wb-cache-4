5|$|Cracker Barrel {{was founded}} in 1969 by Dan Evins, a sales {{representative}} for Shell Oil, who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve gasoline sales. Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> chosen {{to give it a}} Southern country theme, Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers. The first restaurant was built close to Interstate 40, in Lebanon, Tennessee. It opened in September 1969, serving Southern cuisine including biscuits, grits, country ham, and turnip greens.|$|E

It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, {{similar to that}} of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> instead of a reference at compile time.|$|E

Seneb is described {{as the owner of}} several thousand cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life â€“ being carried in a litter, sailing in a boat in the Nile Delta, or receiving his children. The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high-ranking courtier such as inspecting his linen and cattle, receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers. He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin, and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff. One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs, each captioned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name.</b> He is depicted using what were evidently custom-made items of furniture, such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side-panels to conceal his legs.|$|E

25|$|Spiridonov was {{the first}} to begin {{referring}} to the new system <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> similar to 'sambo'. He eventually developed a softer style called Samoz that could be used by smaller, weaker practitioners or even wounded soldiers and secret agents. Spiridonov's inspiration to develop 'Samoz' stemmed from his World War I bayonet injury, which greatly restricted his (left arm and thus his) ability to practice wrestle. Refined versions of sambo are still used today or fused with specific sambo applications {{to meet the needs of}} Russian commandos today.|$|E

25|$|Surnames with {{religious}} meanings or connotations are common. It {{is possible that}} some of these originated from an ancestor who converted to Catholicism and intended or needed to demonstrate his new faith. Another possible source of religious names were orphans who were abandoned in the churches and raised in Catholic orphanages by priests and nuns. They were usually baptized <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> related to the date near when they were found or baptized. Another possible source is when previous religious given names (expressing a special devotion by the parents or the god-parents, or the child's birth date) were adopted as family names.|$|E
25|$|Other {{successful}} cases {{filed by}} Starbucks include the case won in 2006 against the chain Xingbake in Shanghai, China for trademark infringement, because the chain used a green-and-white circular logo <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> that sounded phonetically {{similar to the}} Chinese for Starbucks. Starbucks did not open any stores after first registering its trademark in Russia in 1997 and in 2002 a Russian lawyer successfully filed a request to cancel the trademark. He then registered the name with a Moscow company and asked for $600,000 to sell the trademark to Starbucks, but was ruled against in November 2005.|$|E
