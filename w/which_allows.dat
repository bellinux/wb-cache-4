5|$|In the 21st century, {{these trends}} have continued, and several new {{approaches}} {{have come into}} prominence, including multielectrode recording, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> the activity of many brain cells to be recorded {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; genomics, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|E
5|$|Providing balance, {{when moving}} or stationary, {{is also a}} central {{function}} of the ear.

5|$|Duke offers 46 {{arts and}} {{sciences}} majors, four engineering majors, 52 Minors (including two in engineering) and Program II, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> students to design their own interdisciplinary major in arts & sciences, and IDEAS, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> students to design their own engineering major. Twenty-four certificate programs also are available. Students pursue a major, and can pursue {{a combination of a}} total of up to three including minors, certificates, and/or a second major. Eighty-five percent of undergraduates enroll in the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, while the rest are in the Pratt School of Engineering.|$|E

5|$|The total {{complement}} of proteins present {{at a time}} in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> the separation {{of a large number of}} proteins, mass spectrometry, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, <b>which</b> <b>allows</b> the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The {{total complement}} of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E
