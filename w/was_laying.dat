5|$|ExactTarget {{went public}} in March 2012 and raised $161.5 million in funding on the New York Stock Exchange. In late 2012, it {{acquired}} a marketing automation vendor, Pardot, for $96 million, and the developers of a product recommendation engine, iGoDigital, for $21 million. In 2012, its revenues grew 40 percent over the preceding year. The following June, ExactTarget was acquired by salesforce.com for $2.5 billion. A few months later, salesforce.com said it <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> off 200 staff due to overlaps after the ExactTarget acquisition. That September at the ExactTarget Connections conference, salesforce.com said it was integrating ExactTarget into a new division called Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud.|$|E
5|$|On March 30, 1780, Scott {{arrived in}} Charleston just as Clinton <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> siege to the city. He was {{captured}} {{when the city}} surrendered on May 12, 1780, and was held as {{a prisoner of war}} at Haddrell's Point near Charleston. Although he was a prisoner, he was given freedom to move within a six-mile radius and was allowed to correspond and trade with acquaintances in Virginia. With the death of William Woodford on November 13, 1780, he became primarily responsible for the welfare of the Virginia troops at Haddrell's Point. He requested his parole on account of ill health on January 30, 1781, and in late March, Charles Cornwallis granted the request.|$|E
5|$|Roddy Piper was Special Guest Referee for a bout between Jeff Hardy and Scott Hall, {{which was}} the {{following}} contest. After the two fought for a few minutes, Hardy gained the pinfall victory after he jumped off the top rope and performed a Swanton Bomb, a high-angle front flip from the top rope, onto Hall who <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> flat against the mat. Abyss attacked Hardy after the match finished, and lifted Hardy up onto his shoulders and then dropped to a seated position, a move which Abyss dubbed the Shock Treatment.|$|E

5|$|The last quarterfinal match {{featured}} A.J. Styles and Super Eric against Awesome Kong and B.G. James. Super Eric {{picked up}} Kong and slammed her into B.G., who <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> {{on the ring}} mat. Later, Styles attempted to perform a move by jumping off the ropes, but legitimately tripped, falling face-first on the mat. Then B.G. lifted Styles to perform a suplex, which Styles countered into a small package pin attempt, resulting in a victory at five minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Monty Brown and Jeff Hardy to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy scored a two-count on Brown by slamming the back of Brown's head and neck into the mat with a reverse neckbreaker. Hardy then {{climbed to the top}} rope and jumped off with a somersault toward Brown, who <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> on his back in the ring, to attempt his signature Swanton Bomb maneuver. Once Hardy jumped, Brown moved {{out of the way and}} then performed his signature Pounce maneuver by crashing into Hardy. Brown followed by pinning Hardy at 8 minutes and 43 seconds to win the contest and become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Euryalus, {{named after}} the Greek hero Euryalus, was laid down on 18 July 1899 by Vickers, Sons & Maxim at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. She was {{launched}} 20 May 1901 in front of 30,000 spectators, and christened by Mrs. Douglas Vickers, wife {{of one of the}} directors of the company. On 11 June 1901, {{the south side of the}} Ramsden dock at Barrow caught fire, and was practically destroyed before the flames could be extinguished. The recently launched Euryalus <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> alongside this wharf, and the fire set ablaze the teak wood sheathing of the cruiser. Considerable damage was done to the ship before she was hauled from the pier into the middle of the dock, and her completion was severely delayed. Towed to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for repairs, the ship slipped off the blocks supporting her in drydock and was severely damaged. While on sea trials, she collided with the auxiliary vessel Traveller on 27 June 1903 at Devonport. Euryalus was finally completed on 5 January 1904, nearly two years after her sister ships.|$|E

50|$|After {{acquiring}} further experience Eliza Munday learnt {{to employ}} her executive powers more judiciously. She married, at Liverpool on 11 Feb. 1806, James Salmon, organist of St. Peter's, Liverpool, whose father, James Salmon the elder (d. 1827), <b>was</b> <b>lay</b> clerk of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and whose brother William (1789-1858), after holding the same position, <b>was</b> <b>lay</b> clerk of Westminster and taught singing.|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} Ghazis fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's {{official}} historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed {{the position of}} the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that Ghazi had come up to periscope depth to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to crash dive, which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: {{on the night of the}} explosion, Rajput was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two depth charges on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage. The third possibility is that there was a mishap when Ghazi <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> mines on the day before hostilities broke out.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

5|$|The newly {{assembled}} coalition {{organized a}} number of small campaigns in Lithuania; the largest was undertaken at the end of summer. During this campaign the Knights burned wooden castles at Kernavė, possibly the first capital of Lithuania, which never recovered from the destruction. While the army <b>was</b> <b>laying</b> siege to Georgenburg, Grand Master Conrad Zöllner von Rothenstein died. The coalition decided to abandon this siege and march on Vilnius instead, as such a large army could not easily be re-assembled. On 11 September 1390, the joint forces launched a five-week siege on the city. Vilnius' castles were held by Skirgaila, commanding combined Polish, Lithuanian, and Ruthenian troops. The Knights reduced much of the outer city to ruins and managed to destroy the Crooked Castle, which was never rebuilt. Vytautas' brother Tautvilas Kęstutaitis and Jogaila's brother Karigaila died during the siege. The besiegers ran into various difficulties. Their supplies of gunpowder were dwindling, the weather was deteriorating, the terms of service for some volunteers from western Europe ended, and the Knights needed a new Grand Master. They decided to return to Prussia. The siege did not {{bring an end to the}} conflict, but it demonstrated an increased dissatisfaction with Jogaila among the regional inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|The ruling did in {{many ways}} clarify issues {{surrounding}} prohibition {{of the use of}} force and the right of self-defence.
