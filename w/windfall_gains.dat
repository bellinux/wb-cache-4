5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. <b>Windfall</b> <b>gains</b> would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
500|$|Based {{on a study}} {{conducted}} by Dale Jorgenson, proponents state that production cost of domestic goods and services could decrease by approximately 22% on average after embedded tax costs are removed, leaving the sale nearly the same after taxes. The study concludes that producer prices would drop between 15% and 26% (depending on the type of good/service). Jorgenson's research included all income and payroll taxes in the embedded tax estimation, which assumes employee take-home pay (net income) remains unchanged from pre-FairTax levels. [...] Price and wage changes after the FairTax would largely depend on the response of the Federal Reserve monetary authorities. Non-accommodation of the money supply would suggest retail prices and take home pay stay the same—embedded taxes are replaced by the FairTax. Full accommodation would suggest prices and incomes rise by the exclusive rate (i.e., 30%)—embedded taxes become <b>windfall</b> <b>gains.</b> Partial accommodation would suggest a varying degree in-between.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch [...] "merchant capitalism" [...] {{was based}} on trading, {{shipping}} and finance rather than manufacturing or agriculture and marked the transition of the Dutch economy to a new stage. [...] The accumulation of capital in the enormous amounts generated in this period caused demand for productive investment opportunities beside the immediate reinvestment in the own business. It also necessitated innovative institutional arrangements to bring demand and supply of investment funds together. From this period date the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Amsterdamsche Wisselbank. There were also innovations in marine insurance and legal structuring of firms like the joint stock company. These innovations helped manage risk. For example, ships were financed by shares, with each of 16 merchants, say, holding a 1/16 share. This minimized risk and maximized opportunity for <b>windfall</b> <b>gains.</b>|$|E
50|$|Note {{that while}} the {{windfall}} gain/ton is fairly modest , because of the vast size of the coal allocations, the total figure for the <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> is very large. Note also that the figure stated as a <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> would in fact accrue to the allocatee {{over the life of}} the reserve, which would likely exceed 100 years. Thus, using any reasonable discount rate, the Present value of the <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> will be dramatically smaller (perhaps one tenth) of the <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> stated in the CAG Report.|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{literature on}} the economics of mortgage choice holds that consumer-borrower preference for the ARM depends largely on the FRM-ARM rate differential. However, there is no empirical evidence as to whether consumers are better off, worse off, or left indifferent with {{the choice of the}} ARM relative to the alternative FRM. This paper estimates the <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> or loss induced by the FRM-ARM rate differential in a multiperiod setting. The major results are as follows: (1) on the average consumer-borrowers reap <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> from the use of ARM, (2) but some individual consumers had windfall loss, (3) consumers with ARMs that have periodic interest-rate caps have significantly higher <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> than consumers whose ARMs have no periodic rate caps, and (4) the level of the <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> (loss) appears to be correlated with the slope of the yield curve and the level of interest rate.

Second, the subsidy affects not just the decision to move out, but location andhousing quality choices. Finally we suggest a model to identify how much of theallowance came as a <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> to parents. Defining the <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> as being thesubsidies distributed to students who can study locally and whose choice would havebeen to live independently without the subsidy, we find that as much as half of theallowance came as a <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> to stude nts and their parents. ...|$|R

50|$|Behavioural {{economists have}} {{proposed}} an alternate description of intertemporal consumption, the behavioural life cycle hypothesis. They propose that people mentally divide their assets into non-fungible mental accounts - current income, current assets (savings) and future income. The marginal {{propensity to consume}} (MPC) out {{of each of these}} accounts is different. Drawing upon empirical studies of consumption, superannuation and <b>windfall</b> <b>gains</b> they hypothesize that the MPC is close to one out of current income, close to zero for future income and somewhere in between with respect to current assets. These differing MPCs explain why people 'overconsume' during their highest earning years, why increasing superannuation contributions does not cause current savings to be reduced (as the life-cycle model implies) and why small <b>windfall</b> <b>gains</b> (which are coded as current income) are consumed at a high rate but a higher proportion of larger gains is saved.|$|E

50|$|Presently, no law {{requires}} a merchant to provide refunds for lost or stolen cards. Whether a refund is possible is specified in an issuer's cardholder agreement. In addition, most closed system cards cannot be redeemed for cash. When a cardholder redeems all but an insignificant {{portion of the}} card on merchandise, that amount is generally lost and is a <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> for the issuing merchant. The merchant also obtains a <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> if a card has an expiry date and the cardholder fails to use the full value by that date. Furthermore, the merchant has an interest-free use of the value until it is redeemed.|$|R

This decree provided <b>windfall</b> <b>gains</b> to several well-connected Nigerians, but proved highly detrimental to non-oil investment in the Nigerian economy.|$|E
40|$|Commodity {{stabilization}} {{funds are}} hard-currency savings {{to protect against}} a fall in income for commodity exports {{in the presence of}} borrowing constraints. The authors develop the optimal rules for deposits in and withdrawals from such a fund by using a benchmark model of precautionary savings with liquidity constraints. They show that the optimal stabilization fund is small. For the Chilean Copper Stabilization fund, they show that the actual accumulation of foreign assets has been much larger than the benchmark model requires. Over long periods, the copper fund should contain less than one month's exports. They also use the model to find the optimal depletion of the <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> oil exports received {{as a result of the}} Persian Gulf crisis - amounting to about four months of average exports. They find that such a <b>windfall</b> <b>gain</b> should be depleted in about four years. In the long run, an oil exporter should keep a small fund, significantly less than one month of oilexports. But higher-than-predicted funds can be justified if there are externalities associated with the fund, frictions in the economy, or the borrowing constraint is relaxed.

50|$|The {{market prices}} for privately held {{companies}} are typically viewed from {{a return on}} investment perspective (such as 25%), whilst publicly held and or exchange listed companies trade on a Price to earnings ratio (P/E) (such as a P/E of 10, which equates to a 10% ROI). Thus, if a publicly traded company specialises in the acquisition of privately held companies, from a per-share perspective there is a gain with every acquisition that falls within these guidelines. E.g., Berkshire Hathaway and Halydean Corporation. Private to public equities arbitrage is a term which can arguably be applied to investment banking in general.
