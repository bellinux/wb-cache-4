5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

A second time the Queen <b>waved</b> <b>her</b> wand above her head, and then every doll hurried to its own home, and {{the doors and windows}} began to close again. But Dot and Tot could hear the dolls {{laughing}} and talking in the houses until the Queen <b>waved</b> <b>her</b> wand for the third and last time, when silence fell on the village, and her Majesty turned to the children and said: ...|$|R

25|$|In {{his later}} years, Zip eschewed {{traveling}} {{in favor of}} performing at Coney Island. One Sunday afternoon in 1925, Zip heard a little girl cry for help. He noticed the girl <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> arms in the ocean and swam out to rescue her. At the time, the vigorous Zip {{was in his early}} 80s. All who witnessed his valor cheered, but he left the scene to avoid their accolades.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} one of the most highly publicized in California history. The {{prosecution}} hypothesis was that Abbott had attempted to rape the victim and killed her when she resisted. Abbott pleaded not guilty. At the trial all the evidence produced was circumstantial and nothing directly connected Abbott with Stephanie Bryan's death. The prosecution used emotion to overcome the lack of direct evidence by such strategies as showing the jury the rotten clothes from the victim's body and <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> brassiere and panties, making implications it could not prove. Abbott explained that in May, the basement of the house had been used as a polling site with many people having access. Although the prosecution charged attempted rape, the pathologist testified that the body was too decomposed to evaluate it for evidence of sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters {{in front of}} the bulldozer, and began <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day.... When it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E

25|$|Marilyn taught Genie to {{take her}} {{frustration}} out on inanimate objects in their yard and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By {{the end of her}} stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> hand depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.|$|E

[...] "No other friend," [...] re–echoed they, [...] "have you not a husband?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Madonna on The Virgin Tour (1985) and the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008). on the Virgin Tour, Madonna performed the song wearing a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly button exposed, and multiple crucifixes in different sizes, hanging {{from different parts of}} her body. Madonna performed the song in its original version. She appeared from behind a silhouette, and descended the steps while <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> hands and singing. The performance was not included on the [...] VHS in 1985.|$|E

500|$|At about 10:30p.m. (accounts differ as to {{the exact}} time), Blanchard began her ascent, {{carrying}} a white flag and wearing a white dress and a white hat topped with ostrich plumes. The wind was blowing strongly, and it appears the balloon struggled to rise. By shedding ballast Blanchard managed to get some lift, but the balloon brushed through the trees as it ascended. Once she had cleared the treetops Blanchard began the display by <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> flag. The balloon was illuminated by baskets containing [...] "Bengal fire", a slow-burning, coloured pyrotechnic.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Auld Lang Syne (The New Year's Anthem)" [...] was {{released}} on December 15, 2010. A pregnant Carey, who only moves from the waist up, wears a black laced dress while {{standing in front of}} a green screen, which depict exploding fireworks in the nights sky. Becky Bain for Idolator positively reviewed the video, writing [...] "There is something so endlessly entertaining about watching Mariah Carey do her patented diva theatrics — <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> arms like a crazy hand model; tenderly stroking her hair; spinning around dramatically." ...|$|E
500|$|Carmella's exit storyline was devised {{months prior}} to Blair's departure. Producers had planned to reunite Carmella and Oliver and have them leave together, however Hoflin decided to go travelling, meaning he was {{unavailable}} for filming. Prior to Hoflin's departure, he and Balir filmed scenes showing their reunion. Scripts were quickly rewritten to portray Oliver in Portugal, where Hoflin was in real life, instead of New York where Oliver left for upon his exit. Describing her reaction to Carmella's scripts towards the end, Blair commented: [...] "After a while I'd open my script and say, 'Please give me one scene where I'm smiling'. And then I'd read the script and think, 'Damn - no smiling scenes again'." [...] Blair had originally hoped that Carmella would be killed on-screen, as she felt a dramatic send off would have been fitting. After the [...] "tragic" [...] final year Carmella underwent, Blair decided she was happy with the exit because [...] "something finally goes right for her". Blair also opined: [...] "It's a really lovely story and I think the fans will be happy with it." [...] Carmella's [...] "happy exit storyline" [...] saw her leaving in a taxi surrounded by all of her friends <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> off, after they convinced her {{to start a new}} life with Oliver.|$|E

500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E
