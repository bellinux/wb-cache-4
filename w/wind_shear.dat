5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>shear</b> {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> for aircraft. Low level <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. <b>Wind</b> <b>shear</b> is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with <b>wind</b> <b>shear.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> conditions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>shear</b> affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low level <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level <b>wind</b> <b>shear,</b> for example using a boom vang.|$|E
40|$|Using a fully {{nonlinear}} two-dimensional (2 -D) numerical model, we simulated {{gravity waves}} (GWs) breaking and {{their contributions to}} the formation of large <b>winds</b> and <b>wind</b> <b>shears</b> in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). An eddy diffusion coefficient is used in the 2 -D numerical model to parameterize realistic turbulent mixing. Our study shows that the momentum deposited by breaking GWs accelerates the mean wind. The resultant large background wind increases the GW's apparent horizontal phase velocity and decreases the GW's intrinsic frequency and vertical wavelength. Both the accelerated mean wind and the decreased GW vertical wavelength contribute to the enhancement of <b>wind</b> <b>shears.</b> This, in turn, creates a background condition that favors the occurrence of GW instability, breaking, and momentum deposition, as well as mean wind acceleration, which further enhances the <b>wind</b> <b>shears.</b> We find that GWs with longer vertical wavelengths and faster horizontal phase velocity can induce larger winds, but they may not necessarily induce larger <b>wind</b> <b>shears.</b> In addition, the background temperature can affect the time and height of GW breaking, thus causing accelerated mean <b>winds</b> and <b>wind</b> <b>shears...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>shear,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. <b>Wind</b> <b>shear</b> can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E
5|$|Downbursts. When an outflow {{boundary}} forms due to {{a shallow}} layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and directional <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> can result {{at the leading edge}} of the three dimensional boundary.

5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} {{associated with an}} area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the depression was forecast to dissipate because of strong <b>wind</b> <b>shear.</b> Moving little, its development was constantly hindered by <b>wind</b> <b>shear.</b> The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> to {{organize}} the storm {{in such a way}} as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are affected}} by <b>wind</b> <b>shear.</b> Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those {{at the top of}} blade travel, and this in turn affects the turbine operation. This low level <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.|$|E
5|$|By September 28, the {{organization}} of the depression deteriorated further due to strong vertical <b>wind</b> <b>shear.</b> The center of the depression again became difficult to location by infrared images early on September 29. Later that day, a few computer models indicated a decrease in <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> over the depression within two days, thus, it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> exposed the center of the depression again by early on September 30, though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status. By late on October 1, satellite imagery noted that the depression dissipated, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{effects from}} the strong <b>wind</b> <b>shear,</b> a large, deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of Josephine. The center {{was found to have}} shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5-day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only a swirl of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, mostly {{to the north of the}} circulation, due to the strong southerly <b>wind</b> <b>shear.</b> By mid-morning, Josephine re-intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> again took its toll on Josephine by late morning. The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly.|$|E
5|$|Further {{intensification}} was slowed {{because of}} strong <b>wind</b> <b>shear,</b> which caused the storm's center of circulation to be displaced from {{the bulk of}} convection. Due {{to the lack of}} atmospheric steering currents at the time, Odile assumed a slow, meandering course towards the west. Continued <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> caused the tropical storm to become disorganized on September11 before abating, allowing for thunderstorms to rebuild over Odile's circulation center on September12. The relaxed <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> enabled the growth of intense rainbands encircling the tropical cyclone as well as improved outflow aloft. The following day, Odile quickly attained a large central dense overcast; in accordance with Dvorak-derived satellite intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded the storm to hurricane intensity.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the remnant}} low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7. Convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September8, <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> took over the system again. Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September14, dry air and <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> caused the remnants to dissipate entirely.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{temperature}} in the tropopause and lower stratosphere is largely constant with increasing altitude, very little convection and its resultant turbulence occurs there.

5|$|Soaring {{related to}} <b>wind</b> <b>shear,</b> also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed.
