5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Lerner hired former Packers coach Mike Holmgren as team president, moving Keenan {{to chief}} {{financial}} officer. A month later, the owner hired Eagles front-office executive Tom Heckert as general manager. Heckert replaced former general manager George Kokinis, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> the previous November. The new management said Mangini would return for a second season.|$|E
5|$|During the 2002–03 season, the Flames hired Darryl Sutter as the team's head coach, {{replacing}} Greg Gilbert, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> as the Flames languished in {{last place}} in the Western Conference. Sutter also became the team's general manager following the season, and is credited with revitalizing the franchise. Among Sutter's first moves was to acquire goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, whom he had previously coached in San Jose, early in the 2003-04 season. Kiprusoff responded by setting a modern NHL record for lowest goals against average at 1.69.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the regular season and prior to North Carolina's acceptance of the invitation to play in the Gator Bowl, Tar Heels head coach Mack Brown received an offer from the Texas Longhorns to become that school's head coach. A day and a half after Texas extended the offer, Brown resigned his position as North Carolina's head coach and accepted the Texas job.

5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking {{on matters of}} public concern. In Pickering v. Board of Education (1968), the Court first articulated the right of {{public employees}} {{to be protected from}} dismissal for exercising their right to free speech. There, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a teacher <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E
5|$|Another {{knee injury}} ended his 2008–09 season after 75 games {{and left him}} {{unavailable}} for the playoffs. He expressed his frustrations with coach Mike Keenan, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> by the team after failing to advance past {{the first round of}} the playoffs, criticizing Keenan's lack of structure and expressing optimism for the team's chances under a new coach. After failing to score a goal in 2008–09 and the first half of the 2009–10 season, Regehr scored his first goal in 141 games on January 18, 2010, against the San Jose Sharks. He finished with 2 goals and 17 points that season and matched those totals in 2010–11. Upon playing his 804th game late in the season, Regehr surpassed Al MacInnis as the team's all-time leader in games played by a defenceman.|$|E
5|$|During the 2015 offseason, Ray Shero {{was named}} the Devils' new general manager, and John Hynes was named as the new head coach. Lou Lamoriello {{resigned}} as team president and became {{the general manager of}} the Toronto Maple Leafs, replacing Dave Nonis, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> {{at the end of the}} season. In the 2015–16 season, the Devils finished seventh in the Metropolitan Division with 84 points, missing the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. The team finished in last place in the Eastern Conference the following season with 70 points; this was the first time that they finished last in the conference since the 1985–86 season. However, they won the ensuing draft lottery to secure the first overall selection in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, which they used to select Halifax Mooseheads center Nico Hischier.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Urlacher {{was awarded}} the Ed Block Courage Award, given to those who showed a {{commitment}} to sportsmanship and courage. During his award acceptance speech, Urlacher thanked the Bears for their support after his mother Lavoyda Lenard died. Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 9, Urlacher intercepted Matt Hasselbeck, and returned the pick 46 yards for a touchdown. Urlacher led the Bears in tackles until Week 13 against the Seahawks, in which he sustained a hamstring injury that sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season. Urlacher became an unrestricted free agent on March 12, 2013. On March 20, the Bears announced that Urlacher will not return in 2013 after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. Urlacher later belittled Phil Emery's contract negotiations with him as 'lip service', and stated the Bears had little intention to re-sign him. In 2015, Urlacher told ESPN that he still respected the Bears organization and front office, but has yet to speak to Emery, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Several {{weeks after}} the {{departure}} of those assistants, reports began to surface that O'Brien had interviewed for the Houston Texans' head coaching position to replace Gary Kubiak, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> late in the season. Subsequently, the two sides were reported to be negotiating a contract, and on January 3, 2014, the Texans {{held a press conference}} announcing O'Brien as their new head coach. Assistant head coach and wide receivers coach Stan Hixon, safeties coach Anthony Midget, defensive coordinator John Butler, running backs coach Charles London, and strength coach Craig Fitzgerald submitted resignations on January 6, and most were expected to follow O'Brien to the NFL, leaving only offensive line coach Mac McWhorter, who was 63 years old and came out of retirement to coach at Penn State, defensive line coach Larry Johnson, a long-time member of the staff, and tight ends coach John Strollo, as assistant coaches on the staff, and thus making Penn State more attractive of a coaching position to a new coach, as he could bring in his own staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounting}} department features Angela Martin, an admitted uptight and hypocritical woman {{who wishes to}} keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as serious as possible; Kevin Malone, a lovable, but dim-witted man who revels in juvenile humor and frequently indulges himself with gambling and M and Oscar Martinez is intelligent but often patronizing and whose homosexuality and Hispanic heritage made him a favorite target for Michael's unintentional off-color comments. Rounding out the office are the stern salesman Stanley Hudson, who barely stood for Michael's constant references to his Black-American heritage (he also doesn't like {{to take part in}} time wasting meetings and sometimes sleeps in them or works on crossword puzzles); eccentric quality assurance representative Creed Bratton; the kind and caring saleswoman Phyllis Lapin-Vance, who marries Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration across the hall from the office; Andy Bernard is a salesman introduced in season three after the closing of the Stamford, Connecticut branch of Dunder Mifflin and the merging of the two; the bubbly and talkative customer service representative Kelly Kapoor; the promiscuous alcoholic supply relations representative Meredith Palmer; human resources representative Toby Flenderson, who is admittedly hated by, and often the target of abuse by Michael Scott; warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin; Warehouse dock worker and Pam's ex-fiancé Roy Anderson, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> in the third season; and Michael's former love interest and former Vice President for Regional Sales for Dunder Mifflin Jan Levinson (Jan Levinson-Gould until her divorce in season 2).|$|E
