2500|$|Some mathematicians have {{attempted}} to correct this misunderstanding of Cantor's work. In 1930, the set theorist Abraham Fraenkel stated that Cantor's method is [...] "… a method that incidentally, contrary to a widespread interpretation, is fundamentally constructive and not merely existential." [...] In 1972, Irving Kaplansky wrote: [...] "It is often said that Cantor's proof is not 'constructive,' and so does not yield a tangible transcendental number. This remark is not justified. If <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> definite listing of all algebraic numbers … and then apply the diagonal procedure …, we get a perfectly definite transcendental number (it could be computed to any number of decimal places)." ...|$|E

He became the Chair of Finance, {{responsible}} for the GLC's £3,000,000,000 budget, and was Ken Livingstone's deputy leader. In an interview with Ronan Bennett for The Guardian newspaper, he described his role during this time as being [...] "to translate policies into concrete realities on the ground". He further discussed his performance by indicating, [...] "I was a fairly hard-nosed administrator.

2500|$|Following their {{breakthrough}} 1997 album King of Fools, Delirious? started recording Mezzamorphis in February 1998, {{and continued}} to record throughout that year, interspersed with summer tours throughout the US and UK. The band began recording with roughly half the songs already written, and continued writing as they recorded. Most of the recording took place in an old school in West Sussex. In the words of lead vocalist Martin Smith, [...] "We turned a classroom into a control room, {{and there were some}} wooden rooms where students used to dine, in which <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> drum kit with different mike positions. We did the bulk of it there {{for the first six months}} in between touring. In the end, we went to a smaller studio in Ford just to finish it off." [...] The band used movable drapes to experiment with different drum sounds and reverbs; most of the drums on the album are thus natural and unprocessed.|$|E
2500|$|Neuro-linguistic {{programming}} (NLP) is {{an approach}} to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please tell us about that. RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't there a way to maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't need them to see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where <b>we</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases. Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started.
