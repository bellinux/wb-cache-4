5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of <b>welfare</b> <b>economics</b> {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

25|$|<b>Welfare</b> <b>economics</b> is a {{normative}} branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques to simultaneously determine the allocative efficiency within an {{economy and the}} income distribution associated with it.

25|$|The {{idea that}} the {{ultimate}} good exists and is not orderable but is globally measurable is reflected in various ways in economic (classical economics, green economics, <b>welfare</b> <b>economics,</b> gross national happiness) and scientific (positive psychology, the science of morality) well-being measuring theories, all of which focus on various ways of assessing progress towards that goal, a so-called genuine progress indicator.

25|$|Bentham's {{opinions}} about monetary economics were {{completely different from}} those of David Ricardo; however, they had some similarities to those of Henry Thornton. He focused on monetary expansion as a means of helping to create full employment. He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving, propensity to consume, the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern <b>welfare</b> <b>economics.</b>|$|E
25|$|On a {{utilitarian}} basis, {{which has}} traditionally been used in <b>welfare</b> <b>economics,</b> an argument {{can be made for}} richer countries taking on most of the burdens of mitigation (Halsnæs et al., 2007). However, another result is possible with a different modeling of impacts. If an approach is taken where the interests of poorer people have lower weighting, the result {{is that there is a}} much weaker argument in favour of mitigation action in rich countries. Valuing climate change impacts in poorer countries less than domestic climate change impacts (both in terms of policy and the impacts of climate change) would be consistent with observed spending in rich countries on foreign aid (Hepburn, 2005; Helm, 2008:229).|$|E
