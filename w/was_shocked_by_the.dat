5|$|The Australian public <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> revelation by a turncoat Russian officer, {{who claimed}} that a direct {{engagement}} was secretly planned by Russia in case the Confederacy was recognised by Britain. The Russian navy had just paid Australia a visit in preparation for launching attacks. Fear of a possible military confrontation led to a massive buildup of coastal defences and to the acquisition of an ironclad warship.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly {{lived on a}} farm and was then hired as a municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s {{was very different from}} the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and the miserable effects of unemployment and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news of a military coup d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or hopelessness of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E
5|$|Only {{very late}} {{on the night of}} 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels, he {{received}} a dispatch from the Prince of Orange and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on Quatre Bras, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.|$|E

5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|Ending {{his playing}} career, Bauer became coach, {{general manager and}} {{president}} of the Dutchmen in 1952. He coached the team to two OHA senior championships and Allan Cup victories: 1952–53 and 1954–55. As the top senior team in the nation, the Dutchmen were sent to Italy to represent Canada at the 1956 Winter Olympics. Bauer was pleased with the way his team adapted to European rules and the Dutchmen were expected to bring home the gold medal. However, the team <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> American entry, a 4–1 loss. Though they still had a chance at gold due to the round robin format of the tournament, the Dutchmen were defeated by the Soviet Union – at the time a relatively unknown and emerging hockey power – by a 2–0 score despite outshooting the Soviets 23–9. Canada was relegated to the bronze medal, at the time the worst finish in the nation's Olympic hockey history.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{turnaround}} from a 281 {{season in}} 1992 {{was the largest}} single-season turnaround in school history and was the second-best {{in the country that}} year. Tech hoped to improve upon a 14 all-time record in bowl games, while Indiana hoped to do likewise for its 34 historical bowl-game record. In the week prior to the game, bad weather in Virginia caused travel delays that prevented many fans and the Virginia Tech marching band from arriving at the game early. Two days prior to the Independence Bowl, Tech <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death of Dr. Richard Bullock, who served as the team's physician from 1971 to 1988. Bullock designed a special football neck protector worn by players during the 1980s and 1990s before being phased out in favor of more advanced padding.|$|E

25|$|While many locals <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{senseless}} killing, others {{rallied to}} Ison's defense. About 100 locals attended Ison's bond hearing {{and offered to}} help pay his bond.|$|R
5|$|Woods' {{performance}} {{continued to}} suffer in 2011, {{taking its toll}} on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament, where he tied for fourth place. Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops on the PGA Tour. In July, he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams (who <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell. After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell {{to a low of}} #58. He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} sets of {{the boats}} were not built specifically for the programme, but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses. Cumming had originally hoped to simulate the rocking of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs, with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead. The photo of Tegan's Aunt Vanessa, one of the items created by Marriner from the contents of her mind, was shot specifically for the filming, requiring Dolore Whiteman (who had played the character in Logopolis) to be contracted for a one-day photoshoot. The models {{of the boats}}, used in the racing sequences, were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum. The ships were mounted on rods for filming, while the oars were battery operated. The model of Davey's ship remained intact, with explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence. Kelt <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dilapidated state of the TARDIS console prop, and was worried about damaging it while filming the explosion from Part One, and asked producer John Nathan-Turner if he could replace it but was told {{there was no money}} available.|$|E

50|$|The {{streaker}} later filed {{a police}} report, although the molestation charges {{have since been}} dropped. Some parents <b>were</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> incident as the show was targeted at families as well.|$|R
25|$|Europe <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> attack, since King Carlos {{was highly}} {{regarded}} by other European heads of state. The Lisbon regicide hastened {{the end of}} the monarchy by placing D. Manuel II on the throne and throwing the monarchical parties against one another.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} leader publicly to {{join the}} nationalist Dange faction was A.K. Gopalan, the deputy leader of the Communist group in Lok Sabha. He was quoted by a newspaper that he(Gopalan) <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 'Ladakh incident', lamenting the loss of Indian lives, and stating that the country would support Nehru {{in his efforts to}} avoid any repetition of it.|$|E
25|$|The Protestant Ascendancy <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{events of}} the 1790s, as was the British government. In {{response}} to them, in 1801 under the Irish Act of Union, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland the Irish Parliament voted itself out of existence and Dublin lost its political status as a capital.|$|E

25|$|Turmoil in Becker's {{personal}} life also interfered. His girlfriend {{died of a}} drug overdose in their Upper West Side apartment, and he was sued for $17 million. Becker settled out of court, but he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> accusations and by the tabloid press coverage that followed. Soon after, Becker {{was struck by a}} taxi while crossing a Manhattan street, shattering his right leg in several places and forcing him to use crutches.|$|E
25|$|He also chewed tobacco as a {{protection}} against infection, and worried that wig-makers might be using {{hair from the}} corpses as a raw material. Furthermore, it was Pepys who suggested that the Navy Office should evacuate to Greenwich, although he did offer to remain in town himself. He later took great pride in his stoicism. Meanwhile, Elisabeth Pepys was sent to Woolwich. She {{did not return to}} Seething Lane until January 1666, and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sight of St Olave's churchyard, where 300 people had been buried.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the conquest}} of Crete was {{considered}} a grandiose victory of the airborne corps, the German leadership focused on the heavy losses incurred. The German Air Ministry <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of transport aircraft lost, and Student, reflecting on the casualties suffered by the paratroopers, concluded after the war that Crete was {{the death of the}} airborne force. Hitler, believing airborne forces to be a weapon of surprise which had now lost that advantage, concluded that the days of the airborne corps were over and directed that paratroopers should be employed as ground-based troops in subsequent operations in the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|Alongside his passionate {{antipathy}} towards Germany, Kipling was privately deeply {{critical of}} how the war was fought by the British Army, complaining as early as October 1914 that Germany should have been defeated by now, and something must be wrong with the British Army. Kipling, who <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> heavy losses that the British Expeditionary Force had taken by the autumn of 1914, blamed the entire pre-war generation of British politicians, who he argued had failed to learn {{the lessons of the}} Boer War. As a result, thousands of British soldiers were now paying with their lives for their failure in the fields of France and Belgium.|$|E
25|$|Public opinion <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{departure}} of Talaat Pasha, {{even though he}} had been known to turn a blind eye on corrupt ministers appointed because of their associations to the CUP. Talaat Pasha had a reputation for being courageous and patriotic, the type of individual who would willingly face the consequences of his actions. With the occupation of Constantinople Izzet Pasha resigned. Tevfik Pasha took the position of grand vizier the same day that British ships entered the Golden Horn. Tevfik Pasha lasted until 4 March 1919, replaced by Ferid Pasha whose first order was the arrest of leading members of the CUP.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Japan's policy of {{national}} isolation in the Edo period, in 1862 Takasugi was {{ordered by the}} domain to go secretly to Shanghai in China to investigate the state of affairs {{and the strength of}} the Western powers. Takasugi's visit coincided with the Taiping Rebellion, and he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> effects of European imperialism even on the Chinese Empire. Takasugi returned to Japan convinced that Japan must strengthen itself to avoid being colonized by the western powers, or to suffer a similar fate as China. This coincided with the growing Sonnō Jōi ('expel the barbarians and revere the Emperor') movement, which attracted certain radical sections of Japan's warrior class and court nobility, and Takasugi's ideas found ready support in Chōshū and other parts of Japan.|$|E
