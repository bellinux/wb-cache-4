25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the <b>work</b> <b>you</b> do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E

[...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation.

500|$|Before Hendrix was 19 years old, law {{enforcement}} authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars. When given a choice between spending time in prison or joining the Army, he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord, California, {{he was assigned to}} the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He arrived there on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father: [...] "There's nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks, then when you go to jump school... you get hell. They <b>work</b> <b>you</b> to death, fussing and fighting." [...] In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar at his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan's house in Seattle, asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible, stating: [...] "I really need it now." [...] His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words [...] "Betty Jean" [...] to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties, which led to verbal taunting and physical abuse from his peers, who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return.|$|E
500|$|New Phillies' bench coach Larry Bowa said, [...] "(Asche) {{reminds me}} of a younger Chase Utley, he gets real mad when he misses a ball, he wants to make every play, he wants to go out and <b>work,</b> <b>you</b> can't hit enough groundballs to him ... he's got a great {{attitude}} ... that kind of energy can invigorate a ball club." [...] Marcus Hayes, a writer for the Philadelphia Daily News concurred with Bowa's comparison of Asche to Utley, calling their similarities [...] "eerie", and writing, [...] "Already, Asche's solution to failure is to ignore fatigue; to work harder; to improve at all costs. His objective is not necessarily to hit home runs, or to hit a big payday, but, rather, to make sure he can beat out a ground ball in late September. Sound familiar?" [...] Sal Rende, the hitting coach for the Phillies' AAA affiliate, noted that Asche also has solid intangibles, including makeup and work ethic, garnering yet another comparison to Utley. For his part, Asche said that while he appreciates the comparison, he wants to be his own player. Asche's determination and work ethic contributed to his fast ascent through the Phillies minor league system. He is a perfectionist, who recalled a game in which he made three fielding errors as his most memorable game with the big league Phillies.|$|E
500|$|On January 10, 1956, Presley {{made his}} first {{recordings}} for RCA in Nashville. Extending the singer's by now customary backup of Moore, Black, and Fontana, RCA enlisted pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Chet Atkins, and three background singers, including first tenor Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, {{to fill out the}} sound. The session produced the moody, unusual [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", released as a single on January 27. Parker finally brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance, on January 28, introduced by disc jockey Bill Randle, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem [...] "Blue Suede Shoes". In February, Presley's [...] "I Forgot to Remember to Forget", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, {{reached the top of the}} Billboard country chart. Neal's contract was terminated and, on March 2, Parker became Presley's manager. Gladys Presley was worried about how the fans were reacting to Presley and had hardly been to any of her son's performances because she was worried he was going to get hurt, she remarked to him repeatedly: [...] "Elvis, the Colonel is going to <b>work</b> <b>you</b> to your death.

500|$|Jude Law {{stars as}} Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] Sullivan, a.k.a. Sky Captain: He {{commands}} a private air force {{known as the}} Flying Legion. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would <b>work.</b> <b>You</b> know, the kind of bickering [...] I always {{like to call it}} The African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet wanted to work with Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. [...] Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and [...] Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby, the Edge {{separated from his}} wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely <b>work.</b> <b>You</b> know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E
500|$|Heavy {{criticism}} was {{directed toward the}} script, dialogue, and cutscene length. McShea felt that the unskippable cutscenes and [...] "the overabundance of story in Other M were a negative deviation from Metroid tradition". Kollar states that they [...] "often run as long as 15 minutes, exhausting players with repetition of obvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interesting as a teenager’s diary". Justin Haywald of 1UP.com complained that as the game progresses [...] "instead of getting more {{of the things that}} <b>work</b> , <b>you</b> get more of the things you don't care about [...] ". Donlan notes that the plot is considered as [...] "the future's dumbest soap opera". Wolinsky echoes the misgivings about Samus' immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty. Tae K. Kim of GamePro writes that while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, [...] "it helped contextualize her entire existence" [...] which developed the character to [...] "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past". Contrarily, Haywald found the portrayal [...] "lifeless and boring" [...] and [...] "nonsensical". G4tv's Abbie Heppe was critical on Samus's portrayal; she wrote that Samus [...] "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man", and found that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals. In Zero Punctuation, Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw derided the game's story as a [...] "bloated, cancerous mass [...] turning [...] into a shrieking mimsy in a submissive relationship with a bellend in a fancy cap." [...] Croshaw also states that the gameplay is [...] "infinitely stronger [...] in that it's merely bad." ...|$|E
