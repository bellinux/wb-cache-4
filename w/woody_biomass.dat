5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from <b>woody</b> <b>biomass.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to compare mass loss and chemical evolution of the solid phase, versus time, during dynamic torrefaction {{of different types of}} biomass. For this purpose, two experiments, ThermoGravimetric Analysis and solid-state 13 C Cross-Polarization/Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, were run on four representative biomasses. Overall mass loss and chemical evolution of the solid phase were followed, respectively, as a function of temperature and time. Thanks to this coupled information, it was shown that the knowledge of both solid mass loss and chemical evolution is necessary to characterize torrefaction severity. Moreover, biomasses containing higher proportions of xylan lost mass faster than those containing lower proportions. Lignin showed a protecting role towards cellulose, which would lead to a faster degradation of non-woody biomasses in comparison with <b>woody</b> <b>biomasses.</b> Three parameters would have an influence on solid chemical evolution during torrefaction: xylan content in hemicellulose, lignin content in biomass, and cellulose crystallinity.

40|$|Deforestation and {{degradation}} of tropical forests {{is one of}} the main concerns in relation to land use change in Indonesia (Wicke et al., 2011). In the past 30 years much tropical forests are changed into agricultural lands, mainly oil palm plantations (Palmer & Engel, 2007; Fitzherbert et al., 2008; Hansen et al., 2009; Koh and Wilcove, 2008; Wicke et al., 2011). As a result primary forests are declining and secondary forests are increasing in size and numbers (Brown & Lugo, 1990, Kenzo et al., 2009 a,b). To be able to make an assessment of the rate of deforestation or land use change measurements of forest biomass are done. This is of importance for initiatives like REDD+ and governmental agencies that validate the carbon stock of forests (Mitchard et al., 2011). Specifically for the financial rewards that are provided for sequestered carbon or for the emission reduction from management of terrestrial biomass it is of importance to have a reliable, accurate and cost-effective method of measuring and monitoring carbon stocks, carbon fluxes and deforestation rates (Gibbs et al., 2007; Mitchard et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2011; Salimon et al., 2011). Biomass can be measured by using two methods: field measurements (Ketterings et al., 2001; Kenzo et al., 2009 a) and remote sensing techniques (Santos et al., 2002; Lu, 2006; Mitchard et al., 2009). The results of these forest biomass measurements can be linked to carbon stocks and fluxes, because forests extract carbon from the atmosphere and store it as biomass. ALOS PALSAR is a satellite with sensor that can be used for the creation of forest woody AGB images. However, the influence of small trees on the ALOS PALSAR imagery in relation to the woody AGB is not known. To enhance the accuracy of this relationship it is important that allometric equations for secondary forests are created, specified and validated. Therefore the aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the ALOS PALSAR backscatter and the woody AGB of secondary forests in East-Kalimantan, calculated using trees with a DBH > 10 cm and > 1 cm. The allometric equations of Ketterings et al. (2001) and Kenzo et al. (2009 a) are applied. Additionally the allometric equations of Ketterings et al. (2001) and Kenzo et al. (2009 a) are compared for the woody AGB in order to examine the applicability and difference between the two allometric equations. In this research <b>woody</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> measurements are done in secondary forests in East-Kalimantan, Indonesia. In three locations: Bukit Soeharto (secondary education forest), KRUS (secondary education forest) and PT REA (secondary forests nearby and inside an oil palm plantation). The field measurements (diameter and height) are converted into <b>woody</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> values with the use of the allometric equations of Ketterings et al. (2001) and Kenzo et al. (2009 a). The calculated <b>woody</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> results are then linked to the ALOS PALSAR (2009) backscatter, and relationships and differences are examined. This research concluded that there is a significant difference in the total woody AGB of secondary forests in East-Kalimantan when comparing the results of the allometric equations of Ketterings et al. (2001) and Kenzo et al. (2009 a). This is the result of different field locations and types of secondary forests from which the allometric equations of Ketterings et al. (2001) and Kenzo et al. (2009 a) are derived. In addition there is a significant difference in the total <b>woody</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> calculated using trees with a DBH > 1 or trees with a DBH > 10 cm. This difference is not related to the allometric equations. This result indicates that the total <b>woody</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> of small trees ( 10 cm. There is only a significant relationship found between the backscatter of band 2 of the ALOS PALSAR (2009) and the total <b>woody</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> calculated using trees with a DBH> 1 cm and trees with a DBH > 10 cm in PT REA. However, it is expected that Bukit Soeharto and KRUS also have a significant relationship but due to the small amount of data no significant relationship is found. To conclude, the best relationship between the backscatter of the ALOS PALSAR (2009) is established with the use of band 2 backscatter and the total <b>woody</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> of secondary forests calculated using trees with a DBH > 10 cm. Nevertheless it is advisable that more research is conducted on the relationship between the ALOS PALSAR imagery and woody AGB of secondary forests. This research for example only focused on East-Kalimantan. It would be recommendable that this relationship is examined for more locations and different types of secondary forest. More research will increase the possibility for the implication of the ALOS PALSAR imagery for <b>woody</b> above ground <b>biomass</b> identification on difference scales, which would be desirable for initiatives like REDD+ and governmental agencies...|$|R
40|$|Substrates Preparation from <b>Woody</b> Tropical Waste <b>Biomass</b> for Bio{{hydrogen}} Production. Addressing to {{the global}} warming problem, energy crisis and pollution, hydrogen production by micro-organisms using biotechnological approach should be considered, since it fulfils the recent society requirement to safely produce, renewable and environmental friendly energy. Hydrogen {{is one of the}} most promising green energy sources, because it is easily converted to electricity and cleanly combustible. There are three types of micro-organisms for hydrogen production, the first is cyanobacteria through the photosynthesis process, the second is anaerobic bacteria, which use organic substances as electron donor and energy and convert them to hydrogen, the third is photosynthetic bacteria, somewhat between photosynthetic and anaerobic bacteria, which are capable of converting the organic substances to hydrogen at a fairly high rate. We propose to use the abundant waste biomasses in Indonesia for hydrogen production by the microbial system. Our focus research is the production of hydrogen from waste biomasses by two-stage fermentation systems, which combine the conversion process of monomer biomasses to lactic acid by Lactobacillus sp. and the conversion process of lactic acid to hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria. In this research, two kind substrates preparation were apply for <b>woody</b> waste <b>biomass</b> such as chemical hydrolysis and biological methods with several treatments.

40|$|As the {{atmosphere}} warms, precipitation events are becoming less frequent but more intense. A three-year experiment in Kruger National Park, South Africa, found that fewer, more intense precipitation events encouraged woody plant encroachment. To test {{whether or not}} these treatment responses persisted over time, here, we report results from all five years of that experiment. Grass growth, woody plant growth, total fine root number and area and hydrologic tracer uptake by grasses and woody plants were measured in six treated plots (8 m by 8 m) and six control plots. Treatment effects on soil moisture were measured continuously in one treated and one control plot. During the fourth year, increased precipitation intensity treatments continued to decrease water flux in surface soils (0 - 10 cm), increase water flux in deeper soils (20 + cm), decrease grass growth and increase woody plant growth. Greater root numbers at 20 - 40 cm and greater woody plant uptake of a hydrological tracer from 45 - 60 cm suggested that woody plants increased growth by increasing root number and activity (but not root area) in deeper soils. During the fifth year, natural precipitation events were large and intense so treatments had little effect on precipitation intensity or plant available water. Consistent with this effective treatment removal, {{there was no difference in}} grass or woody growth rates between control and treated plots, although <b>woody</b> plant <b>biomass</b> remained higher in treated than control plots due to treatment effects in the previous four years. Across the five years of this experiment, we found that 1) small increases in precipitation intensity can result in large increases in deep (20 - 130 cm) soil water availability, 2) plant growth responses to precipitation intensity are rapid and disappear quickly, and 3) because <b>woody</b> plants accumulate <b>biomass,</b> occasional increases in precipitation intensity can result in long-term increases in <b>woody</b> plant <b>biomass</b> (i. e., shrub encroachment).
