5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering <b>with</b> <b>eating</b> and drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (marbling) and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in similar conditions. Marbling, together with tenderness and flavour, has been associated <b>with</b> <b>eating</b> quality in some countries, and attracts a higher quality grading with associated premiums, although the link between marbling and palatability is not universally supported. In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat {{is considered to be}} of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed conversion efficiency and yield associated with higher marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different and conflicting production demands.|$|E

5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} <b>with</b> <b>eating</b> and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To further refine our {{understanding}} of impulsivity, obsessions, and compulsions in anorexia nervosa (AN) by isolating which behaviours [...] binge eating, purging, or both [...] are associated with these features. METHODS: We conducted regression analyses <b>with</b> binge <b>eating,</b> purging, and the interaction of binge <b>eating</b> <b>with</b> purging as individual predictors of scores for impulsivity, obsessions, and compulsions in two samples of women with AN (n[*]=[*] 1373). RESULTS: Purging, but not binge <b>eating,</b> was associated <b>with</b> higher scores on impulsivity, obsessions, and compulsions. Purging was also associated <b>with</b> worst <b>eating</b> rituals and <b>with</b> worst <b>eating</b> preoccupations. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that purging, compared <b>with</b> binge <b>eating,</b> may be a stronger correlate of impulsivity, obsessions, and compulsions in AN...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Adipose {{tissue is}} the largest {{endocrine}} organ, composed of subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the latter being highly associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). Expansion of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is linked to CAD. One way of assessing the CAD risk is with low-cost anthropometric measures, although they are inaccurate and cannot discriminate between VAT and SAT. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate (1) the relationship between EAT thickness, SAT thickness and anthropometric measures in a cohort of patients assessed at the cardiology unit and (2) determine predictive power of anthropometric measures and EAT and SAT thickness in establishment of CAD. Methods. Anthropometric measures were obtained from 53 CAD and 42 non-CAD patients. Vascular and structural statuses were obtained with coronarography and echocardiography, as well as measurements of the EAT and SAT thickness. Results. Anthropometric measures showed moderate positive correlation <b>with</b> <b>EAT</b> and SAT thickness. Anthropometric measures and SAT follow nonlinear S curve relationship <b>with</b> <b>EAT.</b> Strong nonlinear power curve relationship was observed between EAT and SAT thinner than 10 [*]mm. Anthropometric measures and EAT and SAT were poor predictors of CAD. Conclusion. Anthropometric measures and SAT have nonlinear relationship <b>with</b> <b>EAT.</b> EAT thickness and anthropometric measures have similar CAD predictive value...|$|R

25|$|Tooth decay, {{also known}} as dental caries or cavities, is a {{breakdown}} of teeth due to acids made by bacteria. The cavities may {{be a number of}} different colors from yellow to black.

25|$|If the lesions are mild, {{the patient}} {{will be subject}} to a good deal of pain. If the lesions are severe, the overall quality of life is devastating.

Although IGF-1 is not absorbed intact by the body, it does stimulate the production of IGF-1 when taken as a supplement.|$|E

25|$|BMI {{categories}} are {{generally regarded as}} a satisfactory tool for measuring whether sedentary individuals are underweight, overweight, or obese with various exceptions, such as: athletes, children, the elderly, and the infirm. Also, {{the growth of a}} child is documented against a BMI-measured growth chart. Obesity trends can then be calculated from the difference between the child's BMI and the BMI on the chart. In the United States, BMI is also used as a measure of underweight, owing to advocacy on behalf of those <b>with</b> <b>eating</b> disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{executive}} functions of obese individuals <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> disorder. METHOD: Thirty-eight obese individuals <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> disorder were compared to thirty-eight obese controls without binge eating disorder in terms of their executive functions. All individuals were assessed using the following instruments: Digit Span, Trail Making Tests A and B, Stroop Test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. In addition, four subtests from the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome Battery were also used, namely the Zoo Map Test, the Modified Six Elements Test, the Action Program Test and the Rule Shift Cards Test. RESULTS: When compared to obese controls, obese individuals <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> disorder presented significant impairment in the following tests: Digit Span backward, Zoo Map Test, Modified Six Elements Test, and Action Program Test. Subjects <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> disorder also showed significant more set shifting and perseverative errors in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. In other measures such as the Digit Span Forward, the Trail Making Test, the Stroop Test and the Rule Shift Cards Test, obese subjects <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> disorder did not differ significantly from obese subjects without binge eating disorder. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, in the present sample, obese individuals <b>with</b> binge <b>eating</b> disorder presented executive deficits, especially impairments relating to problem-solving, cognitive flexibility and working memory...|$|R
