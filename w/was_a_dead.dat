In a post on his blog, Eiland-Hall's lawyer Marc Randazza described the case as a victory for freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|When Marsh's cricket career {{ended in}} 1905, he resumed {{professional}} sprinting; in 1906, he ran against Arthur Postle {{at a meeting}} organised by John Wren in Melbourne. The race was organised to give Postle, then Australia's fastest man, a chance to break the 100-yard world record. In front of 12,000 spectators on a wet track, Marsh starting from a two-yard start maintained an early lead until Postle caught him on the line. Postle was declared the winner with a 10-second time, but some observers claimed that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> heat. He retired from competitive sport after the race.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Torres was {{selected}} for Spain's UEFA Euro 2012 squad and won the Golden Boot award for his three goals scored at the tournament. He netted a brace against the Republic of Ireland before scoring the fourth goal in a 4–0 win over Italy in the final. Torres' goal against the Italians was his second in the final of a European Championship. The following year, Torres scored five goals at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. His tally, which included a four-goal haul against Tahiti, earned him another Golden Boot award. He was then included in Spain's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and scored against Australia in a 3–0 group-stage victory. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> rubber match for Spain, however, as their elimination from the competition had already been confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Taaramäe took fourth overall at Paris–Nice in March, {{winning the}} youth {{classification}} with this performance, which was easily the strongest for an Estonian rider in the event's history. Taaramäe {{turned in a}} similar strong ride at the two-day, three-stage Critérium International, finishing on the event's final podium in third place, and securing the youth classification. At the concurrent Volta a Catalunya, Dumoulin took two stage wins. The first was in stage 5, on an uphill false flat finish which Dumoulin felt suited him well. The second was more unexpected, in that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> flat run in to the finish on wide roads, a more traditional field sprint. Dumoulin was delighted to win twice in front {{of some of the}} sport's biggest stars, and stated that his next goal would be a major spring classic, perhaps the Amstel Gold Race. Dumoulin, however, was not a factor at the Amstel, finishing 104th, over eight minutes behind the winner.|$|E

25|$|The stadium {{has hosted}} four One Day Internationals, {{two of them}} between India and England.

25|$|Intended to paralyse black {{opposition}} and prevent political violence, {{the state of}} emergency proved a self-fulfilling prophecy. State repression deepened black alienation from the regime and suggested to some that peaceful political organising <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end. With the black leadership in detention, the political vacuum was filled by the more militantly inclined. In July and October 1960 large-scale demonstrations and rioting broke out in black townships.|$|E

25|$|Ulrich Bonnell Phillips (November 4, 1877 – January 21, 1934) was an American {{historian}} who largely defined {{the field of}} the social and economic history of the antebellum American South and slavery. Phillips concentrated on the large plantations that dominated the Southern economy, and he did not investigate the numerous small farmers who held few slaves. He concluded that plantation slavery produced great wealth, but <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end, economically, that left the South bypassed by the industrial revolution underway in the North.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth and}} the final test match <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> rubber, ultimately, and this match began with one final {{opportunity}} for the Indian team to translate their individual performances into solid teamwork. The Australians on the other hand, had already won two successive matches against the tourists and their team had also gelled as one unit. Not only did their captain, Bradman lead with example, but the other team members also proved themselves equally adept. So this match saw the Indians playing with their honour at stake.|$|E

Mitchell Johnson was given his debut as Super Sub, coming in after Australia had batted to seven for 331 with four half-centuries. Johnson bowled nine overs for 64, {{without taking a}} wicket, and Scott Styris hit a hundred as New Zealand chased down the target for the highest {{successful}} run chase in ODI cricket thus far. This was also New Zealand's first win in their last eight one-day internationals.|$|E

25|$|The third quarter-final {{featured}} a storied and contentious rivalry. Russia played against Canada in {{a repeat of}} the quarter-finals at the 2010 Olympics, in which Canada embarrassed the Russians 7–3. The opening period <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> heat until a late goal by Maxim Afinogenov. Russia, still undefeated at the tournament, immediately overtook Canada in the second period, and led {{at one point in the}} third period by 4–0. Ilya Kovalchuk had a three-assist game and was a big boost for the Russians who won 5–2, following two late Canadian goals.|$|E
25|$|He was {{recalled}} to the England {{team for}} the final Test of the 1993 Ashes series. With Australia already 4–0 up it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> rubber, but he produced his first substantial innings for England by scoring 64 to help the team grab a consolation victory. This booked him {{a place on the}} subsequent tour of the West Indies. However, another string of low scores meant he was dropped and out of the selectors' plans. Ramprakash was not selected in the touring party for the 1994–95 Ashes series, but was chosen as vice-captain for the England A tour to India. However, an injury to Graeme Hick meant that he was flown out to play in the final Ashes Test scoring a useful 72. He {{was in and out of}} the England team over the next few years, never assured of selection but still scoring very heavily for Middlesex.|$|E
25|$|Tibet under Qing rule {{refers to}} the Qing dynasty's rule over Tibet from 1720 to 1912. During the Qing rule of Tibet, the region was structurally, militarily and {{administratively}} controlled by the Qing dynasty established by the Manchus in China. In the history of Tibet, Qing administrative rule was established after a Qing army defeated the Dzungars who occupied Tibet in 1720, and lasted until {{the fall of the}} Qing dynasty in 1912, although the region retained a degree of political autonomy under the Dalai Lamas. The Qing emperors appointed imperial residents known as the Ambans to Tibet, who commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in Lhasa and reported to the Lifan Yuan, a Qing government agency that oversaw the empire's frontier regions. The protectorate that China had established over Tibet in the 18th century remained into the 20th century, but by the late 19th century Chinese hegemony over Tibet remained in theory but in actuality <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> letter given the weight of China's domestic and foreign-relations burdens. However, the Chinese began to take steps to reassert their authority shortly after the British expedition to Tibet.|$|E

25|$|In 1864 Sturman married Emma Jessup (or Webb) (1846–1918) {{when he was}} 23 and she was 18 years old. They {{had nine}} children, of whom one died young. By 1871 Sturman was aged 30, still a {{schoolmaster}} and married to Emma aged 25, a schoolmistress born in Hackney, Whitechapel, Stepney or Mile End. They had two children aged six and five years, and were living at 145 Packington Street, then a ladies' school, at St Peter's, Islington. By 1881 there were eight children aged two to sixteen, of which the eldest was a civil servant clerk, and Sturman was still schoolmastering, although they had {{moved out of the}} school and were living at 68 Upper Tollington Park, Hornsey. They had moved around somewhat, as the three youngest of the children had been born in Penge, Sydenham, and Lee Place in Lewisham. By 1891 the family had two servants, and most of them (less two children) were living at 160 Holland Road, South Kensington. Sturman was now Hon. Secretary of the Society and Emma was Lady Secretary. Their daughter Florence <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> letter office clerk - a post which might have been useful at a Society which practised a form of pamphleting and received a great deal of returned mail. The other children were all clerks, except the youngest who was an apprentice electrical engineer. In 1899, Sturman died.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the games}} were completed, very few media outlets gave it attention, believing the Game Boy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> console; {{a general lack of}} {{interest}} of merchandising convinced Tajiri that Nintendo would reject the games. The Pokémon games were not expected to do well, but sales steadily increased until the series found itself among Nintendo's top franchises. Rumors of a hidden Pokémon creature named Mew, which could only be obtained by exploiting programming errors, increased interest in the game. Tajiri had included Mew in the game in order to promote trading and interaction between players, but Nintendo was not aware of the creature upon release. The franchise helped Nintendo's waning sales. Tajiri deliberately toned down violence in his games. In this vein, he designed Pokémon creatures to faint rather than die upon their defeat, as he believed it was unhealthy for children to equate the concept of death with losing a game. After the completion and release of Red and Blue in Japan, Tajiri later worked on 1997's Bushi Seiryūden: Futari no Yūsha. Tajiri continues {{to be involved in the}} more modern Pokémon titles as well. In the most recent incarnations, he supervised the process from start to finish and approved all the text. While developing games, Tajiri works irregular hours, often laboring 24 hours at a time and resting 12 hours.|$|E
