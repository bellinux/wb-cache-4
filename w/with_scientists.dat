5|$|In 2011, the National Science Foundation granted $11 {{million to}} modify an A-10 for weather {{research}} for CIRPAS at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and in collaboration <b>with</b> <b>scientists</b> from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM), replacing SDSM's retired North American T-28 Trojan.

He worked at the US Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II, where he researched naval mines. In 1943, he was recruited by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, he worked <b>with</b> <b>scientists</b> including Luis Alvarez, John von Neumann and George Kistiakowsky {{on the development of}} the high explosives and exploding-bridgewire detonators required by atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham's {{practice}} of leadership was different to his day-fighter counterparts. A day unit would fly in formation together, engage the enemy together, communicate by radio {{and follow the}} directions and example of their commanding officer in combat. Cunningham {{was not in a}} position to lead in this way. The night fighter was a lone hunter. When it took off the crew would operate alone in the air. Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch <b>with</b> <b>scientists</b> and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to fly on instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods. Rawnsley contributed with the use of AI and mock-interception using target aircraft were flown regularly.|$|E

5|$|However, by 1783 Forster {{saw that}} his {{involvement}} with the Rosicrucians not only led him away from real science, but also deeper into debt (it is {{said he was not}} good at money); for these reasons Forster was happy to accept a proposal by the Polish Komisja Edukacji Narodowej (Commission of National Education) and became Chair of Natural History at Vilnius University in 1784. Initially, he was accepted well in Vilnius, but he felt more and more isolated with time. Most of his contacts were still <b>with</b> <b>scientists</b> in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with Immanuel Kant about the definition of race. In 1785, Forster traveled to Halle where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine. Back in Vilnius, Forster's ambitions to build a real natural history scientific center could not get appropriate financial support from the Polish authorities. Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community. Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as Catherine II of Russia had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the Mulovsky expedition) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in Saint Petersburg. This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist Jędrzej Śniadecki. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left Vilnius. He then settled in Mainz, where he became head librarian of the University of Mainz, a position held previously by his friend Johannes von Müller, who made sure Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to the administration of Elector Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{observers}} {{believe that most}} bear species are near-sighted, which allows bears to forage for small objects such as berries.

Experiments show that black bears can see color, unlike many mammals. <b>With</b> <b>scientists</b> still working to determine exactly how perceptive bear eyes are, it is difficult to compare bear eyesight with human eyesight.|$|E
