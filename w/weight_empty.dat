Selection Nellore animals had, respectively, 360 and 430 kg of initial and slaughter body weight, and NeC animals had 318 and 373 kg for the same traits. Animals were slaughtered and empty body composition was determined by chemical analysis of the components blood, hide, head and feet, viscera and carcass.

Significant differences were detected between NeS and NeC animals for slaughter body <b>weight,</b> <b>empty</b> body <b>weight,</b> <b>empty</b> body gain rate, and contents of water, protein, ash and retained energy in empty body, showing that selected animals had greater body sizes and growth rates.

Control Nellore animals showed a 10 % higher gain in fat percentage than NeS in the period. This shows that the growth of bone and muscle ceased earlier and NeC group accumulated more fat.

30|$|The {{axle load}} of a wagon {{is the total}} wagon <b>weight</b> (<b>empty</b> wagon weight[*]+[*]load on the wagon) resting on the axle. Higher axle load means fewer {{requirements}} of wagons, which is good from the operator and customer point of view. Axle load is therefore an important design factor in the engineering of railways, designed to tolerate a maximum weight‐per‐axle (axle load). If it exceeds the maximum rated axle load, it will cause more damage to the track so, for infrastructure managers, a lower or safer axle load limit is desirable. In this regard [23] remind us that: ‘the negative impacts of increased axle loads occur primarily {{in the areas of}} track and bridge maintenance and renewal, and freight car maintenance’.|$|E

Forty eight yearling intact male Borana (n= 24) and Arsi-Bale (n= 24) goats were used in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement, the factors being breed-type (Borana and Arsi-bale) and feeding days (90, 120 and 150). The goats were slaughtered after 18 hours fasting to evaluate the various carcass traits. The carcasses were separated into leg, lion, rack, shoulder and neck and breast and shank primal cuts. The Borana goats possessed heavier live <b>weight,</b> <b>empty</b> body weight, carcass weight and length than the Arsi-Bale goats in the feedlot environment.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 30 - 31. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the traditional large metal waste carts currently in use in industry to a plastic waste cart with the same load capacity. This was done through initial pull force studies using a dynamometer and biomechanical evaluations of male industrial workers. The initial pull force study involved using a hand force dynamometer to measure the minimum initial pull force needed to move both the metal and plastic carts. Five different metal and three different plastic carts were tested this way on smooth concrete and rough asphalt surfaces, with switching of the wheels between the plastic and metal carts, with larger diameter wheels, and with varying loads inside the carts (O kg to 454 kg). The results showed a significant decrease in the required pull force with the plastic cart on both a smooth concrete (p= 0. 0001) and on a rough asphalt (p= 0. 0001) surface. The material of the cart and of the wheel on the plastic cart proved to be significant (both p= 0. 0001). However, the wheel diameter did not prove to be significant (p=O. 1039). The biomechanical study on industry workers also showed a significant reduction in the required pull force (P= 0. 0001). The study shows that a safe load limit for a large four-wheel cart is dependent on cart <b>weight</b> (<b>empty),</b> wheel bearings, and wheel diameter. Since all large fourwheel carts do not have the same cart <b>weight</b> (<b>empty),</b> wheel bearings, and wheel diameter, a safe load limit should not be established for all four-wheel carts. Rather a safe load limit would need to be created for each particular four-wheel cart. This study concludes that replacing the traditional metal waste carts with the lighter plastic carts would be extremely rough asphalt, where the carts are normally pushed and pulled, it takes twice as much force to move the metal carts as it does a plastic cart carrying the same load. This means by switching to the plastic carts workers will be reducing the amount of pull force exerted daily by 50 %. This should lead to a reduction in push/pull related injuries and a savings to the company...|$|E

Five levels of drought stress consisted: (D 1 = 50, D 2 = 100, D 3 = 150, D 4 = 200 and D 5 = 250 mm evaporation from class A evaporation pan). Results showed that grain yields were 5486, 4480, 3080, 2460 and 2260 kg per hectare for D 1 to D 5 respectively. Increasing water deficit levels decreased grain yield, oil percentage, no. of grain per head, 100 seed weight, dry weight, stem diameter, head diameter, leaf area index, relative water content, chlorophyll content.
