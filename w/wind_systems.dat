Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems. Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore <b>wind</b> <b>systems,</b> and must take into account every single one of these factors.

To alleviate this problem, it is required that the composite tape winding machines be designed such that the layers of composite are evenly wound on the previous one. The paper presents a novel design of flexible <b>winding</b> <b>system</b> for composite tape winding.

40|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> {{sets the}} {{operational}} {{conditions for the}} organ pipes. The pipe foot pressure is by nature very unsteady and {{is a result of}} the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> response to the activities of the organ player. Changing flows create propagating pressure waves. These are spread in the <b>wind</b> <b>system,</b> interact with each other and are reflected at the system boundaries. This investigation is in many aspects related to the newly reconstructed baroque organ in Örgryte Nya Kyrka, Göteborg, Sweden. The dynamic behaviour of the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> was studied by means of measurements and numerical simulations. The full scale laboratory test rig was used to illustrate component characteristics as well as system performance. Among the many results achieved, the very strong influence of the wind trunk length on the pallet box pressure is to be pointed out. Unlike pallet box pressures, transient pressures in the tone channel can easily be affected by the organ player by means of sensitive fingering at key attack and release. Computer simulations as well as test rig measurements confirm this behaviour and illustrate the impacts of several design parameters. By means of section valves, different <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> layouts were created and tested in Örgryte. The flexible system in Örgryte offers a certain amount of freedom to tune the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> to suit the type of music played. Furthermore, the influence of the type of wind supply (blower/bellows) was studied. The new arrangement with a speed controlled blower performed very well. All tests and simulations point out the dominant role of the wind trunks on the dynamic behaviour of the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> and the importance of the system layout. The numerical simulations proved to be most informative and principally correct.

It can be shown that the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> productivity and therefore the relative cost of the product which it produces is completely dependent on the wind regime under consideration. The mean wind speed, standard deviation, and wind profile are the most significant parameters {{to be used in the}} investigation of cost of product from a <b>wind</b> <b>system.</b> The purpose of this work is not to find an optimum <b>wind</b> <b>system,</b> but to give the reader enough information to make an informed decision as to whether or not a <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> configuration could meet the particular need under consideration; the <b>wind</b> <b>system</b> appropriate to a residential home owner is quite different from that for a dairy farmer, for example. The decision ultimately boils down to the cost of usable energy, i. e., cents/kwhr of those kwhrs thatcan be used. Various wind machines will be designed and priced. They will then be superimposed onto different wind regimes modeled by the Weibull distribution for a first approximation of the cost of product at that site using that machine. It will be clear that the same machine will have different cost effectiveness at different sites, and that the cost-ofuseful-energy-product will vary, site-to-site, for the same machine...|$|R
