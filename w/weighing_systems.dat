40|$|Abstract − This {{research}} {{deals with}} a <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> used under {{the conditions in which}} various movements exist. These various movements are heaving motion, rolling motion, pitching motion, etc. In this paper, these various movements are collectively called as “vibration-like movements”. The term of “vibration-like moving conditions” means the conditions in which vibration-like movements exist. In the previous paper[1], the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> which has 3 dummy loadcells is discussed. “Dummy loadcell ” is the loadcell which observes the vibration-like movements. We manufactured the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> and made several experiments with the <b>weighing</b> <b>system.</b> As a result of those experiments, it is confirmed that the proposed method is able to weigh under the vibration-like moving conditions accurately. The purpose of this research is the practical realization of the <b>weighing</b> <b>system.</b> In order to put the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> into practical use, it is needed to reduce the size and weight of the <b>weighing</b> <b>system.</b> Accelerometers are substituted for the dummy loadcells.

These various movements are heaving motion, rolling motion, pitching motion, etc. In this paper, these various movements are collectively called as “vibration-like movement”. The term of “vibration-like moving conditions” means {{the conditions in which}} vibration-like movements exist. In the previous paper [1], the new weighing method was proposed. This method basically requires 4 loadcells which observe the vibration-like moving conditions. These loadcells are called as “dummy loadcell”. Installing 3 dummy loadcells properly and estimating two angular velocities, this weighing method is feasible to measure the mass value of a weighed object by means of 3 dummy loadcells. In this paper, the estimating method of these velocities is explained in detail. We manufactured the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> which consists of a weighing loadcell and 3 dummy loadcells on trial. Several numerical simulations and experiments by using this <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> were conducted. It is confirmed that the estimation of the angular velocities is feasible and the accurate weighing under the vibration-like moving conditions is also feasible...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results obtained from density measurements of pure water produced at CENAM. This water is used as density standard for calibrations services. The measurements were done into a scheme of experimental design {{in order to find}} possible sources of variability in the hydrostatic <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> of the national density standard. The design factors checked were: days after the water is produced, positions of the solid density standards at the hydrostatic <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> and the spheres used. The variable of interest for the scheme of experimental design was the difference between the water density measured using the solid density standards and the water density calculated by the formula of M. Tanaka et al. [1]. The goal {{of this study is to}} estimate an uncertainty value associated to the water density used at CENAM calculated by the formula which includes the storage effect, and by other side evaluating the effects due to the spheres and positions of the sphere into the hydrostatic <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> of the national density standard...|$|R

The present work aimed at developing and evaluating a load cell-based <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> {{for use with}} small to medium size continuous weighing lysimeters. It was used a single 300 -kg capacity load cell whose signal was conditioned through a differential amplifier to an analogical signal varying from 1 to 5 V. The signal was then converted to digital number through an A/D converter working in the 0 to 10 V range. The A/D circuit allowed reading up to four analogical signals {{by means of a}} computer program developed for that purpose. To assess the performance of the <b>weighing</b> <b>system</b> the uncertainty parameters repeatability, hysteresis, linearity and overall accuracy were considered. The overall accuracy, which combines the effects of the other errors, was lower than 1 mm suggesting the suitability of the system for daily ET measurement with low-volume continuous weighing lysimeters.
