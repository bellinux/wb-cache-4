5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

25|$|In {{the light}} of King's {{powerful}} demagogic speech yesterday he stands {{head and shoulders above}} all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes.

25|$|Those {{representatives of}} the bourgeoisie who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture {{are a bunch of}} counter-revolutionary revisionists.

Some of them we have already seen through; others <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not.</b> Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khruschev for example, who are still nestling beside us.|$|E

25|$|While <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{shown the}} Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box {{and a dark}} box, neither one containing a circle. However we could put a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a unary operation.|$|E
25|$|The return {{excursion}} train {{which was}} due to leave London at ten minutes before twelve on Saturday night last arrived at Bourne between three and four o'clock on Sunday morning. When near the platform at Bourne station the engine came into violent collision with two empty carriages which were standing upon the line, driving them completely through two very strong gates at the South Street crossing, one of the gates being smashed to splinters, and the carriages considerably damaged. There were nine passengers (including two ladies) in the carriage attached to the engine and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> heard of anyone sustaining greater injury than a severe shaking. One gentleman's hat was smashed {{to such an extent}} that he has put in a claim for a new one.|$|E
25|$|It is our policy-and we have {{increasingly}} {{the means and}} the detailed plans {{to carry out this}} policy-to ensure that the Soviet leadership knows that if they chose some intermediate level of aggression, we could, by selective, large (but still less than maximum) nuclear attacks, exact an unacceptably high price in the things the Soviet leaders appear to value most--political and military control, military force both nuclear and conventional, and the industrial capability to sustain a war. In our planning <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> ignored the problem of ending the war, nor would we ignore it {{in the event of a}} war. And, of course, we have, and we will keep, a survivable and enduring capability to attack the full range of targets, including the Soviet economic base, if that is the appropriate response to a Soviet strike.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of Newton's law of gravity has enabled {{the acquisition of}} much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit galactic centers, galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E
