You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the <b>world,</b> <b>how</b> our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

This allowed showrunners Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage to deal with concepts such as superheroics and fantasy without explaining them to the audience, since they are already well established in the MCU, while still focusing on their own characters, which they described as [...] "liberating". Also that month, it was {{announced that}} Marvel and Netflix would complete production on 135 episodes by the end of 2017, making the deal the largest television production commitment in New York State. Production for the different series had engaged 500 local vendors and small businesses for various stages of development, and had required over 14,000 production-related hires.|$|E

In Outliers, Gladwell examines the {{factors that contribute to}} high levels of success. To support his thesis, he examines why the majority of Canadian ice hockey players are born in {{the first few months of}} the calendar year, how Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates achieved his extreme wealth, how The Beatles became one of the most successful musical acts in human history, [...] how Joseph Flom built Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom into one of the most successful law firms in the <b>world,</b> <b>how</b> cultural differences play a large part in perceived intelligence and rational decision making, and how two people with exceptional intelligence, Christopher Langan and J. Robert Oppenheimer, end up with such vastly different fortunes. Throughout the publication, Gladwell repeatedly mentions the [...] "10,000-Hour Rule", claiming that the key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours, though the authors of the original study this was based on have disputed Gladwell's usage.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix <b>world,</b> <b>how</b> do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Paine begins The Age of Reason {{by attacking}} revelation. Revelation, he maintains, {{can only be}} {{verified}} by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: [...] "it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it". He {{also points out that}} the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. [...] "The Bible of the Deist", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be [...] "creation". Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of The Age of Reason, he will do just this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible. For example Thomas Paine notes, [...] " [...] The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him {{to the top of a}} high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the <b>World.</b> <b>How</b> happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest?

500|$|A {{total of}} nine hundred people {{attended}} the event. Canadian Online Explorer writer Mark Xamin rated the entire event a {{six out of}} ten, which was lower than the {{seven and a half}} out of ten given to the 2007 Final Resolution event by Chris Sokol, but equal with the second Final Resolution held in December 2008 given by Bryan and Chris Sokol. Final Resolution's rating was lower than TNA's previous event Turning Point, which was given a six and half out of ten. It was also lower than the seven and half given to TNA's next event Against All Odds. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's Royal Rumble PPV event held on January 27, Final Resolution was rated lower as Royal Rumble was given an eight out of ten by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk. In Xamin's review two matches were rated an eight out of ten, his overall highest rating given in the review. The first was the TNA Women's Knockout Championship defense by Gail Kim against Awesome Kong in a No Disqualification match. Xamin felt it was an [...] "absolutely fantastic match" [...] and that they showed [...] "the <b>world</b> <b>how</b> good women's wrestling can be." [...] The second match given this score was the main event between Kurt Angle and Christian Cage for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Xamin felt it was a [...] "very solid match" [...] and that they put on a [...] "wrestling clinic." [...] The TNA World Tag Team Championship match and the Six Man Tag Team Ultimate X match were both rated six out of ten. Xamin stated that in the Tag Team Championship match [...] "Nash looked his age" [...] despite the efforts of Joe and Styles doing [...] "their best to carry the match"; although he felt it was still an [...] "entertaining segment." [...] Xamin also thought that due to Team 3D's creativity in the Ultimate X match they [...] "stole the show in a match they had no business being in." [...] Regarding the overall event, Xamin wrote that [...] "Final Resolution was more about advancing storylines and entertainment value than it was about watching good wrestling." [...] He also believed that Final Resolution had two [...] "stand-out matches (Gail Kim vs Awesome Kong and Angle vs Christian Cage)" [...] despite the rest of the card being [...] "lacklustre at best." ...|$|E
