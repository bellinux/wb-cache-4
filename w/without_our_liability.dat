Non-contractual liability {{is provided by}} our civil code, defining it as at fault or <b>without</b> fault <b>liability.</b> <b>Our</b> country, as a country in transition needs legal investment and its implementation into practice. One of the cases on which liability on damage compensation arises is {{the combination of the}} rights of persons, whose dignity has been infringed against the right that is explicitly sanctioned in the Constitution of the Republic of Albania, freedom of speech as well as thought, fundamental principles of law, but always without thereby infringing the dignity of a subject of law and and being faced with moral and material damages. In order to handle legally this issue as well as its civil legal consequences that threaten to influence on the entities that breach the law, but also their sensibilization. Hereafter I am handling the theoretical and legal way – the analysis of such a case, under legal - civil perspective...|$|R

40|$|The Challenge of Library Management: Leading with Emotional Engagement. By Wyoma VanDuinkerken and Pixey Anne Mosley, Chicago: American Library Association, 2011. 169 p. alk. paper, $ 52. 00 (ISBN 9780838911020). Authors VanDuinkerken and Mosley {{begin with}} {{the premise that the}} {{greatest}} challenge facing libraries is the recognition that, <b>without</b> change, <b>our</b> past strengths will become <b>our</b> <b>liabilities.</b> In nine brief chapters, the authors detail the unique challenges facing administrators and managers charged with leading change in a library environment. Through the translation and application of private sector corporate change management literature and research, the authors advise how to become an effective change leader in library environs. The structure of the book, well documented with over 150 sources, is effective for both new managers and seasoned managers in need of a refresher who may be charged with leading either small- or large-scale organizational changes...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} malpractice reforms on physician behavior using a new measure of liability risk and a nationally representative, individual-level data set on physician behavior. We match <b>our</b> <b>liability</b> measure to data on physician behavior from the Physician Practice Costs and Income Survey (PPCIS). Data from the PPCIS bracket a period of substantial state-level legal reform between 1983 and 1988, which provides identifying variation in <b>our</b> <b>liability</b> measure. We estimate the impact of liability reform on hours worked. We find an estimated elasticity of hours worked to liability exposure of -. 285 for the full sample of physicians. The effect for physicians ages 55 or older is much larger: we find an elasticity of - 1. 224 for this category. We find that an increase in $ 1 of expected liability {{is associated with a}} $. 70 -$ 1. 05 increase in malpractice premiums. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago.
