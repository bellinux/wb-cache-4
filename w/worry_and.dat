5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> scrutiny would prove to be for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E

Tom answers {{the door to}} Stevie, who asks Tom {{to come back to}} work. He is alarmed to see Tom call Gerri; Stevie says that Gerri was killed in a car accident, and that Tom went back to work too soon. Stevie heads to the bathroom to get Tom's medication, but freezes when he sees the corpse of Migg in the bath. Tom tells him not to <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> that Migg is not real. He invites Stevie to stay for coffee, saying Gerri is just boiling the kettle.|$|E

5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E
5|$|While in Vietnam, the {{veterans}} were {{told not to}} <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> were persuaded the chemical was harmless. After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects {{might be related to}} Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they had been exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.|$|E
5|$|In 683, Emperor Gaozong died. He was {{succeeded by}} Emperor Zhongzong, his eldest {{surviving}} son by Wu. Zhongzong tried to appoint his wife's father as chancellor: after only six {{weeks on the}} throne, he was deposed by Empress Wu in favor of his younger brother, 12-year-old Emperor Ruizong. This provoked a group of Tang princes to rebel in 684; Wu's armies suppressed them within two months. She proclaimed the Tianshou era of Wu Zhou on October 16, 690, and three days later demoted Emperor Ruizong to crown prince. He was also forced {{to give up his}} father's surname Li in favor of the empress's Wu. She then ruled as China's only empress. A palace coup on February 20, 705, forced her to yield her position on February 22. The next day, her son Zhongzong was restored to power; the Tang was formally restored on March 3. She died soon after. To legitimize her rule, she circulated a document known as the Great Cloud Sutra, which predicted that a reincarnation of the Maitreya Buddha would be a female monarch who would dispel illness, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> disaster from the world. She even introduced numerous revised written characters to the written language, which reverted to the originals after her death. Arguably {{the most important part of}} her legacy was diminishing the power of the northwest aristocracy, allowing people from other clans and regions of China to become more represented in Chinese politics and government.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} with Moran's book, the many illustrations it provides of a Churchill understandably plunged into temporary low mood by military defeats and other severely adverse developments constitute a compelling {{portrait of a}} great man reacting to, but not significantly impeded by, <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> overstrain, a compelling portrait that is entirely consistent with the portraits of others who worked closely with Churchill. Churchill did not receive medication for depression—the amphetamine that Moran prescribed for special occasions, especially for big speeches from the autumn of 1953 onwards, was to combat the effects of Churchill's stroke of that year.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century, the dissenting feminist voices had little to no social influence. There was little sign of change in the {{political}} or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women's movement. Collective concerns began to coalesce {{by the end of the}} century, paralleling the emergence of a stiffer social model and code of conduct that Marion Reid described as confining and repressive for women. While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> fueled opposing views.|$|E

25|$|To {{the jurors}} who voted to acquit him, Socrates gives encouragement: his supernatural daimonion did not {{interfere}} with his conduct of the legal defence, which he viewed {{as a sign that}} such a defence was the correct action. In that way, the daimonion communicated to Socrates that death might be a good thing; either death is annihilation (release from earthly <b>worry)</b> <b>and</b> not to be feared, or death is migration (higher plane of existence) in which reside the souls of personages and heroes, such as Hesiod and Homer and Odysseus. Socrates concludes his self-defence by saying to the court that he bears no ill-will, neither towards his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — nor the jurors. He asks that they ensure the well-being of his three sons, so that they learn to live ethically.|$|E
25|$|Venus {{revels in}} having the girl under her power, and turns Psyche {{over to her}} two handmaids, <b>Worry</b> <b>and</b> Sadness, to be whipped and tortured. Venus tears her clothes and bashes her head into the ground, and mocks her for conceiving {{a child in a}} sham marriage. The goddess then throws before her a great mass of mixed wheat, barley, poppyseed, chickpeas, lentils, and beans, {{demanding}} that she sort them into separate heaps by dawn. But when Venus withdraws to attend a wedding feast, a kind ant takes pity on Psyche, and assembles a fleet of insects to accomplish the task. Venus is furious when she returns drunk from the feast, and only tosses Psyche a crust of bread. At this point in the story, it is revealed that Cupid is also in the house of Venus, languishing from his injury.|$|E
25|$|Aggressiveness also {{arises from}} a need of space. Young pike {{tend to have}} their food robbed by larger pike. Pike are {{aggressive}} if not given enough space because they are territorial. They use a form of foraging known as sit-and-wait. Unlike species such as perch, pike undergo bursts of energy instead of actively chasing down prey. As such, {{a fair amount of}} inactive time occurs until they find prey. Hunting efficiency decreases with competition; the larger the pike, the larger the area controlled by that particular pike. An inverse relation to vegetation density and pike size exists, which is due to the possibility of cannibalism from the largest pike. This makes sense, as the smaller pike need more vegetation to avoid being eaten. Large pike do not have this <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> can afford the luxury of a large line of sight. They prefer a tree structure habitat.|$|E

25|$|In mid-January {{when the}} boy band Fahrenheit were guests on the Chinese program, Super Winners (超级大赢家), fans had filed {{complaints}} toward the host, Frankie Kao, for his disrespectful and careless attitude towards Fahrenheit and their fans. Fans listed their arguments, criticizing Kao for being contemptuous; before the program was to be recorded Fahrenheit and their fans {{had to wait for}} over two hours because Kao had to practice his dance for the opening; when Aaron Yan accidentally had his eyes burnt by fireworks, Kao completely ignored his injury and continued on with the program. When fans began to <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> cry, he became annoyed and screamed at the fans to shut up. Fans also complained that when Fahrenheit was dancing, Kao had caused them to NG many times and therefore they were required to dance several more times. Fans witnessed an extremely exhausted Jiro Wang, who was {{almost to the point of}} collapsing after dancing. The ill Wu Chun was also a victim; fans had witnessed Kao requiring Wu to do health-risking activities when Wu was sick with a fever.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Yamaguchi worked {{around a}} [...] "night" [...] theme, and was {{inspired}} by creating film-like imagery for each song. Yamaguchi wanted to compile lyrics featuring introspective feelings of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> sadness that people primarily felt at night. Yamaguchi was further inspired to write more autobiographically, creating a documentary-like non-fiction work. He wanted to create lyrics closer to the style of haiku than standard pop lyricisim, in order to express many things with as few phrases as possible.|$|E
500|$|The story {{complicates the}} common theme of {{transitioning}} to adulthood by examining this transition {{on a planet}} where individuals have no fixed gender identity. The narrator Sov goes {{through a period of}} intense <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> anxiety when she learns she is going to kemmer for the first time. After experiencing the kemmerhouse, however, she says that [...] "love is love", no matter whether a person is in kemmer or not. Thus, the story separates the idea of love from a person's sexual and gender identity.|$|E

500|$|The Giants 1988 season {{got off to}} a rough start due to an offseason scandal {{involving}} Lawrence Taylor. [...] Taylor had abused cocaine which {{violated the}} NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over the edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. This was especially true given the eventual career paths of talented players like Hollywood Henderson and Dexter Manley whose drug problems derailed their careers. However, after his return Taylor played at his normal All-Pro level, recording 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> scrutiny would prove to be for naught, as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor passed his drug tests and avoided suspension.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès, in a psychoanalytical {{analysis}} of Tintin in Tibet, observes that Tintin is more firmly {{in control of}} the plot than he was in earlier adventures. Apostolidès notes that the character displays <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> emotion not present previously, something he suggested showed Tintin sorting out the problems that he faced in life. In his analysis, he calls Tintin a [...] "foundling" [...] and his friend Chang [...] "the lost child" [...] and [...] "Tintin's twin... the heroes have to struggle to great heights to escape the temporality and pervasive values of [...] universe." [...] He saw the Yeti, who [...] "internalises certain human characteristics", as more complex than Hergé's previous bestial character, Ranko in The Black Island: [...] "The monster loves Chang with a love as unconditional as Tintin's love for his friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Another of the team's goals {{was to make}} players feel {{unsettled}} {{after playing}} the game, and present gameplay moments {{that would make them}} <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> feel vulnerable. The team incorporated survival horror elements into the game, which were also used in the first game. The game was described by THQ as their own [...] "bid to combat shooter fatigue" [...] using its heavy single-player story focus. According to Beynon the game's philosophy is the complete opposite of the Call of Duty franchise, which was described as short, linear, and filled with [...] "filler content" [...] that would only be a tutorial for the multiplayer content. The team hoped to have most moments featured in the game [...] "narrative-driven", and that all the enemy encounters in the game are designed to be different from each other. They hoped that by offering a unique experience with each encounter, they would be remembered by players. They hoped that the game would [...] "rekindle memories of Half-Life 2".|$|E
