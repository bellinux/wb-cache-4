2500|$|The {{subsequent}} law of 1851 {{establishing the}} Seminaries seemed {{an answer to}} the existing educational needs of Tallahassee when it passed the Legislature. Francis W. Eppes, the grandson of Thomas Jefferson and <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Monticello, was the Intendant or Mayor of Tallahassee {{at the time of this}} competition. [...] Eppes was well aware of the benefits an institution of higher learning could bring to a city and was determined to win the west seminary for Tallahassee. [...] The building of the Florida Institute was regarded at the time as the [...] "handsomest edifice in Tallahassee" [...] and cost $6,172.00 at its completion in April 1855. Around 100 students enrolled in the school year 1855-1856. [...] A group of citizens calling themselves the [...] "friends of the Institution" [...] planned to petition the Legislature to create the University of Florida from the Florida Institute. [...] By 1856 Eppes and the Tallahassee City Council had won the competition and transferred the Florida Institute to the state. The rise of land slightly west of the center of Tallahassee, formerly known as Gallows Hill, which was the site and building of the ongoing Florida Institute, was offered and accepted as the western state seminary for male students. The seminary officially held classes as a state institution in 1857. In 1858 it absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy begun in 1843 as the Misses Bates School, thereby becoming co-educational. The West Florida Seminary stood near the front of the Westcott Building on the existing FSU campus. This site is the oldest continually used location of higher learning in Florida. The eastern seminary was located in Ocala in 1853 and closed during the American Civil War. It reopened in 1866 in Gainesville and would eventually be combined with other schools to form what would be called the University of the State of Florida in 1906.|$|E

2500|$|Zeitgeist {{received}} mixed reviews, {{indicated by}} {{a score of}} 59/100 on Metacritic.

[...] Qs Paul Rees commented that [...] "at least half of Zeitgeist {{is made up of}} grinding songs that amount to riffs, pummelling and little else," [...] and that Zeitgeists emotional range is [...] "limited and wearing", but praised Chamberlin's drumming, stating that he [...] "remains {{one of the most powerful}} drummers in rock." [...] In addition, Modern Drummer proclaimed that the album contains [...] "Chamberlin's greatest drumming ever put to CD."

[...] The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and said that it [...] "ends up sounding like a Corgan career retrospective in B-side form." [...] musicOMH gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "Recounting such thoughts, by this point almost an hour has been spent in the company of a record which stares back at you with the appeal of an ex you'd rather not have bumped into." [...] Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said, [...] "The best you can offer is that it’s not a disaster – now do you want to tell Billy or should I?" [...] Robert Christgau simply gave the record a [...] "Dud" [...] rating (...) [...] Slant Magazine gave it a score of two out of five and called it [...] "the Pumpkins' most aggressively metal album to date. But heaps of guitars, vocal overdubs, and ridiculous effects don't mask a lack of inventiveness or even plain ol' quality songwriting." [...] Canadian magazine Now also gave it a score of two stars out of five and called it [...] "no-frills rawk that's been dumbed down for mass consumption." [...] Melodic magazine gave it a score of three stars out of five, calling the album a disappointing return of the band. Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of one-and-a-half stars out of five and said that [...] "the mixing problems extend far beyond Corgan's voice.
