25|$|The Ring {{has been}} the subject of myriad interpretations. For example, George Bernard Shaw, in The Perfect <b>Wagnerite,</b> argues for a view of The Ring as an {{essentially}} socialist critique of industrial society and its abuses. Robert Donington in Wagner's Ring And Its Symbols interprets it in terms of Jungian psychology, as an account of the development of unconscious archetypes in the mind, leading towards individuation.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's {{followers}} (known as Wagnerians or <b>Wagnerites)</b> {{have formed}} many societies dedicated to Wagner's life and work.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think Miss Dryfoos is {{very fond}} of Wagner's music," [...] Mrs. Mandel said. [...] "I believe you are all great <b>Wagnerites</b> in Boston?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... 'Das Judenthum' was {{an embarrassment}} to the early <b>Wagnerites</b> and was rarely reprinted in the early 20th century, {{except as part of}} his {{collected}} works. Fischer has found no significant critical comment on the essay. Before the Nazi period there was just one reprint of the essay itself, in Weimar in 1914. It is therefore very unlikely that it was read by Adolf Hitler or any of the Nazi hierarchy during the development of the Nazi movement (or later) and {{there is no evidence of}} this. During the Nazi period there were just two publications: in Berlin in 1934 and in Leipzig in 1939. Neither of these seem to have been large editions.|$|R
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous modern {{production}} was the centennial production of 1976, the Jahrhundertring, directed by Patrice Chéreau and conducted by Pierre Boulez. Set in the industrial revolution, it replaced {{the depths of the}} Rhine with a hydroelectric power dam and featured grimy sets populated by men and gods in 19th and 20th century business suits. This drew heavily on the reading of the Ring as a revolutionary drama and critique of the modern world, famously expounded by George Bernard Shaw in The Perfect <b>Wagnerite.</b> Early performances were booed but the audience of 1980 gave it a 45-minute ovation in its final year; the production is now generally regarded as revolutionary and a classic.|$|E
500|$|Wagner's {{ideas are}} {{amenable}} to socialist interpretations; many of his ideas on art were being formulated {{at the time of}} his revolutionary inclinations in the 1840s. Thus, for example, George Bernard Shaw wrote in The Perfect <b>Wagnerite</b> (1883): ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, Meyerbeer's operas {{gradually}} disappeared from the stage, partly due to their length and expense to mount, partly due to their denigration by supporters of Wagnerian opera. In 1898, George Bernard Shaw, in The Perfect <b>Wagnerite,</b> had already cast scorn on Robert and commented that [...] "Nowadays young people cannot understand how anyone could have taken Meyerbeer's influence seriously." ...|$|E
40|$|After a brief {{overview}} of the critically neglected interaction between the apparently local phenomenon of the Irish Cultural Revival and “European” Wagnerism, this essay provides an essential and paradigmatic comparison between the different steps Yeats and Joyce were taking on their Wagnerian trajectory in the transitional years between {{the end of the nineteenth}} and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. Whatever their personal idiosyncrasies and resistances, these Irish Wagnerians and <b>Wagnerites</b> on the threshold between two centuries had good national and nationalist reasons to conceive of such a motley chronotope as an Irish Bayreuth, with its Wagnerianly “transnational, universal significance”. Not surprisingly, “the concept of a national dramatic enterprise” was generated and cultivated at Coole, “reawakening the soul of a nation to its foundational myth, [which] had more in common with Wagner’s Bayreuth than is often recognized”...|$|R
500|$|In 1885 Cosima {{announced}} that she would direct the 1886 festival. Her tenure as Bayreuth's director lasted for 22 years, until 1907. During that time she oversaw 13 festivals, and by gradually increasing the repertory established the [...] "Bayreuth canon" [...] of ten mature Wagner works. Her triumvirate of conductors—Levi, Richter and Felix Mottl—shared the musical direction until 1894, when Levi left. Richter and Mottl served throughout Cosima's years, joined by several of the leading conductors of the day, although Bülow resisted all offers to participate. In {{the course of her}} long stewardship Cosima overcame the misgivings of the hardline <b>Wagnerites</b> patrons who believed, like Nietzsche in his early years, that Wagner's works should not be entrusted to a non-German. Under her watch the festival moved from an uncertain financial basis into a prosperous business undertaking that brought great riches to the Wagner family.|$|R
60|$|As many English <b>Wagnerites</b> seem to {{be still}} under the {{impression}} that Wagner composed Rienzi in his youth, Tannhauser and Lohengrin in his middle age, and The Ring in his later years, may I again remind them that The Ring {{was the result of a}} political convulsion which occurred when Wagner was only thirty-six, and that the poem was completed when he was forty, with thirty more years of work before him? It is as much a first essay in political philosophy as Die Feen is a first essay in romantic opera. The attempt to recover its spirit twenty years later, when the music of Night Falls On The Gods was added, was an attempt to revive the barricades of Dresden in the Temple of the Grail. Only those who have never had any political enthusiasms to survive can believe that such an attempt could succeed. G. B. S.|$|R
500|$|As Wagner prospered, {{it became}} second-nature for him, his wife Cosima and the Wagner circle to deprecate Meyerbeer and his works, and Cosima's Diaries contain {{numerous}} instances of this – (as well as recording {{a dream of}} Wagner's in which he and Meyerbeer were reconciled). Wagner's autobiography 'Mein Leben', circulated amongst his friends (and published openly in 1911), contains constant sniping at Meyerbeer and concludes with Wagner receiving the news of Meyerbeer's death, and his companions' gratification at the news. The downgrading of Meyerbeer became a commonplace amongst Wagnerites: in 1898, George Bernard Shaw, in The Perfect <b>Wagnerite,</b> commented that [...] "Nowadays young people cannot understand how anyone could have taken Meyerbeer's influence seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Like many musicians of his generation, Holst {{came under}} Wagner's spell. He had recoiled {{from the music}} of Götterdämmerung when he heard it at Covent Garden in 1892, but {{encouraged}} by his friend and fellow-student Fritz Hart he persevered and quickly became an ardent <b>Wagnerite.</b> Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, [...] "ill-assimilated wisps of Tristan inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures." [...] Stanford admired some of Wagner's works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst's sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: [...] "It won't do, me boy; it won't do". Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, Herbert Howells, as [...] "the one man who could get {{any one of us}} out of a technical mess", but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.|$|E
500|$|In 1898, as {{a result}} of overwork, Shaw's health broke down. He was nursed by Charlotte Payne-Townshend, a rich Anglo-Irish woman whom he had met through the Webbs. The {{previous}} year she had proposed that she and Shaw should marry. He had declined, but when she insisted on nursing him in a house in the country, Shaw, concerned that this might cause scandal, agreed to their marriage. The ceremony took place on 1 June 1898, in the register office in Covent Garden. The bride and bridegroom were both aged forty-one. In the view of the biographer and critic St John Ervine, [...] "their life together was entirely felicitous". There were no children of the marriage, which it is generally believed was never consummated; whether this was wholly at Charlotte's wish, as Shaw liked to suggest, is less widely credited. In the early weeks of the marriage Shaw was much occupied writing his Marxist analysis of Wagner's Ring cycle, published as The Perfect <b>Wagnerite</b> late in 1898. In 1906 the Shaws found a country home in Ayot St Lawrence, Hertfordshire; they renamed the house [...] "Shaw's Corner", and lived there {{for the rest of their}} lives. They retained a London flat in the Adelphi and later at Whitehall Court.|$|E
50|$|Horowitz’s {{treatment}} late Gilded Age culture challenges prevalent {{notions of}} “social control” and “sacralization” {{as defined by}} such cultural historians as Alan Trachtenburg and Lawrence Levine. In Wagner Nights: An American History and Classical Music in America: A History of Its Rise and Fall, he argues that American classical music {{of the late nineteenth}} century cannot be viewed as an instrument of affluent elites. In Understanding Toscanini: How He Became an American Culture-God and Helped Create a New Audience for Old Music, he treats the “Toscanini cult” of the mid-twentieth century {{as a metaphor for the}} decline of classical music in the United States, arguing that the conductor Arturo Toscanini became the first non-composer to be widely regarded the “world’s greatest musician,“ and that no prior conductor of comparable eminence and influence had been so divorced from the music of his own time. Wagner Nights also proposes that American Wagnerism of the 1880s and 1890s was (compared to European and Russian Wagner movements) distinctly meliorist and “proto-feminist,“ the vast majority of American <b>Wagnerites</b> having been women.|$|R
2500|$|Saxony was {{a center}} of völkisch {{activity}} in the late 19th century, and in the elections to the Saxon Landtag in 1893, völkisch candidates won 6 out of the 16 seats. Chamberlain's status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was {{to a certain extent}} an outsider in his adopted country-a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent. In a classic case of being plus royaliste que le roi (more royalist than the kings), Chamberlain tried very hard to be more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to völkisch politics. Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized most of the time. Chamberlain's friend Hermann Keyserling later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English [...] "individualist" [...] who [...] "never saw Germany as it really is", instead having an idealized, almost mythic view of Germany and the Germans. This was especially the case as initially the German <b>Wagnerites</b> had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements that very much hurt Chamberlain. To compensate, Chamberlain became über deutsche, the man who wanted to be more German than the Germans.|$|R
5000|$|The Bayreuther Blätter devoted its June, 1892, {{issue to}} a {{memorial}} of Paul Lagarde and it emphatically recommended {{his work to}} its readers. Ludwig Schemann, {{one of the most}} prolific of Bayreuth Germanics and racists, and later the author of a full-length biography of Lagarde, summarized his life and work and concluded that [...] "for the comprehension of Lagarde's whole being one must above all remember that he always considered himself the prophet and guide of his people — which of course he actually was." [...] For Schemann his legacy consisted largely of his struggle against the Jews: [...] "Not since the days of Schopenhauer and Wagner is the German thinker so mightily opposed this alien people, which desecrates our holy possessions, poisons our people, and seeks to rest our property from us so as to completely trample on us, as Lagarde has" [...] It was this image of Lagarde, the anti-Semitic prophet of a purified and heroic Germany, which the political <b>Wagnerites</b> and the Bayreuther Blätter and kept alive. Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Wagner's son-in-law and intellectual disciple, wrote: [...] "For us, the Deutsche Schriften have for a long time belonged to our most precious books, and we consider Lagarde's unabashed exposure of the inferiority of Semitic religious instincts and the pernicious effects on Christianity as an achievement that deserves our admiration and gratitude." [...] -- Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrunderts, 5th ed. München 1904, p.lxii.|$|R
500|$|The Rhinemaidens {{have been}} {{described}} as the drama's [...] "most seductive but most elusive characters", and in one analysis as representatives of [...] "seduction by infantile fantasy". They [...] act essentially as a unity, with a composite yet elusive personality. Apart from Flosshilde’s implied seniority, demonstrated by occasional light rebukes and illustrated musically by awarding the role to a deeper-voiced contralto or mezzo, their characters are undifferentiated. In The Perfect <b>Wagnerite,</b> his 1886 analysis of the Ring drama as political allegory, George Bernard Shaw describes the Rhinemaidens as [...] "thoughtless, elemental, only half-real things, very much like modern young ladies". The attributes most apparent initially are charm and playfulness, combined with a natural innocence; their joy in the gold they guard derives from its beauty alone, even though they know its latent power. However, this veneer of childlike simplicity is misleading; aside from proving themselves irresponsible as guardians, they are also provocative, sarcastic and cruel in their interaction with Alberich. When the demigod Loge reports that the Rhinemaidens need Wotan's help to regain the gold, Fricka, the goddess of marriage, calls them a [...] "watery brood" [...] (Wassergezücht) and complains about the many men they have lured away with their [...] "treacherous bathing". They are beguiling and flirtatious with Siegfried, but finally wise as revealed by the undisclosed counsel which they give to Brünnhilde. Sabor sees the personality of the Rhinemaidens as a blend of the [...] "good hearted nature" [...] of the Oceanids and the [...] "austerity" [...] (including the willingness to drown people) of the daughters of Ægir.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a leading}} <b>Wagnerite</b> in Vienna, Chamberlain befriended {{a number of}} other {{prominent}} Wagnerites such as Prince Hohenhohe-Langenburg, Ludwig Schemann, Georg Meurer, and Baron Christian von Ehrenfels. [...] The most important friendship that Chamberlain made during his time in Vienna was with German Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, Prince Philip von Eulenburg, who shared Chamberlain's love of Wagnerian music. Besides being a passionate <b>Wagnerite,</b> Eulenburg was also an anti-Semite, an Anglophobe and a convinced enemy of democracy who found much to admire in Chamberlain's anti-Semitic, anti-British and anti-democratic writings.|$|E
2500|$|For the centenary Ring in Bayreuth, Boulez {{originally}} asked Ingmar Bergman then Peter Brook to direct, {{both of whom}} refused. Peter Stein initially agreed but withdrew in 1974. Patrice Chéreau, who {{was primarily}} a theatre director, accepted {{and went on to}} create one of the defining opera productions of modern times, helping to usher in the era of Regietheater. He treated the story in part as an allegory of capitalism, drawing on ideas that George Bernard Shaw explored in The Perfect <b>Wagnerite</b> in 1898.|$|E
5000|$|In 1885 Cosima {{announced}} that she would direct the 1886 festival. Her tenure as Bayreuth's director lasted for 22 years, until 1907. During that time she oversaw 13 festivals, and by gradually increasing the repertory established the [...] "Bayreuth canon" [...] of ten mature Wagner works. Her triumvirate of conductors—Levi, Richter and Felix Mottl—shared the musical direction until 1894, when Levi left.

Under her watch the festival moved from an uncertain financial basis into a prosperous business undertaking that brought great riches to the Wagner family.Although the festival's historian, Frederic Spotts, suggests that Cosima was more creative than she affected to be, the primary purpose of all her productions was to follow the instructions and reflect the wishes of the Master: [...] "There is nothing left for us here to create, but only to perfect in detail". This policy incurred criticism, among others from Bernard Shaw, who in 1889 mocked Cosima as the [...] "chief remembrancer". Shaw scorned the idea that Wagner's wishes were best represented by the slavish copying in perpetuity of the performances he had witnessed. Ten years later Shaw highlighted as a feature of the [...] "Bayreuth style" [...] the [...] "intolerably old-fashioned tradition of half rhetorical, half historical-pictorial attitudes and gestures", and the characteristic singing, [...] "sometime tolerable, sometimes abominable". The subordination of the music to text, diction and character portrayal was a specific feature of the Bayreuth style; Cosima, according to Spotts, turned the principle of clear enunciation into [...] "a fetish ... The resulting harsh declamatory style came to be derided as ... the infamous Bayreuth bark".|$|R
6000|$|To be able {{to follow}} the music of The Ring, all that is {{necessary}} is to become familiar enough with the brief musical phrases out of which it is built to recognize them and attach a certain definite significance to them, exactly as any ordinary Englishman recognizes and attaches a definite significance to the opening bars of God Save the King. There is no difficulty here: every soldier is expected to learn and distinguish between different bugle calls and trumpet calls; and anyone who can do this can learn and distinguish between the representative themes or [...] "leading motives" [...] (Leitmotifs) of The Ring. They are the easier to learn because they are repeated again and again; and the main ones are so emphatically impressed on the ear whilst the spectator is looking {{for the first time at}} the objects, or witnessing the first strong dramatic expression of the ideas they denote, that the requisite association is formed unconsciously. The themes are neither long, nor complicated, nor difficult. Whoever can pick up the flourish of a coach-horn, the note of a bird, the rhythm of the postman's knock or of a horse's gallop, will be at no loss in picking up the themes of The Ring. No doubt, when it comes to forming the necessary mental association with the theme, it may happen that the spectator may find his ear conquering the tune more easily than his mind conquers the thought. But for the most part the themes do not denote thoughts at all, but either emotions of a quite simple universal kind, or the sights, sounds and fancies common enough to be familiar to children. Indeed some of them are as frankly childish as any of the funny little orchestral interludes which, in Haydn's Creation, introduce the horse, the deer, or the worm. We have both the horse and the worm in The Ring, treated exactly in Haydn's manner, and with an effect not a whit less ridiculous to superior people who decline to take it good-humoredly. Even the complaisance of good <b>Wagnerites</b> is occasionally rather overstrained by the way in which Brynhild's allusions to her charger Grani elicit from the band a little rum-ti-tum triplet which by itself is in no way suggestive of a horse, although a continuous rush of such triplets makes a very exciting musical gallop.|$|R
2500|$|Chamberlain who in {{the words}} of Buruma was [...] "an English fetishist of German blood", who wrote long pseudo-scientific {{articles}} about how [...] "Germanic racial genius" [...] manifested itself in the cultural works of Richard Wagner, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Ludwig van Beethoven, and William Shakespeare (Chamberlain considered Shakespeare to be a [...] "Germanic playwright" [...] who properly belonged to Germany), making him the [...] "perfect match" [...] for Wilhelm. Chamberlain frequently wrote to an appreciative and admiring Wilhelm telling him that it was only the noble [...] "German spirit" [...] which was saving the world from being destroyed by a [...] "deracinated Yankee-Anglo-Jewish materialism". Finally, Wilhelm was also a <b>Wagnerite,</b> and found much to admire in Chamberlain's writings praising Wagner's music as a mystical, spiritual life-force that embodied all that was great about the [...] "German spirit".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1921, Stolzing-Cerny {{who joined}} the NSDAP in December 1920 wrote to Chamberlain about the new man on the {{political}} scene, [...] "one Adolf Hitler, an Austrian worker, a man of extraordinary oratorical talents and an astonishingly rich political knowledge who knows marvelously how to thrill the masses". Initially, Chamberlain was hesitant about Hitler, believing {{that he might be}} another Kapp, but after the [...] "battle of Coburg", where Hitler had personally fought with his followers in a street battle against the Communists, Chamberlain started to see Hitler as someone who practiced what he preached. From that a time onwards, Chamberlain started to closely follow and admire Hitler, whom he saw as [...] "Germany's savior". Hitler in his turn had read The Foundations, Chamberlain's biography of Wagner and many of his wartime essays, and was much influenced by all that Chamberlain had written. British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, a biographer of Hitler, writes that [...] "...Hitler drew heavily for his ideas from well known anti-Semitic tracts such as those by Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Adolf Wahrmund and especially, the arch-popularizer Theodor Fritsch (one of whose emphasis was the alleged sexual abuse of women by the Jews)...". The fact that Hitler was an ardent <b>Wagnerite</b> who adored Wagner's music gave Chamberlain and Hitler a mutual ground for friendship beyond their shared hatred of the Jews. Likewise, Joseph Goebbels had been converted to the völkisch ideology after reading Chamberlain's books and essays, and came to the conclusion on the basis of Chamberlain's writings that the West could only be saved by removing the Jews from German society. During this period, Chamberlain who was practically a member of the Wagner family started to push for the Bayreuth Festival to become [...] openly identified with völkisch politics, and to turn the previously apolitical festival into a völkisch rally.|$|E
2500|$|An ardent Francophile in his youth, Chamberlain had {{a marked}} {{preference}} for speaking French over English. It was {{only at the}} age of twenty three in November 1878, when he first heard the music of Richard Wagner—which struck him with all the force of a religious revelation—that Chamberlain became not only a <b>Wagnerite,</b> but an ardent Germanophile and Francophobe. As he put later, it was then he realized the full [...] "degeneracy" [...] of the French culture that he had so admired compared to the greatness of the German culture that had produced Wagner, who Chamberlain viewed {{as one of the great}} geniuses of all time. In the music of Wagner, Chamberlain finally found the mystical, life-affirming spiritual force that he had been unsuccessfully seeking to find in British and French cultures. Further increasing his love of Germany [...] was that he had fallen in love with a German woman named Anna Horst, and she with him. As Chamberlain's wealthy, snobbish family back in Britain objected to him marrying the lower middle-class Horst on the grounds that she was socially unsuitable for him, this further estranged him from Britain, a place whose people Chamberlain regarded as cold, unfeeling, callous and concerned only with money. By contrast, Chamberlain regarded Germany as the romantic [...] "land of love", a place whose people had human feelings like love, and whose culture was infused with a special spirituality that brought out the best in humanity. In 1883–1884, Chamberlain lived in Paris and worked as a stockbroker. Chamberlain's attempts to play the Paris bourse ended in failure as he proved to be inept at business, and much of his hatred of capitalism stemmed from his time in Paris. More happily for him, Chamberlain founded the first Wagner society in Paris and often contributed articles to the Revue Wagnérienne, the first journal in France devoted to Wagner studies. Together with his friend, the French writer Édouard Dujardin, Chamberlain did much to introduce Wagner to the French, who until then had largely ignored Wagner's music.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} The Foundations made Chamberlain famous {{all over the}} world. In 1906, the Brazilian {{intellectual}} Sílvio Romero cited Chamberlain together with Otto Ammon, Georges Vacher de Lapouge and Arthur de Gobineau as having proved that the blond [...] "dolichocephalic" [...] people of northern Europe were the best and greatest race in the entire world, and urged that Brazil could become a great nation by a huge influx of German immigrants who would achieve the embranquecimento (whitening) of Brazil. Chamberlain received invitations to lecture on his racial theories at Yale and Johns Hopkins universities, but turned them down {{on the grounds that}} he had no wish to visit what he viewed as a culturally and spiritually debased nation like the United States. When the book was first published, reviewers often asked who this Chamberlain was, and there was much fevered speculation in the German press if Chamberlain was related to Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary and as the principal author of the British forward policy in South Africa one of the most detested men in the Reich. Several German magazines printed pictures of Joseph Chamberlain's sons Austen Chamberlain or Neville Chamberlain as the author of The Foundations by mistake. As such, many Germans breathed a collective sigh of relief when it was established that Houston Stewart Chamberlain was not related to the famous Chamberlain family of Birmingham. After the success of The Foundations, a Chamberlain Kreis (circle) appeared in Vienna that comprised the Indologist Leopold von Schroeder, Count Ulrich von Bülow; Countess Melanie Metternich-Zichy, Countess Marietta von Coundenhove, Baroness [...] Emma von Ehrenfels, the music critic and <b>Wagnerite</b> Gustav Schonaich, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Count Hermann Keyserling and Rudolf Kassner who met weekly at Chamberlain's home to discuss his racial theories. It was during this period that Chamberlain had an affair with Baroness von Ehrenfels, the wife of his friend Baron Christian von Ehrenfels and another affair with a Viennese showgirl Lili Petri. In 1906, his marriage to Anna ended in divorce. Besides the income from sales of The Foundations and the essays he was constantly writing for newspapers and journals, Chamberlain was supported financially by a wealthy German piano-manufacturer August Ludowici (who liked Chamberlain so much that he purchased a house for him) and by the Swiss industrialist Agénor Boisssier, giving an annual income of about 30,000–40,000 marks (by contrast a German school-teacher had an annual income of 1,000 marks while a professor made about 12,000 marks per year). In 1908, Chamberlain married Wagner's daughter Eva von Bülow after Cosima Wagner suggested the match, making him extremely happy to be married to the daughter of his hero Wagner.|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, {{he moved}} to Austria. During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, {{influenced}} by the concept of Teutonic supremacy he believed embodied {{in the works of}} Richard Wagner and the French racist Arthur de Gobineau. In his book Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, the aristocratic snob Gobineau, who had an obsessive hatred of commoners had developed the theory of an Aryan master race as a way of bolstering his social standing as he believed that French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul while ordinary French people were the descendants of racially inferior Latin and Celtic peoples. Wagner had met Gobineau while on vacation in Rome in 1876, and the two had become friends. Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau's theories, but could not accept Gobineau's theory of inevitable racial decay amongst {{what was left of the}} [...] "Aryan race", instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans. The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedländer wrote that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely [...] "redemptive anti-semitism", a type of völkisch anti-semitism that could explain all in the world in regards to Jew-hatred and offer a form of [...] "redemption" [...] for the anti-Semitic. Chamberlain had attended Wagner's Bayreuth Festival in 1882 and struck up a close correspondence with his widow Cosima. In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death, he married Eva von Bülow-Wagner, Franz Liszt's granddaughter and Richard Wagner's daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von Bülow-despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner's daughter). The next year {{he moved to}} Germany and became an important member of the [...] "Bayreuth Circle" [...] of German nationalist intellectuals. As an ardent <b>Wagnerite,</b> Chamberlain saw it as his life's mission to spread the Master's message of racial hatred. Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation. Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s:Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further from the 'firm ground of nature'; soon it must fling us out into empty nothingness. In another letter, Chamberlain stated this about the purpose of the Wagner cult:If we do not soon pay attention to Schiller's thought regarding the transformation from the state of Need into the Aesthetic State, then our condition will degenerate into a boundless chaos of empty talk and arms foundries. If we do not soon heed Wagner's warning-that mankind must awaken to a consciousness of its [...] "pristine holy worth"-then the Babylonian tower of senseless doctrines will collapse on us and suffocate the moral core of our being forever. In Chamberlain's viewpoint, the purpose of the Wagner cult was nothing less than the salvation of humanity. As such, Chamberlain became engulfed in the [...] "redemptive anti-semitism" [...] that was at the core of both Wagner's worldview and of the Wagner cult.|$|E
60|$|The {{preparation}} of a Second Edition of this booklet {{is quite the}} most unexpected literary task that has ever been set me. When it first appeared I was ungrateful enough to remonstrate with its publisher for printing, as I thought, more copies than the most sanguine <b>Wagnerite</b> could ever hope to sell. But the result proved that exactly one person buys a copy on {{every day in the}} year, including Sundays; and so, in the process of the suns, a reprint has become necessary.|$|E
60|$|What a pity, I thought, {{that with}} that noble {{masculine}} touch of hers she is {{unaware of the}} deeps of music. Some day I shall try to get from her just what Beethoven, say, and Chopin, mean to her. She has not read Shaw's Perfect <b>Wagnerite,</b> nor had she ever heard of Nietzsche's Case of Wagner. She likes Mozart, and old Boccherini, and Leonardo Leo. Likewise she is partial to Schumann, especially Forest Scenes. And she played his Papillons most brilliantly. When I closed my eyes I could have sworn it was a man's fingers on the keys.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the purpose}} of our present {{generalisation}} it is only necessary to say that Shaw, as a musical critic, summed himself up as [...] "The Perfect Wagnerite"; he threw himself into subtle and yet trenchant eulogy of that revolutionary voice in music. It was {{the same with the}} other arts. As he was a Perfect <b>Wagnerite</b> in music, so he was a Perfect Whistlerite in painting; so above all he was a Perfect Ibsenite in drama. And with this we enter that part of his career with which this book is more specially concerned. When Mr. William Archer got him established as dramatic critic of the Saturday Review, he became for the first time [...] "a star of the stage"; a shooting star and sometimes a destroying comet.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is clear}} after this {{utterance}} from the would-be Schopenhaurian, that Wagner's explanations {{of his works}} {{for the most part}} explain nothing but the mood in which he happened to be on the day he advanced them, or the train of thought suggested to his very susceptible imagination and active mind by the points raised by his questioner. Especially in his private letters, where his outpourings are modified by his dramatic consciousness of the personality of his correspondent, do we find him taking all manner of positions, and putting forward all sorts of cases which must be taken as clever and suggestive special pleadings, and not as serious and permanent expositions of his works. These works must speak for themselves: if The Ring says one thing, and a letter written afterwards says that it said something else, The Ring must be taken to confute the letter just as conclusively as if the two had been written by different hands. However, nobody fairly well acquainted with Wagner's utterances as a whole will find any unaccountable contradictions in them. As in all men of his type, our manifold nature was so marked in him that he was like several different men rolled into one. When he had exhausted himself in the character of the most pugnacious, aggressive, and sanguine of reformers, he rested himself as a Pessimist and Nirvanist. In The Ring the quietism of Brynhild's [...] "Rest, rest, thou God" [...] is sublime in its deep conviction; but you have only to turn back the pages to find the irrepressible bustle of Siegfried and the revelry of the clansmen expressed with equal zest. Wagner was not a Schopenhaurite every day in the week, nor even a <b>Wagnerite.</b> His mind changes as often as his mood. On Monday nothing will ever induce him to return to quilldriving: on Tuesday he begins a new pamphlet. On Wednesday he is impatient of the misapprehensions of people who cannot see how impossible it is for him to preside as a conductor over platform performances of fragments of his works, which can only be understood when presented strictly according to his intention on the stage: on Thursday he gets up a concert of Wagnerian selections, and when it is over writes to his friends describing how profoundly both bandsmen and audience were impressed. On Friday he exults in the self-assertion of Siegfried's will against all moral ordinances, and is full of a revolutionary sense of [...] "the universal law of change and renewal": on Saturday he has an attack of holiness, and asks, [...] "Can you conceive a moral action of which the root idea is not renunciation?" [...] In short, Wagner can be quoted against himself almost without limit, much as Beethoven's adagios could be quoted against his scherzos if a dispute arose between two fools as to whether he was a melancholy man or a merry one.|$|E
