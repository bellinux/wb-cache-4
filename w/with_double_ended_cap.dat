The homopolymers, with M(n) 29000 - 59000, have an excess of the perfluoro end groups at the surface that is inversely proportional to the chain length and is commensurate with one or both ends having perfluoro groups. In contrast, <b>double</b> perfluoro <b>end</b> <b>capped</b> homopolymers of M(n) similar to 9000 have {{only one of the}} perfluoro groups at the surface.

40|$|International audienceThe working {{principle}} of resonant force sensors <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> tuning forks (DETF) consists of measuring {{one of the}} resonant frequencies of the vibrating beams which depend on the force applied in the beams. Although the principle is simple, its practical application presents some problems. The principal difficulties {{in the design of}} such a structure lie in two principal points dealing with the mounting of the DETF on its support and with the mechanical resistance of the structure. In order to approach the ideal structure, the proposed force sensor is based on a DETF directly machined in a metallic circular plate. The force to be measured is applied on the plate by using a tube. The sensor has been designed using finite element simulations. An electronic circuit including both analog PLL and logic circuitry parts has been developed for frequency shift measurement, dedicated to this sensor.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} the problems encountered by conventional distance relays when protecting double-circuit transmission lines. The problems arise principally {{as a result}} of the mutual coupling between the two circuits under different fault conditions; this mutual coupling is highly nonlinear in nature. An adaptive protection scheme is proposed for such lines based on application of artificial neural network (ANN). ANN has the ability to classify the nonlinear relationship between measured signals by identifying different patterns of the associated signals. One of the key points of the present work is that only current signals measured at local end have been used to detect and classify the faults in the double circuit transmission line <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>end</b> infeed. The adaptive protection scheme is tested under a specific fault type, but varying fault location, fault resistance, fault inception angle and with remote end infeed. An improved performance is experienced once the neural network is trained adequately, which performs precisely when faced with different system parameters and conditions. The entire test results clearly show that the fault is detected and classified within a quarter cycle; thus the proposed adaptive protection technique is well suited for double circuit transmission line fault detection & classification. Results of performance studies show that the proposed neural network-based module can improve the performance of conventional fault selection algorithms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the engineering issues and development criteria utilized to evolve the Atlas Marx bank pulse power components. The capacitor and rail-gap required alterations from existing designs to minimize system inductance and component count, maximize reliability, and enhance maintainability. For the capacitors, development {{has resulted in}} a plastic cased device <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>ended</b> bushings. The design of the capacitors` output electrodes, foil packs, and internal interconnect webbing results in a capacitor with improved performance. The capacitors are rated at 33. 5 uF and 60 kV and are housed in a 28 in. {times} 29 in. {times} 13 in. fiberglass case. Terminal inductance is less than 15 nH with a design discharge current greater than 650 kA. An improved ``third generation`` rail-gap will be utilized and {{is a product of the}} ACE machine developments at Maxwell Laboratories. The gap has a polyurethane body and one piece electrodes. To minimize prefires, a modified internal profile reduces the E-field and increases tracking length between the electrodes. With an individual Marx stage charged ``+`` and ``{minus}`` and a trigger rail with 50 / 50 grading (mid-plane), external trigger bias or coupling components are not required. This further reduces system component count. To further reduce gap prefires and environmental concerns, high pressure air, instead of the typical Argon/SF 6 mixture, will be used. The metallic switching by-products will form insulating oxides and the gap flushing procedures are simplified. To ensure multi-channel discharges, fast dV/dT trigger voltages ({approximately} 30 kV/nS), similar to those developed for the Staged Theta-Pinch railgaps (a Scyllac era machine at Los Alamos), will be utilized...|$|R

Simulated oblique fractures of the diaphysis were created in 15 artificial paediatric femurs. Titanium Elastic Nails with <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> were inserted at angles of 45 °, 55 ° and 65 ° in five specimens for each angle to create three study groups. Biomechanical testing was performed with axial compression until failure.
