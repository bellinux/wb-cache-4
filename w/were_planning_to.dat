5|$|Investigation {{into the}} assault began even before Udin's death. The police began their {{investigation}} on 13 August, but were hampered as {{the crime scene}} had been contaminated during the commotion after the assault. Under the command of Sergeant Major Edy Wuryanto, the police began by collecting Udin's notes and blood from his family; the family had received several bags of blood from Bethesda and <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> bury it with the body.|$|E

5|$|The first {{openly gay}} British footballer Justin Fashanu (1961–1998) spent his {{last night in}} Chariots Roman Spa. His suicide was due to press reports that the US {{authorities}} <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> extradite him and charge him with sexual assault (there was in fact no warrant). His suicide note claimed that the sexual encounter had been consensual and that the youth contacted police only after Fashanu refused to pay him blackmail.|$|E
50|$|Line 23 <b>is</b> a <b>planned</b> future subway {{line on the}} Shanghai Metro. Its termini <b>are</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Xujiahui and Minhang Development Zone.

5|$|A {{short time}} later Brock {{received}} a report from Fort George {{that some of the}} garrison <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> imprison the officers and flee to the U.S. Immediately he boarded the schooner that had brought the message and proceeded to Fort George, under the command of then-Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Hale Sheaffe. A hastily assembled honour guard formed to greet Brock's unexpected arrival. Alone on entering the fort, Brock ordered the sergeant of the guard to disarm and had him confined.|$|E
5|$|After their release, {{the journalists}} {{went to the}} US embassy in Saigon to {{complain}} about their treatment {{at the hands of}} Diệm's officials and asked for US government protection. Their appeals were dismissed, as was a direct appeal to the White House. Through the efforts of US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, the assault charges laid against the journalists were subsequently dropped. Vietnamese Buddhists reacted to the incident by contending that Diệm's men <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> assassinate monks, while Madame Nhu repeated earlier claims that the US government had been trying to overthrow her brother-in-law.|$|E
5|$|An urban {{district}} council {{had been considered}} a year previously, {{in light of the}} expansion of areas within the parish, particularly Northwood. A report was prepared in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood—2,700 by that time, with 530 houses—compared with the largely rural character of the rest of Ruislip parish. The Metropolitan Railway extension from Harrow to Uxbridge was also discussed at the meeting on 28 October 1903, as a station was to be opened in Ruislip on the line. Kings College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish, <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> sell some for development in light of the new line. As a result of these events, the council voted in favour of becoming an {{urban district}}.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|During his pontificate Clement strove diplomatically {{to bring}} Western European nations to defense of Crete. The Ottomans <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> advance on the Venetian owned {{capital of the}} Island at Candia. He intervened in the War of Devolution and helped {{negotiate}} a peace, which increased the likelihood that Spain and France would both aid Crete. The French initially sent a small force to aid Crete in 1668, before increasing their troop commitment in 1669. This did affect {{the outcome of the}} Ottoman advance, and they captured Candia in September 1669.|$|E

Following the departure of their former members Okereke and Lissack started to work on new songs on their own in late 2014.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though all}} {{military}} activities ceased by 6 August 1933, exaggerated stories of atrocities {{committed by the}} Assyrians at Dirabun and the persistent anti-Christian propaganda and rumours insisted that the Christians <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> blow bridges up and to poison drinking water in major Iraqi cities. According to some historians, the agitation against the Assyrians was also encouraged by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani's Arab nationalist government, which {{saw it as a}} distraction to the continuous Shiite revolt {{in the southern part of}} the country.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights activists}} had {{previously}} alleged, and on February 28, 2017 investigative journalism reported confirmation, that child labor {{is used in}} {{a portion of the}} worldwide supply of cobalt sourced from African artisanal mines. This revelation prompted cell phone maker Apple Inc., on March 3, 2017, to stop buying the ore from suppliers such as Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt who source from artisanal mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and only using suppliers that are verified to meet its workplace standards. In 2017, some exploration companies <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> survey old silver and cobalt mines in the area of Cobalt, Ontario where significant deposits are believed to lie.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} that the Germans <b>were</b> <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk {{in the ground and}} served by rail links.

When Ranariddh was fired from his position as the president of Funcinpec in October 2006, Chakrapong was also expelled from the party and senate the following month.|$|E
