50|$|The Cát Bà langur, {{also known}} as the <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus poliocephalus) is {{resident}} within the park and is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a critically endangered primate; one of the rarest in the world.|$|E
50|$|François' langur {{is found}} only in {{southwest}} China and northern Vietnam. The range of the <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur</b> is much smaller—only in southern Guangxi and Cát Bà Island in Vietnam. Phayre's leaf monkey is native to Yunnan and a larger swath of Indochina. The capped and Shortridge's langurs live along the Yunnan-Myanmar border. The Nepal gray langur {{is larger than the}} lutungs and found in southern Tibet.|$|E
50|$|Other Old World monkeys in China {{include the}} François' langur, <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur,</b> Phayre's leaf monkey, capped langur and Shortridge's langur, which are collectively {{categorized}} as lutungs and the Nepal gray langur, {{which is considered}} a true langur. All of these species are endangered. Lutungs, also called leaf monkeys, have relatively short arms, longer legs and long tails along with a hood of hair above their eyes.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{locomotor}} behaviour of <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs</b> Trachypithecus leucocephalus and François’ langurs T. françoisi to test two hypotheses: (1) these monkeys have evolved locomotor ability {{to support their}} activities on limestone hills, and (2) François’ langurs have evolved more diverse locomotor skills than <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs.</b> Data were collected from 1996 – 1998 and in 2005 in Fusui Nature Reserve, Guangxi, and showed that the two species had similar locomotor types, but François’ langurs had more locomotor modes (26) than <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs</b> (12). Quadrupedal walking and leaping were two major types, and <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs</b> were more arboreal than François’ langurs. We suggest that, while keeping their ancestral locomotor types, the two species have evolved new types allowing them to live on limestone cliffs. Compared to <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs,</b> François’ langurs have more diverse locomotor modes that probably have allowed them to live in more habitat types. As an evolutionary outcome, François’ langurs have a larger distribution range [Current Zoology 55 (1) : 9 – 19, 2009]...|$|R
30|$|Thus our {{theoretical}} {{results show}} that releasing the African wild dogs in captivity to the wild is effective for protecting African wild dog population with Allee effect and continuous delay. Therefore, when protecting African wild dogs, we can determine the survival threshold, have African wild dogs in captivity, and monitor the wild populations (the initial value). Then, {{according to the state}} feedback of wild <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs,</b> a certain amount of <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs</b> in captivity will be released to the wild {{to increase the number of}} <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs</b> in the wild, making the population have a normal reproduction to survive. According to the survival threshold and initial value, we can choose different grazing plans.|$|R
50|$|Fusui's warm climate {{gives it}} {{a large amount of}} biodiversity. There are many rare species of animals and more than 1,100 species of plants. National grade one {{protected}} animals include <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs,</b> clouded leopard, musk deer, python more than 30 species. Country grade one protected plant include cycads, and country grade two protected plant include ferns, Jian wood, camphor wood.|$|R
50|$|The <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus poliocephalus) is a {{critically}} endangered langur. Two subspecies are recognized: T. p. poliocephalus in Cát Bà Island, Vietnam, and T. p. leucocephalus in Guangxi, China. The former (the nominate subspecies), often {{known as the}} golden-headed or Cat Ba langur, is among the rarest primates in the world, and possibly the rarest primate in Asia, with population size estimated at less than 70 individuals.|$|E
50|$|Cát Bà National Park was {{established}} on 31 March 1986 under No.79/CP {{decision of the}} Council of Ministers of Vietnam (now the government). The park has been a popular tourist destination, since the mid-1990s with wealthy Chinese and Vietnamese tourists. The tourists created a demand for traditional medicine and development and logging led to the near extinction of the <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur</b> with numbers falling from 2600 to just 40 in 2003. In 2016 there are 67 (± 5).|$|E
50|$|He {{has also}} helped save the <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur</b> species through {{his work at}} the Nongguan Nature Reserve in Chongzuo, China. His work to save the langurs focused on both {{protecting}} the species, and improving the lives of the nearby villagers who were competing for resources with the langurs. The population of langurs declined from 2,000 in the late 1980s to just 96 when Pan began his work in 1996. Through Pan's efforts, the population has since climbed to over 500 in 2008.|$|E
40|$|We {{collected}} data on sleeping site use from {{two groups of}} <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs</b> Trachypithecus leucocephalus living in Fusui Nature Reserve, China between August 2007 and July 2008. This information {{was used to test}} several hypotheses regarding ultimate causes of sleeping site use in this primate. <b>White-headed</b> <b>langurs</b> slept either in caves (17 sites) or on a cliff ledge (one site). They used all sleeping sites repeatedly, and reused some of them on consecutive nights; three nights was the longest consecutive use of any one sleep site. We suggest that langurs use sleeping sites to make approach and attack by predators difficult, and to increase their own familiarity with a location so as to improve chances for escape. Langurs’ cryptic behaviors with an increased level of vigilance before entering sleeping sites may also help in decreasing the possibility of detection by predators. Group 1 spent more sleeping nights in the central area of their territory than expected; in contrast, group 2 spent more sleeping nights in the periphery of their territory, which overlaps with that of another groups, than expected. The position of sleeping site relative to the last feeding site of the day and the first feeding site of the subsequent morning indicated a strategy closer to that of a multiple central place forager than of a central place forager. These results suggest that territory defense and food access may {{play an important role in}} sleeping site use of <b>white-headed</b> <b>langurs</b> [Current Zoology 57 (3) : 260 – 268, 2011]...|$|R
30|$|The topic about {{impulsive}} {{state feedback}} controls (abbreviated as ISFC) {{has been investigated}} extensively in the last decades due to its potential applications in culturing microorganisms [1 – 3], pest integrated management [4 – 6], disease control [7, 8], fish harvesting [9 – 11], and wildlife management [12, 13]. For example, [1] proposed a bioprocess model with ISFC to acquire an equivalent stable output by the precise feeding. Ref. [4] explored the periodic solution of an entomopathogenic nematode invading the insect model with ISFC. Ref. [7] considered some vaccines into a disease by ISFC, and got the uniqueness of order one periodic solution (OOPS) by geometric method. Ref. [12] formulated a <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur’s</b> ISFC model with sparse effect and continuous delay to study the periodic and artificial releasing. On ISFC models, scholars often {{pay close attention to}} the qualitative analysis of OOPS. Ref. [11] proposed a phytoplankton–fish model with ISFC and then formulated an optimal control problem (OCP, for short) and strived to find the appropriate harvesting rates to maximize the cost function in an impulsive period. Here, the solvability of the system in one period provides convenience for solving the OCP by Lagrange multiplier. But for the complicated ecosystem whose analytical solution cannot be expressed explicitly, if it is exploited in a period mode, what period and strategies are implemented to optimize the cost function at the minimal cost? Furthermore, how to translate the OCP of the ISFC to a problem with parameter optimization in one period is interesting. So far, few researchers have paid attention to these tasks which are the focuses of our paper.|$|R
40|$|The Cat Ba Islands in Hai Phong City, {{northern}} Vietnam, {{consist of}} a large limestone island with a maximumheight of 322 m above sea level and 366 small limestone islets with a total area of about 180 km 2. The islands are relictsof karst limestone mountains that became submerged during the Holocene transgression 7000 – 8000 year ago. Thecombination of the longtime karst process and recent marine processes in the monsoonal tropical zone has created avery diversity landscape on the Cat Ba Islands that {{can be divided into}} 3 habitat types with 16 forms. The first habitat typeis the karst mountains and hills, including karst mountains and hills, karst valleys and dolines, karst lakes, karst caves, andold marine terraces. The second habitat type is the limestone island coast, including beaches, mangrove marshes, tidalflats, rocky coasts, marine notch caves, marine karst lakes, and bights. The third habitat type is karst plains submerged bythe sea, including karst cones (fengcong) and towers (fengling), bedrock exposed on the seabed, sandy mud seabed, andsubmerged channels. Like the landscape, the biodiversity is also high in ecosystems composed of scrub cover – bare hills,rainy tropical forests, paddy fields and gardens, swamps, caves, beaches, mangrove forests, tidal flats, rocky coasts, marinekrast lakes, coral reefs, hard bottoms, seagrass beds and soft bottoms. The ecosystems on the Cat Ba Islands that supportvery high species biodiversity include tropical evergreen rainforests, soft bottoms; coral reefs, mangrove forests, andmarine karst lakes. A total of 2, 380 species have been recorded in the Cat Ba Islands, included 741 species of terrestrialplants; 282 species of terrestrial animals; 30 species of mangrove plants; 287 species of phytoplankton; 79 species ofseaweed; 79 species of zooplankton; 196 species of marine fishes; 154 species of corals; and 538 species of zoobenthos. Many of these species are listed in the Red Book of Vietnam as endangered species, included the <b>white-headed</b> or CatBa <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus poliocephalus), a famous endemic species. Human activities have resulted in significantlychanges to the landscape end ecosytems of the Cat Ba islands; however, many natural aspects of the islandsd have beenpreserved. For this reason, the Cat Ba Islands were recognized as a Biological Reserved Area by UNESCO in 2004...|$|R
5000|$|There are 21 {{critically}} endangered primates, 7 {{of which}} have remained on the IUCN's [...] "The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates" [...] list since the year 2000: the silky sifaka, Delacour's langur, the <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur,</b> the gray-shanked douc, the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey, the Cross River gorilla and the Sumatran orangutan. Miss Waldron's red colobus was recently declared extinct when {{no trace of the}} subspecies could be found from 1993 to 1999. A few hunters have found and killed individuals since then, but the subspecies' prospects remain bleak.|$|E
5000|$|Cat Ba {{island is}} the largest island within the Cat Ba archipelago, with 366 smaller islands and tidally exposed rocks {{surrounding}} it. As {{all members of the}} Trachypithecus francoisi species group, this social, diurnal lutung is found in limestone forests. Critically endangered, the <b>white-headed</b> <b>Langur</b> resides near Ha Long Bay, specifically in Cat Ba Island, hence its common name [...] "Cat Ba Langur". This landscape is known as a karst formation that has been invaded by the ocean. The topography is of limestone that has been worn away through erosion, which later formed ridges, towers, fissures, sinkholes and other types of landforms. The Cat Ba Langur are diurnal animals, adapted to living in limestone habitat.The sleeping caves, ledges, and overhangs used by the langurs are thought to be used as protection from predators and extreme weather. Accessible caves were used as a hunting ground for humans to capture or kill langurs as they slept.|$|E
40|$|Many Asian colobine monkey {{species are}} {{suffering}} from habitat destruction and population size decline. There is a great need to understand their genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history for effective species conservation. The <b>white-headed</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus leucocephalus) is a Critically Endangered colobine species endemic to the limestone karst forests in southwestern China. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences of 390 fecal samples from 40 social groups across the main distribution areas, which represented one-third of the total extant population. Only nine haplotypes and 10 polymorphic sites were identified, indicating remarkably low genetic diversity in the species. Using a subset of 77 samples from different individuals, we evaluated genetic variation, population structure, and population demographic history. We found very low values of haplotype diversity (h = 0. 570 ± 0. 056) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0. 00323 ± 0. 00044) in the hypervariable region I (HVRI) of the mtDNA control region. Distribution of haplotypes displayed marked geographical pattern, with one population (Chongzuo, CZ) showing a complete lack of genetic diversity (having only one haplotype), whereas the other population (Fusui, FS) having all nine haplotypes. We detected strong population genetic structure among habit patches (ΦST = 0. 375, P < 0. 001). In addition, the Mantel test showed a significant correlation between the pairwise genetic distances and geographical distances among social groups in FS (correlation coefficient = 0. 267, P = 0. 003), indicting isolation-by-distance pattern of genetic divergence in the mtDNA sequences. Analyses of demographic history suggested an overall stable historical population size and modest population expansion in the last 2, 000 years. Our results indicate different genetic diversity and possibly distinct population history for different local populations, and suggest that CZ and FS {{should be considered as}} one evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) and two management units (MUs) pending further investigation using nuclear markers...|$|E
