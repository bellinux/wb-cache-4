5|$|Unable {{to secure}} funding for further work and {{allegedly}} suffering from health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the director's health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain if he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> direct another film.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> be another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E

This, Chilembwe believed, was the only way change <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> occur.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand at such a rapid pace that university newspapers questioned if the increase in the number of fraternities <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> end. Many fraternity chapters were founded during this time that no longer exist at the university, such Alpha Chi Rho, Theta Nu Epsilon, and Delta Chi. Other chapters that are still active were founded at this time as well, such as Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa.|$|E

Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have.|$|E

The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 {{for use by the}} Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the Midway-class aircraft carriers).

Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple {{national and international}} championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, Bonfire mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses – until she found his replacement, Salinero, {{she did not think}} she <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> find a horse to match Bonfire's talent. A statue of Bonfire stands in Van Grunsven's home town of Erp.|$|E

While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved {{and asked if she}} <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started by}} {{focusing}} on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black and white or color. They reasoned that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16colors. At the time, the designers believed that was more than they <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> need for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|E

They give Bart the choice of two prizes: $10,000 in cash or a full-grown African elephant. Bart chooses the elephant. This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed that nobody <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> choose an elephant, and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their boss to give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or lose their jobs. They decide on the former option.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix {{did not pay}} Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but {{after six months of}} development was told that no funding <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{argued that}} he had conquered the city by force. Abu Ubaidah {{maintained}} the city had capitulated, through the peace agreement between him and Thomas. The corps commanders discussed the situation, and reportedly told Khalid that the peace agreement must be honored. Their rationale had logic: if other Byzantines in Syria heard that the Muslims had given a guarantee of safety to a surrendered city and then had slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> surrender to the Muslims. This would make the task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid, though not happy, agreed to honor the peace agreement.|$|E
