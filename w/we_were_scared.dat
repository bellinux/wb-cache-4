5000|$|The group {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album at Intermedia Studios in Boston, Massachusetts with record producer Adrian Barber. For the most part, the production is sparse and dry - two guitars, bass, drums, a singer, and occasionally piano - {{but the most}} remarkable feature of the album is how different Steven Tyler sounds compared to the albums that followed. In his autobiography Tyler recalls, [...] "The band was very uptight. We were so nervous that when the red recording light came on we froze. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>scared</b> shitless. I changed my voice into the Muppet, Kermit the Frog, to sound more like a blues singer." [...] In 1997 the singer told Stephen Davis, [...] "Yes, I changed my voice when we did the final vocals. I didn't like my voice, the way it sounded. I was insecure, but nobody told me not to." [...] Tyler added that producer Adrian Barber was [...] "good for his time" [...] {{but it was like}} [...] "being with a retarded child in there, and I'm not sure if it was because he was so high, or because we all were."

40|$|Losing {{someone close}} to you is very painful and the pain may {{take a long time}} to 'heal'. With the loss various {{emotions}} such as shock, anger and guilt may follow. It is common for a person in this situation to feel helpless, awkward and unsure. When talking to them, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>scared</b> of saying the wrong things which could make the person feel even worse. In most instances, people feel that there is little that they can do in order to make things better for someone who is in 'grieving'. According to Helpguide. org, while someone could not take away the pain of the loss, they can provide the much-needed comfort and support. This may start by letting the person know that you care...|$|R

Tom and me clumb down the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs, and it felt amazing good--that is, the stretching did, but the sand scorched our feet like hot embers. Next, we see somebody coming, and started to meet him; but we heard Jim shout, and looked around and he was fairly dancing, and making signs, and yelling.

The next thing you know, you are Group of the Year on nationwide TV. Randy Owen on the group's surprise success The group's next single, [...] "My Home's in Alabama", received an even better response, reaching the top 20. Their early chart successes led to an invitation to appear at the [...] "New Faces" [...] show at Nashville's annual Country Radio Seminar, along with other new acts, such as Reba McEntire. The band had to perform with studio musicians, rather than as a band, and left the session believing they had destroyed their chances. Despite this, the group drew interest from several labels, among those RCA Records, with whom they signed in April 1980. Their first single on RCA, [...] "Tennessee River", was produced by Harold Shedd and was their first to hit number one on the Billboard country chart, beginning a streak of over 30 number one hits. Cashbox named the band the New Vocal Group of the Year, marking the band's first award. In July 1980, the band left their long-time gig at the Bowery, promoting their single which they initially believed to be fluke. The success took the band by surprise and soon became [...] "all but consuming." ...|$|E
5000|$|The table holds all the {{different}} pronouns in Saliba. There are different rules for using each of them though. Starting with independent pronouns, when using these pronouns in a sentence they can and will most likely form noun phrases and will have a determiner. An example of a sentence using an independent pronoun could go as follows: Kai-wa ka matausi, which means <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>scared.</b> In the next column are subject pronouns, these pronouns are used as the subject in a sentence hence their name. To be more precise one could say they {{are the subject of}} verbal clauses. As far as object pronouns go, according to linguists who studied Saliba these are only put on certain objects. One example using both types of pronouns could be Wawaya-o-wa kwa hanoi-di, which means Wake up the children. Notice the kwa particle marking the subject and the -di particle marking possession. Another example could be Sina-gu yo tama-gu se hanoi-gai, meaning My mother and my father woke us up. Again notice the two possessive pronouns -gu to mark my father and my mother and also the se and -gai used to mark the subject and object respectively. On a bit of a side note, the subject pronouns ku and u are only used mostly for imperatives or events where the verb expressing it is not realized. For example, like ku lau which means go!. The last column, possessions, the rules for using the suffixes in a sentence are split up into alienable possessions and inalienable possessions. For alienable possessions, the possessive pronoun goes after one of the two possessive classifiers as shown in the table below. [...] For inalienable possessions the possessive classifiers yo- and ka- are not used. Instead, the possessive pronoun suffix goes after the possessed noun. If the inalienable noun is plural then the plural suffix will just go directly after the possessive suffix, as shown in the table below.|$|E

Chalk the 8086 design up to Intel’s competitive paranoia. ”Because {{of the success of}} Zilog’s 8 -bit processor, we were sure they were cooking up some super processors for 16 bits and beyond,” recalls Peter Stohl, lead engineer on 8086. “We knew we had to beat them to the punch. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>scared</b> and moving fast. ” At the time, Intel wanted to retain backward compatibility with the large installed base of 8 -bit code while providing a much greater address space—a full 1 MB—and faster clock speeds of up to 5 MHz. In spite of difficult circumstances and tools rudimentary by today’s standards, after only two years the 8086 team had produced working silicon. The new processor shipped in 1978 and incorporated many innovative features—it could even run in multiprocessor configurations...|$|E
5000|$|In his book, Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition, Harry Brod, a Professor of Philosophy and Humanities in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the University of Northern Iowa, writes: In the {{introduction}} to The Great Comic Book Heroes, Jules Feiffer writes that this is Superman's joke {{on the rest of}} us. Clark is Superman's vision of what other men <b>are</b> really like. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>scared,</b> incompetent, and powerless, particularly around women. Though Feiffer took the joke good-naturedly, a more cynical response would see here the Kryptonian's misanthropy, his misandry embodied in Clark and his misogyny in his wish that Lois be enamored of Clark (much like Oberon takes out hostility toward Titania by having her fall in love with an ass in Shakespeare's Midsummer-Night's Dream).|$|R

40|$|In {{this text}} I explore the {{question}} what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> actually afraid of when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>scared</b> at the movies. It is usually claimed that our fear derives from our engagement with characters and our ‘participation’ through thought, simulation or make-believe in fearful situations of the filmic world. While these standard accounts provide {{part of the}} explanation why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> afraid, I aim to complement them by showing that we often literally fear for ourselves as well. Concentrating on an anticipatory subspecies of cinematic fear I call ‘dread,’ I argue that we often fear a negative affective outcome, namely our own fearful experience of shock and/or horror that usually ends scenes of dread. By looking at viewers’ action tendencies and actions proper activated in dreadful moments, I suggest that we appraise scenes of dread as potentially harmful to our current (and even future) psychological well-being. Dread will thus {{turn out to be a}} specific kind of meta-emotion...|$|R

I used to go there every week and spend time seeing how these students played cricket and did other things normally. That is what inspired {{me to do something}} for these people". In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>scared</b> because <b>we</b> have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology.

James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, all of whom Farmer had helped recruit for CORE, disappeared during the Mississippi Freedom Summer. A full-scale FBI investigation aided by other law enforcement, found their murdered corpses buried in an earthen dam. The murders inspired the 1988 feature movie, Mississippi Burning. Years later, recalling the event, Farmer said, [...] "Anyone who said he wasn't afraid {{during the civil rights}} movement was either a liar or without imagination.

It was getting pretty dim by the time we turned the corner of the woods, sweating and panting with that long run, and see the sycamores thirty yards ahead of us; and just then we see a couple of men run into the bunch and heard two or three terrible screams for help.
