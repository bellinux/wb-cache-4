60|$|Sentence of Death was pronounc'd {{upon him}} accordingly. Several other Prosecutions {{might have been}} brought against him, but this was thought {{sufficient}} to rid the World of so Capital an Offender: He beg'd earnestly for Transportation, to the most extream Foot of his Majesty's Dominions; and pleaded Youth, and Ignorance as the Motive which had precipitated him into the Guilt; but the Court deaf to his Importunities, as knowing him, and his repeated Crimes to be equally flagrant, gave him no satisfactory Answer: He return'd to his dismal Abode the Condemn'd Hold, where were Nine more unhappy Wretches in as dreadful Circumstances as himself. The Court being at Windsor, the Malefactors had a longer Respite than is usual; during that Recess, James Harman, Lumley, Davis and Sheppard agreed upon an Escape, concerted Measures, and provided Instruments to make it effectual; but put off the Execution of their Design, on Account the two Gentlemen having their hopes of Life daily renewed by the favourable Answers they receiv'd from some considerable Persons; but those vanishing the day before their Execution, and finding their Sentence irreversible, they two dropt their hopes, together with the Design, they form'd for an Escape, and so in earnest prepar'd to meet Death on the Morrow, (which they accordingly did.). 'Twas on this Day Mr Davis gave Sheppard the <b>Watch</b> <b>Springs,</b> Files, Saws, &c. to Effect his own Release; and knowing that a Warrant was Hourly expected for his Execution with Two others, on the Friday following; he thought it high time to look about him, for he had waited his Tryal, saw his Conviction, and heard his Sentence with some patience; but finding himself irrespitably decreed for Death, he could sit passive no longer, and on the very Day of the Execution of the former; whilst they were having their Fetters taken off, in order for going to the Tree, that Day he began to saw, Saturday made a progress; but Sunday omitted, by Reason of the Concourse in the Lodge: Edgworth Bess having been set at Liberty, had frequent Access to him, with others of his Acquaintance. On Monday the Death Warrant came from Windsor, appointing that he, together with Joseph Ward and Anthony Upton should be Executed on the Friday following, being the 4th of September. The Keepers acquainted him therewith, and desired him to {{make good use of}} that short Time. He thank'd them, said he would follow their Advice, and prepare. Edgworth Bess, and another Woman had been with him at the Door of the Condemn'd Hold best part of the Afternoon, between five and six he desir'd the other Prisoners, except Stephen Fowles to remain above, while he offer'd something in private to his Friends at the Door; they comply'd, and in this interval he got the Spike asunder, which made way for the Skeleton to pass with his Heels foremost, by the Assistance of Fowles, whom he most ungenerously betray'd to the Keepers after his being retaken, and the Fellow was as severely punish'd for it.|$|E

50|$|A modern watch {{mainspring}} is a {{long strip}} of hardened and blued steel, or specialised steel alloy, 20-30 cm long and 0.05-0.2 mm thick. The mainspring in the common 1-day movement is calculated to enable the watch to run for 36 to 40 hours, i.e. with a power-reserve for 12 to 16 hours, which is the normal standard for hand-wound as well as self-winding watches. 8-Day movements, used in clocks meant to be wound weekly, provide power for at least 192 hours but use longer mainsprings and bigger barrels. Clock mainsprings are similar to <b>watch</b> <b>springs,</b> only larger.|$|E
40|$|Physicians {{may have}} first known what an {{aneurysm}} {{was as far}} back as the 14 th Century BC in Egypt 1, but by the early 19 th century they were still trying to find satisfactory options for treating large or surgically inaccessible aneurysms. 4, 5 One of the techniques being considered was inserting a needle to provoke formation of a clot that would close off the aneurysm. The proof that this technique could work was discovered by C. H. Moore in 1864, during an autopsy of a gunshot victim. The bullet, lodged in the ascending aorta, was embedded in fibrin. Based on this, Moore speculated that a wire could be introduced into the body through a small wound, but then passed up to the aneurysm where it would coil and attract fibrin to block the aneurysm. Moore used 26 yards of coil to treat a thoracic aorta aneurysm; the patient died of sepsis, but the aneurysm had decreased in pulsation and size before that, and autopsy confirmed that the coils had promoted fibrin clotting as predicted. Later efforts trying a variety of materials, ranging from iron wire to gold-plated <b>watch</b> <b>springs,</b> also had poor outcomes. Attempts using electrical current to provoke clots during this period did not produce a consistent benefit either. 5,...|$|E
