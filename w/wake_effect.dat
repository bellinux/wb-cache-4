40|$|<b>Wake</b> <b>effects</b> are {{important}} to wind turbine design and wind farm design, because they will affect the aerodynamic performance and structural loads of wind turbine operating in a wind farm. <b>Wake</b> <b>effects</b> were investigated extensively for horizontal axis wind turbine(HAWT) in the past, {{but there has been}} very limited work done for the vertical axis wind turbine(VAWT), whose <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> are unique because the blades will go through their own wake region during the operation. The presented thesis aims to bridge this knowledge gap by modelling the VAWT <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> using CFD. As for the general wind turbine <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> study, four key aspects can be identified: wake models, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, and structural integrity. Relevant literature is reviewed in the thesis, and a comprehensive framework of studying the VAWT <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> is proposed. The framework covers all the four key aspects of the wind turbine <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> study, and two of them will be addressed in the presented thesis, wake models and wake aerodynamics. CFD modelling in the thesis is based on RANS method. The near wake modelling focuses on the aerodynamics prediction and the far wake modelling focuses on the wake structure prediction. As for the near <b>wake</b> study, <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> of a circular cylinder at Re= 140000 is studied and validated. the aerodynamic performance of NACA 0015 airfoil at various angle of attack at Re= 2000000 is modelled using different turbulence models, dynamic stall effects of the airfoil at three different regimes are investigated. They form the basis of analysing the aerodynamic performance of VAWT rotor. A 17 m 2 -bladed VAWT designed based on such geometries (circular cylinder and NACA 0015 airfoil) is modelled thereafter, simulated aerodynamic performance under different tip-speed ratios are compared with experiment data. As for the far wake study, both rotor simplification using porous disk and full rotor simulation are presented. A persistent symmetric wake region is observed from the porous disk modelling while the full rotor modelling predicts an asymmetric wake region. The wake interaction is then studied in a two turbine VAWT array, the influence of <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> on the performance of VAWT at 3 diameters downstream is investigated. Overlapping of wake region is analysed...|$|R

30|$|The <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> is an {{important}} factor in wind farm design. A higher rating of WTs gets more affected by the wake. In case of larger OSWFs, <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> decreases the total power generation of the wind farm. Wake is the variation of wind speed from weaker to strengthen point behind the WT. The downstream WTs experience the <b>wake</b> <b>effect.</b> The <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> depends on the allocation of WT in the wind farm. If the distance between the consequent WTs is less, the effect of wake on downstream side WT will be more. In [21], authors have calculated the power loss in OSWF considering turbulence intensity and atmospheric stability. These two parameters strongly affect the wake formation. Wake models are proposed to analyze the wake effects in [22]. Those are Jensen model by N.O.Jensen, Larsen model by G.C.

Within this research, a generic coupling methodology is developed to model both near-field and far-field <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> caused by floating (e. g., WECs, platforms) or fixed offshore structures. The methodology is based on the coupling of a wave-structure interaction solver (Nemoh) and a wave propagation model.

40|$|Abstract. Large scale {{wind power}} {{penetration}} {{has a significant}} impact on the reliability of the electric generation systems. A wind farm consists of a large number of wind turbine generators (WTGs). A major difficulty in modeling wind farms is that the WTG not have an independent capacity distribution due to the dependence of the individual turbine output on the same energy source, the wind. In this paper, a model of the wind farm output power considering multi-wake effects is established according to the probability distribution of the wind speed and the characteristic of the wind generator output power: based on the simple Jenson <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> model, the <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> with wind speed sheer model and the detail <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> model with the detail shade areas of the upstream wind turbines are discussed respectively. Compared to the individual <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> model, this model takes the wind farm as a whole and considers the multi-wakes effect on the same unit. As a result the loss of the velocity inside the wind farm is considered more exactly. Furthermore, considering the features of sequentially and self-correlation of wind speed, an auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model for wind speed is built up. Also the reliability model of wind farm is built when the output characteristics of wind power generation units, correlation of wind speeds among different wind farms, outage model of wind power generation units, <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> of wind farm and air temperature are considered. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed models. These models can be used to research the reliability of power grid containing wind farms, wind farm capacity credit as well as the interconnection among wind farm...|$|E

The <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> losses are assumed as 5 % because the wind farm has turbines working {{in front of the}} other as shown in Figure  2 and so the estimated monthly capacity factor is multiplied by a factor of 0.95.|$|E

This {{is one of the reasons}} why wind power, as a renewable energy source, is increasing fast in the world today. An effective way of harnessing lots of wind power is to build large wind farms. However, the aero-dynamic interaction among wind turbines, called <b>wake</b> <b>effect,</b> makes control of wind farms complicated. In order to cope with this problem and maximize the production of wind farms, a so-called Maximum Power Point Tracker can be used. This thesis develops and evaluates a Maximum Power Point Tracker algorithm based on optimization. As compared to the previous research in the topic, the algorithm in this thesis takes into account not only the <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> but also the collector system losses. Moreover, it also considers reactive power dispatch, cable current capability and bus voltage limits. The evaluation shows that the active power output of a sample wind farm consisting of 18 wind turbines, rated 6 MW each, can increase by as much as 1. 30 %.

It is established that thermal <b>wake</b> <b>effects</b> can be expressed quantitatively solely as functions of the flow efficiency and the fin pitch to louver pitch ratio.

40|$|In a wind farm, the {{upstream}} {{wind turbine}} may cause power {{loss to the}} downstream wind turbines due to the <b>wake</b> <b>effect.</b> Meanwhile, the energy production {{is determined by the}} power generation and the lifetime of the wind turbine. In this paper, an optimal active power control method is proposed to maximize the energy production of wind farms by considering the <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> and the lifetime of wind turbine. It starts with the analysis of the pitch angle curve and active power curve seen from the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) of individual wind turbines. Taking the <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> into account, the pitch angle curve and active power curve are optimized with the aim of Maximum Power Generation (MPG) of the wind farm. Afterwards, considering the lifetime of wind turbines, a comparison is offered between the MPPT method and the MPG method for energy production using a simplified two-turbine wind farm as an example. Due to the small range of the effective wake area, it is found that the energy production is almost the same. Finally, the pitch angle curve and active power curve are optimized according to the Maximum Energy Production (MEP) of a wind farm. Upon considering and contrasting the MPPT method and the MEP method, {{it can be seen that}} the energy production of wind farms can be increased even in the case of there not being an effective wake area...|$|E

Unlike the conventional approach in which each wind turbine operation is optimised individually to maximise its own energy capture, the proposed control strategy aims to optimise the whole system by operating some wind turbines at sub-optimum points, so that the <b>wake</b> <b>effect</b> within the WPP is reduced and therefore the total power generation is maximised. The methodology {{used to assess the}} performance of both control approaches is presented and applied to two particular study cases. It contains a comprehensive wake model considering single, partial and multiple wake effects among turbines. The study also takes into account the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory to accurately compute both power and thrust coefficient of each wind turbine. The results suggest a good potential of the proposed concept, since an increase in the annual energy captured by the WPP from 1. 86 % up to 6. 24 % may be achieved (depending on the wind rose at the WPP location) by operating some specific wind turbines slightly away from their optimum point and reducing thus the <b>wake</b> <b>effect.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|For highly non-planar {{lifting systems}} like the box wing, induced drag {{predictions}} based on common potential-flow methods can have limited accuracy. This is primarily {{related to the}} linear, fixed-wake surrogate models, which neglect the correlation of the effective height-to-span ratio and system angle of attack or insufficiently account for free-wake deformations such as deflection and roll-up effects. Dependent on the vertical and horizontal wing arrangement of simplified box wing and biplane configurations and the system angle of attack, the present research analyses the unknown impact of <b>wake</b> model <b>effects,</b> investigates the accuracy of potential-flow induced drag predictions against an Euler-flow reference and explores the influence of higher-order <b>wake</b> <b>effects.</b> The computational expense of considered methodologies is assessed to evaluate their applicability within an aerodynamic design and optimization methodology for highly non-planar lifting systems.

The body-fixed wake model is found generally inappropriate for induced drag estimation of present lifting systems, whereas the freestream-fixed wake model provides consistent results.
