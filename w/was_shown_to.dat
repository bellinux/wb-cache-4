50|$|The {{olfactory}} tubercle has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play a {{large role}} in behavior. Unilateral lesions in the olfactory tubercle have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> alter attention, social and sensory responsiveness, and even locomotor behavior. Bilateral lesions have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> reduce copulatory behavior in male rats. The olfactory tubercle has also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> especially involved in reward and addictive behaviors. Rats have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle more than the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, other reward centers in the brain. In fact, they will administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle at about 200 times per hour and even till death.|$|R

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be the molecular repository of genetic information by {{experiments in the}} 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D.

50|$|The AP-1 {{transcription}} factor has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play numerous roles in cell growth and proliferation. In particular, c-Fos and c-Jun {{seem to be}} major players in these processes. C-jun has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essential for fibroblast proliferation, and levels of both AP-1 subunits have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expressed above basal levels during cell division. C-fos has also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> increase in expression {{in response to the}} introduction of growth factors in the cell, further supporting its suggested involvement in the cell cycle. The growth factors TGF alpha, TGF beta, and IL2 have all <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> stimulate c-Fos, and thereby stimulate cellular proliferation via AP-1 activation.|$|R

5|$|Aletheia– The former Oracle of Delphi who was gifted with prophetic sight. When she was {{encountered}} by Kratos, she <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be {{an elderly woman}} who had no eyes. Castor and Pollux crushed her under rocks so that Kratos could not see her. Her dying words to Kratos told him to seek the Eyes of Truth across the sea in the Lantern of Delos—the Eyes being her own eyes that were taken by the Furies. The character was voiced by Adrienne Barbeau in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} Spanish {{research}} study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mushrooms, Rhodotus palmatus was one of 204 species screened against a panel of human clinical pathogens and laboratory control strains. Using a standard laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, the mushroom <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> have moderate antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, and weak antifungal activity against both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus.|$|E
5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E

At the molecular level, repandiol is an alkylating agent. It inserts crosslinks between strands of DNA, {{making it difficult}} for the genetic material to be expressed or replicated.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E

A mixed fortnightly collection <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be the worst performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste. A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|Flies have rapid {{reflexes}} {{that aid}} their escape from predators but their sustained flight speeds are low. Dolichopodid {{flies in the}} genus Condylostylus respond in less than 5 milliseconds to camera flashes by taking flight. In the past, the deer bot fly, Cephenemyia, was claimed {{to be one of}} the fastest insects on the basis of an estimate made visually by Charles Townsend in 1927. This claim, of speeds of 600 to 800 miles per hour, was regularly repeated until it <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be physically impossible as well as incorrect by Irving Langmuir. Langmuir suggested an estimated speed of 25 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|Following the feud, Kelly and Knox {{were moved}} into a storyline with CM Punk in September, in which Kelly <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> have {{developed}} a liking for Punk, and Knox <b>was</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be increasingly protective and jealous. During the next month, Kelly continuously flirted with Punk and was shown watching his matches from the crowd, until Knox stopped her. Subsequently, Kelly's character dressed as Punk for ECW's Halloween Costume Contest, enraging Knox and leading to a match between the two, during which Kelly cheered for Punk. At December to Dismember, Kelly and Knox took on the team of Ariel and Kevin Thorn in a mixed tag team match, during which Knox refused to tag in before abandoning Kelly, leaving her to be beaten down by Ariel. On the following episode of ECW, Kelly defeated Ariel with a roll-up on her first ECW singles match, after which Knox came to ringside with flowers, only to throw them in Kelly's face and perform his signature swinging reverse STO on her, ending their relationship and giving her a scripted injury, removing her from the program for six weeks.|$|E
