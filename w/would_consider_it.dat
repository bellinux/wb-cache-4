5|$|William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland made {{it clear}} in a {{communication}} with the proprietor of the Dublin Daily Express {{that he would not}} allow an armed expedition of hundreds of men, as the committee was planning, and that 50 unarmed men would be sufficient to harvest the crops. He said that the government <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> their duty to protect this group. On 10 November 1880, the relief expedition consisting of one contingent from County Cavan and one from County Monaghan left for County Mayo. Additional troops had already arrived in County Mayo to protect the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|In July 1991, Špegelj and Đodan's {{advice was}} {{supported}} by a number of Croatian Parliament members. In response, Tuđman dismissed Đodan the same month he was appointed Defence Minister, and Špegelj resigned his command of the ZNG on 3 August. The deteriorating situation in eastern Croatia, including the JNA expulsion of ZNG troops from Baranja, intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci, increasing losses and the growing conviction that the JNA were actively supporting the Croatian Serb revolt, forced Tuđman to act. On 22 August, he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the withdrawal of the JNA to its barracks {{by the end of the}} month. The ultimatum stated that if the JNA failed to comply, Croatia <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> an army of occupation and take corresponding action. On 1 September, the EC proposed a ceasefire and a peace conference was accepted by the Yugoslav Presidency and by Tuđman, despite his earlier ultimatum. The conference started on 7 September, but only four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the presidency, Stjepan Mesić, ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours. This order was motivated by Tuđman's concern that the conference would drag on while the ZNG lost territory. Even though the order was opposed by other members of the presidency, it gave Croatia justification to openly confront the JNA.|$|E

5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it.</b> Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not in the best interest of the province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E
25|$|Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, {{offered to}} sell the patent {{outright}} to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone {{was nothing but a}} toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25million he <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted {{to sell the}} patent. Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 Bulloch {{contracted}} with the Laird shipyard {{for the construction}} of two ironclad rams to be used against the Union blockade. However, if it could be proven that the contract (or commission) for building these ships was in violation of Britain's neutrality law, the ships could be seized. The Union's minister to Britain, Charles F. Adams, tried to do just that; but he could only gather circumstantial evidence, as Bulloch {{went to great lengths to}} conceal his movements. Adams threatened the British government with reprisal: that if the rams escaped, the United States <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> an act of war. After further consideration, British authorities seized the two vessels and from that point on kept a close watch on Bulloch and other such propositions made by the Confederate government, forcing C.S.A. officials to turn to the French for future commissions. Following that turn of events Bulloch then commissioned a shipbuilder in France to construct the Stonewall, an other armored ram.|$|E

John Crace reviewed the documentary for The Guardian, noting that Holland was no [...] "attention-seeking, neo-Conservative, Niall Ferguson lookalike" [...] but was probably a social liberal. Crace opined that while most Westerners would find Holland's findings uncontentious, many devout Muslims <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> blasphemous.

At the same time, North Korean T-34 tanks, SU-76 self-propelled guns, and antitank guns moved toward Komam-ni on the road {{at the foot of}} Sibidang-san.

She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'."

500|$|Several {{biographies of}} Hans-Joachim Marseille {{have written about}} his disdain for {{authority}} and for the National Socialist movement in general.

After returning to Africa, Eduard Neumman recalled, [...] "After his first visit with Hitler, Marseille returned {{and said that he}} thought 'the Führer was a rather odd sort'." [...] On the visit, Marseille also said some unflattering things about Hitler and the Nazi Party. Several senior officers, which included Adolf Galland and Nicolaus von Below, overheard his remarks during one of the award ceremonies. Von Below asked Marseille if he would join the Nazi Party and within earshot of others, Marseille responded, [...] "that if he saw a party worth joining, he <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it,</b> but there would have to plenty of attractive women in it."

[...] Shortly thereafter, {{in an attempt to}} bring the two Reform Party factions together, Trump invited party leaders to the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.

[...] Verney appreciated the gesture and in shifting from his once-chilly reception to the Trump candidacy, he welcomed Trump into the race. [...] After opening the event to questions, one attendee asked Trump whether he would appear at the Florida Reform Party's state convention. [...] Trump said he <b>would</b> <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> [...] "very seriously." [...] Concerning Buchanan, Trump repeated he could not support Buchanan as the party's nominee. [...] Despite the retreat, the intra-party dispute over the location of the convention continued. [...] Citing scheduling conflicts, Trump did not attend the Florida Reform Party's state convention. [...] Reports suggested that Trump insiders believed Buchanan had packed the convention with supporters and would embarrass Trump by winning all the state's delegates. [...] There were also growing indications Trump was considering withdrawing from the race, commenting that he was [...] "deeply concerned" [...] about the conflict within the party. [...] In another attempt to unite the party's factions, Trump wrote letters to Ventura and Perot, requesting the two make peace. [...] Trump believed the instability of the party would hinder his chances of presidential success. Stone commented that [...] "the [...] party is melting down before our very eyes." [...] On the final day of January, Trump was removed from the New York primary ballot after a judge determined that Trump's supporters had failed to obtain the required 5,000 signatures from registered Reform Party members.
