5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many times in the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E
5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} night the New York Mets <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> behind to defeat the Boston Red Sox in Game 7 of the 1986 World Series, the Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 27–20 in week eight to improve to 6–2 and move into a tie with the Redskins for the division lead. With the teams tied 20–20, Joe Morris scored the game-winning touchdown on a 13-yard run with 98 seconds remaining. The Giants offense featured a two tight end formation {{throughout much of the}} game which allowed them to run the ball more effectively. The Giants used Mark Bavaro and Zeke Mowatt throughout much of the game, sometimes even lining them up on the same side. Morris finished the game with 181yards. Redskins quarterback Jay Schroeder threw for 420yards in the loss.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} visual capture {{experienced}} {{in daily life}} {{is known as the}} “ventriloquism effect”. This is when ventriloquists make their speech appear to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> their puppet rather than their own mouths. In this situation, visual capture allows the audio stimuli to be controlled by the vision system and produce a congruent experience that the sound <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the puppet.Another popular example of visual capture happens while watching a movie in a theater, and the sound appears to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the actors lips. Although this may seem true, the sound <b>is</b> actually <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the speakers, often spread out across the theater rather than directly behind wherever the character’s mouth may be.|$|R
5|$|According to the Orkneyinga saga, when Earl Páll herd of Earl Rögnvaldr's {{arrival in}} Shetland, he held council {{and decided to}} {{immediately}} gather forces and attack Earl Rögnvaldr before he could be reinforced by the incoming men he knew <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the Suðreyjar. That night Earl Páll was joined by five chieftains, with four ships—this brings his total forces to five ships. The fleet sailed to Rousay, where they arrive at sunset. During the night the force is further strengthened by arriving men. In the morning, as the fleet is about to set out for Shetland to meet Earl Rögnvaldr, about ten or twelve ships were spotted coming from the Pentland Firth. Earl Páll and his men were certain these ships were those of Frakökk and Ölvir; in consequence, the earl ordered the fleet to intercept. The saga states that when Ölvir's ships were east of Tankerness, they then sailed west from Mulls Head, Deerness. By this time, Earl Páll was further strengthened by a chieftain from Tankerness. The earl then ordered his ships to be bound together, and for a bondi to gather stones for the upcoming battle. When the earl and his troops have fully prepared themselves, the saga states that Ölvir's forces made their attack.|$|E
5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
25|$|By 1798, Brune was at Corfu. During {{the siege}} she slipped by the Russian ships and into Corfu to inform General Chabot that {{reinforcements}} <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> Ancona. The reinforcements did leave on 8 December, but only reached Corfu's north coast in early January. They then left {{when they were}} unable to establish contact with Chabot.|$|E

Many Pakistani defence analysts and experts had publicly accused India and Afghanistan of aiding the Taliban to destabilize Pakistan. On May 19, 2009, the Pakistan Army captured three foreign fighters from Mingora District. According to the Pakistani Army, all these foreign fighters were Libyan nationals. The Pakistani Army also captured five Saudi nationals during the search operation.|$|E
25|$|CacheFlow {{grew from}} $7 million in {{revenues}} in 1998, to $29 million in 1999 and $97 million in 2001. However, it already had 21–35 {{percent of the total}} market for its products and was still not profitable. The company lost 97 percent of its value from October 2000 to March 2001 as the dot-com bubble came to an end and the company reported continued negative profits. By 2002, several competing internet caching companies had abandoned the market, due to slow adoption of caching technology and most of CacheFlow's revenues <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> its IT security products.|$|E
25|$|When {{the news}} reached the Spanish headquarters, Don Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands, and {{commander-in-chief}} of the Spanish {{forces in the}} Low Countries, sent his son Don Fadrique with 4,000 soldiers (other 16,000 soldiers <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the north), along with the Maestre de Campo Chiappino Vitelli, to defeat Louis of Nassau and retrieve Mons. On 23 June Fadrique's forces arrived at Mons and laid siege to the city. Furthermore, in early June, the Duke of Alba, {{at the head of}} the bulk of the Spanish army, recaptured Valenciennes after a feeble defence of the Protestant garrison, depriving the rebels, and their French allies, of one of their main bases.|$|E

25|$|Despite suspicions {{against him}} Brown was {{appointed}} to the newly formed Kidnap Squad. With prohibition over, local criminals turned to new sources of income. Racketeers Jack Piefer and Harry Sawyer suggested that the Barker-Karpis gang should move into kidnapping. They kidnapped wealthy businessman William Hamm. Brown informed them of plans by police to trap them. The ransom money was successfully collected, and a cut given to Brown. Another kidnapping followed. Edward Bremer, a local businessman, was snatched on his way to work after dropping his daughter at school on January 15, 1934. The FBI became actively involved. When it became evident that leaks <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the local Kidnap Squad, Brown was isolated from the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Education is an {{important}} factor in healthcare utilization, though it is closely intertwined with economic status. An individual may not go to a medical professional or seek care if they don’t know the ills of their failure to do so, or the value of proper treatment. In Tajikistan, since the nation gained its independence, the likelihood of giving birth at home has increased rapidly among women with lower educational status. Education also has a significant impact on the quality of prenatal and maternal healthcare. Mothers with primary education consulted a doctor during pregnancy at significantly lower rates (72%) when compared to those with a secondary education (77%), technical training (88%) or a higher education (100%). There is also evidence for a correlation between socioeconomic status and health literacy; one study showed that wealthier Tanzanian families were more likely to recognize disease in their children than those that <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> lower income backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|In January 2000, Dayton-Hudson {{was renamed}} the Target Corporation; between 75 and 80 percent of Dayton-Hudson's sales and {{earnings}} <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> Target while the department stores {{were used to}} fuel its growth. It also separated its e-commerce operations from its retailing division and combined it with Rivertown Trading into a standalone subsidiary called target.direct. The following year, the Dayton's and Hudson's stores were rebranded under the Marshall Field's name. The company sold Marshall Field's to May Department Stores in June 2004 and sold Mervyn's to an investment consortium including Sun Capital Partners, Cerberus Capital Management, and Lubert-Adler/Klaff and Partners, L.P that September. In 2005, Target began operation in Bangalore, India. In 2006, Target completed construction of the Robert J. Ulrich Center in Embassy Golf Links in Bangalore, and Target planned to continue its expansion into India {{with the construction of}} additional office space at the Mysore Corporate Campus and successfully opened a branch at Mysore.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the policemen}} {{were not able}} to {{recognize}} where the shots <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from.</b> After roughly 30 minutes of gunfire, the CJNG gunmen left through the mountains' forest. Investigators {{were not able to}} confirm any casualties from the CJNG's side, but Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco stated that it was not uncommon for organized crime members to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades from the battlefield to prevent authorities from investigating and identifying the corpses. He said that the suspects were probably hiding in the nearby mountains, which makes it difficult for law enforcement to conduct a thorough search of the area. Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco admitted that one of the biggest obstacles of the investigation was understanding how the CJNG found out the exact day, time, and place the police convoy was going to pass through the area where they were ambushed. He believes that the CJNG had precise information on the police's journey, and does not discard the possibility that an outsider might have given the CJNG information on the police's arrangements, or that someone inside the police ranks was passing along information to them.|$|E
25|$|The Russians {{had gained}} control of the {{habitats}} {{of the most valuable}} sea otters, the Kurilian-Kamchatkan and Aleutian sea otters. Their fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those of sea otters on the Pacific Northwest Coast and California. The Russians, therefore, advanced to the Northwest Coast only after the superior varieties of sea otters were depleted, around 1788. The Russian entry to the Northwest Coast was slow, however, due to a shortage of ships and sailors. Yakutat Bay was reached in 1794 and the settlement of Slavorossiya was built there in 1795. Reconnaissance of the coast as far as the Queen Charlotte Islands was carried out by James Shields, a British employee of the Golikov-Shelikhov Company. In 1795 Alexandr Baranov, who had been hired in 1790 to manage Shelikhov's fur enterprise, sailed into Sitka Sound, claiming it for Russia. Hunting parties arrived in the following years and by 1800 three-quarters of Russian America's sea otter skins <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the Sitka Sound area. In July 1799 Baranov returned on the brig Oryol and established the settlement of Arkhangelsk. It was destroyed by Tlingits in 1802 but rebuilt nearby in 1804 and given the name Novo-Arkhangelsk (New Archangel). It soon become the primary settlement and colonial capital of Russian America. After the Alaska Purchase, it was renamed Sitka, the first capital of Alaska Territory.|$|E

Some [...] were voyeuristic and some <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> personal experience [...] I remember getting the lyrics to 'Yes' and thinking 'You crazy fucker, how do I write music for this?'". Critic Simon Price notes that the potential radio-friendliness of the song is undermined by its focus on the subject of prostitution and the recurrence of sexual swearing in the lyric.|$|E

This was to repay his arrears in back wages from his Wardenship of the East March, from an indenture of 1 June 1463.

[...] But the change was also motivated by broad demographic shifts; when the organization had first been formed, Puerto Ricans comprised about 63 percent of the overall New York Latino population. This figure had now fallen to about 34 percent, and the group's clients <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> Bolivia, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and the like.

Meanwhile, Towers 12 through 14 had actually been picked up off of their foundations, moved slightly to the northwest and set back down intact and upright, held together by only the railroad tracks on the bridge. Next towers four through nine collapsed to the west, twisting clockwise, as the tornado started to move northward. As it moved north, inflow winds {{came in from the}} south and caused Towers 12, 13, and 14 to finally collapse towards the north, twisting counterclockwise.|$|E
