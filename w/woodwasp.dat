5|$|Birds are {{the primary}} natural enemies of the Sirex <b>woodwasp.</b> The adults are {{frequently}} hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex <b>woodwasp.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} species of Siricidae, the Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> can damage {{relatively}} healthy trees so heavily, they die back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; only when the population is high does the insect also attack intact and healthy trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need healthy wood, the Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood which was already infested.|$|E
5|$|The Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> and Amylostereum areolatum have a mutualistic {{symbiotic}} relationship. The Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> is, {{together with}} Sirex juvencus and S. nitobei from eastern Asia, {{one of three}} symbionts of the fungus {{that in the first}} instance benefits from its vector function. Additionally, the wasp creates the optimal conditions for the infestation through the fungus by drilling into the underlying wood layers and weakening the host tree. The fungus adapted to this process {{in the course of the}} years and has created fruit bodies only rarely or in the crop.|$|E
50|$|Mycangia of the <b>woodwasps</b> (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) {{were first}} {{described}} by Buchner. Different from highly diverse types in bark and ambrosia beetles, <b>woodwasps</b> {{only have a}} pair of mycangia {{on the top of}} their ovipositor. Then when females deposit their eggs inside the host plant, they inject the symbiotic fungi from mycangia and phytotoxic mucus from another reservoir-like structure.|$|R
5|$|The {{range of}} the Amylostereaceae {{originally}} comprised only Holarctic regions, including North America and Eurasia, and the Neotropics, with Central and South America. The introduction of A.areolatum and its symbionts, the Sirex <b>woodwasps,</b> saw {{the spread of the}} genus to all continents except Antarctica.|$|R

5|$|The native {{habitat of}} the Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> is the {{temperate}} Palaearctic, ranging from Maghreb over Europe, Siberia, and Mongolia, to the Kamchatka peninsula. They live in deep pine-rich forests.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the <b>woodwasp</b> larvae. The population of the Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E
5|$|Larvae of Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are {{produced}} per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the <b>woodwasp</b> is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E

5|$|The Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> only attacks conifers, {{especially}} pines. In {{its usual}} habitat, these are mainly Pinus sylvestris, Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra. In the Southern Hemisphere and in North America, the wasp attacks exotic and domestic pine species, generally in plantations. Examples include Pinus radiata and Pinus taeda in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of the Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> {{are almost}} {{colourless}} and only have three stub-shaped pairs of sterna. They cut through host wood with their powerful mandibles. They have a pointed, dark tip at their rear end, which presses the drilling {{dust on the}} walls of the borehole. They closely resemble other larvae in the genus Sirex.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, the <b>woodwasp</b> {{is fully}} {{dependent}} on the symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
5000|$|Females of the leaf-rolling weevil in {{the genus}} Euops (Coleoptera: Attelabidae) store {{symbiotic}} fungi in the mycangia, which {{is between the}} first ventral segment of the abdomen and the thorax. [...] Different from ovipositor-associate mycangia in <b>woodwasps,</b> lizard beetles, and ship-timber beetles, mycangia of leaf-rolling weevils {{is a pair of}} spore incubators at the anterior end of the abdomen. This mycangium is formed by the coxa and the metendosternite at the posterior end of the thorax.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{inoculum}} in mycangia are fungi. The symbiotic inoculum of most {{bark and}} ambrosia beetles are fungi belonging to Ophiostomatales (Ascomycota: Sordariomycetidae) and Microascales (Ascomycota: Hypocreomycetidae). Symbiotic fungi in mycangia of <b>woodwasps</b> are Amylostereaceae (Basidiomycota: Russulales). Symbiotic fungi in mycangia of lizard beetles are yeast (Ascomycota: Saccharomycetales). Symbiotic fungi in mycangia of ship-timber beetles are Endomyces (Ascomycota: Dipodascaceae). Symbiotic fungi in mycangia of leaf-rolling weevils are Penicillium fungi (Ascomycota: Trichocomaceae). In {{addition to the}} above primary symbiotic fungi, secondary fungi and some bacteria have been isolated from mycangia.|$|R
40|$|In Europe, siricid <b>woodwasps</b> attack dead, dying or {{weakened}} {{coniferous trees}} {{in a variety}} of ecological situations. Female siricids drill into trees, making characteristic punctures in the bark and wood, and oviposition shafts in which no eggs or one or more eggs are deposited.

5|$|Subsequently, {{forestry}} authorities intensified their {{pest control}} methods and additionally started education campaigns, such as warning not to transport firewood over large distances or to store it too long. Through wood export, the wasp can spread to East Asia, West Australia {{and parts of}} Africa. Remote locations, such as the Horn of Africa, may be spared from the Sirex <b>woodwasp,</b> providing the area is controlled. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the IUCN has graded the wasp as heavily invasive.|$|E
5|$|Three Amylostereum {{species are}} {{symbionts}} of wood wasps in the genera Sirex, Urocerus, and Xoanon, which infest conifers. The female wood wasps deposit their eggs together with fungal spores and mucus in trees, and the fungus is eaten by the wasp's larva as food. The fungus propagates vegetatively through {{the formation of}} asexual spores in newly emerged females that are stored in special structures adapted for the transport of symbiotic fungi. The A.areolatum–Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> (S.noctilio) symbiont complex has been studied extensively because of its potential to cause substantial economic losses in the forestry industry, particularly in non-native regions.|$|E
5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E
40|$|Deladenus proximus (Neotylenchidae) is a {{nematode}} {{associated with}} pine trees and <b>woodwasps,</b> Sirex nigricornis (Hymenoptera). Previous to this study, little {{was known about}} the geographic distribution and variability of D. proximus. Herein I present information about their life cycle, pathogenicity, and variability. The life cycle {{is similar to that}} of other species of Deladenus in that it includes mycetophagous and entomopathogenic stages. Fertilized female nematodes penetrate siricid larvae and grow in the body cavity releasing thousands of larvae. These larvae invade the gonads, mycangia (sacs containing symbiotic fungus) and eggs upon metamorphosis of the host. Females oviposit infected eggs and spores of fungus (Amylostereum chailletii) into stressed trees, where nematodes mature and feed on the fungus, completing the life cycle. From 2009 to 2012 a total of 1, 574 <b>woodwasps</b> were collected from Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, and South Carolina. <b>Woodwasps</b> were dissected and live nematodes were reared on cultures of A. chailletii and examined upon maturation. Reared nematodes were compared against type specimens of D. ipini and published descriptions of D. proximus. My study indicates prevalence varied across localities but every infected female wasp was sterilized, as indicated by presence of nematodes in the eggs. In addition I compared diagnostic characteristics of adult nematodes from each locality and found no significant difference in their size and structures. The nuclear loci 18 S, 5. 8 S and ITS 1 and 2 and the mitochondrial locus cox 1 were amplified from each nematode. Nuclear DNA was invariable from all 4 locations and had 99 % identity to the invasive species Deladenus siricidicola. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed more variability so these data were used to evaluate genetic structure across localities. Analysis of the cox 1 data revealed 19 haplotypes and the absence of any geographic clusters or subpopulations. The lack of geographic structure may be due to the fact that each female wasp is infected with only one adult female nematode and therefore larvae within a wasp are siblings. With a generation time of 2 weeks these nematodes can have 20 generations without immigration or emigration, suggesting these nematodes are inbred. The pattern of transmission of this nematode and pathogenicity {{is similar to that of}} Deladenus siricidicola, which is used as a biocontrol against the invasive species Sirex noctilio. Experimental infections of Deladenus proximus in Sirex noctilio are recommended to test their viability as a biocontrol agent...|$|R
40|$|The {{mutualism}} between siricid <b>woodwasps</b> and Amylostereum fungal symbionts {{has long}} been considered to be species-specific. Recent studies from North America have challenged this assumption, where native siricids and the introduced Sirex noctilio are clearly swapping symbionts. Whether this pattern {{is a consequence of}} invasion or an underappreciated property of siricid biology is unknown. Here we show that the native Japanese siricid, Sirex nitobei, carries both Amylostereum areolatum and Amylostereum chailletii, rather than only A. areolatum as long assumed. Furthermore, all samples from a Urocerus sp. unexpectedly carried, A. chailletii and not Amylostereum laevigatum. Vegetative compatibility group tests revealed extensive clonality, with one VCG present amongst three A. areolatum isolates and six VCGs present amongst 61 A. chailletii isolates. These results contribute to the understanding of insect-fungal fidelity in the siricid-Amylostereum association and, together with other studies, suggest that host tree influences Amylostereum species occurrence, perhaps more strongly than wasps.

40|$|Previous {{molecular}} {{analyses of}} higher hymenopteran relationships {{have largely been}} based on subjectively aligned ribosomal sequences (18 S and 28 S). Here, we reanalyze the 18 S and 28 S data (unaligned about 4. 4 kb) using an objective and a semi-objective alignment approach, based on MAFFT and BAli-Phy, respectively. Furthermore, we present the first analyses of a substantial protein-coding data set (4. 6 kb from one mitochondrial and four nuclear genes). Our results indicate that previous studies may have suffered from inflated support values due to subjective alignment of the ribosomal sequences, but apparently not from significant biases. The protein data provide independent confirmation of several earlier results, including the monophyly of non-xyelid hymenopterans, Pamphilioidea + Unicalcarida, Unicalcarida, Vespina, Apocrita, Proctotrupomorpha and core Proctotrupomorpha.

Combining the available morphological, ribosomal and protein-coding data, we examine the total-evidence signal as well as congruence and conflict among the three data sources. Despite an emerging consensus on many higher-level hymenopteran relationships, several problems remain unresolved or contentious, including rooting of the hymenopteran tree, relationships of the <b>woodwasps,</b> placement of Stephanoidea and Ceraphronoidea, and the sister group of Aculeata...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 1 Traps of {{four new}} designs were tested against the {{conventionally}} used multiple-funnel trap {{to determine whether}} trapping of large wood-boring insects can be improved in western Canada. All four new traps used a large collecting receptacle containing detergent-laced water, and three presented a prominent visual silhouette above the receptacle. 2 In total, 27 336 large woodborers were captured from 10 June to 30 September in an experiment in the southern interior of British Columbia, and 4737 from 6 June to 27 July in an experiment in northern Alberta. The woodborers captured in the British Columbia experiment were mainly beetles in the families Cerambycidae (79 %) and Buprestidae (15 %), and <b>woodwasps</b> in the family Siricidae (6 %). Most woodborers, e. g. three Monochamus spp. and Xylotrechus longitarsus (the predominant cerambycids), were captured throughout the summer, with peak captures in August. 3 Cross-vane, pipe and stacked-bottomless-¯ower-pot traps were generally superior to pan and multiple-funnel traps for insects in nine taxa, but cross-vane traps were the most effective overall, trapping 32 % of all insects captured. 4 The large number of target insects captured in {{a relatively small number}} of traps in the two experiments suggests that employment of an ef®cacious trap with a large vertical silhouette and a wide, escape-proof collecting receptacle could make mass trapping of large woodborers in timber processing areas operationally feasible. 5 Because the most effective traps were unstable in the wind, and the detergent-laced water captured unacceptably high numbers of small mammals, design mod-i®cations are necessary.

500|$|This <b>woodwasp</b> is an {{invasive}} species {{in many parts}} of the world, including Australia, New Zealand, North America, South America, and South Africa, where it has become a significant economic pest of pine trees.

500|$|Several {{biological}} control agents have been employed {{to try to}} limit populations of the Sirex <b>woodwasp.</b> [...] B. siricidicola {{has been shown to}} infect up to 70% of the wasps, but delivery and inoculation have been an issue when delivering the organism to the tree. [...] The introductions of parasitic wasps. Megarhyssa nortoni nortoni, Rhyssa persuasoria persuasoria and Ibalia leucospoides leucospoides have been successful at hyperparasitism, but do not reduce wasp populations below 40% of the local population. [...] Although some success in slowing the population growth of the wasp has been observed, these measures are not stopping the spread of the wasp.|$|E
500|$|Several parasites have {{a larger}} impact on <b>woodwasp</b> populations. These include Ibalia leucospoides (Ibaliidae); Schletterius cinctipes, Megarhyssa nortoni (Ichneumonidae); and Rhyssa persuasoria. While I. leucospoides lay its eggs into the woodwasp's egg and the {{hatching}} period is therefore similar to its host's, the ichneumons mentioned lay their eggs on larvae or adult woodwasps; they hatch out later in the springtime. The parasites locate host larvae hidden in the wood using their antennae to detect cues, including the smell of leaking drill dust or fungus mycelium, weak vibrations, or differences in temperature. The majority of these insect [...] hyperparasites feed on honeydew and nectar, both of which affect the woodwasps' sensitivity.|$|E
500|$|The {{species has}} reached other continents, such as Australia, South Africa and North America, through {{the export of}} timber and firewood. While {{invasion}} was prevented in North America for a long time, the Sirex <b>woodwasp</b> established itself in New Zealand around 1900. There, it contributed to massive pine declines {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, spreading to Tasmania in the 1950s and then to the Australian mainland.
