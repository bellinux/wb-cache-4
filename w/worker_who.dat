30|$|Only {{few studies}} have {{investigated}} the consequences of returning {{to work for the}} pre-disability employer versus returning to work for a new employer. These studies suggest that the pre-injury employer has a significant impact on disabled worker’s subsequent labour market outcomes. For example, Campolieti (2004) found that <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> returned to the pre-injury employer were more likely to receive accommodations than <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> returned to another employer. Campolieti and Krashinsy (2006) found that permanently impaired male <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> returned to the pre-accident employer had significantly higher wages than <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> did not return to the pre-injury employer.|$|R
40|$|Context: Little {{is known}} about Wisconsin <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> wear {{respirators}} and the prevalence of work-related asthma (WRA) in that population. To understand this problem, we questioned <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> wear respirators. Objectives: The primary objective was {{to learn more about}} the health experiences of <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> wear res-pirators. A secondary objective was to evaluate the util-ity of the survey in WRA surveillance. Design: A survey was mailed to an opportunistic sample of <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> received medical evaluation for respira-tor fit testing. Participants: Surveys were sent to 1356 workers medi-cally evaluated to wear a respirator; 192 surveys were completed and returned...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze the main {{characteristics}} of the jobs of <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> attended college in comparison of <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> finished high school and did not pursued their studies. On one hand, there is a description of unemployment and jobs of different groups. For <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> completed college, the rate of unemployment and the incidence of “low quality” jobs are lower than for less skilled workers. On the other hand, the article presents an estimation of the wage premium of college and more specifically, of the premium in occupations where we can find workers with college and with high-school. The main conclusion is that there is a premium for <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> finished college but the results are not clear for <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> studied some years of college but did not graduate. The data used refer to the Household Survey of the nineties. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of local status, where workers compare their wage to the wage of other workers within the same firm. We assume a {{competitive}} labor market with unobservable effort, where firms condition wages on output as incentive for effort. If <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> care about status are also more productive, such status concerns generate an equilibrium with heterogenous firms where <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> care and <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> do not care about status work together. Such firms provide <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> care about status with stronger incentives to exert effort, compared with <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> do not care. In addition, there will be homogenous firm <b>who</b> employ <b>workers</b> of the same type. The main result is that wage differences within heterogenous firms exceed the wage differences across homogenous firms. The difference from previous studies (e. g., Frank 1984) is that effort is elastically supplied and the payment for status is influenced by the relative supply of <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> care and do not care about status. The positive correlation between status concerns and productivity is derived as part of the equilibrium, because <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> care about status signal their stronger motivation through investment in schooling. These results are maintained if one adds risk aversion and global status concerns, where workers also care about the average wage in society. Tel-Aviv Universit...|$|R

His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
