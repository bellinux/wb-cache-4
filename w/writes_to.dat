5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for leaving out {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} forced into a more participatory role in the story development. For example, in No One <b>Writes</b> <b>to</b> the Colonel, the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E

50|$|<b>Writing</b> <b>to</b> {{learn is}} also {{occasionally}} {{referred to as}} the expressivist or cognitive mode of WAC. <b>Writing</b> <b>to</b> learn supports the use of mostly informal, often ungraded <b>writing</b> exercises <b>to</b> help students understand course content in non-English disciplines. <b>Writing</b> <b>to</b> learn assumes that being able to explain or express concepts in one's own words both builds and reflects understanding. Because the goal of <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> learn exercises is learning rather than a finished writing product, instructors are discouraged from paying attention to grammar and surface mechanics. The student himself or herself, not the teacher, is the audience. Common <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> learn exercises include reading responses, journals, free writing, and multiple forms of collaborative writing.|$|R

Twenty-five first graders learned about our solar system and plans by engaging in these <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> learn activities. Finding.
