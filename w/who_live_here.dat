25|$|Much of the municipality's {{economy is}} now {{tied to the}} influx of {{tourists}} and foreigners who come to live, mostly retirees. A Wikipedia sister site Wikivoyage has an entry for San Miguel de Allende. In 2002, 250,000 visitors spent about 8.4 million USD at the town's attractions, but those <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> contribute far more to the economy. Most of this is concentrated {{in the town of}} San Miguel proper. It accounts for over 36% of the municipality's jobs and most of the municipality's income. Tourism accounts for almost all of the municipality's income from outside. This began in the mid 20th century as a cheap place to live; however, despite recent economic downturns, it no longer is. This has not lessened San Miguel's attraction for foreign visitors and retirees as homes and hotels here are still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe. Despite not having a casino or an airport and being 400 miles from the nearest beach, this small city has been ranked by magazines such as Time and Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler as one of its preferred places to live and visit.|$|E

Kirchner writes {{of the people of}} Davos: [...] "The people <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> are proud. The hard work, which is done with great love, the way they treat animals (you very seldom see an animal being mishandled) entitle them to be proud. In most cases, work here has reached the ideal standard of being done with love. You can see it in the movements of their hands. And that, in turn, ennobles the facial expression and imbues all personal contacts with a great delicacy. This is a country in which democracy has become reality. Here a man’s word still counts, and you need have no fears about sleeping with your doors open. I am so happy to be allowed to be here, and through hard work I should like to thank the people for the kindness they have shown me". Kirchner began writing critiques of his own art under the pseudonym of Louis de Marsalle in order to control public opinion of him and free himself of dependence upon the art critics of the day.|$|E
2500|$|Blessed Sister Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering {{said that}} in her mystical {{experiences}} Jesus Christ inspired her to build a shrine dedicated to his Sacred Heart. The imposing Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (also referred as Church of the Good Shepherd or Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) was built between 14 July 1957 and 21 April 1966, in the civil parish of Ermesinde in north Portugal, and consecrated to the Heart of Christ in fulfillment of the vow made by the nun. According to the writings of Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Jesus had made this promise: [...] "I will make it a place of graces. I will distribute copiously graces to all who live in this house , those <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> now, those who will live here after, and even to their relatives." [...] Jesus also promised her: [...] "Know this, My daughter, that by the charity of My Heart I desire to pour out floods of graces through your heart over the hearts of others. This is why people will come to you with confidence; {{it will not be}} your personal qualities which will attract them, but Me. No one, even the most hardened sinner, will leave your presence without having received, in one way or another, consolation, relief, or a special grace." ...|$|E

[...] Márton Gyöngyösi admitted immediately after his speech that he had composed his sentence wrongly, as he thought of MPs with Israeli-Hungarian double citizenship and not of Jewish people. At the same time Gyöngyösi offered apology for the misunderstanding. Despite this, political rivals of Jobbik started a harsh smear campaign, depicting Gyöngyösi as an extremist. As Al Jazeera reported, this led to [...] "international condemnation of Nazi-style policies and a protest outside the legislature in Budapest. Around ten thousand Hungarians in Budapest protested against Gyöngyösi's anti-Semitic remarks. All major Hungarian political parties {{took part in the}} protest. At the protest, Attila Mesterházy the leader of the successor of the state party of the communist era, the Hungarian Socialist Party, described Jobbik as a [...] "fascist possessions virus", while 5th district of Budapest mayor Antal Rogán, representing the governing Fidesz party, described Jobbik as [...] "evil". Jewish organizations, ignoring Gyöngyösi's apology and correction, responded to Gyöngyösi speech by describing it as a reintroduction of Nazism in Hungarian parliament and by describing Jobbik as a Nazi party.|$|E
2500|$|From its beginning, the colonia {{has been}} home to a mix of {{socioeconomic}} classes, with small businesses owned by the lower middle class located in grand buildings, which mostly now hold cultural or large business institutions. It {{is a mix of}} traditional and modern architecture as the area is in transition. It is a traditional neighborhood filled with mom-and-pop stores, workshops to repair anything from electronics to shoes, small eateries, many cantinas, shops that sell only fresh chicken, Chinese-Mexican cafes, and even men who come around to sharpen knives and collect scrap iron and newspapers. In a number of sections, its streets are filled with people during the day and neighbors can often be seen chatting on sidewalks and in local markets. The main festival of the year has been that of Saints Cosmas and Damian {{since the beginning of the}} neighborhood and is celebrated each year on 27 September. It is celebrated with music, fireworks and foods such as pozole, enchiladas with mole sauce, quesadillas with squash flowers and atole. Here rich and poor alike eat and enjoy the events in the same space. Many of the interiors of the old mansions have been remodeled into apartments that average about 90m2 in size with two bedrooms, conserving the original facade. Most, including many artists, <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> are attracted by the area’s past charm, reasonable prices and do not want to live far from the city center.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{sculptor}} Robert Arneson {{was commissioned}} {{to create a}} monument to Moscone to be installed in the new Moscone Convention Center. [...] The bust portraying Moscone was done in Arneson's expressionistic style and was considered acceptable by San Francisco's Art Commission. [...] However, the pedestal which the former Mayor's head rested on was deemed inappropriate and Arneson was asked to change it. At issue were references to Harvey Milk, the assassinations, the [...] "Twinkie Defense", the White Night riots, and Dianne Feinstein's mayoral succession that Arneson had included {{on the surface of}} the pedestal. [...] Arneson refused to make alterations to the work, returned the commission, and later resold the sculpture. In a critique of the event, Frederic Stout wrote that [...] "Arneson's mistake was in presenting the city mothers/fathers with something honest, engaging and provoking, that is to say, a work of art. What they wanted, of course, was not a work of art at all. They wanted an object of ritual magic: the smiling head of a dead politician." [...] In 1994 a new bust by San Francisco artist Spero Anargyros was unveiled, depicting Moscone holding a pen, below which are words from Moscone: [...] "San Francisco is an extraordinary city, because its people have learned to live together with one another, to respect each other, and to work with each other for the future of their community. That's the strength and beauty of this city – it's the reason why the citizens <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> are the luckiest people in the world." ...|$|E
