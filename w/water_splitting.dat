40|$|A new {{mechanistic}} model on <b>water</b> <b>split</b> behaviour in a hydrocyclone {{has been developed}} based on the convoluted hydrodynamics of swirling flows in a confined environment. A comprehensive study has been accomplished on the genesis and subsequent distribution of G force based on the characterization of internal flow features of a 2 in hydrocyclone through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The difference between the magnitude of G force in cylindrical and spigot regions is taken into account as a new hydrodynamic parameter to compute the <b>water</b> <b>split</b> behaviour. Specifically, our analysis reveals a semi-empirical relationship between the <b>water</b> <b>split</b> with G force difference (ΔG), the vortex finder diameter (Dvf) and the spigot diameter (Dsp). The developed model is validated against experimental data and show good prediction accuracy. Unique aspect of the developed empirical model is that the underlying mechanism of incipient flow peculiarity is implicitly accounted to rummage the separation characteristics in a quantifiable manner. In addition to rationalize the flow split behaviour of hydrocyclones, this new hydrodynamic indicator seems promising {{to be used as}} a scale-up parameter in envisaging the separation performance for a given application...|$|R

40|$|Hydrocyclones {{have been}} widely used to {{separate}} particles by size in many industries. Their flows are complicated and involve multiple phases: liquid, gas, and particles of different sizes and densities. A two fluid model, facilitated with the mixture model, has been used to study the flow in hydrocyclones under wide range of conditions and used here to study the effects of geometrical configuration and material properties of cyclones operated at different feed solids concentrations. The variables considered include geometrical configurations such as dimensions and shape of body, cone and vortex finder as well as particle density. The outcome shows a smaller cyclone results in an increased cut size, decreased pressure drop, sharper separation and higher <b>water</b> <b>split.</b> Both large and small spigot diameters lead to poor separation performances. Accordingly, an optimum spigot diameter can be identified depending on feed solids concentration. It is also shown that for all considered hydrocyclones, a better separation performance can be achieved by the operation at lower feed solid concentration. Further research shows that cyclone performance is sensitive to both length and shape of conical section. A longer conical section leads to decreased inlet pressure drop, d 50, and Ep, and an increased <b>water</b> <b>split.</b> When cone shape varies from concave to convex, a compromise optimum performance for the cyclone with a convex cone is observed with a minimum Ep and relatively small pressure drop and <b>water</b> <b>split.</b> A new hydrocyclone featured with a long convex cone is then proposed which can improve the performance of the conventional cyclone. The keycharacteristics of flow in a hydrocyclone are then investigated when vortex finder geometry including diameter length and shape varies. It has been shown that a compromise optimum performance can be identified with relatively small inlet pressure drop, Ep, and <b>water</b> <b>split.</b> Discussion is then extended to flow behaviour analysis under the effect of different density fractions. The origin of flow pattern and the motion of coal particles have been predicted and discussed. The effect of coal density variation on operational conditions and performance of the large diameter hydrocyclones are also studied in this work...|$|R
40|$|Assessing the {{performance}} of the proposed high-level radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, requires an understanding of the chemistry of the water that moves through the host rock. The uniaxial compression method used to extract pore water from samples of tuffaceous borehole core was successful only for nonwelded tuff. An ultracentrifugation method was adopted to extract pore water from samples of the densely welded tuff of the proposed repository horizon. Tests were performed using both methods to determine the efficiency of pore water extraction and the potential effects on pore water chemistry. Test results indicate that uniaxial compression is most efficient for extracting pore water from nonwelded tuff, while ultracentrifugation is more successful in extracting pore water from densely welded tuff. Pore <b>water</b> <b>splits</b> taken from a single nonwelded tuff core during uniaxial compression tests have shown changes in pore water chemistry with increasing pressure for calcium, chloride, sulfate, and nitrate, while the chemistry of pore <b>water</b> <b>splits</b> from welded and nonwelded tuffs using ultracentrifugation indicates that there is no significant fractionation of solutes...|$|R

The physics is embedded in a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation model whose key features are presented and justified in the paper. Some features are selected {{in such a way}} that the model can eventually be used to simulate dense flow inside hydrocyclones.

Simulation results are successfully compared to <b>water</b> <b>split,</b> velocity profiles inside the hydrocyclone and partition function measurements, either produced using our own experimental setup or from the literature.
