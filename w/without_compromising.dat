5|$|Much of the {{displacement}} of a dreadnought was {{taken up by the}} steel plating of the armour. Designers spent much time and effort to provide the best possible protection for their ships against the various weapons they would be faced with. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> speed, firepower or seakeeping.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{sought to}} {{mitigate}} {{the effects of the}} Pondicherry climate and oriented the Golconde dormitory (as it became known), so that its main facades faced north and south {{to make use of the}} prevailing breeze. A combination of moveable louvres on the exterior skin and woven teak sliding doors permitted ventilation <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> on privacy. The building is still in use as an ashram today. It was the first modernist building in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevention}} of oxygen toxicity depends {{entirely on the}} setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case {{prevention of}} bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity {{must be carried out}} <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.|$|E

5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more durable.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the local}} protein {{synthesis}} hypothesis gained significant support, there was general {{agreement that the}} protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur in the cell body <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The Marwari is {{descended from}} native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses. The ponies {{were small and}} hardy, but with poor conformation; the {{influence}} of the Arabian blood improved the appearance <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> the hardiness. The Arabians possibly came ashore from a cargo ship wrecked off India's west coast. Legend in India states that the Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the Kachchh District. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as foundation bloodstock for the Marwari. There is also the possibility of some Mongolian influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of the proposed algorithm is that reduces the number of re-broadcasts <b>without</b> significantly <b>compromising</b> on its reachability, while the traditional probability scheme that the AODV uses, produces more re-broadcasts.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, MBIR {{significantly}} improves {{image noise}} and streak artifacts compared to ASIR in abdominopelvic CT. MBIR shows greater potential than ASIR for achieving further radiation dose reductions over ASIR <b>without</b> severely <b>compromising</b> image quality.|$|R
5|$|Claims {{that the}} NEP had retarded {{economic}} growth were dismissed; it was posited that the NEP {{had managed to}} avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP. The NEP was also defended as having created a Malay middle class and improving standards of living <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> the non-Bumiputra share {{of the economy in}} absolute terms; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%. It was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to the NEP's success in creating a Malay upper class. Although many of the NEP's goals were restated by the NDP, the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution. Nevertheless, many of the policies from the NEP era were retained under the NDP, which was set to expire in 2020.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July, Vikrant sailed off to Cochin {{in company}} with the Western Fleet. En route, before {{reaching}} Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried out. After {{the completion of the}} radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for Madras, escorted by Brahmaputra and Beas. The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain (later Vice Admiral) S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about flight operations. He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if flight operations were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether it was possible to embark an Alizé <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> the speed restrictions. The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Alizé aircraft would have to land at close to stalling speed. Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but <b>without</b> <b>compromising</b> the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E
