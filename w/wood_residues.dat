40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the impacts of technical and market changes on the economic feasibility of using wood biomass to produce heat for an average-sized greenhouse in British Columbia. A previous techno-economic analysis determined that the installation of a wood pellet or a <b>wood</b> <b>residue</b> boiler to generate 40 % of the greenhouse heat demand is more economical than using a natural gas boiler alone to generate all the heat [1]. As the techno-economic analysis contained forecasted parameters, a thorough sensitivity analysis is needed for sound decision making. This paper extends the previous techno-economic study by assessing the effect of fuel price, wood biomass energy contribution, and greenhouse size changes on the net present value (NPV) when using a wood pellet or <b>wood</b> <b>residue</b> boiler with or without an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). The results indicate that the attractiveness of using wood biomass will increase if the price of fossil fuels increases more than 3 % per year or carbon taxes and regulations are applied. Increasing the biomass energy contribution by 20 % (to provide 60 % of the total heat demand) would still be economical.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to perform a techno-economic analysis on a typical wood pellet and <b>wood</b> <b>residue</b> boiler for generation of heat to an average-sized greenhouse in British Columbia. The variables analyzed included greenhouse size and structure, boiler efficiency, fuel types, and source of carbon dioxide (CO 2) for crop fertilization. The net present value (NPV) show that installing a wood pellet or a <b>wood</b> <b>residue</b> boiler to provide 40 % of the annual heat demand is more economical than using a natural gas boiler to provide all the heat at a discount rate of 10 %. For an assumed lifespan of 25 years, a wood pellet boiler system could generate NPV of C$ 259, 311 without electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and C$ 74, 695 with ESP, respectively. While, installing a <b>wood</b> <b>residue</b> boiler with or without an ESP could provide NPV of C$ 919, 922 or C$ 1, 104, 538, respectively. Using a wood biomass boiler could also eliminate over 3000 Â tonne CO 2 equivalents of greenhouse gases annually. Wood biomass combustion generates more particulate matters than natural gas combustion. However, an advanced emission control system could significantly reduce particulate matters emission from wood biomass combustion which would bring the particulate emission to a relatively similar level as for natural gas.

5000|$|Thermal energy {{applications}} for switchgrass {{appear to be}} closer to near-term scale-up than cellulosic ethanol for industrial or small-scale applications. For example, switchgrass can be pressed into fuel pellets that are subsequently burned in pellet stoves used to heat homes (which typically burn corn or wood pellets). Switchgrass has been widely tested as a substitute for coal in power generation. The most widely studied project to date has been the Chariton Valley Project in Iowa. [...] The Show-Me-Energy Cooperative (SMEC) in Missouri is using switchgrass and other warm-season grasses, along with <b>wood</b> <b>residues,</b> as feedstocks for pellets used for the firing of a coal-fired power plant. In Eastern Canada, switchgrass is being used on a pilot scale as a feedstock for commercial heating applications. Combustion studies have been undertaken and it appears to be well-suited as a commercial boiler fuel. Research is also being undertaken to develop switchgrass as a pellet fuel because of lack of surplus <b>wood</b> <b>residues</b> in eastern Canada, as a slowdown in the forest products industry in 2009 is now resulting in wood pellet shortages throughout Eastern North America. Generally speaking, the direct firing of switchgrass for thermal applications can provide the highest net energy gain and energy output-to-input ratio of all switchgrass bioconversion processes. Research has found switchgrass, when pelletized and used as a solid biofuel, is a good candidate for displacing fossil fuels. Switchgrass pellets were identified to have a 14.6:1 energy output-to-input ratio, which is substantially better than that for liquid biofuel options from farmland. [...] As a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy, switchgrass pellets were found to be an effective means to use farmland to mitigate greenhouse gases on the order of 7.6-13 tonnes per hectare of CO2. In contrast, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol and corn ethanol were found to mitigate 5.2 and 1.5 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, respectively.|$|E
