25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E
500|$|During the sixties, Kraft was a {{household}} name in America. He appeared {{on the cover of}} the August 27, 1965 issue of Time Magazine, in which he was profiled as the [...] "Conductor in a Command Post". In his interview with Time, Kraft compared himself with namesake Christopher Columbus, displaying what the magazine described as [...] "an almost angry pride" [...] in his work. [...] "We know a lot more about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do than he did," [...] Kraft said. [...] "And we know where we're going." [...] The article described Kraft's role in the Gemini 5 mission, and drew on Kraft's frequent comparisons of his position as flight director with that of an orchestra conductor.|$|E

500|$|Pascu parted with Divertis in 2007. At the time, he {{indicated}} that {{he could no longer}} handle their tight schedule. The break was not total, though, since Pascu continued to appear on Animat Planet. In a 2007 interview, reflecting on that show's impact, he stated, [...] "I'm not much of a fan of political humor. I simply like the impromptu kind of humor [...] If [...] happens to be political, it is because that is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do in this series." [...] In 2012, he asserted that his break with political humor was definitive, and against the consensus in Divertis—in 2007, Pascu noted there was already a disagreement between him and Toni Grecu. Shortly after his departure, a conflict between Grecu and the other Divertis actors broke Divertis into competing halves.|$|E
500|$|In March 1930, Garrett {{was posted}} as adjutant/quartermaster to the 3rd Light Horse Regiment at Mount Gambier, South Australia. As a speaker at Mount Gambier's Anzac Day commemorations on 25 April 1934, he was {{reported}} as {{warning of the}} poor state of Australia's preparedness for war, admonishing: [...] "We shall {{not have the time}} that we had before the last war, and we shall not be fighting for our homes thousands of miles away. We shall be fighting at our own back door. That is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> prepare for." [...] In August that year he was transferred to the 4th Light Horse Regiment at Warrnambool, Victoria, as adjutant/quartermaster. Garrett was posted to the staff of Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1936, and departed for England in November the following year to attend the Staff College, Camberley. He was promoted to major in July 1938, and returned to Australia upon the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry {{liked the}} cast's scenes with the sumo suits, but saved {{most of her}} praise for Pam's speech. She {{declared}} that it [...] "was AMAZING. Jenna Fischer blew me away with that speech. It’s what I have been hoping for since the first episode of this season. It didn’t end with Jim swooping in and kissing Pam but there’s still one episode left in the season. So that’s <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ponder over the next week." [...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I {{thought that it was}} a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me just fine. I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs. I thought that it was filled with a great assortment of gags, both character-based and farcical." [...] However, Black was critical of Pam's speech because it felt both [...] "forced" [...] and out of character for Pam to publicly state her feelings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result was}} that the Germans seriously underestimated the {{strength}} of the Soviet defences. The commander of 19 Panzer, General G. Schmidt, wrote that [...] "We did not assume that there was even one fourth Russian strength of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> encounter".|$|R

5000|$|A week later, Yahoo! {{agreed to}} settle with {{affected}} Chinese dissidents, paying them undisclosed compensation. Yang stated, [...] "After {{meeting with the}} families, it was clear <b>to</b> me <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do to make this right for them, for Yahoo, and for the future." [...] That week, Yang established the Yahoo! Human Rights Fund, a fund to provide [...] "humanitarian and legal support" [...] to online dissidents.|$|R
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

Good quality media coverage is important as highlighted by Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese pro-democracy leader, at the 2011 awards ceremony because it is [...] "through the media that the rest of the world gets to hear about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> undergo".|$|E

2500|$|Baptized in {{the church}} {{at the age of}} 12, Sarah Palin was an {{attendee}} until 2002. Speaking at the church in 2008, Palin asked congregants to [...] "Pray for our military {{men and women who are}} striving to do what is right also for this country" [...] and pray [...] "that our national leaders are sending them out on a task that is from God. That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make sure we're praying for: that there is a plan and that plan is God's plan".|$|E
2500|$|Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones {{said of the}} appointment: [...] "Raj isn’t only a {{personal}} friend to me but also to Wales. He’s been a tireless advocate for promoting our country {{as a place to}} invest and do business and travelled with me to India earlier this year to highlight <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> offer to Indian companies. I know his appointment as Honorary Consul to Wales will be of great pride to him and I am sure he will do an excellent job." ...|$|E

The fact that she does adds to the offensiveness of deducing that the mother can do nothing from the {{supposition}} that third parties can do nothing. [...] But it does more than this: it casts a bright light on the supposition that third parties can do nothing.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} with The Capital Times of Madison, {{he stated that}} [...] "My life has not been something to write home about". He justified the bombing, stating that [...] "We did <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do; <b>we</b> did <b>what</b> <b>we</b> felt {{a lot of other}} people should have done", continuing that [...] "I don't care what public opinion is; <b>we</b> did <b>what</b> was right." ...|$|R

[...] "We just don't get any credit", added safety Ray Horton, describing a defense that did not have any Pro Bowl selections. [...] "We come up and do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do. Hey, we've won 12 games! Other higher-ranked defenses are at home right now. So it's not like we're riding the coattails of our offense." ...|$|E
2500|$|We are {{describing}} {{the area of}} a rectangle, with the width times the height, and we are adding the areas together. [...] Each rectangle, {{by virtue of the}} mean value theorem, describes an approximation of the curve section it is drawn over. Also [...] need not be the same for all values of i, or in other words that the width of the rectangles can differ. [...] <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is approximate the curve with n rectangles. [...] Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and n increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get {{closer and closer to the}} actual area of the curve.|$|E
2500|$|The third Casualty@Holby City {{crossover}} was {{aired in}} October 2005, {{two months after}} the interactive special. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. The crossover was broadcast in the same week that the BBC launched a new adaptation of Charles Dickens' Bleak House starring Gillian Anderson and Charles Dance, and Phil and Grant Mitchell returned to the station's soap opera EastEnders. BBC1 controller Peter Fincham explained: [...] "We have got three very different dramas playing this week that emphasise the breadth and depth of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> offer. Changing the scheduling of established favourites and the format for presenting period drama is exactly what I want BBC1 to be doing, challenging our audiences with top quality programming." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1999 New York Times story, [...] "C.E.O. Round Table- Online Pioneers: The Buzz Never Stops", Espuelas {{explained}} his approach: [...] "I {{spent a lot}} of time learning how Winston Churchill ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor—not having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high. Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do. But that was part of the encouragement—to think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't have to get it right all the time. You just have to get it right 51 percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy." ...|$|E

I do not for one moment go to the length of imagining that the present negotiations will go far to shape the future form of Arabia or to either establish our rights or to bind our hands in that country. The situation and its elements are much too nebulous for that. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> arrive at now is to tempt the Arab people into the right path, detach them from the enemy and bring them on to our side. This on our part is at present largely a matter of words, and to succeed we must use persuasive terms and abstain from academic haggling over conditions – whether about Baghdad or elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Viva la Vida" [...] are narrated by a protagonist {{who says he}} [...] "used to rule the world". Martin has {{explained}} the song lyric [...] "I know Saint Peter won't call my name" [...] {{in an interview with}} Q magazine: [...] "It's about... You're not on the list," [...] When asked about the song, bass guitarist Guy Berryman said: [...] "It's a story about a king who's lost his kingdom, and all the album's artwork is based on the idea of revolutionaries and guerrillas. There's this slightly anti-authoritarian viewpoint that's crept into some of the lyrics and it's some of the pay-off between being surrounded by governments on one side, but also we're human beings with emotions and we're all going to die and the stupidity of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put up with every day. Hence the album title." ...|$|E
