5|$|However, {{the region}} was given the name Uttaranchal by the Bharatiya Janata Party led central {{government}} and Uttar Pradesh state government <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> {{a new round of}} state reorganisation in 1998. Chosen for its allegedly less separatist connotations, the name change generated enormous controversy among many activists for a separate state who saw it as a political act. The name Uttarakhand remained popular in the region, even while Uttaranchal was promulgated through official usage.|$|E

5|$|One of the first-produced {{episodes of}} the season, {{it is known}} for {{showcasing}} early designs and different characterizations for {{several members of the}} show's cast. The episode is inspired by the comedy of Laurel and Hardy and features cultural references to films such as Citizen Kane and Freaks as well as the Batman and Twilight Zone television series. In November 1996, The BBC chose it as the first episode to be aired, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> showing the series, later being beat in the ratings by Sabrina.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> to fill stadium sized venues and bigger, {{they ran into}} {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what {{proportion}} of the corps commanders had risen from the ranks, but {{it is likely to}} have been small as most rankers would be nearing retirement age {{by the time they were}} given command of a regiment and would be promoted no further. In contrast, directly commissioned protectores and tribuni dominated the higher echelons, as they were usually young men <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>started.</b> For such men, promotion to corps command could be swift e.g. the future emperor Theodosius I was a dux at age 28. It was also possible for rungs on the rank-ladder to be skipped. Commanders of scholae, who enjoyed direct access to the emperor, often reached the highest rank of magister militum: e.g. the barbarian-born officer Agilo was promoted direct to magister militum from tribunus of a schola in 360, skipping the dux stage.|$|E

5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 {{following}} the band's Stadium Arcadium tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{went on a}} hiatus, with Kiedis citing exhaustion as the main reason. The band's hiatus lasted until October 2009 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> to write and rehearse for their tenth album however absent from these rehearsals was Fruciante although present was the band's touring guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer leading many to speculate Frusciante had again left the band. Speculation proved to be true with Frusciante already having quit the band {{for a second time}} on July 29, 2009 however it wasn't until December 2009 in a post on his official website that he made his departure from the band official to the public. He stated that he left Red Hot Chili Peppers during the hiatus to focus on a solo career. Klinghoffer, who acted as a sideman during 2007 dates on the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and on John Frusciante's solo projects, joined the band on October 12, 2009; however, his membership was not announced until February 8, 2010. With Klinghoffer, the band saw this as a new beginning and in August 2011 they released their tenth-studio album, I'm with You. During this tour, the band added backing musicians, Mauro Refosco and Chris Warren (also Smith's drum technician) to their touring lineup.|$|E
