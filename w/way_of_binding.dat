30|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is {{the method}} for the {{treatment}} of cancer, where the photosensitizer excitation by the light leads to the generation of singlet oxygen that is toxic for the tumor tissue [1]. But despite of several advantages, the drawback of this method is the very small depth of the light penetration into the tissue [2]. Thus, the idea of X-ray-inducible PDT based on X-ray-excited sensitizers composed of scintillating and photosensitizing parts with the electronic excitation energy transfer (EEET) from the first to the last one seems attractive [3]. Recently, a number of nanosystems based on this concept were described with various materials used as scintillators, different photosensitizer molecules, and several <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>binding</b> them into a system [2, 4 – 9]; X-rays induced singlet oxygen generation [2, 6, 7, 9], cell destruction [4, 5, 7], and tumor destruction in mice [7] were demonstrated.|$|R

30|$|By use of {{computer}} simulation, {{the interactions of}} DNA molecule with HL 1 or HL 2 separately and in combination with C 60 fullerene were studied. The chemical compounds formed the stable complexes with DNA: HL 1 when binding with a great groove and at intercalation into a small groove, while HL 2 only when bound with a small groove. At the combined action of HL 1 or HL 2 with C 60 fullerene, the C 60 [*]+[*]HL 2 structure formed the stable complex with DNA when bound with a small groove and at intercalation into it, while the C 60 [*]+[*]HL 1 structure formed the stable complex with DNA only in one case—when binding with a large groove. In this case, the strong stacking or cation-π interactions can be formed between these chemicals and C 60 fullerene. Thus, the chemical compounds form the stable complexes with DNA both individually and in combination with C 60 fullerene, but {{the differences in the}} types <b>of</b> bonds and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>binding</b> could be the cause of their different cytotoxic effects.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between cellulase enzymes and their substrates is of central importance to several technological and scientific challenges. Here {{we report that}} the binding of cellulose binding modules (CBM) from Trichoderma reesei cellulases Cel 6 A and Cel 7 A show a major difference in how they interact with substrates originating from wood compared to bacterial cellulose. We found that the CBM from TrCel 7 A recognizes the two substrates differently {{and as a consequence}} shows an unexpected <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>binding.</b> We show that the substrate has a large impact on the exchange rate of the studied CBM, and moreover, CBM-TrCel 7 A seems to have an additional mode of binding on wood derived cellulose but not on cellulose originating from bacterial source. This mode is not seen in double CBM (DCBM) constructs comprising both CBM-TrCel 7 A and CBM-TrCel 6 A. The linker length of DCBMs affects the binding properties, and slows down the exchange rates of the proteins and thus, can be used to analyze the differences between the single CBM. These results have impact on the cellulase research and offer new understanding on how these industrially relevant enzymes act. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|In 1995, {{the annual}} meeting of the American Economic Association {{included}} a plenary session about domestic policy issues. One of the panelists was the Nobel laureate MIT economist Robert Solow. In the course of his remarks, Solow said that he did not find school choice appealing. During the question-and-answer period, I asked him why he did not find school vouchers appealing. He replied: “It isn’t for any economic reason; all the economic reasons favor school vouchers. It is because what made me an American is the United States Army and the public school system. ” Admirable in its candor and lucidity, Solow’s reply suggests a solution to a broader conundrum. If government intervention creates an official and common frame of ref-erence, a set of cultural focal points, a sense of togetherness and common experience, then almost any form of government intervention can help to “make us Americans. ” If people see government activism as a singular <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>binding</b> society together, then they may favor any particular government intervention virtually for its own sake—whether it be government intervention in schooling, urban transit, postal services, Social Security, or anything else—because they love the way in which it makes them American.

Intensification of the economic capacities of these companies, {{as well as a number}} of agricultural and other activities, can copper to degradation of water quality of the Neretva River. The particular problem poses the fact that the waters of the River Neretva are retained for longer periods of time at the existing hydro accumulation reservoirs (Jablaničko, Grabovica, Mostar), which facilitates and accelerates the process of eutrophication.

40|$|One {{fundamental}} principle in Swedish contract law is that passive acceptance {{does not constitute}} a <b>binding</b> acceptance <b>of</b> an offer. Still, business owners use the consumers unknowing of this, and form offers saying passivity {{will lead to a}} binding agreement. Business owners are thus trying to “negatively bind” the consumer to agreements. There are rules prohibiting this kind of actions in the Swedish marketing law (MFL). In order to find out what constitutes this forbidden kind of agreement-entering according to the Swedish Market Court, an analysis of seven cases settled between 2002 - 2009 and concerning consumers in these situations, is made. The analysis is made in a comparative manner, identifying the differences and similarities in order to distinguish, if any, common principles that are used by the Market Court to settle these cases. This is of importance since new <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> entering agreements are constantly developed and increasing, especially on the Internet. Consequently, this means that the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> negatively <b>binding</b> consumers to agreements are increasing as well. It is found that there are some common principles in these cases. Initially, the cases are differently evaluated depending on the existence of earlier agreements between parties. If there is an earlier agreement, the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> negatively <b>binding</b> the consumer to an agreement could be acceptable. Where parties did not have an earlier agreement, the cases were without exceptions regarding orders made online.
