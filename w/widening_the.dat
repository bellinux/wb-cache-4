5000|$|In November 1968, {{work began}} to <b>widen</b> <b>the</b> Delaware Turnpike {{from four to}} six lanes to handle {{increasing}} traffic volumes. <b>The</b> <b>widening</b> project was completed in December 1969, one year ahead of schedule. In 1969, a plan was made to <b>widen</b> <b>the</b> turnpike between DE 896 and DE 273 to ten lanes and between DE 273 and DE 141 to 12 lanes in a 3-3-3-3 local-express lane configuration. This was later scaled down to a proposal to <b>widen</b> <b>the</b> road to eight lanes total. <b>The</b> <b>widening</b> of <b>the</b> Delaware Turnpike to eight lanes occurred in the 1980s. From 1971 to 1978, a north-south extension of the Delaware Turnpike running south to Dover was studied. This extension of the turnpike evolved into a [...] "Relief Route" [...] for US 13 and was built as DE 1 between 1987 and 2003.|$|R
5|$|A Final Environmental Document is {{scheduled}} to be released in the middle of 2016. In the meantime, Caltrans studies have begun relating to <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> route to three lanes in each direction, as called for by the 2050 regional plan.|$|E
5|$|After TransNet was renewed in November 2004, {{planning}} {{continued for}} <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> remaining portion of SR76 west of I-15, {{due to the}} frequent accidents that occurred on the eastern portion, although some claimed that the habits of drivers were at fault.

5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary, or pulmonic {{stenosis}} is {{an often}} congenital narrowing of the pulmonary valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants.

5|$|There {{was also}} a {{proposal}} in 2000 to renovate the interchange at Bradley Avenue.

5|$|An inquiry {{was held}} into <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> section from the Archway {{intersection}} to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971. It was {{originally intended to}} widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978, and a second inquiry in 1984, chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings, was also abandoned. The traffic flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a day by 1981, but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 the Reform Act {{was passed}} by Parliament, <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> {{electorate}} across the country. The Isle of Bute's electorate rose to 300 and acquired a permanent Member of Parliament, still controlled by Bute.

In the aftermath of the reforms, Bute secretly sponsored the creation of the conservative newspaper the Glamorgan Monmouth and Brecon Gazette and Merthyr Guardian, to increase support across the county, and underwrote its losses for many years.|$|E

As <b>widening</b> <b>the</b> existing road would have left the council liable for compensation from affected businesses and properties, the provision of bypass routes was recommended instead.

5|$|In October 1961, Nasser {{embarked}} on a major nationalization program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism was the answer to his country's problems and would have prevented Syria's secession. In order to organize and solidify his popular base with Egypt's citizens and counter the army's influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a new constitution.
