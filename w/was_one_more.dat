5|$|The 1907 Tour de France {{incorporated}} 14 stages, which <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> than in 1906. For {{the first}} time, roads in Switzerland were included.

5|$|Pertec {{was eager}} to {{increase}} sales to small businesses through the 26 Altair Computer stores across the United States. The marketing toward hobby/home user was curtailed. The November 1977 issue of the MITS newsletter, Computer Notes, was the last produced by the Albuquerque staff. There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> issue produced by the Pertec staff in Chatsworth, California. The back cover of the leading home computer magazine, Byte, always carried a full page Altair advertisement. This ended with the September 1977 issue. Roberts and Yates stayed on and worked on special projects.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Summer Olympics {{were held}} in Beijing, People's Republic of China, from 8 August to 24 August 2008. Approximately 11,028 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOC) participated. Overall, 302 events in 28 sports were held; 165 events were opened to men, 127 were opened to women and 10 were mixed events. In total there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> event than in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.|$|E

5|$|In the two-man {{bobsleigh}} competition, a tie {{meant that}} two gold medals were awarded, so no silver medal was awarded for that event. A tie for {{second in the}} men's Super G skiing competition meant that a pair of silver medals were given out, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the four-man bobsleigh, a tie for third resulted in the awarding of two bronze medals. Due to these ties, the number of gold medals awarded <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> {{than the number of}} silver or bronze medals. In snowboarding, Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the gold medal in the men's Giant Slalom, but it was briefly stripped by the IOC after he tested positive for marijuana. After the Canadian Olympic Association filed an appeal, however, the IOC's decision was overturned.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Congressional midterm {{elections}} took place {{less than three}} months after Ford assumed office and {{in the wake of the}} Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan. In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.|$|E

25|$|Later in the race, there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> time trial, on the {{penultimate}} day. Also, {{there were}} just three uphill finishes (Courchevel, Ax-3 Domaines and Pla d'Adet), a lower number than in previous years. The finish line of the last stage was, as has been since 1975, on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The Polish–Lithuanian magnates were {{preoccupied with}} the issue of {{recovery}} of their old feudal lands in the east, lost to the Cossacks and Russia. There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> and the most significant, even if belated and in the end botched, attempt to resolve the Cossack conflict in an amicable way, by including Ukraine as a partner in the Commonwealth federation.|$|E
25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> {{match at}} the arena after the {{pay-per-view}} event {{went off the}} air. It was later part of the In Your House 2 video released by Coliseum Video: Bret Hart wrestled Jean-Pierre Lafitte. Lafitte held control {{for most of the}} match, but Hart gained the advantage near the end as Lafitte missed a diving crossbody. Hart capitalized, pinning Lafitte via a roll-up.|$|E

He moved in his job in insurance to Wellington on his return from England and he appeared in the 1949-50 New Zealand domestic season in just one match for Auckland against a non-Test-playing Australian side, and then retired.|$|E
25|$|Currency had not {{yet been}} invented, so Assyrian merchants used gold for {{wholesale}} trade and silver for retail trade during this time. Gold was considered eight times more valuable than silver. But there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> metal, amutum, which was even more valuable than gold. Amutum is thought to be the newly discovered iron and was forty times more valuable than silver. The most important Anatolian export was copper, and the Assyrian merchants sold tin and clothing to Anatolia.|$|E
25|$|In 1258, Thái Tông {{decided to}} remarry Princess Chiêu Thánh {{to the general}} Lê Phụ Trần because he had an {{essential}} role in the victory of Đại Việt over the first Mongol invasion. This event <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> time criticized in historical books for the lack of moral code in marriage during the Early Trần period. Princess Chiêu Thánh died in Cổ Pháp in March 1278 at the age of 61. With the second husband Lê Phụ Trần, she had two children, Marquis Lê Tông and Princess Ứng Thụy Lê Khuê.|$|E

25|$|González {{had a long}} scar {{across his}} left cheek that, {{according}} to his autobiography, {{some members of the}} mass media of the 1940s attributed to his being a Mexican-American pachuco and hence involved in knife fights. This <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> slur that embittered González towards the media in general. The scar was actually the result of a prosaic street accident in 1935 when he was seven years old: pushing a scooter too fast, he ran into a passing car and had his cheek gashed open by its door handle. He spent two weeks in the hospital as a result.|$|E
25|$|Mistwalker {{confirmed}} in February 2005 {{that it was}} working on two RPGs for the then-untitled Xbox 360. Lost Odyssey was officially revealed during a pre-Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The game's content was large enough that it was shipped on four dual-layer DVD discs: this <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> than Mistwalker's other Xbox 360 RPG Blue Dragon, {{and at the time}} made it Microsoft's largest console game. A demo for Japan was released in 2006, featuring a basic build of its battle system. In hindsight, a demo release this early was seen as a mistake as it gave players a negative impression of the battle system. Microsoft initially had high hopes for the title and so had high sales forecasts, but after the Xbox 360 met with poor sales in Japan, they significantly reduced their forecast.|$|E

Ilaiyaraaja joined Dhanraj Master as a student to learn musical {{instruments}} and the master renamed and called him as just [...] "Raaja". In his first movie Annakili, Tamil film producer Panchu Arunachalam added [...] "Ilaiya" [...] (Ilaiya means younger in Tamil language) as prefix in his name Raaja and he named as [...] "Ilaiyaraaja" [...] because in the 1970s there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> music director A.

It {{was picked up}} just off the Cherbourg peninsula as it made {{its way across the}} central Channel to the Isle of Wight. By 17:50, it had reached St. Catherine's Point. Nos. 213 and 602 Squadrons were patrolling nearby at Tangmere, where they were kept {{for the duration of the}} raid. No. 607 Squadron, also from Tangmere, was flying to the airfield over Southampton at [...] and No. 609 Squadron was on its way from Middle Wallop to patrol Portsmouth. At 18:00, by which time the German operation was virtually over, the British dispositions were completed when No. 238 Squadron took off from Middle Wallop to patrol the airfield.|$|E

Actors portraying Orions included Bobbi Sue Luther and WWE wrestler Big Show. Luther subsequently explained that she was [...] "familiar with the show but never really watched it", and thanked her fiancé Robert Hall for explaining her role as an Orion slave girl to her. She researched the role on the internet after she received the script, in particular the portrayal by Susan Oliver in Star Treks original pilot, [...] "The Cage". It took four hours of make-up work for Luther to be ready, and she described the costume as slightly skimpier than she was used to as a lingerie and bikini model. Despite the application of isopropyl alcohol, Luther said that it took days for the remnants of the make-up to be removed.|$|E

There is no point 150 miles from Spokane that is not at least 225 miles from any other city of 10,000 population. We have about us a territory of 60,000 square miles in extent, to every point of which we are nearer than any other city, to every point of which we have better railroad connections and easier grades than any other city... We have eight lines of railroad that radiate out in all directions through it, so that shipments made here in the morning can reach any point within its borders by nightfall. We have a telephone system connecting us with almost every shipping town and shipping station within its borders. Goods may be ordered, shipped and received, in most instances, within one day. Never was a city more intimately knit to its surrounding territory than Spokane, and never <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> free from a legitimate rival in trade..." ...|$|E
