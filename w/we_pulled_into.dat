But {{it was not to}} be. I got to my 'dobe house and managed a cracking fine dinner my cook had ready for me. She was mostly Spiggoty and half Indian, and her name was Paloma.-- Now, Sarah, haven't I told you she was older'n a grandmother, and looked more like a buzzard than a dove? Why, I couldn't bear to eat with her around where I could look at her. But she did make things comfortable, and she was some economical when it came to marketing.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Examiner.com, Melanie described what she claimed was {{the inspiration for the}} song: [...] "I was fasting with a 27-day fast on water. I broke the fast and went back to my life living in New Jersey {{and we were going to}} a flea market around six in the morning. On the way back… and I had just broken the fast, from the flea market, we passed a McDonald's and the aroma hit me, and I had been a vegetarian before the fast. So <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the McDonald's and I got the whole works... the burger, the shake, and the fries… and no sooner after I finished that last bite of my burger… that song was in my head. The aroma brought back memories of roller skating and learning to ride a bike and the vision of my dad holding the back fender of the tire. And me saying to my dad... 'You’re holding, you’re holding, you’re holding, right?' Then I’d look back and he wasn’t holding and I’d fall. So that whole thing came back to me and came out in this song." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kearney began {{focusing}} on music fusing his simple guitar playing with spoken word or rap. He {{started to play}} at coffee shops and soon began to make small amounts of money. At this time, Kearney had met friend and future producer, Robert Marvin. The two began to make music together, but Marvin had plans to move to Nashville, Tennessee. Marvin asked Kearney {{to help with the}} move and he accepted. Kearney says, [...] "I helped him pack up his trailer and we put a mattress {{on the back of his}} truck. We basically drove cross-country and slept in the back. When <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> Nashville we slept in a school parking lot for three days until we finally rented this apartment where the roof was caving in and mice were crawling all over." [...] Kearney decided to stay in Nashville to record a few demos with Marvin and after a few months, Kearney had no plans on returning. [...] "By the end of the summer, we had three or four songs and I realized this is what I wanted to do. It just clicked. So I called home to Oregon and said, 'I'm not coming back' and I never left Nashville." ...|$|E

40|$|As {{young women}} pull ahead {{of young men}} in higher education, the wage gap narrows, and young men {{continue}} to be arrested and incarcerated at higher rates than young women, {{there has been much}} discussion at the policy level and in the media regarding the need to concentrate resources on men and boys. President Barack Obama’s “My Brother’s Keeper 2 ̆ 2 and “Responsible Fatherhood” initiatives typify this shift. As legal aid lawyers who represent youth, many of whom {{have been involved in the}} juvenile and criminal legal systems, <b>we</b> are <b>pulled</b> <b>into</b> the debate and asked to answer with increasing frequency: “What about the boys?” While young men of color certainly face discrimination and hardships that are worthy of attention, any conversation about the impact of mass incarceration on communities of color that ignores the voices and experiences of young women of color is inherently misguided...|$|R

[...] Chick Lit Central, a top chick-lit blog, states, [...] "Dog Training the American Male made me laugh...hard.

Something had hit him while he was swimming and he thought he would die. But life stirred in him. He had a message for you. For a long time he went on crawling under the big trees on his hands and knees, for there is no rest for a messenger till the message is delivered. At last he found himself on the left bank of the creek. And still he felt life stir in him. So he started to swim across, for if you were in this world you were on the other side. While he swam he felt his strength abandoning him. He managed to scramble on to a drifting log and lay on it like one who is dead, till <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> him <b>into</b> one of our boats." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the longer}} {{introduction}} of Radical History Review’s two thematic issues “Queering Archives,” we frame the archive as an evasive and dynamic space animated by the tensions of knowledge production, absence, and presence. As Jeffrey Weeks argued in RHR in 1979, “The evolution of sexual meanings and identities {{that we have}} traced over the past hundred years or so {{are by no means}} complete. ” 1 Fragments of information float unfixed — historically unraveled — and we form archives when <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> the fragments <b>into</b> the orbit of efforts to know. Yet the business of knowing is unsteady, as scholars of sexuality and gender have amply demonstrated. Between the fraught and necessary practices of historicization, anachronism, interpretation, bias, and partial readings that propel historical scholarship, archival fragments fall {{in and out of the}} frame of an easily perceptible knowledge. Queer historical knowledge thus is evasive — like a coin dropped in the ocean and for which one grasps, reaching it only for it to slip away again, rolling deeper into the beyond. To say that the knowledge work of animating queer historical fragments is marked by such slipperiness is to underline how the archive negotiates the decomposition and recomposition of knowledge’s materials. <b>We</b> <b>pull</b> and push at the fading paper, the fraying fabric, the photographs bleaching into their backgrounds, and manipulate technologies on their way to obsolescence, all as part of some suturing effort of one kind or another...|$|R

Don't you think if <b>we</b> <b>pulled</b> out now that would open it up for Iran and Syria, God knows who—Russia—how do <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> out now? And isn't it our responsibility to get these people up on their feet? I mean, do you leave a newborn baby to take care of himself? How do <b>we</b> <b>pull</b> out now?
