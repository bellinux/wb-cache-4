5|$|One of history's great Chiefs of Staff {{and a key}} {{member of}} the Imperial Staff, Schmitt was the most {{experienced}} Austrian leader, called out of retirement for this specific task of organizing the Austro-Russian retreat. He had wide experience as a leader: From the summer of 1796 {{until his retirement in}} 1800, he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, of the Lower Rhine, the Rhine, and the Army of Germany, and a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. Consequently, he had organized a variety of maneuvers and battle plans under different terrain. The military historian Digby Smith hypothesizes that Schmitt, an experienced officer and sound tactician, would have been more effective at the Battle of Austerlitz, at least more effective than his replacement, Franz von Weyrother, as Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. After Schmitt's death, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, developed the general battle plan of the Allied action at Austerlitz. In the long run, it was unlikely that Schmitt's plan would have changed the overall outcome—Austerlitz was arguably one of Napoleon's finest battles—but his battle plan <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> have been an improvement over the one the Allies used.|$|E

25|$|King {{played two}} roles. On the one hand, he told English Canadians that Canada <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> enter war if Britain did. On the other hand, {{he and his}} Quebec {{lieutenant}} Ernest Lapointe told French Canadians that Canada would only go to war if {{it was in the}} country's best interests. With the dual messages, King slowly led Canada toward war without causing strife between Canada's two main linguistic communities. As his final step in asserting Canada's autonomy, King ensured that the Canadian Parliament made its own declaration of war one week after Britain.|$|E

25|$|The Sultanate of Rum was {{in chaos}} and {{decentralized}} {{ever since the}} Mongol invasions in ca. 1240. As a result, {{the greatest threat to}} Byzantium was not the Muslims but their Christian counterparts in the West — Michael VIII knew that the Venetians and the Franks <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> launch another attempt to establish Latin rule in Constantinople. The situation became worse when Charles of Anjou, brother of the King of France, conquered Sicily from the Hohenstaufens in 1266. In 1267, Pope Clement IV arranged a pact, whereby Charles would receive land in the East in return for assisting a new military expedition to Constantinople. A delay on Charles' end meant that Michael VIII was given enough time to negotiate a union between the Church of Rome and that of Constantinople in 1274, thus removing Papal support for an invasion of Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|If the Republic {{had been}} a Monarchy, or if the office of stadtholder had already been {{hereditary}} (as it was to become after the Orangist amendments of 1747) the posthumous child <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> have been acclaimed stadtholder automatically, and a Regency would have been put into place, as happened in 1751, when three-year-old William V succeeded his deceased father in office in all seven provinces. As a matter of fact, this was proposed by the Orangist faction in the Republic, and especially by Willem Frederik, who proposed himself {{in the role of}} Lieutenant-Stadtholder in the five provinces in which he was not already stadtholder in his own right, until baby William would come of age. But this proposal elicited little enthusiasm from the Holland regents, who still vividly remembered his role in the recent coup.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly, the Packers were {{in talks}} with Oakland Raiders wide {{receiver}} Randy Moss {{at the behest of}} Brett Favre. If the Packers had made the move to acquire the 30-year-old wide receiver, the trade <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> have been a controversial one, as Moss has a long and storied history with the Green Bay franchise. While Moss's salary was high, Green Bay, at the time, reportedly had $24 million of cap space, and could have absorbed his contract easily. These rumors were put to an end on April 29, 2007, when Oakland dealt Moss to New England for a 4th round draft pick. In the days following the NFL draft, Favre was upset concerning Green Bay's inability to acquire Moss. Favre was reportedly so upset that his agent requested that the Packers trade him. Coach Mike McCarthy was able to calm Favre down over the phone, and Favre eventually admitted that while he wanted to win, {{he did not want to}} be traded in order to do so.|$|E

25|$|When he returned, however, Cook - now bowling at {{a slower}} pace than in 1911 - {{immediately}} became, for the first time, indispensable to Lancashire. Although he still failed to achieve much against strong counties, he did a notable performance against Gloucestershire with nine for 49, and was second in the Lancashire bowling averages. 1920, however, saw Cook jump right {{to the top of the}} tree with 156 first-class wickets for less than fifteen runs each, and some notable performances in tandem with Harry Dean and Cecil Parkin, notably against Kent at Old Trafford in July. Although he did not have the honour of representing the Players or touring Australia, Cook <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> have been chosen as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden but for the special portrait of Pelham Warner to commemorate Middlesex's Championship win. In the dry summer of 1921, Cook showed himself to be one of the most tireless and consistent workhorses in county cricket, even if no selector thought he had enough sting to be a Test match bowler. He took 151 wickets without one haul of seven in an innings, and in 1922 he maintained his accuracy and spin notably when taking seven for 23 on a crumbling pitch.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{deactivation}} enhanced strategy, {{a relatively}} small instantaneous kinetic chain length limits the number of vinyl groups that {{can be added to}} a propagating chain end during each activation/deactivation cycles and thus keeps the polymer chains growing in a limited space. In this way, unlike what happens in free radical polymerization (FRP), the formation of huge polymer chains and large-scale combinations at early reaction stages is avoided. Therefore, a small instantaneous kinetic chain length is the prerequisite for further manipulation of intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular crosslinking. Based on the small instantaneous kinetic chain length, regulation of different chain dimensions and concentrations would lead to distinct reaction types. A low ratio of initiator to monomer would result in the formation of longer chains but of a lower chain concentration, This scenario <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> increases the chances of intramolecular cyclization due to the high local/spatial vinyl concentration within the growth boundary. Although the opportunity for intermolecular reactions can increase as the polymer chains grow, the likelihood of this occurring at the early stage of reactions is minimal due to the low chain concentration, which is why single chain cyclized/knotted polymers can form. However, in contrast, a high initiator concentration not only diminishes the chain dimension during the linear-growth phase thus suppressing the intramolecular cyclization, but it also increases the chain concentration within the system so that pendent vinyl groups in one chain are more likely to fall into the growth boundary of another chain. Once the monomers are converted to short chains, the intermolecular combination increases and allows the formation of hyperbranched structures with a high density of branching and vinyl functional groups.|$|E

500|$|An analogy has {{frequently}} been drawn between the European Crusades of the Middle Ages {{and the modern}} day Zionist movement. This view, which has been espoused by Arab media and political leaders, has also been discussed in Israeli academia. Prawer was often asked to comment on this analogy, and claimed that a major difference was that the Jews settled the land and worked it, whereas the Crusaders lorded over a conquered land worked by the natives. [...] Ronnie Ellenblum, a lecturer at Hebrew University, identifies a subliminal objective in Prawer's work to draw {{a distinction between the}} two: [...] "He's always writing about the Crusaders' manpower shortage and about their not settling the land...He claims that their presence here was principally urban, consisting of nobility and merchants. This is why they lost in the end. The implications are obvious: If we bring enough immigrants, and if we settle the land, we are bound to succeed." [...] (Ellenblum himself has shown that Crusader settlement in the Holy Land was much more widespread than previously thought and has found evidence of hundreds of Crusader farms.) But he also notes that [...] "if Joshua Prawer were alive today he <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> deny any linkage between his Zionist political beliefs and the model of segregation that he developed." ...|$|E

The Draka employ the policy of [...] "No peace beyond Luna," [...] leading to frequent skirmishes in the inner solar system. It is not unknown, although extremely rare, for people from the Domination to defect to the Alliance.

2500|$|Galton was a keen observer. In 1906, {{visiting a}} {{livestock}} fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers {{were invited to}} guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that [...] "the middlemost estimate expresses the vox populi, every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high {{by a majority of}} the voters", and reported this value (the median, in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy. [...] Recent archival research has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in Nature: the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error. [...] James Surowiecki uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> have been more strongly expressed.|$|E
