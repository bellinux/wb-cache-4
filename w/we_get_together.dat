500|$|Record {{producer}} Greg Fidelman {{said that}} [...] "the {{fact that the}} songs were still new and fresh to them, and they hadn't been playing them for six months in rehearsal, kept the vibe and excitement in the studio very high." [...] Vocalist Tom Araya said that there [...] "are two principal music writers in this band, so you're {{going to get a}} combination of speed and heaviness," [...] and later said that the [...] "writing is really aggressive and fast, while Jeff likes things to be fast, but with melodies and grooves. In making this album, we seemed to share the same vision from song ideas to titles; when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>together</b> as Slayer, it just happens, nothing is contrived, it's not thought out, we just do it, and we did that with this new album." [...] Lombardo said that Hanneman's writing and performance had [...] "gone back to this great punk energy, especially with 'Psychopathy Red'." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{detailed}} review, HitFix's Melina Newman denounced its lyrical content: [...] "Even though they never are so blatant {{about it that}} booty call subtext can't go right over their tween audience's head, there's no mistaking lines like “if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>together,</b> don’t let the pictures ever leave your phone” for anyone who's 13 or up. The lyrics are unwieldy and uncouth. That's what happens when you're not a boy, but not yet a man: One Direction can't go straight from the G-rated sweetness of “What Makes You Beautiful” to something akin to Enrique Iglesias's [...] "Tonight, I’m F****** You," [...] so instead they’re stuck with this in between clumsiness that the not-so-little girls will understand." [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly characterised it as [...] "not-so-innocent" [...] and a [...] "party jam". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that its sexual suggestive lyricism [...] "arrives too soon after the more accomplished puppy-love odes of previous hits [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] to further the conversation." ...|$|E
500|$|Rouass was {{acquainted with}} the series, having viewed the first two series and [...] "dipped {{in and out of}} it." [...] She also stated that Maya is only a {{background}} character throughout the series, meaning her role is limited, and does not play a spy or becoming [...] "part of this mafia or that mafia." [...] Due to her limited appearance, the actress was available to perform other projects, including The Sarah Jane Adventures and Conan the Barbarian, as well as spending the free time with her daughter. Rouass does not participate in any stunt work, but does appear in [...] "a lot of passionate scenes." [...] Having gotten used to filming sex scenes in Footballers' Wives, Rouass noticed that while humour was involved in Footballers' Wives, Spooks was more passionate and very choreographed. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Rouass recalled one of the scenes; [...] "there's one scene where <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>together</b> in the kitchen and the director was like, 'Come on, let's be honest, you haven't seen each other for years, you're not going to get all romantic, you're going to shag her on the table.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|After Get Outs success, Peele {{announced}} that he had plans to make four more social thrillers in the next decade. In an interview with Business Insider he said, [...] "The best and scariest monsters in the world are human beings and what we are capable of especially when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>together.</b> I've been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies {{is going to be about}} a different one of these social demons." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2007 Costello's {{playing on}} Nappy Brown's {{comeback}} album, Long Time Coming, was {{singled out for}} praise by the critics. The following year Costello released {{what was to be}} his last album, <b>We</b> Can <b>Get</b> <b>Together,</b> acclaimed by many as his best work. His guitar playing on this record was described variously as [...] "incendiary", [...] "searing", and [...] "blistering red hot". It earned Costello two Blues Music Award nominations for Best Contemporary Album and Best Contemporary Male Artist. Hal Horowitz of the Allmusic guide summed up <b>We</b> Can <b>Get</b> <b>Together</b> with the following: ...|$|R

60|$|But I {{have said}} {{enough to show}} {{that the time has come}} when novelists, if they do not wish to be left behind in the race, must adapt {{themselves}} to modern conditions. One does not wish to threaten, but, as I say, we astigmatics are in a large minority and can, if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>together,</b> make our presence felt. Roused by this article to a sense of the injustice of their treatment, the great army of glass-wearing citizens could very easily make novelists see reason. A boycott of non-spectacled heroes would soon achieve the necessary reform. Perhaps there will be no need to let matters go as far as that. I hope not. But, if this warning should be neglected, if we have any more of these novels about men with keen gray eyes or snapping black eyes or cheerful blue eyes--any sort of eyes, in fact, lacking some muscular affliction, we shall know what to do.|$|E
6000|$|The {{manufacturer}} did not reply, and the professor, after {{a preliminary}} hemming, held his peace. It was the banker {{who took the}} word: [...] "Well, so far as business is concerned, they were right. It is no use to pretend {{that there is any}} relation between business and the higher education. There is no business man who will pretend that there is not often an actual incompatibility if he is honest. I know that when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>together</b> at a commercial or financial dinner we talk as if great merchants and great financiers were beneficent geniuses, who evoked the prosperity of mankind by their schemes from the conditions that would otherwise have remained barren. Well, very likely they are, but we must all confess that they do not know it at the time. What they are consciously looking out for then is the main chance. If general prosperity follows, all well and good; they are willing to be given the credit for it. But, as I said, with business as business, the 'education of a gentleman' has nothing to do. That education is always putting the old Ciceronian question: whether the fellow arriving at a starving city with a cargo of grain is bound to tell the people before he squeezes them that there are half a dozen other fellows with grain just below the horizon. As a gentleman he would have to tell them, because he could not take advantage of their necessities; but, as a business man, he would think it bad business to tell them, or no business at all. The principle goes all through; I say, business is business; and I am not going to pretend that business will ever be anything else. In our business battles we don't take off our hats to the other side and say, 'Gentlemen of the French Guard, have the goodness to fire.' That may be war, but it is not business. We seize all the advantages we can; very few of us would actually deceive; but if a fellow believes a thing, and we know he is wrong, we do not usually take the trouble to set him right, {{if we are going to}} lose anything by undeceiving him. That would not be business. I suppose you think that is dreadful?" [...] He turned smilingly to the minister.|$|E

The album featured 117 Southern Arizona musicians, plus various local Tucson studios, engineers, and producers, and was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon.com and in a double CD with national distribution on March 14, 2011 through unknown indie label CoSeismic Records.
