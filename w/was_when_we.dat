500|$|The Who {{had planned}} to perform Tommy live since {{starting}} the project. The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the Hanwell Community Centre in Ealing including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April. The running order was changed, and four songs ("Cousin Kevin", [...] "Underture", [...] "Sensation" [...] and [...] "Welcome") were dropped entirely. Townshend later said the group [...] "did the whole thing {{from start to finish}} and that <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first realized we had something cohesive and playable." [...] Daltrey's voice had improved substantially since the group's early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.|$|E
500|$|The Andy Griffith Show [...] is an American {{situation}} comedy which aired on CBS from October 3, 1960, to September 6, 1971, {{with a total}} of 249 half-hour episodes spanning over 8 seasons, first in black and white and then in color, which partially originated from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show. It originally starred Andy Griffith in the role of Andy Taylor, the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. Other major characters include Andy's inept but well-meaning deputy, who is also his cousin, Barney Fife (Don Knotts); Andy's spinster aunt and housekeeper, [...] "Aunt" [...] Bee Taylor (Frances Bavier), and Andy's precocious young son, Opie (Ron Howard). Eccentric townspeople and temperamental girlfriends complete the cast. Regarding the tone of the show, Griffith said that despite a contemporary setting, the show evoked nostalgia, stating in a Today Show interview: [...] "Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It <b>was,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were doing it, of a time gone by." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} with Melody Maker, Nirvana's Kurt Cobain described his {{great admiration for}} Pod: [...] "The way they structure [...] totally unique, very atmospheric"; he also listed it in his published diary {{as one of his}} three favorite albums of all time. In a 2007 chat forum interview, Albini revealed that he considered the album to be among the best he had engineered; a 2015 article in Stereogum likewise ranked it as the eighth best Albini-recorded album ever. Donelly has characterized it as the [...] "truest" [...] of all the albums she has worked on, commenting that [...] "It really feels exactly the way it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were doing it." [...] Wiggs has similarly described her [...] "abiding affection" [...] for Pod, noting that all of the people involved in making it were particularly dedicated and attentive to doing quality work. In 2003, Pitchfork ranked the album at number 81 on their list of the Top 100 Albums of the 1990s.

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of [...] "The Broken Man", series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss spoke {{about some of the}} thought process behind the motivations of the characters that were featured prominently in the episode. David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} event, Phelps' compatriot Ian Crocker {{was seen as}} the swimmer with the best chance of beating Phelps. Crocker beat Phelps' 100 metre {{butterfly}} world record in 2003, and had since lowered it twice: once at the 2004 United States Olympic trials, and then at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal. Before the Olympics, Crocker and Phelps held the seventeen fastest times ever in the event. In 2004, Crocker was the favorite in the men's 100 metre butterfly, but lost to Phelps by four hundredths of a second. This victory gave Phelps the right to swim in the final of the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, however he gave up the spot to Crocker, and took his turn in the semifinals. Although holding the world record, Crocker had lost the last four times that he was up against Phelps in the 100 metre butterfly, including the 2008 United States Olympic Trials. Some thought that Crocker was not in the same shape that he <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> broke the world record, including Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) analyst Byron MacDonald who said that [...] "If he's (Crocker) going to beat Phelps in Beijing, Crocker has to get close to his world record time of 50.40. He just hasn't shown it [...] can do it this year".|$|E

500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month hiatus at the {{beginning}} of 2006, From Autumn to Ashes returned and played the length of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, adding Rob Lauritsen in place of Cox. In September 2006, the band rented practice space and began writing material for what would become Holding a Wolf by the Ears. Brian McTernan was chosen as producer because he had previously worked with Mark and Newton on their side project Biology's album, and the members opted for this release to have a less refined feel than the last albums. As From Autumn to Ashes prepared to begin studio recording for the album, Mark noted that Perri [...] "never came out to any of the practices and he had no involvement. But that was also the way it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> wrote Abandon Your Friends." [...] Perri had then declared that he would no longer {{be a part of the}} band. [...] As Mark explains, [...] "I thought there was a more considerate way he could have gone about leaving the band", but it was ultimately [...] "cool of him to recognize that he just didn't have the passion for the band anymore." [...] Deciding to move on without Perri as a member, Mark then became lead vocalist, providing both clean and screaming vocals in addition to his already recorded drums. [...] Mark, as the band's lyricist explained that he [...] "work very hard and writing and revising very personal lyrics" [...] and found that a part of him did not want to hand over the lyrics to another to sing, however, with Perri's departure and when Mark began recording vocal tracks, [...] "It immediately seemed like that’s the way things had been all along". Mark stated the bulk of the album's lyrics had been [...] "just about living" [...] and [...] "the idea that extremes are dangerous." [...] Recorded in about a month's time, Holding a Wolf by the Ears was named for the quotation by Thomas Jefferson, [...] "But as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other." [...] Reviewer Drew Beringer of Absolute Punk had praised the change in the band's line up, stating that [...] "Mark is three times the front man Perri was", and gave [...] "passion that had been severely lacking while Perri was in the band." ...|$|E

There's as much trouble now as there <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were over there. I think the slogan 'A war to end war.' is all wrong." [...] He fully endorsed American preparedness, but showed sympathy for isolationism by saying that he would fight only if war came to America.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway.

2500|$|In {{the early}} days, {{communal}} meetings {{were limited to}} practical matters, but in the 1920s and 1930s, they became more informal. Instead of meeting in the dining room, the group would sit around a campfire. Rather than reading minutes, the session would begin with a group dance. Remembering her youth on a kibbutz {{on the shores of}} the Kinneret, one woman said: [...] "Oh, how beautiful it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all took part in the discussions, [...] nights of searching for one another—that is what I call those hallowed nights. During the moments of silence, {{it seemed to me that}} from each heart a spark would burst forth, and the sparks would unite in one great flame penetrating the heavens.... At the center of our camp a fire burns, and under the weight of the hora the earth groans a rhythmic groan, accompanied by wild songs".|$|E

It was released as part of The Sound of Drums which is a double album that includes a compilation disc, The Greatest Hits, and the studio recording, Night of the Living Drums. Ash described The Sound of Drums conception, [...] "he catalyst <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> realised we were coming up to the band's 10-year anniversary.

2500|$|In 2001, Bob Costas {{claimed that}} despite still loving the game, he now felt a certain {{alienation}} from the institution. By {{the time that}} NBC lost Major League Baseball {{for the second time}} in twelve years, the sport endured a strike, realignment, the introduction of the wild card round, and NBC's complete loss of the regular season Game of the Week. Costas would add that since NBC only did a few games each year and he lacked the forum that he would eventually have (on HBO's On the Record with Bob Costas, Inside the NFL and Costas Now as well as Costas on the Radio) to express his views, he to some extent, started editorializing in games. When asked about whether or not the fact that NBC no longer had the baseball rights was disappointing, Bob Costas said [...] "I'm a little disappointed to lose baseball, but that's the way the business is. And it's not nearly as disappointing as it <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> lost it at the end of the '80s. Because then it was like baseball was the birthright for NBC. ... (Baseball is) not going to affect any decision that I have in the future. It's nowhere near as devastating as a decade ago. Different circumstances, different time. I miss it a little bit but not a lot. I am very philosophical about this stuff. I have had wonderful opportunities in my career and no one wants to hear me complain about anything." [...] In 2009, Costas would become a contributor and occasional play-by-play announcer for MLB Network.|$|E
