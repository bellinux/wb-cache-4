40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} to find the maximum power {{transfer}} conditions <b>in</b> <b>bimorph</b> piezoelectric-based harvesters is proposed. Explicitly, we derive a closed form expression that relates the load resistance to the mechanical parameters describing the bimorph based on the electromechanical, single degree of freedom, analogy. Further, by {{taking into account the}} intrinsic capacitance of the piezoelectric harvester, a more descriptive expression of the resonant frequency <b>in</b> piezoelectric <b>bimorphs</b> was derived. <b>In</b> interest of impartiality, we apply the proposed philosophy on previously published experimental results and compare it with other reported hypotheses. It was found that the proposed method was able to predict the actual optimum load resistance more accurately than other methods reported in the literature. © 2012 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{experimentally}} show that polyvinylidene fluoride biaxially oriented <b>in</b> <b>bimorph</b> configuration is a suitable flexural traveling wave device. Piezoelectric ceramic is promising, however the lack biocompatibility is the main drawback for biomedical micro-electromechanical system. A prototype of 20 mm diameter was designed, constructed, and tested via an optical method. A first investigation was performed on two standing waves which were excited to generate the traveling wave. The findings of amplitude and phase have revealed a B 31 vibration mode at 7. 2 kHz and a maximum amplitude of roughly 40 nm. The flexural traveling wave was confirmed experimentally...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} method of {{increasing}} output power of multilayer piezoelectric energy harvesters using Single Supply Pre-biasing (SSPB). In SSPB, {{it is important that}} the pre-biasing voltage be applied at the right moment. Multilayer piezoelectric energy harvesters are well suited SSPB as there is no phase lag between piezoelectric charge displacement on each layer and one layer can therefore be used for switch timing control. Compared to previously reported SSPB circuits, the power consumption of the circuit has been significantly reduced. Experimentally, the output power of a bimorph single-layer energy harvester using SSPB has been increased by a factor of three compared to that using a bridge rectifier. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing SSPB <b>in</b> <b>bimorph</b> double-layer energy harvesters has also been investigated...|$|R
