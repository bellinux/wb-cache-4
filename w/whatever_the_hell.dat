The band has {{explained}} that the reason the booklets do not feature this is because Davis believes fans should not rely on printed lyrics because it limits the experience in listening to the music.

Louis Virtel from The Backlot ranked the video at number 22 on a list for [...] "Madonna's 55 Best Videos", and called it [...] "tongue-in-cheek, pleather-heavy". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "It's rare that Madonna gets a chance to be both harsh and hilarious in a music video", and in this one, [...] "Madonna basically does <b>whatever</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> she wants. Brandish a chihuahua? Mock and celebrate kinkiness? Sneer at the camera like a bored third-grader? She does it all, and even in black cornrows, she's a vision of coolness and sexual superiority".

[...] Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen commented that the album contains [...] "turbulent ballads, powered by booming drums and vocal chorales rising like distant thunder, full of Welch's banshee wails.

[...] The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick viewed Ceremonials as [...] "a giant, fluid, emotionally resonant album" [...] and stated, [...] "Contrary to the name she has given her band, the Machine feel organic and human, providing an epic, full-blooded soundtrack to Welch's voodoo, in which rhythm, melody and chanting are employed to drive out neuroses and insecurities, characterised as ghosts and devils." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin described Welch as [...] "a bloodied, bloodying songbird in a gilded cage of immaculately crafted, slow-burn, chest-beating empowerment anthems, gripping steel bars that her elegantly volcanic voice could shred at any moment", adding, [...] "She's {{so much better than}} her material that her material is rendered immaterial." ...|$|E

Fox has described Nancy as [...] "a bit of a moral compass for the show. She knows what's right and she's often the voice of that. I think that's a really good role for her, and it's quite an important one. I think it's quite good to have a strong, intelligent woman in the show". She added that Nancy [...] "has a very short fuse and loses her temper quickly".|$|E
