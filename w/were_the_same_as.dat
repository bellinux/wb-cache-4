5|$|Along {{with the}} 2/19th and 2/20th Battalions, it was {{assigned}} to the 22nd Brigade, which formed part of the 8th Division. The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> those of the 18th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were purple over green, in a diamond shape, although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval shape designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is a heavy}} smoker, at {{one point}} smoking 70 {{cigarettes}} a day. Bond has his cigarettes custom-made by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal; the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter. Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Manson was {{replaced}} as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, {{the son of}} Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 tender locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North tender locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the Class S tender locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.|$|E

Before leaving, Steiner sets Sheila's apartment on fire with her inside (unaware that she survives) and goes to hide at Blanchard's house. When Blanchard returns home, he is killed by Steiner. Meanwhile, Davis has examined Latham's body and realizes that the electric marks left on Latham <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the criminals. Steiner shows up at Hill's house, where he finds her and Mitchell. Steiner demands that they tell him where he can find more electricity, since after the projection he needs energy to survive. Hill and Mitchell try to convince {{him to return to}} the laboratory so they can try reversing the projection, but Steiner rebuffs them and leaves toward a power plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{blue and}} red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several {{competing}} theories have been put forth for the {{blue and red}} design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it {{was the idea of}} his father as the colours <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used many times.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's next {{operation}} {{was scheduled for}} early September 1944. Codenamed Comet, the plan called for the 1st Airborne Division's three brigades to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave and finally the River Rhine at Arnhem. The objective of the 4th Parachute Brigade would be the bridge at Grave. Planning for Comet was well advanced when on the 10September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation, Market Garden, was proposed whose objectives <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> those of Comet but would this time {{be carried out by}} three divisions of the 1st Allied Airborne Army.|$|E

50|$|In brief, XLA is {{described}} in two steps: (1) give the 16 binary connectives the right geometry, the right shape value anatomy; and (2) add the transformational physiology, namely, apply the algebra of simple symmetry groups to the 16 iconic letter shape symbols. Change comes with a whisper. This whisper presents a triple isomorphism. <b>The</b> mental operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> symmetry operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> logical operations. Said the other way around, <b>the</b> logical operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> symmetry operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mental operations.

5|$|The initial Tour de France of 1903 {{had been}} a large success, and it was quickly decided to {{organize}} it again in 1904. The route was identical, with the same six stages. The rules <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in 1903, with one exception: cyclists could not enter in just one stage, but had to join for the entire race. The favourites for the victory were Garin, Pothier and Aucouturier, who had performed well in the 1903 Tour de France. Among the competitors was Henri Paret who, at 50 years old, still holds the record of oldest Tour de France cyclist.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem had}} already been solved by Pontecorvo in 1968. In 1959, a {{powerful}} accelerator (that was never built) was being designed, and he began considering experiments that could be performed with it. He contemplated a project investigating muons. Julian Schwinger had hypothesised that particles experience the weak interaction through exchanging W bosons. The W boson would not be discovered until 1983, but a problem immediately surfaced. Gerald Feinberg pointed out that this implied that some interactions {{that had never been}} observed should occur, but conceded that this was only true if the neutrinos associated with electrons <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> those associated with muons.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of equites cohortales (the cavalry arm of cohortes equitatae), as expounded by G.L. Cheesman, {{was that}} they were just a mounted infantry with poor-quality horses. They would use their mounts simply to reach the battlefield and then would dismount to fight. This view is today discredited. Although it is clear that equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence their lower pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry {{in the same way as}} the alares and often alongside them. Their armour and weapons <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> for the alares.|$|E

Rules were also different from today's; 3 points, not 5, were awarded for tries and 4, not 3, were given for a drop goal. Also, 4 points were awarded for a goal from mark, which would be reduced to 3 points in 1905 and eliminated completely in 1977.

The Secretary of State did pass such an instrument, the Public Interest Disclosure (Compensation) Regulations 1999, but Section 8 has now been repealed under Section 44 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. Under Section 10, the Act applies to crown servants, excepting under Section 11, those who are employees of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. The Act does exclude, in Sections 12 and 13, serving police officers and those employed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often {{when compared to the}} modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions, the 2/5th formed the 17th Brigade, and was {{assigned}} to the 6th Division, the first infantry division formed as part of the 2nd AIF. The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> those of the 5th Battalion. These colours were black over red, in a horizontal rectangular shape, although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion consisted of four rifle companies, from 'A' to 'D', each consisting of three platoons. These companies were supported by a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company with six specialist platoons: signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortars. The battalion also had a regimental aid post attached. The battalion's personnel assembled between November 1939 and April 1940, undertaking basic training in Australia before embarking for the Middle East on 14 April 1940 aboard the transport HMT Ettrick from Port Melbourne.|$|E
