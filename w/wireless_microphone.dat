5|$|This was Bowie's {{first tour}} where <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> {{technology}} was available, allowing Bowie considerable freedom {{to move around}} the stage during a concert. This allowed him {{to interact with the}} dancers and musicians much more freely, and as such the set included 3-story high mobile scaffolding, onto which Bowie and his dancers would occasionally climb during the show.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{primarily}} filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment {{was needed for}} some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform. An off-camera <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was done by a single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.|$|E
5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Shure {{introduced}} {{their first}} <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> system for performers, and in 1959, they introduced the Unidyne III Microphone, {{which was the}} predecessor to the SM57, which would be introduced, along with the SM58, six years later. Shure also produced portable equipment for broadcast field recording like Vocal Master, the M67 Portable Mixer, and the FP31 Portable Mixer. In 1990, Shure entered the <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> market with the L-Series.|$|E
25|$|Even before Shure re-entered the <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> market though, concert {{engineers}} commonly specified Shure microphone capsules for the <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> systems {{they were}} using. Once Shure introduced its own UHF <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> system, which featured wireless versions of several popular Shure microphones, {{they no longer}} made capsules available for other manufacturers' systems. This practice encouraged sales of Shure wireless systems and gained Shure market share in the category. Shure's UHF system featured software control {{and the ability to}} operate as many as 78 systems simultaneously. On the ULX series (introduced in 2002), they featured the ability to scan for clear wireless channels, sound quality rivaling wired models, a less expensive package, and the ability to operate 40 systems simultaneously. The ULX system was awarded a TEC Award in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Shure {{introduced}} the Vagabond 88 <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> system. Operating within a copper wire circle either {{suspended from the}} ceiling or laid on the floor, the system could transmit within an area of approximately 700 square feet. The system consisted of a low-frequency FM radio transmitter and microphone, utilized five subminiature vacuum tubes, and was powered by two hearing aid batteries. The Vagabond system was expensive and somewhat fragile, but was adopted for use by several Las Vegas venues of the time. Not until 1990 did Shure re-enter the <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> market {{with the introduction of}} the L Series.|$|E

Some professional <b>wireless</b> <b>microphones</b> and 'low power auxiliary' stations(including those labeled as [...] "UHF") must be licensed under Part 74, Subpart H of the FCC's rules. However, as of January 2010, many professional <b>wireless</b> <b>microphones,</b> and other Part 74 certified 'low power auxiliary' stations with a 50 mW output or less, can be operated in the [...] "core TV band" [...] (TV channels 2 through 51, except 37) frequencies without a license under a waiver of Part 15 rules. This waiver is expected to become permanent. Units using the high UHF channels (700 MHz band) revoked from the TV bandplan in June 2009 became illegal to operate in June 2010.|$|R
25|$|Shure {{manufactures}} several {{lines of}} <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> systems, {{many of them}} utilizing microphone capsules from their wired microphones models such as the SM58, SM87, Beta 58, and Beta87A.

25|$|Shure Incorporated is an American audio {{products}} corporation. It {{was founded}} by Sidney N. Shure in Chicago, Illinois in 1925 as a supplier of radio parts kits. The company became a consumer and professional audio-electronics manufacturer of microphones, <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> systems, phonograph cartridges, discussion systems, mixers, and digital signal processing. The company also manufactures listening products, including headphones, high-end earphones, and personal monitor systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{sensitive}} transducer {{element of}} a microphone is called its element or capsule. Sound is first converted to mechanical motion {{by means of a}} diaphragm, the motion of which is then converted to an electrical signal. A complete microphone also includes a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an electronic circuit to adapt the output of the capsule to the equipment being driven. A <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> contains a radio transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{hearing aids}} include {{wireless}} hearing aids. One hearing aid can transmit {{to the other}} side so that pressing one aid's program button simultaneously changes the other aid, so that both aids change background settings simultaneously. FM listening systems are now emerging with wireless receivers integrated with the use of hearing aids. A separate <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone</b> can be given to a partner to wear in a restaurant, in the car, during leisure time, in the shopping mall, at lectures, or during religious services. The voice is transmitted wirelessly to the hearing aids eliminating the effects of distance and background noise. FM systems have shown to give the best speech understanding in noise of all available technologies.|$|E

In this paper we investigate the use of blind source extraction (BSE) techniques in such a combined acoustic sensor network to perform speech enhancement. We present strategies that apply traditional ASP techniques to the fixed microphone array, while simultaneously the spatial diversity provided by the <b>wireless</b> <b>microphones</b> is exploited. Our conclusion is that BSE techniques {{can be used in a}} combined <b>wireless</b> and fixed <b>microphone</b> network to perform speech enhancement...|$|R

2500|$|VanderWaal began {{composing}} {{her first}} songs at age three, using a <b>wireless</b> <b>microphone.</b> As a preteen, she found songwriting inspiration by watching movies {{and trying to}} imagine what a character was feeling, and [...] "what {{it would be like}} if I were them, and wrote a song." [...] She was inspired to learn the ukulele after watching a family friend play and seeing a Twenty One Pilots video on YouTube. She then bought one, using money she had received for her 11th birthday, and watched more videos to teach herself how to play. She has also played the saxophone in her school's marching band. After learning to play the ukulele, VanderWaal began to perform during open mic events at small venues near her home and to study music theory. In July 2016, after her audition on AGT, VanderWaal performed at the Lafayette Theatre in Suffern and at the Ramapo Summer Concert Series at Palisades Credit Union Park.|$|E
