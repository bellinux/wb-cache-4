5|$|Johnson's {{early works}} and early life have been {{neglected}} topics within Johnson scholarship. As a result, he is primarily {{known for the}} events surrounding his later life and later <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>A</b> Dictionary of the English Language. This imbalance originates in the failure of James Boswell, Johnson's friend and companion, to discuss in great detail Johnson's childhood {{and the beginning of}} his career within the Life of Samuel Johnson, the most famous biography on Johnson. In particular, Boswell ignored Johnson's early politics and political writings which show a concern with Sir Robert Walpole's political administration.|$|E

25|$|Differential {{braking systems}} are {{essentially}} an epicyclic transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, and puts a conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the idlers are locked and the system <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> conventional epicyclic. When the brake is released, the idlers spin, reducing the speed of rotation on that side. This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E

It's a pop-culture clash that is sometimes quite annoying (especially in Rice's left-field rhymes) but still <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> charm".

500|$|While Gustave Courbet (1819–1877) {{could be}} {{described}} as an anti-Romantic painter, his major <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>A</b> Burial at Ornans (1849–50) and The Artist's Studio (1855) owe a debt to The Raft of the Medusa. The influence is not only in Courbet's enormous scale, but in his willingness to portray ordinary people and current political events, and to record people, places and events in real, everyday surroundings. The 2004 exhibition at the Clark Art Institute, [...] Bonjour Monsieur Courbet: The Bruyas Collection from the Musee Fabre, Montpellier, sought to compare the 19th-century Realist painters Courbet, Honoré Daumier (1808–1879), and early Édouard Manet (1832–1883) with artists associated with Romanticism, including Géricault and Delacroix. Citing The Raft of the Medusa as an instrumental influence on Realism, the exhibition drew comparisons between all of the artists. The critic Michael Fried sees Manet directly borrowing the figure of the man cradling his son for the composition of Angels at the Tomb of Christ.|$|E
500|$|After refusing {{an offer}} {{to sing a song}} for A. R. Rahman's album Blue, Akhtar acted in, and {{produced}} his sister Zoya's directorial and written debut Luck By Chance, which had Hrithik Roshan and Konkona Sen Sharma in the lead roles. He was cast in the film after being deemed as a [...] "perfect choice" [...] for it. The story of the film revolved around a struggling actor who arrives in Mumbai to become a film star. It was released on 30 January 2009. Though failing to do well at the box office and being declared a [...] "flop", the film received generally positive reviews from critics. Neil Genzlinger from The New York Times said: [...] "It is Mr. Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this far-ranging, cameo-filled film. He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc." [...] Rajeev Masand noted: [...] "Farhan Akhtar delivers a simple-enough likeable performance that is just what the film required— no showy flourishes, no loud outbursts, just a straight off spontaneous act that <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} met with {{positive}} reviews by music critics. During a review of Saxobeats, Celeste Rhoads from AllMusic saw [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] as a club sensation along with [...] "Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)" [...] (2009) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011). Rodrigo of Yam Magazine wrote, [...] "One day, I heard Mr. Saxobeat by accident and I was instantly hooked. Thanks to its insanely catchy saxophone riffs and Stan's voice, Mr. Saxobeat is a very fun, upbeat song that you can smile and dance to {{no matter where you}} are. Plus, the song <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> charm for parties." [...] McCall of The Star-Ledger associated the song with the revival of the saxophone in music. The Hollywood Reporter Shirley Halperin listed the saxophone sequences in [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] in her list of [...] "12 Awesome Sax Solos". Johnston, writing for Village Voice, said [...] "the way they're employed" [...] sounded like Pitbull's [...] "I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)" [...] (2009).

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 17, 1910. It states: [...] "Clara Moore is a society girl who has won the affections of Jack Cass, a young millionaire. He thinks she loves him, but it is really his money that she adores. Prompted by a letter of warning, Jack decides to prove his sweetheart's love. One reason is that he privately disapproves of the way Clara and her mother have treated a poor relation, an orphan girl, who has been left in their care. Instead of giving her a home, they make a servant of her. Jack's plot <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> charm. His faithful valet gives the newspapers {{the story of the}} failure of Jack's mind, and that young man's ruin. Clara reads it and when Jack calls and admits that the reports are correct, she returns his ring and says that all is over between them. In fact {{the only person in the}} house that shows any sympathy for Jack is the poor relation, May Dustin, and naturally he compares her with the heartless society girl. Jack wants to see more of May, and invents a unique way of doing so. He buys out the milkman who serves the family, and in that way is able to call on May everyday. Liking soon ripens into love, and May agrees to wed Jack, although thinking he has nothing in the world but a meager salary. After marriage she is told the truth and finds that her husband has money enough to supply her every wish. As for Clara, she has lost her only chance to win a prized millionaire." ...|$|E

It can be considered [...] "full desalination" [...] because it converts the entire amount of saltwater intake into distilled water. One of the advantages of this system is the feasibility for inland operation. Standard advantages also include no air pollution and no temperature increase of endangered natural water bodies from power plant cooling-water discharge. Another important advantage is the production of sea salt for industrial and other uses. As of 2015, 50% of the world's sea salt production relies on fossil energy sources.|$|E

2500|$|The Transrapid maglev {{system uses}} a {{synchronous}} longstator linear motor for both propulsion and braking. It <b>works</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rotating electric motor whose stator is [...] "unrolled" [...] along {{the underside of}} the guideway; instead of producing torque (rotation) it produces a linear force along its length. The electromagnets in the maglev vehicle which lift it also work as the equivalent of the excitation portion (rotor) of this linear electric motor. Since the magnetic travelling field works in only one direction, if there were to be several maglev trains on a given track section, they would all travel in the same direction thereby reducing the possibility of collision between moving trains.|$|E

If these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, then shivering begins {{in order to use}} muscle movements to produce more heat. [...] When the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline either spontaneously or with medication, the reverse of these processes (vasodilation, end of shivering and nonshivering heat production) and sweating are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.|$|E
