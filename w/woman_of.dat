50|$|In her work, Crenshaw {{identifies}} {{three aspects}} of intersectionality {{that affect the}} visibility <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> color: structural intersectionality, political intersectionality, and representational intersectionality.

Political intersectionality examines how feminist and anti-racists laws and policies have paradoxically decreased the visibility <b>of</b> violence against <b>women</b> <b>of</b> color. Finally, representational intersectionality delves into how pop culture portrayals <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> color can obscure the actual, real life experiences <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> color.|$|R
