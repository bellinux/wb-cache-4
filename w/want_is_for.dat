2500|$|During a 2011 {{interview}} with London Evening Standard, Monáe {{said that she}} [...] "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter-ego found in many of her songs. She also said, [...] "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'Other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a black woman... what I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'Other' {{to connect with the}} music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" [...] She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation [...] "in due time". In 2013, Monáe stated that she wants both men and women to [...] "still be attracted to [...] " [...] and expressed support for the LGBTQ community.|$|E

6000|$|... "And I meant it," [...] said Mr. Vyner; [...] "only in {{unconscious}} imitation I dozed off. What I really <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> {{somebody to}} take my legs, somebody else my shoulders, and waft me gently ashore." ...|$|E
25|$|At {{the wedding}} reception, {{being held at}} a grand stately home (the real-life Basildon Park), Saskia's mother realises that all she <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> Saskia to <b>be</b> happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "The lady downstairs," [...] replied Rupert. [...] "The {{lady who}} was locked up. She won't come out. And {{she says that}} all she <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> us to let these fellows loose." ...|$|R
50|$|But Githany was tricking Sirak. What she {{actually}} <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> Bane to finally kill Sirak. Githany killed both of Sirak's goons. Sirak pleaded for Bane to have mercy, and then Bane decapitated Sirak.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} make any {{difference}} what the difference is," [...] said Olive, speaking quickly and with perhaps a little sharpness in her voice, [...] "all I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> you to pay me the toll." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes--in that way; {{but these}} men want it another way. What they <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> the State {{to set up}} a legal examination, and turn the landlords off altogether, if they can, and then let {{themselves}} have the farms in their stead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You can't have {{anything}} to say against it, Miss; can you? There's your grandfather as is willing, and the-money as one may say counted out,--and John Crumb is willing, with his house so ready that there isn't a ha'porth to do. All we <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> you to name the day.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Hinkle said, [...] "No, best {{look out}} for your health, if it takes all summer. I shouldn't want you to hurry on my account. Your time is my time. All I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> Miss Clementina, here, to {{personally}} conduct me to her father. If I could get him to take hold of my gleaner in New England, we could make the blueberry crop worth twice what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Be {{easy with}} him,' put in Egan {{from the next}} cot. 'He has got his chanst o' goin' clean.

6000|$|... "What is {{all that}} to me?" [...] she screamed. [...] "It doesn't matter to me how your house got here. There have been storms ever since the {{beginning}} of the world, and I never heard of any of them taking a house into a person's back yard. You ought not to have built your house where any such thing could happen. But all this is nothing to me. I don't understand now how your house did get here, and I don't want to understand it. All I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> you to take it away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then. We may {{consider}} that as settled," [...] Mrs. Conway said. [...] "What I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> {{you to tell}} your Martha that she is to give notice to leave at once, and that if she has an opportunity she is to mention to Miss Penfold {{that she has a}} friend who is out of place at present, and whom she is sure will suit. Of course as she will say that she is going to leave to be married, Miss Penfold cannot be vexed with her, as she might be otherwise, and may take her friend on her recommendation." ...|$|E
60|$|What I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> you to {{threaten}} the Virginia Central Railroad and canal in the manner your judgment tells you is best, holding yourself ready to advance, if the enemy draw off their forces. If you make the enemy hold a force equal to your own {{for the protection of}} those thoroughfares, it will accomplish nearly as much as their destruction. If you cannot do this, then {{the next best thing to}} do is to send here all the force you can. I deem a good cavalry force necessary for your offensive, as well as defensive operations. You need not therefore send here more than one division of cavalry.|$|E
50|$|All Wyl Thirsk ever <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> {{his family}} to be happy, to be loyal to his monarch, King Magnus, as his father was and, most importantly, {{to follow in the}} {{footsteps}} of his father, Fergys Thirsk.

No, all he <b>wants</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> me {{to clear}} out of Sunwich, and I'm not going to--until it pleases me, at any rate. It's poison to him <b>for</b> me to <b>be</b> living at the Kybirds' and pushing a trolley down on the quay. Talk about love {{sweetening}} toil, that does." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This fellow Bince, who is {{assistant}} general manager for Compton, {{got a letter from}} Murray two or three weeks before Compton was killed. Murray enclosed a threat signed I.W.W., and his letter instructed Bince to show the threat to Compton. I haven't got all the dope on it, but I've got a hunch that in some way it is connected with this job. Anyway, I've got both Murray's letter and the threat he enclosed. They're hidden in my desk at the plant. I can't get them, of course; they wouldn't let me in the place now, and Murray's so strong with the police that I wouldn't trust them, so I haven't told any one. What I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> you to go there to-night and get them." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{woman with}} her bundle passed {{through the open door}} of the house behind the mill. The public {{entrance}} was at the front where by day the bags of grain were lifted by rope and tackle to the upper story, and the farmers who brought them climbed up by the inner stairways. The believers had expected that they were to come in by way of the dwelling, but now the burly figure of the miller, with the light of a candle behind it, showed black in the doorway, and he spoke up, in his friendly voice: [...] "Neighbors, we want you all to go round to the front of the mill and come in there. The miracle is going to be done on the bolting-cloth floor, where there will be room for all that wants to see. We don't mean to keep anybody out, whether they believe or don't believe. The only thing we <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> you all to be quiet, and not make trouble. And now, come in as quick as you can, so you can be sure we haven't had time to do anything to the cloth that the seamless raiment is going to be made out of." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{my young}} friends, {{and if this}} would be true of your fathers on earth, {{it is just as}} true of your Father in heaven. You have never seen Him--you may have {{forgotten}} Him--you may have disobeyed Him-- you may have lived on your own way, as if you had no Father in heaven; still you know that you have a Father in heaven. You pray, surely, sometimes. What do you say? [...] "Our Father which art in heaven." [...] So you have a Father in heaven, else what right have you to use those words,--what right have you to say to God, [...] "Our Father in heaven," [...] if you believe that you have no Father there? That would be only blasphemy and mockery. I can well understand that you have often said those words without thinking of them--without thinking what a blessed, glorious, soul-saving meaning there was in them; but I will not believe that you never once in your whole lives said, [...] "Our Father which art in heaven," [...] without believing them to be true words. What I <b>want</b> <b>is,</b> <b>for</b> you ALWAYS to believe them to be true. Oh young men and young women, boys and girls--believe those words, believe that when you say, [...] "Our Father which art in heaven," [...] you speak God's truth about yourselves; that the evil devil rages when he hears you speak those words, because they are the words which prove that you do not belong to him and to hell, but to God and the kingdom of heaven. Oh, believe those words--behave as if you believed those words, and you shall see what will come of them, through all eternity for ever.|$|E

50|$|Although most stepfamilies {{can agree}} on what they do not <b>want</b> to <b>be</b> <b>for</b> one another, they are often hard pressed to agree upon what they do <b>want</b> to <b>be</b> <b>for</b> one another. This makes it {{difficult}} for everyone in the family to learn their roles. It <b>is</b> especially difficult <b>for</b> the children, because the roles and expectations of them change as they move between the homes and families of both of their birth parents.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And that's what I <b>was</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>for,</b> <b>is</b> it?' cried Mrs Prig, triumphantly. 'Yes. But you'll find {{yourself}} deceived. I won't go near him. We shall {{see how you}} get on without me. I won't have nothink to do with him.' ...|$|R

50|$|For me, {{in terms}} of {{personal}} satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished. I already won.
