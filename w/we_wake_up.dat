500|$|Lyrically {{the track}} is written about a failing {{relationship}} {{caused by a}} partner who abuses alcohol. The singer speaks {{of a man who}} faces a disconnect between his personality while drunk and sober, causing the inability to forge a connection. During the second verse Gomez sings [...] "Why is it so different when <b>we</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up?</b> / Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch / Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough / But I know what's next, and I want so much", describing a lover who can only show his true emotions while intoxicated. Later in the song she expresses the pain she feels having wasted so much time into her relationship, and decides to leave her dysfunctional lover: [...] "You've got a hold on me / You're like a wasted dream / I gave you everything / But you don't know how to love me when you're sober".|$|E

2500|$|The {{inverted}} spectrum thought experiment, {{originally developed}} by John Locke, {{invites us to}} imagine that <b>we</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> one morning and find that {{for some unknown reason}} all the colors in the world have been inverted. Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon. Supporters of the existence of qualia argue that since we can imagine this happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us, but that has no physical basis.

While calling for more research into thorium as an energy source and the country’s indigenous three-stage programme, he said, [...] "The world always felt there would be a miracle.

60|$|Jimmy's was not {{a nature}} that lent itself readily to introspection, but he was putting himself now through a searching self-examination which was {{revealing}} all kinds of unsuspected flaws in his character. He had been having too good a time for years past to have leisure to realise that he possessed any responsibilities. He had lived each day as it came {{in the spirit of}} the Monks of Thelema. But his father's reception of the news of last night's escapade and the few words he had said had given him pause. Life had taken on of a sudden a less simple aspect. Dimly, for he {{was not a}}ccustomed to thinking along these lines, he perceived the numbing truth that we human beings are merely as many pieces in a jig-saw puzzle and that our every movement affects the fortunes of some other piece. Just so, faintly at first and taking shape by degrees, must the germ of civic spirit have come to Prehistoric Man. We are all individualists till <b>we</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

6000|$|This {{distinction}} is very important, {{as can be}} seen from any practical parallel. Suppose <b>we</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> {{in the middle of the}} night and find that a neighbour has entered the house not by the front-door but by the skylight; we may suspect that he has come after the fine old family jewellery. We may be reassured if he can refer it to a really exceptional event; as that he fell on to the roof out of an aeroplane, or climbed on to the roof to escape from a mad dog. Short of the incredible, the stranger the story the better the excuse; for an extraordinary event requires an extraordinary excuse. But we shall hardly be reassured if he merely gazes at us in a dreamy and wistful fashion and says, [...] "After all, what is property? Why should material objects be thus artificially attached, etc., etc.?" [...] We shall merely realise that his attitude allows of his taking the jewellery and everything else. Or if the neighbour approaches us carrying a large knife dripping with blood, we may be convinced by his story that he killed another neighbour in self-defence, that the quiet gentleman next door was really a homicidal maniac. We shall know that homicidal mania is exceptional and that we ourselves are so happy as not to suffer from it; and being free from the disease may be free from the danger. But it will not soothe us for the man with the gory knife to say softly and pensively [...] "After all, what is human life? Why should we cling to it? Brief at the best, sad at the brightest, it is itself but a disease from which, etc., etc." [...] We shall perceive that the sceptic is in a mood not only to murder us but to massacre everybody in the street. Exactly the same effect which would be produced by the questions of [...] "What is property?" [...] and [...] "What is life?" [...] is produced by the question of [...] "What is liberty?" [...] It leaves the questioner free to disregard any liberty, or in other words to take any liberties. The very thing he says is an anticipatory excuse for anything he may choose to do. If he gags a man to prevent him from indulging in profane swearing, or locks him in the coal cellar to guard against his going on the spree, he can still be satisfied with saying, [...] "After all, what is liberty? Man is a member of, etc., etc." ...|$|E
6000|$|A terrific time! If {{he did not}} mistake, Leila Lynch {{had always}} had a terrific time. And he smiled, seeing again the stoep of an old Dutch house at High Constantia, and a woman sitting there under the white flowers of a sweet-scented creeper--a pretty woman, with eyes which could put a spell on you, a woman he would have got {{entangled}} with {{if he had not}} cut and run for it! Ten years ago, and here she was again, refreshing him out of the past. He sniffed the fragrance of the little letter. How everybody always managed to work into a letter what they were doing in the war! If he answered her he would be sure to say: [...] "Since I got lamed, I've been at the War Office, working on remounts, and a dull job it is!" [...] Leila Lynch! Women didn't get younger, and he suspected her of being older than himself. But he remembered agreeably her white shoulders and that turn of her neck when she looked at you with those big grey eyes of hers. Only a five-day acquaintanceship, but they had crowded much into it as one did in a strange land. The episode had been a green and dangerous spot, like one of those bright mossy bits of bog when you were snipe-shooting, to set foot on which was to let you down up to the neck, at least. Well, there was none of that danger now, for her husband was dead-poor chap! It would be nice, in these dismal days, when nobody spent any time whatever except {{in the service of the}} country, to improve his powers of service by a few hours' recreation in her society. 'What humbugs we are!' he thought: 'To read the newspapers and the speeches you'd believe everybody thought of nothing but how to get killed for the sake of the future. Drunk on verbiage! What heads and mouths we shall all have when <b>we</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> some fine morning with Peace shining in at the window! Ah! If only we could; and enjoy ourselves again!' And he gazed at the moon. She was dipping already, reeling away into the dawn. Water carts and street sweepers had come out into the glimmer; sparrows twittered in the eaves. The city was raising a strange unknown face to the grey light, shuttered and deserted as Babylon. Jimmy Fort tapped out his pipe, sighed, and got into bed.|$|E
