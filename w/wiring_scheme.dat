50|$|The CSAFE {{specification}} {{describes the}} physical <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> {{as well as}} the format of the data frames. The CSAFE protocol is designed to work in a master/slave fashion. A special I/O jack on the exercise equipment accepts a normal 8P8C (RJ-45) plug (although the <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> has no relation to ethernet) wired to a normal RS-232 cable. The CSAFE port also has pins which should be wired to an input audio jack.|$|E

40|$|We {{model the}} {{functioning}} of different <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes</b> in visual projections using artificial neural networks and so speculate on selective factors underlying taxonomic variation in neural architecture. We model the high connective overlap of vertebrates (where networks have a dense mesh of connections) and the less overlapping, more modular architecture of arthropods. We also consider natural variation in these basic <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes.</b> Generally, arthropod networks are as efficient or more efficient in functioning compared to vertebrate networks. They do not show the confusion effect (decreasing targeting accuracy with increasing input group size), and they train as well or better. Arthropod networks are, however, generally poorer at reconstructing novel inputs. The ability of vertebrate networks to effectively process novel stimuli could promote behavioral sophistication and drive the evolution of vertebrate <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes.</b> Vertebrate networks with less connective overlap have, surprisingly, similar or superior properties compared to those with high connective overlap. Thus, the partial connective overlap seen in real vertebrate visual projections may be an optimal, evolved solution. Arthropod networks with and without whole‐cell neural connections within neural layers have similar properties. This indicates that neural connections mediated by offshoots of single cells (dendrites) may be fundamental to generating the confusion effect...|$|R
50|$|The Fender Esquire has a {{variation}} to the Vintage <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> {{by using the}} scheme on a single pickup. This gives a treble cutoff in the first position, normal in the middle position, and a tone control cutoff in the third position.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} (brown) pair {{is increasingly}} used for Power over Ethernet (PoE). Legacy equipment may use just this pair; this conflicts with other equipment, because some manufacturers previously short circuited unused pairs to reduce signal crosstalk. Some routers, bridges and switches can be {{powered by the}} unused 4 lines—blues (+) and browns (−)—to carry current to the unit. There is now a standardized <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> for Power over Ethernet.|$|E

50|$|I²C {{is popular}} for {{interfacing}} peripheral circuits to prototyping systems, {{such as the}} Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I²C does not employ a standardized connector, however, and board designers have created various <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes</b> for I²C interconnections. To minimize the possible damage due to plugging 0.1-inch headers in backwards, some developers have suggested using alternating signal and power connections of the following wiring schemes: (GND, SCL, VCC, SDA) or (VCC, SDA, GND, SCL).|$|R
50|$|As with {{wireless}} doorbells, musical doorbells {{have also}} become more common. Musical and continuous power doorbells {{serve as an}} attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} newer digital circuitry and older doorbell <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes.</b> A major difference between the standard setup of a wired doorbell and a musical doorbell is that the musical doorbell must maintain power after the doorbell button is released to continue playing the doorbell song. This can be achieved in one of two ways.|$|R
50|$|The Avcon {{connector}} was compliant to the then-current SAE J1772-1998 conductive charging standard. It {{is possible}} to use either an adapter or to upgrade {{the plug on the}} truck to the updated J1772-2010 standard. The two connectors use an identical signaling and <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> with ground, two hots, proximity and pilot. With an adapter or after an upgrade, Ranger EVs can use the newer public charging infrastructure being deployed nationwide that utilizes the new J1772-2010 standard.|$|E
50|$|If one has {{specified}} wires {{within a}} cable (for instance, the colored Ethernet cable wires in TIA/EIA-568-B), then {{the order in}} which different color wires are attached to different connector pins defines the <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme.</b> Different ways of wiring numbered connector pins at the two ends of a cable creates different assemblies, which may appear identical but behave differently. The cross-reference between the contacts, or pins, of an electrical connector, and their functions is called pinout. There are many different pinouts for various connectors exists.|$|E
5000|$|This {{function}} is not generally supported by modular connectors. Modular connectors providing suitable switch contacts are available but not common; Instead, mode 3 devices use two modular connectors, {{one for the}} incoming line {{and the other for}} the outgoing line. The convenience of using a single connector in this application is one reason for the continued use of 600 series connectors, but mixing this <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> with modular connectors does not work well. For example, if a modern modem with its supplied 6P2C adaptor is plugged into a conventionally wired 611 mode 3 socket, the result is to disconnect all downstream devices.|$|E

50|$|Of {{particular}} concern was Livermore's W47, which generated unacceptably high yields in one-point testing. To prevent an accidental detonation, Livermore {{decided to use}} mechanical safing on the W47. The <b>wire</b> safety <b>scheme</b> described below was the result.|$|R
50|$|Although {{commonly}} referred to as an RJ45 in the context of Ethernet and category 5 cables, it is incorrect to refer to a generic 8P8C connector as an RJ45. A telephone-system-standard RJ45 plug has a key which excludes insertion in an un-keyed 8P8C socket. The registered jack (RJ) standard specifies a different mechanical interface and <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> for an RJ45S from TIA/EIA-568-B which is often used for modular connectors used in Ethernet and telephone applications. 8P8C modular plugs and jacks look very similar to the plugs and jacks used for FCC's registered jack RJ45 variants, although the RJ45S is not compatible with 8P8C modular connectors.|$|E
50|$|Telecaster Pluses from 1989 to 1995 (Version One) {{had a short}} style bridge (somewhat {{similar to}} that of the Stratocaster), with the bridge pickup having a small metal pickup ring which was not part of the bridge mechanism. The control plate also {{differed}} from the standard Telecaster; due to an extra mini switch between the tone and volume knobs. The three position toggle acts as a coil splitter for the bridge - toward the neck for the pickup closest to the neck, toward the bridge for the pickup closest to the bridge and in the middle for both. This <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> was available on the American Deluxe Tele for about two years. Guitars made from about 1995 until 1997 (Version Two) also featured a bound contoured alder body with ash veneers, a regular Telecaster bridge plate and Lace Sensor pickups. Telecaster Plus and Deluxe Plus models were all replaced by the American Deluxe Telecaster in 1998.|$|E

40|$|How does {{multilevel}} metalization {{impact the}} design of FPGA interconnect? The availability {{of a growing number}} of metal layers presents the opportunity to use wiring in the thirddimension to reduce switch requirements. Unfortunately, traditional FPGA <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes</b> are not designed to exploit these additional metal layers. We introduce an alternate topology, based on Leighton’s Mesh-of-Trees, which carefully exploits hierarchy to allow additional metal layers to support arbitrary device scaling. When wiring layers grow sufficiently fast with aggregate network size (N), our network requires only O(N) area; this is in stark contrast to traditional, Manhattan FPGA routing schemes where switching requirements alone grow superlinearly in N. In practice, we show that, even for the admittedly small designs in the Toronto “FPGA Place and Route Challenge, ” the Mesh-of-Trees networks require 10 % less switches than the standard, Manhattan FPGA routing scheme...|$|R

Utilizing a constructivist approach to developing a course in show control demonstrates positive results in preparing students to apply their knowledge in practical situations. This study applies the 4 C/ID instructional design model of Jeroen van Merriënboer and the problem space concepts introduced by David Jonassen to a course in show control systems, and through examinations, projects, and course evaluations, assesses the course design 2 ̆ 7 s efficacy in bringing learners to a demonstrable level of competence in understanding show control systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We extend ambipolar silicon {{nanowire}} transistors by using three independent gates and show an efficient approach to implement dual-threshold-voltage configurable circuits.

5000|$|The Telecaster {{has also}} been a {{longtime}} favorite guitar for hot-rod customizing. Several variants of the guitar appeared throughout the years with a wide assortment of pickup configurations, such as a humbucker in the neck position, three single-coil pickups and even dual humbuckers with special <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes.</b> Fender offered hot-rodded Teles with such pickup configurations, the US Fat and Nashville B-Bender Telecasters around 1998. The Deluxe Blackout Tele was also equipped with three single-coil pickups, a [...] "Strat-o-Tele" [...] selector switch and a smaller headstock than a standard Telecaster. The most common variants of the standard two-pickup solid body Telecaster are the semi-hollow Thinline, the Custom, -which replaced the neck single coil-pickup with a humbucking pickup, and the twin-humbucker Deluxe. The Custom and Deluxe were introduced during the CBS period and reissues of both designs are currently offered.|$|R
40|$|Many {{vertebrate}} {{motor and}} sensory systems “decussate, ” or cross the midline {{to the opposite}} side of the body. The successful crossing of millions of axons during development requires a complex of tightly controlled regulatory processes. Since these processes have evolved in many distinct systems and organisms, it seems reasonable to presume that decussation confers a significant functional advantage – yet if this is so, the nature of this advantage is not understood. In this article, we examine constraints imposed by topology on the ways that a three dimensional processor and environment can be wired together in a continuous, somatotopic, way. We show that as the number of wiring connections grows, decussated arrangements become overwhelmingly more robust against wiring errors than seemingly simpler same-sided <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes.</b> These results provide a predictive approach for understanding how 3 D networks must be wired if they are to be robust, and therefore have implications both for future large scale computational networks and for complex biomedical devices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{synaptic}} {{drive from}} neuronal populations varies considerably over short time scales. Such {{changes in the}} pre-synaptic rate trigger many temporal processes absent under steady-state conditions. This paper examines the differential impact of pyramidal cell population bursts on post-synaptic pyramidal cells receiving depressing synapses, and on a class of interneuron that receives facilitating synapses. In experiment a significant shift {{of the order of}} one hundred milliseconds is seen between the response of these two cell classes to the same population burst. It is demonstrated here that such a temporal differentiation of the response {{can be explained by the}} synaptic and membrane properties without recourse to elaborate cortical <b>wiring</b> <b>schemes.</b> Experimental data is first used to construct models of the two types of dynamic synaptic response. A population-based approach is then followed to examine analytically the temporal synaptic filtering effects of the population burst for the two post-synaptic targets. The peak-to-peak delays seen in experiment can be captured by the model for experimentally realisti...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{developing}} brain neurons interconnect via {{the action of}} molecules that guide the axon to its targets, thus allowing the proper <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> to emerge. It is not fully understood whether the underlying mechanism is wholly deterministic or not. The existence of “choice-points ” and “decision-regions” suggests that options are available to the growth cone. The guidance mechanism is here simulated by equating the axonal trajectory {{to that of a}} trickle of ground water sipping through a bed of sand. Decision regions are implemented by assigning each site of the percolation lattice a set of probabilities ruling the possible moves. ...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidic {{impedance}} cytometry is a label-free {{approach for}} high-throughput analysis of particles and cells. It {{is based on}} the characterization of the dielectric properties of single particles as they flow through a microchannel with integrated electrodes. However, the measured signal depends not only on the intrinsic particle properties, but also on the particle trajectory through the measuring region, thus challenging the resolution and accuracy of the technique. In this work we show via simulation that this issue can be overcome without resorting to particle focusing, by means of a straightforward modification of the <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> for the most typical and widely used microfluidic impedance chip...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in nanoscale {{science and technology}} provide possibilities to directly self-assemble and integrate functional circuit elements within the <b>wiring</b> <b>scheme</b> of devices with potentially unique architectures. Electroionic resistive switching circuits comprising highly interconnected fractal electrodes and metal-insulator-metal interfaces, known as atomic switch networks, have been fabricated using simple benchtop techniques including solution-phase electroless deposition. These devices are shown to activate through a bias-induced forming step that produces the frequency dependent, nonlinear hysteretic switching expected for gapless-type atomic switches and memristors. By {{eliminating the need for}} complex lithographic methods, such an approach toward device fabrication provides a more accessible platform for the study of ionic resistive switches and memristive systems.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} wire width {{planning}} for interconnect performance optimization in an interconnect-centric design flow. We first propose some simplified, yet near-optimal <b>wire</b> sizing <b>schemes,</b> using {{only one or}} two discrete wire widths. Our sensitivity study on wire sizing optimization further suggests that there exists a small set of "globally" optimal wire widths for a range of interconnects. We develop general and efficient methods for computing such a "globally" optimal wire width design and show rather surprisingly that using only two "predesigned" widths for each metal layer, we are still able to achieve close to optimal performance compared with that by using many possible widths, not only for one fixed length, but also for all wire lengths assigned at each metal layer. Our wire width planning can consider different design objectives and wire length distributions. Moreover, our method has a predictable small amount of errors compared with optimal solutions. We expect that our simplified <b>wire</b> sizing <b>schemes</b> and <b>wire</b> width planning methodology will be very useful for better design convergence and simpler routing architectures...|$|R
