It would have been better if she had killed Rap Brown and/or Stokely Carmichael, but when she killed Dr. King, she lost.|$|E

25|$|Michelangelo’s dome was a {{masterpiece}} of design using two masonry shells, one within the other and crowned by a massive lantern supported, as at Florence, on ribs.

25|$|Lammers: No. But you {{confirmed}} it. You see, I {{have been}} studying metaphysics for years, and I was able by a few questions, by the facts you gave, to check {{what is right and}} what is wrong with a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of the stuff I've been reading. The important thing is that the basic system which runs through all the mystery religions, whether they come from Tibet or the pyramids of Egypt, is backed up by you. It's actually the right system.|$|E

25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the <b>whole</b> <b>lot.</b> But I don't support burning. I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E
25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world and a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality {{in the same way that}} an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E
25|$|Oladotun has {{an innate}} {{affinity}} for dance {{and he did}} that a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> as a kid, his love for legendary Michael Jackson's and Soul Brothers' James Brown's moves fueled the passion and had him take it much more seriously, and while in the university, he instituted a dance group he called Xtreme, they rocked different events {{on and off the}} university campus, shuttering between pursuit of passion and academic excellence. He became popular on campus as a result. Shortly after school he joined (now P-Square's official choreographer), Nonso Asobe's (a.k.a. Don Flexxx) dance group Ignite and performed in many events. Then in 2006 he featured on popular African act, D'banj's smashing hit, Why Me video as a dancer and on DJ Zeez's, Same Ni video. His dancing career was steady-rising towards peak when busy radio schedules among other activities choked out the time he made out for professional dancing.|$|E

He {{grew up in}} the Cowies Hill area of Durban, {{attending}} Westville High School where he played in school-based groups doing covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix and The Who.

In 1976 he was conscripted into the South African Defence Force, where he declared himself a Hindu pacifist, and was assigned to medical duties and then to band work. During his military service, Sony played B♭ horn, euphonium and drums. He changed his surname from Swinney to Sony to make it harder for the army {{to get in touch with}} him for camps; he chose Sony because he liked their products. Whilst in the army in 1977, his father brought him a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of punk rock albums from an overseas trip. This was his first exposure to Sex Pistols and the Clash. By the time his two years service was over he had schooled himself in a lot of the post punk Art rock bands as well as reggae and dub and had developed a healthy respect for Shangaan bass players.|$|E

500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them.
