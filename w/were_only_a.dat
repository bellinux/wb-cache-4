While with Wilmington, {{he led the}} entire Kansas City Royals' organization (and the Carolina League) with fifteen losses (to go with only five wins). He also threw seventeen wild pitches. However, his ERA was 4.09, and the Blue Rocks <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> halfgame ahead of the worst {{team in the league}} (the Potomac Cannons).|$|E
5|$|Although there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> {{handful of}} {{consistent}} superstring theories, it remained a mystery {{why there was}} not just one consistent formulation. However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways.|$|E
5|$|Its {{size and}} unusually bright surface make Vesta the {{brightest}} asteroid, {{and it is}} occasionally {{visible to the naked}} eye from dark skies (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and perihelion <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few weeks apart. It will be brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the earlier}} {{cyclones}} Meena, Nancy, and Olaf, Percy left widespread damage across Swains Island, Tokelau, {{and the northern}} Cook Islands. However, because of well-executed warnings, there were no deaths and there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few injuries. Percy was the worst cyclone to strike Tokelau since a similar cyclone hit the area in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Percy {{was also}} the most {{damaging}} of the February cyclones as it battered the Cook Islands, which were still recovering from the impacts of Cyclones Meena, Nancy and Olaf. Percy then devastated the island of Tokelau, leaving many homeless and millions in dollars in property damages (although exact damage figures are unavailable). Because of warnings {{in anticipation of the}} storm, there were no deaths and there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few injuries.|$|E
5|$|The Shirdi Sai Baba {{movement}} {{began in}} the 19th century, while {{he was living in}} Shirdi. A local Khandoba priest, Mhalsapati Nagre, {{is believed to have been}} his first devotee. In the 19th century, Sai Baba's followers <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small group of inhabitants of Shirdi, and a few people from other parts of India.|$|E

5|$|The final between Zambia and Sudan {{finished}} 0–0 after extra time, but Zambia won on penalties. Although Zambia won the final, {{the trophy}} {{was awarded to}} Sudan, who Zambia beat in the final. This was as Zambia <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> guest team, from the COSAFA federation, therefore the trophy was awarded to the highest finishing CECAFA federation team: Sudan.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 {{the island was}} finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number {{and the lack of}} a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Soviet {{principles}} of urban planning, Žirmūnai, {{according to the}} 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates (the other two being Karoliniškės and Viršuliškės) with the lowest percentage of single-family housing in the city (0.1%). Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments. The scarcity of lots means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} from December 5 to December 6, Petras Vileišis printed 36,000 {{copies of the}} {{resolution}} for distribution. After the assembly, notorious for its loud, lengthy and intense debates, the delegates returned to their communities and started {{to carry out its}} resolutions. The old Russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of the 280 volosts (82 in Kaunas, 33 in Suvalkai, and 10 in Vilnius Governorates). These communities elected their own representatives, organized their own schools where classes were taught in the Lithuanian language, and stopped paying taxes. While the first Russian responses were disorganized and confused, the authorities soon marshaled their armed forces and returned the situation back to normal. The process was relatively peaceful; there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few clashes between armed groups of peasants and Tsarist military forces. Unlike in neighboring Latvia or Estonia, peasants did not rise against their landlords. A number of the most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.|$|E
5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When {{the success of the}} crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{when the}} Duchess {{was staying at}} Ednam Lodge, {{the home of the}} Earl of Dudley, some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the Royal Collection by the Duke, or by the Windsors {{themselves}} as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at Cartier the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small portion of the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Over 12,000 Armenians {{from the}} Ottoman Empire {{went to the}} US {{throughout}} the 1890s. With the exception of Fresno, California, which had land suitable for farming, the earliest Armenian immigrants mostly settled in the northeastern industrial centers, such as New York City, Providence, Worcester, and Boston. Armenian emigrants from the Russian Empire <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> minority in emigration from Armenian lands across the Atlantic (about 2,500 moved in 1898–1914), because Armenians were treated relatively better in Russia than in the Ottoman Empire. Once in America, some Armenians organized political parties to serve various causes in America and in the homeland. Turkish Armenian migration rose gradually {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century, partly due to the Adana Massacre of 1909, and the Balkan Wars in 1912–1913. Before the start of the World War I, there were already 60,000 Armenians in the US. As more Armenians fell victim to the genocide and more Armenians were deported, the Armenian American community grew dramatically.|$|E
5|$|The Clan Class {{was based}} upon the Britannia Class design, {{incorporating}} a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the west of Scotland. The Clan Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance. However, trials {{in other areas of}} the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive made it hard to adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E

5|$|The English and Dutch {{partitioned}} {{the island}} in 1614, as the aggression was hampering the profitability of both groups. That year the Netherlands created Noordsche Compagnie as a whaling cartel. After the Muscovy Company fell into financial difficulties some years later, the Noordsche Compagnie got the upper hand {{and was able to}} dominate the whaling and fend off the English. The company established itself in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen (around Albert I Land) and only permitted a limited Danish presence. The English whaled further south, while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea. From the 1630s, the situation stabilized, and there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> limited number of aggressive incidents. By the end of the 18th century, whaling had ceased as the bowhead whale had reached local extinction.|$|E
5|$|The Helles landing {{was made}} by the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). The {{division}} landed on five beaches in an arc about the tip of the peninsula, named 'S', 'V', 'W', 'X' and 'Y' Beaches from east to west. On 1 May, the 29th Indian Brigade (including the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles) landed, took and secured Sari Bair above the landing beaches and was joined by the 1st/5th and the 2nd/10th Gurkha battalions; the Zion Mule Corps landed at Helles on 27 April. At 'Y' Beach, during the first engagement, the First Battle of Krithia, the Allies landed unopposed and advanced inland. There <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small number of defenders in the village but lacking orders to exploit the position, the 'Y' Beach commander withdrew his force to the beach. It was as close as the Allies ever came to capturing the village as the Ottomans brought up a battalion of the 25th Regiment, checking any further movement.|$|E
5|$|The area {{in which}} the city of Fort Lauderdale would later be founded was {{inhabited}} for more than two thousand years by the Tequesta Indians. Contact with Spanish explorers in the 16th century proved disastrous for the Tequesta, as the Europeans unwittingly brought with them diseases, such as smallpox, to which the native populations possessed no resistance. For the Tequesta, disease, coupled with continuing conflict with their Calusa neighbors, contributed greatly to their decline over the next two centuries. By 1763, there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few Tequesta left in Florida, and most of them were evacuated to Cuba when the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763, {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the Seven Years' War. Although control of the area changed between Spain, United Kingdom, the United States, and the Confederate States of America, it remained largely undeveloped until the 20th century.|$|E
