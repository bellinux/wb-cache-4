5|$|Marked {{structural}} improvements {{took place}} on October17 and the NHC assessed a high probability of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48hours. That evening, corroborating data from ships, satellite imagery, and scatterometer estimates indicated {{the formation of a}} tropical depression by 12:00UTC. With the cyclone located over warm waters of 86°F (30°C) and <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> moist region with low wind shear, intensification was a certainty as the depression approached Mexico. Uncertainties existed as to how fast the system would move. Some forecast models depicting the system as stalling just offshore for several days, though forecasters indicated that a steady northward movement would lead to dissipation within 48hours.|$|E

5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from £2,000 to £1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and to mortgage the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to mortgage it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a full complement of crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E

25|$|Wiercinski's {{research}} methods and conclusions are not {{accepted by the}} vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasian, Negroid, and Mongoloid.

The system presented a well-defined eye enveloped by deep convection, and it reached its initial peak intensity at 18:00UTC, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) and the JTWC estimated one-minute maximum sustained winds at 215km/h (130mph). Soon thereafter, increasing wind shear prompted weakening; convection waned and became increasingly ragged in appearance.

25|$|Theoretically, landless peasants {{were to be}} {{the biggest}} {{beneficiaries}} from collectivization, because it promised them an opportunity to take an equal share in labor and its rewards. In fact, however, rural areas did not have many landless peasants, given the wholesale redistribution of land following the Revolution. Alternatively, for those with property, collectivization meant forfeiting land up to the collective farms and selling most of the harvest to the state at minimal prices set by the state itself. This, in turn, engendered opposition to the idea. Furthermore, collectivization involved significant changes in the traditional village life of Russian peasants <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> short time frame, despite the long Russian rural tradition of collectivism in the village obshchina or mir. The changes were even more dramatic in other places, such as in Ukraine, with its tradition of individual farming, in the Soviet republics of Central Asia, and in the trans-Volga steppes, where for a family to have a herd of livestock was not only a matter of sustenance, but of pride as well.|$|E
25|$|After Lü Bu's {{defeat and}} death, Cao Cao focused on {{preparation}} to the upcoming war with Yuan Shao (who was still his ally then), and Yue Jin {{was assigned to}} the border. When the warlord of Bing Province, Zhang Yang, vacillated on the predicament upon choosing Cao Cao or Yuan Shao as his ally, his subordinate Yang Chou (楊醜) murdered him and took his head to Cao Cao. However, Sui Gu (眭固), a former Heishan bandit, killed Yang Chou when {{he was on his way}} to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). In order to merge Zhang Yang's remnants, Yue Jin intercepted Sui Gu when the latter attempted to go back north, and successfully hunted down his prey and took control of the Bing Province troops. He then brought his troops to join Cao Cao's eastern campaign against Liu Bei, who had just killed Che Zhou (車冑), the Governor of Xu Province, and taken control of the province. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> short time, Liu Bei was defeated, and his aide, Guan Yu, was captured alive.
