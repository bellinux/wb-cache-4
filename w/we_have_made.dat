We are fully committed and prepared to work around the clock if that's what it takes to reach a final agreement. We are at a point where deals get done as long as both parties share a desire to cross the finish line together. There just isn't much left to resolve.|$|E
25|$|We've {{underlined}} to the Bermuda Government {{that they}} should have consulted with the United Kingdom as to whether this falls within their competence or is a security issue, for which the Bermuda Government do not have delegated responsibility. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> clear to the Bermuda Government the need for a security assessment, which we are now helping them to carry out, and we will decide on further steps as appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Tadić {{also said}} that Serbia would not accept the {{legality}} of the EU's planned policing and judiciary mission for Kosovo. On 25 February 2008, Boris Tadić met with Dmitry Medvedev and Sergei Lavrov in Belgrade where Medvedev stated that “We proceed from the understanding that Serbia is a single state with its jurisdiction spanning its entire territory, and we will adhere to this principled stance in the future, <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a deal to coordinate together our efforts in order {{to get out of this}} complicated situation”.

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> jury {{members of}} Big Brother {{available}} to the press the past few seasons always {{with the proviso that}} their questions not inform the ejected HouseGuest of influences outside his or her personal experience in the House. This season several cast members have made either offensive statements or exhibited controversial behavior, we respect journalist interests and rights to pose questions about these statements but believe at the same time doing so could provide information that influences the final vote and potential outcome of this twelve-week competition. For that reason the remaining jurors will not be made {{available to the}} media {{for the duration of the}} program. They will be made available to the press after the Big Brother finale on September 18.|$|E
25|$|My Lord, - We beg {{leave to}} thank your lordship for {{presiding}} at this, our first examination, and we trust that the progress which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> in out studies {{will meet with}} your approval, and also of our parents. We feel assured that your lordship's approbation will prove a stimulus to our future exertions, and that next Christmas (with God's blessing) will find us much further advanced, not only in our secular studies, but in the great study you so strongly recommended to our attention on your late visit, namely - 'the study of God's laws {{and those of the}} Church.' We conclude, begging your lordship's apostolic benediction, and wishing you a merry Christmas and many happy New Years. Signed on behalf of the pupils of St Peter's School. Laurence Lorigan.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of these kids is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E

500|$|On the occasion, Ezra Cornell {{delivered}} a brief speech. [...] He said, [...] "I hope we have {{laid the foundation}} of an institution which shall combine practical with liberal education. ...

500|$|On December 26, Paynter was {{selected}} as the winner of the 2012 Secretariat Vox Populi Award. [...] Penny Chenery, owner of Secretariat, for whom the award was named, said [...] "Paynter's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations, making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year's Vox Populi Award... After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease, I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight laminitis. The progress <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> to date clearly benefited Paynter—a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit." ...|$|E

500|$|Architect {{and critic}} Maxwell Hutchinson has {{attracted}} controversy in {{his criticism of}} recent architectural developments in Leeds, most notably Clarence Dock. In referring to Leeds' plans for the future, Hutchinson said [...] "there are worrying signs that Yorkshire is about {{to make the same}} mistakes that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> in London over 20 years ago". Hutchinson also criticised the dearth of services in the city centre, referring to its lack of schools and health-care facilities. Hutchinson also described the Clarence Dock development as [...] "the slums of the future". These claims were explored on the BBC television programme, Inside Out.|$|E
500|$|The Danish {{government}} {{rejected a}} link between the accident and long-term health issues. Dr. Kaare Ulbak of the Danish National Institute of Radiation Protection said, [...] "We have very good registers for cancer incidents and cancer mortality and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a very thorough investigation." [...] The workers said the lack of proof was attributable to the lack of appropriate medical monitoring. As of November 2008, the case has been unsuccessful. [...] A 2011 report by the Danish National Board of Health found that [...] "the total radiation dose for representative persons in the Thule area for plutonium contamination resulting from the 1968 Thule accident is lower than the recommended reference level, even under extreme conditions and situations." ...|$|E
500|$|Lawson met {{journalist}} John Diamond in 1986, {{when they}} were both writing for The Sunday Times. They married in Venice in 1992, and have a daughter, Cosima, and a son, Bruno. Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud I am of you and what you have become. The great thing about us is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral. After Diamond's death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her [...] "Morbidobox".|$|E

500|$|Heikkinen was the {{one bright}} spot in the Wolverines’ 1937 season. In early November 1937, Anderson {{described}} Heikkinen as “the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.” Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: “Heik has shown the stuff in both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern [...] [...] [...] Minnesota didn’t split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible {{for a lot of}} that. My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. When we have the ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E
500|$|Adrian Sutil in the Spyker {{opted to}} start from the pitlane. Massa got off to the best {{possible}} start and retained his lead, but Räikkönen passed Hamilton into Turn One. At {{the back of the}} field, Anthony Davidson hit the back of Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso. The Toro Rosso came back onto the track and smashed {{into the side of the}} Super Aguri. Liuzzi said afterwards that [...] "all we can do is wait for Silverstone and hope that the definite improvement <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> with the car pays off". At the Adelaide hairpin, Jarno Trulli rammed into the back of Heikki Kovalainen. Trulli was out, but Kovalainen continued at the back of the field. Trulli apologised to Kovalainen after the race, and declared it [...] "a racing accident". The tangle promoted Alonso up to eighth.|$|E
500|$|On October 22, 2008, Microsoft {{announced}} that the game would not be released in India on the Xbox 360 platform. Religious and cultural sentiments were cited as the reason. Microsoft stated, [...] "Microsoft constantly endeavors to bring the best games to Indian consumers in sync with their international release. However, in light of cultural sensitivities in India, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the business decision to not bring Fallout 3 into the country." [...] Although the specific reason was not revealed in public, {{it is possible that}} it is because the game contains two-headed mutated cows called Brahmin, or that Brahmin is also the name of an ancient, powerful hereditary caste of Hindu priests and religious scholars in India, or its similarity to the spelling of brahman, a type of cow that originated in India. Brahman, a breed of Zebu, are revered by Hindus.|$|E

500|$|In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy {{to reduce}} its 300-member staff, suspecting {{that many of them}} were spies. The U.S. responded by ending {{diplomatic}} relations, and it increased CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships that traded with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills. Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On April 15, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed 3 Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation. Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries, publicly proclaiming, [...] "What the imperialists cannot forgive us, is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a Socialist revolution under their noses", his first announcement that the government was socialist.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the time}} of his death, reports of his having been a ringer angered Schulz. [...] While he did work in a steel mill, Schulz insisted that he did not [...] "come out" [...] of the steel mill to play {{football}}. [...] Instead, Schulz said he [...] "went into" [...] the mill to harden himself up for the football season. [...] When asked years later how he got to Michigan, Schulz recalled that, in the summer of 1904, he was working in the mill and had received several offers to play football. [...] One day, his father called to say that Fielding Yost of Michigan was in his office. [...] Schulz ran down the street and rushed into his father's office, where he was introduced to Yost. [...] His father promptly told him, [...] "Adolph, this is Mr. Yost. [...] You are to play football for him at Michigan. [...] <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> all the arrangements".|$|E
500|$|Poppy {{initially}} {{appeared as}} a guest character in two episodes, broadcast on 11 and 13 January 2011, in [...] "filler" [...] scenes that were substituted for those cut from a controversial baby-swap storyline in which Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack)'s son James dies of sudden infant death syndrome, and she secretly swaps him with Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace)'s son, Tommy. A spokeswoman for EastEnders claimed that {{although some of the}} baby-swap scenes had been edited in response to reaction from viewers, none had been removed: [...] "Given the audience response to this storyline, we felt on this occasion that it was appropriate to respond and make some changes. The vast majority of material remains intact and we don't believe that those trims <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> will weaken or detract from the overall storyline for viewers". In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Bright stated that her first scene was her favourite throughout her tenure, as [...] "all [...] could think was, 'I'm sitting on a bench in the Square!'" [...] Babbington, who played Jodie, revealed in May 2011 that Bright was to reprise her role. Bright made her return on 30 June 2011.|$|E
