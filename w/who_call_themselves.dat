25|$|In 1849, George Long {{writes that}} Wallachia and Moldavia are {{separated}} {{only by a}} political boundary and that their history is closely connected.

Ethnologist Robert Gordon Latham, writes in 1854, that the name by which a Wallachian, Moldavian or a Bessarabian designates himself is Roman or Rumanyo (Romanian), a name the author also applies to the Romance speakers of Macedonia. Similarly, in 1845, German brothers Arthur Schott and Albert Schott (historian) write in the beginning of their book – Walachische Mährchen (Wallachian Fairy Tales) – that Wallachians live in Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, Hungary, Macedonia and Thessaly. The authors also mentions that Wallachians respond Eo sum Romanu (I am Romanian) when asked what they are.|$|E
25|$|The Mayos are {{the most}} {{numerous}} indigenous ethnic group in the state with more than 75,000 who have maintained their language and traditions.

There is also a notable community in the northwest of Sonora. Their religion is a mix of Catholicism and traditional beliefs, which they assimilated along with European farming and livestock knowledge. Mayo houses often have a cross made of ironwood to protect against evil. Ethnically pure Mayos tend to segregate themselves from mestizos and other ethnicities. The Mayos make their living from subsistence farming, working on larger farms and combing wild area for herbs, fruits and other resources. They also work making crafts in wood making utensils and decorative items.|$|E

25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but <b>who</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E
25|$|La Huasteca {{is home to}} six {{indigenous}} {{ethnic groups}} with over 250,000 speakers of various indigenous languages. About 70% speak Nahuatl; 20% speak Huastec; six percent speak Otomi and about three percent speak Pame, Tepehua, and Totonac. The Nahuatl speakers of La Huasteca comprise over 27% of all Nahuatl speakers in Mexico. Indigenous communities continue to be mostly agricultural with the growing of corn being most important. Other important aspects include cattle, the processing of sugar cane and the growing of citrus as a cash crop although most of this is {{under the control of}} mestizos. While subject to municipal authorities, usually mestizo dominated, they have their own internal political and economic systems as well. The indigenous of the area face discrimination from the dominant mestizos, <b>who</b> <b>call</b> <b>themselves</b> “gente de razón” (people of reason) and the indigenous “compadritos” or “cuitoles” which is similar to calling them children. Catholic influence in the region has been limited since the colonial period, mostly restricted to major towns and flat areas and less in the more rugged terrain. This has allowed the indigenous of La Huasteca to maintain more of their traditions than those in other regions of Mexico.|$|E

It characterizes their appearance, in which men styled their hair and dressed {{in a manner similar}} to their footmen, as history's most preposterous. (In contemporary Britain fears about the consequences of homosexual relationships often centred on their perceived tendency to ignore (and thus weaken) class boundaries: an effeminate gentleman who dressed like his footman, a servant, embodied this class transgression in a threatening way.) The habit of wearing makeup, the pamphlet says, was [...] "as much in Vogue among our Gentlemen, as with the Ladies in France."
