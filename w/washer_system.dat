2500|$|The second {{generation}} Umnumzaan saw numerous modifications that utilizes {{some of the}} newer technologies found on the Sebenza 25. The single-most visual change was replacing the oversized custom pivot with a more traditional (Sebenza-style) pivot brushing. This new pivot no longer requires the Umnumzaan Take-down Tool and instead a traditional hex wrench {{is all that is}} needed to disassemble and reassemble the knife. This pivot is larger than most blade pivot brushing systems and is identical to the one used on the newer Large Sebenza 25 (mid-2012 release and with a pivot that is significantly thicker than the pivot used on the previous Large Sebenza 21). This pivot also incorporates a newer generation <b>washer</b> <b>system</b> with larger washer perforations, which helps retain lubricating grease better than previous designs, while simultaneously keeping elements out of the pivot system to increase service intervals. The change in pivot and washers is complimented by the modifications made to the ceramic ball and detent system, in which a larger ceramic ball in a slightly different location is used to make opening smoother and reduce wear (although it is unclear as to exactly when this specific change began).|$|E

Aluminum has applications {{in most of the}} metal fabrication industries including au-tomotive, appliance, aircraft and architectural. It continues to make inroads into new markets. One of aluminum’s beneficial properties is the natural formation of aluminum oxides on the metal surface that protect against general corrosion. However, this natural oxide layer has two shortcomings. It has poor adhesion to the base metal and is susceptible to localized corrosion.

Secondly, a control system is proposed for improving heating performance of the WFHS, and its performance is verified through experiments. The key feature of the proposed control system is to regulate the current of a booster converter input to the WFHS up to the target value that is set to guarantee heating performance. Target current is calculated by using initial temperature value and employing the mathematical model derived in the paper.
