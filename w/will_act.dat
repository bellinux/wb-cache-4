5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity <b>will</b> <b>act</b> before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|P.exclamans {{tend to have}} smaller nests {{than other}} wasps, with {{typically}} fewer than one hundred individuals in a given nest. Because {{of the size of}} the nest, the queen tends to be the most active individual in the nest. This is because the queen has to monitor and directly control the activities of the nest. In addition to her reproductive role, the queen must also act as the pacemaker of the nest and synchronize the worker activity. These last two points have recently been disputed and the workers may be self organized. It has also been observed that the queen <b>will</b> <b>act</b> aggressively towards individuals that are the least active.|$|E

50|$|The date of {{execution}} of a will is the date on which the will is signed. Before 1954, when the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> came into force, all provinces had their own legislation regulating the law of testate succession; now the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> has uniformed the law in this regard.|$|R
40|$|Courts {{have long}} {{required}} literal {{compliance with the}} <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> formalities, automatically invalidating defectively executed wills. in this Article Professor Langbein argues for a functional rule of substantial compliance that would treat some such defects as harmless to {{the purposes of the}} <b>Wills</b> <b>Act.</b> He contrasts the functional analysis that excuses the principal will substitutes fron compliance with <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> formalities, and he points to factors that make it likely that the substantial compliance doctrine would fit smoothly into existing practice without materially increasing the levels of probate litigation...|$|R
5|$|She later takes {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Xavier {{and they have}} a brief fling until he has to leave because of drug couriering. He later returns and she opts to resume their relationship, but his ex-girlfriend Freya Duric (Sophie Hensser) ruins things. She makes him sell illegal drugs again and Xavier is torn between her and Ruby. He later decides to settle down with Ruby much to her delight after Ruby exposes Freya and pays her to leave. When Xavier's brother Brendan (Kain O'Keeffe) arrives, he pushes Ruby away because he has learning difficulties, he feels they <b>will</b> <b>act</b> strangely. Ruby later bonds with Brendan; Xavier is pleased and they resume their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{dominate}} other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. Brown hyenas encounter spotted hyenas in the Kalahari, {{where the}} brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter {{each other on}} carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown hyenas will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually {{has the effect of}} seemingly confusing spotted hyenas, which <b>will</b> <b>act</b> bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.|$|E
5|$|When {{a charge}} {{is placed in}} a {{location}} with a non-zero electric field, a force <b>will</b> <b>act</b> on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential {{at a certain point}} in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E

5|$|Most oil {{pollution}} in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, or be ingested when they preen themselves {{in an attempt to}} remove the contaminant. Marine mammals are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or poisoned. Benthic invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned, and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected, and the livelihoods of people dependent on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria <b>will</b> <b>act</b> over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who <b>will</b> <b>act,</b> who will do the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E
5|$|Tatsuya and Miyuki are {{siblings}} of {{the same}} year and children to Tatsurou Shiba and the late Miya Yotsuba; their parents had a loveless forced marriage, and when their mother died, their father married his mistress, Sayuri Furuha, leaving the siblings to live by themselves. Maya Yotsuba, their aunt and the leader of the Yotsuba, was the reason Tatsuya was born with the unique magic to decompose, reconstruct, and detonate matter. Out of fear, the Yotsuba rallied for Tatsuya's death, forcing Miya and Maya to take measures to ensure his survival: the first was Miyuki's creation, a powerful magician who <b>will</b> <b>act</b> as a seal to Tatsuya's power; the second is to magically dull Tatsuya's emotions except for his familial love towards Miyuki; and the third was to assign Tatsuya to be Miyuki's bodyguard in order to develop his sense of loyalty towards her. During a family vacation in Okinawa, Tatsuya wards off an invasion by the Great Asian Alliance and joins the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion which is headed by major Kazama Harunobu. At some point during his life, Tatsuya developed an interest in engineering magical technology and commercialized revolutionary technology through his family's company, Four Leaves Technology, under the identity Taurus Silver. He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> 1963 (1963 C. 44) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{repealed}} the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> 1861 {{and brought}} United Kingdom law {{in line with}} the suggestions of the Ninth Hague Conference on Private International Law, completed on 5 October 1961. Along with the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> 1837, the 1963 Act is the principal <b>Act</b> dealing with <b>wills</b> in the United Kingdom. The 1963 <b>Act</b> allows a <b>will</b> to be considered [...] "properly executed" [...] if it was executed in line with local law in the state where it was executed, the state where the testator lived or the state the testator was a citizen of, rather than applying United Kingdom law to all wills.|$|R

50|$|A will is a {{unilateral}} {{expression of the}} wishes of a testator in a legally prescribed manner which determines what must happen {{to his or her}} property after his or her death. The <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> defines a <b>will</b> to “include a codicil and any other testamentary writing.” The only way in which a testator can make a valid will is by strictly complying with the detailed requirements of section 2(1) of the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{of historic}} {{importance for the}} future of the Anglo- American law of wills has been in progress over the last decade in Australia. Two states of the federation, Queensland and South Australia, have enacted prototype statutes that abrogate the traditional rule of strict compliance with the requirements of <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> formality. The new statutes enable the probate court to validate a will even when the testator has failed to comply fully with the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act...</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{result of}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "outside the will" [...] theory has been seen with respect to witnesses to the will. Section 15 of the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> states that any person [...] " [...] the execution of any will to whom or to whose wife or husband any beneficial ... shall be thereby given or made, such ... shall, so far only as concerns such person attesting the execution of such will, or the wife or husband of such person, or any person claiming under such person or wife or husband, be utterly null and void". In Re Young, an attesting witness was the beneficiary of a secret trust. The court decided that [...] "the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> 1837 {{had nothing to do with}} it" [...] and the secret trust valid. The effect of the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> 1968 has been to allow the trustee of a half-secret trust to attest the will and this may also apply to the fully secret trust.|$|R
5000|$|Viscount Sumner {{said that}} the {{doctrine}} that trusts would be recognised to prevent “fraud” did not conflict with the various <b>Wills</b> <b>Acts,</b> a ‘perfectly normal exercise of general equitable jurisdiction.’ ...|$|R
500|$|Secret trusts do {{not comply}} with the {{formality}} requirements (such as witnessing) laid down in the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> 1837. Despite this, the courts have chosen to uphold them as valid. Although various justifications have been given for this, they are generally categorised as either based on preventing fraud, or as regarding secret trusts as outside (dehors) {{the operation of the}} <b>Wills</b> <b>Act.</b> The first is considered the traditional approach [...] if the courts do not recognise secret trusts, the trustee given the property in the will would be able to keep it for himself, committing fraud. The fraud theory utilises the equitable maxim that [...] "equity will not allow a statute {{to be used as a}} cloak for fraud". A more modern view is that secret trusts exist outside the will altogether, and thus do not have to comply with it. Accepting this theory would undermine the operation of the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act,</b> since the <b>Wills</b> <b>Act</b> is designed to cover all testamentary dispositions. To avoid this problem, one approach has been to reclassify the secret trust as inter vivos ("between the living") but this creates other problems. There have also been attempts to conclude that half-secret trusts rest on a different basis to fully secret trusts, although this has been disapproved by the House of Lords, primarily on practical grounds.|$|R
