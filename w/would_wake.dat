5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a typical day he <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two cups of tea, and go to bed at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Skelton was a {{prolific}} writer of both {{short stories and}} music. After sleeping only {{four or five hours}} a night, he <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up at 5a.m. and begin writing stories, composing music, and painting pictures. He wrote at least one short story a week and had composed over 8,000 songs and symphonies by the time of his death. He wrote commercials for Skoal tobacco and sold many of his compositions to Muzak, a company that specialized in providing background music to stores and other businesses. Skelton was also interested in photography; when attending Hollywood parties, he would take photos and give the film to newspaper reporters waiting outside. He was never without a miniature camera and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. Skelton was also an avid gardener who created his own Japanese and Italian gardens and cultivated bonsai trees at his home in Palm Springs, California.|$|E
5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he learned to read and write in Portuguese at age five. His first tutors were Mariana de Verna and Friar Antonio de Arrábida. When he became Emperor he already had several professors. Amongst these were Félix Taunay (father of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay) and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (son of the regent Francisco de Lima e Silva), who taught French and Fencing respectively, and towards both of whom he developed lifelong friendship and admiration. Pedro II passed the entire day studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up at 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would go to bed. The disciplines were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} efforts {{to establish a}} Naval Academy football team in 1879. The first was guided by first-classman J.H. Robinson, who developed it as a training regiment {{to help keep the}} school's baseball team in shape. The team played the sport under rules that made it much closer to soccer, where the players were permitted only to kick the ball in order to advance it. The second effort, headed by first-classman William John Maxwell was more successful in its efforts. Maxwell met with two of his friends, Tunstall Smith and Henry Woods, who played for the Baltimore Athletic Club and officially challenged their team to a game with the Naval Academy. A team was formed from academy first-classmen, which Maxwell led as a manager, trainer, and captain. The team <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up and practice before reveille and following drill and meals. The squad received encouragement from some of the faculty, who allowed them to eat a late dinner and skip final drill for additional practicing. This was against the direct orders of the school superintendent, who had banned football and similar activities.|$|E

60|$|Every {{sense in}} him clamoured for {{the belief that}} {{it had all been}} an ugly dream, an autumn madness from which he <b>would</b> {{presently}} <b>wake</b> at her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "The old {{man must}} be departed," [...] {{he began to}} say, [...] "or fallen into some fit; for the noise I have made <b>would</b> have <b>waked</b> the seven sleepers." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet, in the {{gathering}} light, [...] I lay with half-shut eyes that <b>would</b> not <b>wake,</b> [...] Lovingly clinging to the skirts of night [...] For that sweet vision's sake.|$|R
25|$|George <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up to {{the sound}} of the front door slamming. He would race downstairs to find the dog {{sleeping}} soundly at the front door. Nobody else heard the sound although it was loud enough to wake the house.|$|E
25|$|Determined {{that her}} son reach his maximum potential, his mother <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> Davis up in the mornings to run a mile on a nearby track to build up his endurance.

25|$|After getting manhandled in {{the first}} half, Georgia Tech's offense <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up, getting into scoring {{position}} on their first drive but unable to put points on the board, then getting a one-yard score from Anthony Allen to cap an 11-play, 71-yard drive and bring the Jackets to within a field goal.|$|E

25|$|As a {{symbolic}} object, it represents Hermes (or the Roman Mercury), {{and by extension}} trades, occupations, or undertakings associated with the god. In later Antiquity, the caduceus {{provided the basis for}} the astrological symbol representing the planet Mercury. Thus, through its use in astrology, alchemy, and astronomy it has come to denote the planet and elemental metal of the same name. It is said the wand <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> the sleeping and send the awake to sleep. If applied to the dying, their death was gentle; if applied to the dead, they returned to life.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{was born}} on August 5, 1982 in Des Moines, Iowa. She {{attended}} eight schools in eight years while her single mother, Lori, often held down two jobs to support her family of six. Jones' father {{spent most of her}} childhood in the Air Force and later in state prison. When Jones was in third grade, her family settled {{in the basement of a}} Des Moines Salvation Army church.

25|$|Lewis Hoad {{was born}} on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of Glebe, the eldest of three sons of tramway {{electrician}} Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle. Hoad started playing tennis at age five with a racket gifted by a local social club. As a young child he <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained and {{he was allowed to}} practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house. At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at Manly in the under 16 category.|$|E
6000|$|... "'E's much better," [...] {{declared}} his mother. [...] "That's what comes o' good nursing; some nurses <b>would</b> 'ave <b>woke</b> 'im {{up to take}} food, but I just let 'im sleep on. People don't feel hunger while they're asleep." ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{mounted the}} stairs, {{and was now}} on the landing just outside Jeanne's door. He pulled the bell-handle, and heard the {{pleasing}} echo of the bell that <b>would</b> presently <b>wake</b> Madame Belhomme and bring her to the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> not <b>wake</b> him, on any account," [...] he said. [...] "It is a {{great effort}} of nature, and he will, I hope, awake quite himself. Of course, I can't say {{anything}} about the wound, till he does.|$|R
25|$|The last {{communication}} with the rover was on sol 2210 (March 22, 2010) {{and there is a}} strong possibility the rover’s batteries lost so much energy at some point that the mission clock stopped. In previous winters the rover was able to park on a Sun-facing slope and keep its internal temperature above −40°C, but since the rover was stuck on flat ground it is estimated that its internal temperature dropped to −55°C. If Spirit had survived these conditions and there had been a cleaning event, there was a possibility that with the southern summer solstice in March 2011, solar energy would increase to a level that <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up the rover.|$|E
25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

60|$|The column {{moved forward}} very gingerly {{for a few}} paces. Then there was an oath, a shower of blue sparks as shod hooves crashed on small stones, and a man rolled over with a jangle of accoutrements that <b>would</b> have <b>waked</b> the dead.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{jumped into}} bed {{with him and he}} climbed on top of me.

As I was slipping out of the room, I heard Michael say to Jermaine, 'Nice job. Now, can we please get some sleep?'" ...|$|E
500|$|Ball <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> at 3:00am to ride his {{motorcycle}} to Ruffy-Baumann for flying practice at dawn, before beginning his daily military duty at 6:45am. His training at Ruffy-Baumann was not unique; Edwin Cole {{was learning to}} fly there at the same time. In letters home Ball recorded that he found flying [...] "great sport", and displayed what Peter de la Billière described as [...] "almost brutal" [...] detachment regarding accidents suffered by his fellow trainees: ...|$|E
500|$|The Just So Stories {{began as}} bedtime stories told to his {{daughter}} [...] "Effie" [...] when the first three were published in a children’s magazine, a year before her death, Kipling explained: [...] "in the evening there were stories meant to put Effie to sleep, and you {{were not allowed to}} alter those by one single little word. They had to be told just so; or Effie <b>would</b> <b>wake</b> up and put back the missing sentence. So at last they came to be like charms, all three of them,—the whale tale, the camel tale, and the rhinoceros tale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Malcolm agreed, [...] "there {{would be}} no {{difficulty}} in swimming if unencumbered with arms and armour, but there {{would be no}} advantage in getting across without these; if we could but get hold of a boat or two, we <b>would</b> soon <b>wake</b> yonder Spaniards up." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{laid the}} altered powder quietly by his pillow, took away his that I had {{laid out in}} {{readiness}} for him, and crept back to my own place noiselessly. There I lay awake, hot and feverish, wondering to myself hour after hour when he <b>would</b> ever <b>wake</b> and take it.|$|R
