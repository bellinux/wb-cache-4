50|$|When Emily {{contracts}} polio, Margaret blames herself, {{believing that}} her daughter's illness is divine retribution. She is subpoenaed by Assistant US Attorney Esther Randolph (Julianne Nicholson) {{to testify against}} Nucky, and considers doing so to atone for her sins, {{even if it means}} sending Nucky to the electric chair. Nucky tells her that he wants to marry her and become a better man, while admitting that the marriage would benefit him by making her ineligible to testify against him. She is unsure of what to do until she sees him teaching Emily to walk in her leg braces; she realizes that he loves her and her children, and marries him the following day after making a full confession to her parish priest. Her protection from testifying - and the sudden murders of the <b>witnesses</b> <b>against</b> Nucky <b>-</b> destroys Randolph's case, and the US Attorney's Office is forced to drop the charges.|$|R
5000|$|Taborsky is an [...] in Connecticut {{death penalty}} lore. He {{is the only}} convict sent to death row not once, but twice, for {{different}} crimes. Taborsky first came to Connecticut's death row for the 1950 murder of Louis Wolfson, a West Hartford liquor store owner, during a robbery. His younger brother Albert, who was also his co-conspirator, testified against Taborsky at the trial {{in exchange for a}} life sentence. In prison, however, Albert exhibited signs of mental illness and was institutionalized. Joseph Taborsky, having learned through the prison grapevine that his brother Albert wound up in an insane asylum, appealed his case. In 1955, the Connecticut Supreme Court reversed Taborsky's conviction (and death sentence) because the sole <b>witness</b> <b>against</b> him <b>-</b> Albert - was incurably insane. Because there were no other witnesses to the robbery and murder of Wolfson, Taborsky could not be tried again. Thus, he was freed from death row, after less than three years, in early October 1955. Taborsky appeared appropriately humble, stating, [...] "You can't beat the law. From now on, I'm not even going to get a parking ticket." ...|$|R
