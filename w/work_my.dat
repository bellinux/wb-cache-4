25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and <b>work.</b> <b>My</b> work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

500|$|A former {{dancer and}} fixture on the New York club scene, Madonna Louise Ciccone became {{known to the}} world simply as Madonna, {{with the release of}} her 1983 self-titled debut album Madonna. Fueled by hit songs like [...] "Holiday", [...] "Borderline" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star", the album {{was one of the best}} selling of the year and helped Madonna become one of the most {{exciting}} new artists of the 1980s. When she started work on her second album, Madonna felt that her first album had succeeded in introducing her [...] "street-smart dance queen" [...] persona, and she wanted to solidify and build upon that concept. According to her, [...] "My <b>work,</b> <b>my</b> dedication—the stubbornness for getting Madonna released—had paid off. Now it was time to solidify my future." ...|$|E
500|$|At first, Angelou {{intended}} {{to return to}} poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and {{so that she could}} [...] "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, [...] "I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my <b>work,</b> <b>my</b> expression". [...] As she told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, [...] "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful". [...] She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.|$|E
500|$|Boonen praised Hayman's victory. He {{said that}} Hayman was [...] "the rider nobody was really looking at" [...] {{and that he}} had ridden a [...] "good sprint", {{although}} no one had much energy left by the velodrome; Vanmarcke had faded in the final metres and boxed Boonen in {{at the bottom of the}} track. He stated that he had received a text message on the morning of the race from a doctor who had treated him after he fractured his skull in the 2015 Abu Dhabi Tour; the doctor had said that the day of the race would be the first day that Boonen would be able to get back on his bike. He noted that he [...] "couldn't be unsatisfied" [...] even though he had not won the race. Stannard described the race as [...] "so close yet so far" [...] and thought that he could have managed a better result than his third place had he not attacked in the final kilometres. He said that he was [...] "super happy" [...] to see Hayman win; he also said that there were [...] "two more steps to <b>work</b> <b>my</b> way up now".|$|E

500|$|On January 25, 1994, the Chandlers' {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court with $15,331,250 to be held in a trust fund for Jordan, $1.5 million for each of his parents and the family's lawyer slated to receive $5 million for a total of {{approximately}} $23 million (although another source showed Feldman was to receive $3 million based on a September 1993 retainer, for a total of $21 million). According to a motion passed to Judge Melville in 2004, leading up to the 2005 trial, Evan Chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with Jackson's insurer. [...] Jackson's insurance company [...] "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of Mr. Jackson and his personal legal counsel" [...] and was [...] "the source of the settlement amounts"; as noted in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson. It also noted [...] "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of precedents in California. Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court) or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case. That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case. In 2004, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau in People v. Jackson said [...] "People who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits. Michael Jackson now regrets making these payments. These settlements were entered into with one primary condition – that condition was that Mr. Jackson never admitted any wrongdoing. Mr. Jackson always denied doing anything wrong...Mr. Jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong." [...] Jackson explained why had he tried to settle: [...] "I wanted to go on with my life. Too many people had already been hurt. I want to make records. I want to sing. I want to perform again...It's my talent. My hard <b>work.</b> <b>My</b> life. My decision." [...] He also wanted to avoid a [...] "media circus".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the talent}} {{he had shown}} during his innings against Somerset, he found the next few seasons difficult. In an {{interview}} with All Out Cricket magazine, he said [...] "I’d {{had a bit of}} first team cricket, and was dropped and managed to <b>work</b> <b>my</b> way back into the team {{in the second half of}} the year but just couldn’t get it right." [...] For four seasons, between 1997 and 2000, Walker consistently averaged in the mid-twenties, scoring just one century in the process. Since then, he has scored over one thousand runs in a season on three occasions.|$|E
2500|$|Cassatt {{traveled}} to Chicago to try her luck, but {{lost some of}} her early paintings in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Shortly afterward, her work {{attracted the attention of}} the archbishop of Pittsburgh, who commissioned her to paint two copies of paintings by Correggio in Parma, Italy, advancing her enough money to cover her travel expenses and part of her stay. In her excitement she wrote, [...] "O how wild I am to get to <b>work,</b> <b>my</b> fingers farely itch & my eyes water to see a fine picture again". With Emily Sartain, a fellow artist from a well-regarded artistic family from Philadelphia, Cassatt set out for Europe again.|$|E

By April, National Football Post reported him at 300 pounds. However, Cam Inman of the Oakland Tribune said that Russell had [...] "a good first minicamp" [...] and [...] "is in great shape" [...] in the team's first training camp in late April. In an interview during camp, Russell said [...] "Today I'm going to keep coming out, compete for the job, <b>work</b> <b>my</b> tail off." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{team lost}} to California in the US final on ESPN, as Marquis was relegated to shortstop because Little Leaguers weren't allowed to pitch {{two days in}} a row. [...] Marquis then led his team to victory over Canada in the third-place game, {{throwing}} a no-hitter. [...] "Playing {{in front of that}} many people at that time in my life made me realize this is what I wanted to do with my life", said Marquis, [...] "and I was going to <b>work</b> <b>my</b> hardest to get it." [...] As of October 2008, he was one of 31 Little League World Series players to have reached the major leagues.|$|E
2500|$|Other admirers have {{included}} special effects artist Ray Harryhausen, who {{writes in his}} autobiography An Animated Life, “Long before Obie (Willis O'Brien), myself, and Steven Spielberg, he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen. [...] At the L.A. County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural {{on one of the}} walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times. This, plus a picture book about Knight’s <b>work</b> <b>my</b> mother gave me, were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three-dimensional models of these extinct beings”. Paleoartist Gregory S. Paul has also mentioned Knight as a big influence on him.|$|E

5000|$|D'Agata's work {{deals with}} addiction, sex, {{personal}} obsessions, darkness, prostitution, and other topics widely considered taboo.

2500|$|After {{not being}} given a {{contract}} with the Queensland Bulls for the 2007–08 season, Nash decided to try to restart his career by moving to the West Indies. Speaking of his decision, he said [...] "I was obviously very disappointed to miss out on a contract, but I pretty much got told {{it would be hard for}} me to <b>work</b> <b>my</b> way back in again and I felt I still have something to offer". In October 2007, Nash was named in the Jamaican squad. Nash played a key role in Jamaica winning the KFC Cup. In the final, he scored 117 as his team beat Trinidad and Tobago by nine wickets. Nash finished the season with 422 first-class runs at 46.88 to his name from the domestic competition and was third in the batting averages. There was surprise in some quarters when Nash was not selected for the Test series against Australia in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1843, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol was published, {{during the}} mid Victorian {{revival of the}} holiday. The word Merry was then {{beginning}} to take on its current meaning of [...] "jovial, cheerful, jolly and outgoing". [...] "Merry Christmas" [...] in this new context figured prominently in A Christmas Carol. The cynical Ebenezer Scrooge rudely deflects the friendly greeting: [...] "If I could <b>work</b> <b>my</b> will … every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding." [...] After the visit from the Ghosts of Christmas affects his transformation, Scrooge exclaims; [...] "I am as merry as a school-boy. A merry Christmas to everybody!" [...] and heartily exchanges the wish to all he meets. The instant popularity of A Christmas Carol, the Victorian era Christmas traditions it typifies, and the term's new meaning appearing in the book popularized the phrase [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E
2500|$|Pisemsky's {{early works}} {{exhibited}} profound disbelief {{in the higher}} qualities of humanity, and a disdain for the opposite sex. Reflecting upon possible reasons for this, Skabichevsky pointed at those first years spent in Kostroma when the young Pisemsky had lost sight of whatever lofty ideals {{he might have been}} exposed to while studying in the capital. [...] "With my [...] success as Podkolesin my scientific and aesthetic life ended. What lie ahead was only grief and the need to find <b>work.</b> <b>My</b> father was dead already, my mother, shocked by his death, was paralyzed and lost her speech, my means were meagre. With this in mind I returned to the country and gave myself to melancholy and hypochondria," [...] Pisemsky wrote in his autobiography. On the other hand, it was his continuous official errand trips throughout the Kostroma governorate that provided Pisemsky with the priceless material he used in his future literary work.|$|E
500|$|Liszt {{remained}} {{grateful to}} Bache and thanked him on several occasions, writing to him, [...] "Without Walter Bache and his {{long years of}} self-sacrificing efforts in the propaganda of <b>my</b> <b>works,</b> <b>my</b> visit to London were indeed not to be thought of." ...|$|R
