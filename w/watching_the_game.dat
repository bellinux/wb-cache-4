5|$|The CFL {{operated}} the Canadian Football Network, {{a coalition of}} private broadcasters that shared league games and the Grey Cup with the CBC, from 1987 to 1990. CBC then broadcast the championship game alone until 2007, when the CFL sold exclusive rights to all games, including the Grey Cup, to specialty channel The Sports Network (TSN) and its French-language sister station Réseau des sports (RDS), a deal that was criticized by Canadians without cable access. Nonetheless, TSN and RDS achieved a record audience for the 2009 Grey Cup, with 6.1 million Canadians <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in its entirety, and over 14 million viewing {{at least part of}} the contest. Viewership has declined in recent years, and in 2014, about 33%, of Canadians watched at least some of the game, peaking at 5.1 million viewers in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by a low scoring Second Test in Sydney when Australia were 4/77 needing 223 to win on a poor wicket against the lethal pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. The express Tyson was bowling with the help of tailwind and the slips cordon were over 50m behind the bat. Harvey stood firm while Tyson scattered the stumps of his partners, and he farmed the strike ruthlessly, protecting the tailenders and counter-attacking the England fast bowlers, relying on the cut shot and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side. Schoolboys <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> leaned over the fence to beckon the boundaries towards them. Last man Bill Johnston came in at 9/145 with 78 runs still required, but protected by Harvey he only had to face 16 balls in 40 minutes and they almost produced an unlikely Australian victory. Harvey continued to attack the bowling, and he hooked Tyson over fine leg's head for four. Together, Harvey and Johnston they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required. At this point, the Australian pair were confident. Harvey and Johnston felt that Tyson was about to run out of energy, and that their prospects would improve when Hutton would have been forced to change bowlers in the near future. However, it was not enough and England won by 38 runs when Johnston gloved a Tyson delivery down the leg side to the wicket-keeper. Harvey had played what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life, a defiant, unbeaten 92, exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no other batsmen reached 15.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{dress of}} a player is a {{protective}} equestrian helmet (usually of a distinctive colour, to be distinguished at the considerable distance from which onlookers are <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game),</b> riding boots to just below the knees, white trousers (often ordinary denim jeans), and a coloured shirt bearing {{the number of the}} player's position. Optional equipment includes one or two gloves, wristbands, kneepads (mandatory in some clubs), spurs, face mask, and a whip. The only piece of equipment required by the United States Polo Association (USPA) rules is the helmet or cap with a chin strap..|$|E
25|$|It {{was another}} disappointing {{end to a}} {{spectacular}} season for the Vikings. They had finished the season with an NFC best 12–2 record and quarterback Fran Tarkenton won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award, and the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award, while Foreman amassed 1,761 all-purpose yards and 22 touchdowns. The day only got worse for Tarkenton, as he soon learned his father {{had died of a}} heart attack while <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The upstart and youthful Cowboys, not expected to do much after an 8–6 season in 1974 and the loss of several key veterans, would go on to defeat the Rams and lose to Pittsburgh in the Super Bowl.|$|E

He encounters Julien Grinda, a Frenchman, outside a gambling den where men play Russian roulette for money. Grinda entices the reluctant Nick to participate and leads him into the den. Mike {{is present in the}} den, <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> but the two friends do not notice each other at first. When Mike does see Nick, he is unable to get his attention. When Nick is introduced into the game, he grabs the gun, fires it at the current contestant, and then again at his own temple, causing the audience to riot in protest. Grinda hustles Nick outside to his car to escape the angry mob. Mike cannot catch up with them as they speed away.|$|E
25|$|Also as {{previously}} mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series {{for a national}} television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At {{some point during the}} game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson was nowhere to be found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. Bob Costas, who, along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history.|$|E

500|$|Taylor's {{high-profile}} {{verbal and}} physical clashes with Huff were well-noted. [...] "He was always hooting his mouth {{off on the}} field," [...] Huff said of Taylor. [...] "He'd tell me, 'Yeah, you're just a big talker.' He brought the best out in you. He was an unusual player, a great player, but an agitator ... I did everything I could to that sonofabitch." [...] The 1962 championship game between the Packers and Giants featured hard hitting and skirmishes throughout by both players, after which Taylor acknowledged there were [...] "some hard feelings" [...] between the two. Boxing promoter Al Flora, after <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> on television, offered Taylor and Huff $2,000 for a four-round boxing match {{to be held in}} Baltimore on January 28, 1963. His offer was turned down, however.|$|E
500|$|In 1951, Bouchard was {{involved}} in a legal first when he was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a New York Rangers fan. The fan claimed Bouchard had struck him with his stick when he was waving to a friend <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> on TV. Bouchard said the fan had actually raised his fist towards a fellow Canadiens player who was being taken off the ice with an injury and his stick hit the fan accidentally as he tried to ward off the blow. In what may have been the first time in legal history, evidence was taken during a trial from someone witnessing an event on a television as the fan's friend testified he'd seen Bouchard strike the blow. Bouchard won the case when Otis Guernsey, president of Abercrombie and Fitch, who was at the game testified he heard [...] "vile language" [...] and saw the fan raise his fist and not wave.|$|E

He was attended to by two neurosurgeons and three other doctors. [...] They soon concluded that the injury was too severe for surgery to be a viable option. Some 30 hours after his fall, on January 15, Masterton died without ever regaining consciousness. [...] His parents, brother, wife and two children were at his side. [...] Masterton's Minnesota teammates, who were playing a game in Boston on the 14th, were informed that he had been removed from life support in the dressing room in what was ultimately a 9–2 loss to the Bruins. [...] He is the only player in NHL history to die {{as a direct result of}} an injury suffered on the ice.

500|$|Limbo {{graphical}} {{and audio}} presentation were considered by reviewers as exceptional and powerful {{elements of the}} game. The monochrome approach, coupled with film grain filter, focusing techniques and lighting, were compared to both film noir and dreamlike tableaus of silent films, allowing the visual elements of the game to carry much of the story's weight. Cian Hassett of PALGN likened the effect to <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> through an old-fashioned film projector that creates [...] "one of the most unsettling and eerily beautiful environments" [...] in video gaming. Garrett Martin of the Boston Herald compared the art style and game design decisions to German Expressionism with [...] "dreamlike levels that twist and spin in unexpected angles". The art style itself was praised as minimalistic, and considered reminiscent {{of the art of}} Lotte Reiniger, Edward Gorey, Fritz Lang, and Tim Burton. The use of misdirection in the visuals was also praised, such as by using silhouettes to avoid revealing {{the true nature of the}} characters or shadows, or by showing human figures across a chasm who disappear once the player crossed the chasm.|$|E
500|$|Sakic {{was born}} in Burnaby, British Columbia, to Marijan and Slavica Sakic (originally Šakić, [...] ), {{immigrants}} from Croatia {{in what was then}} Yugoslavia. Growing up in Burnaby, he did not learn to speak English well until kindergarten, having been raised with Croatian as his mother tongue. At the age of four, Sakic attended his first NHL game, a match between the Vancouver Canucks and Atlanta Flames; after <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Sakic decided that he wanted to become a hockey player. As a smaller player, he was forced to use skill rather than size to excel, and modeled himself after his idol, Wayne Gretzky. After showing exceptional promise as a young hockey player in Burnaby, Sakic was referenced as a new Wayne Gretzky in the making. He scored 83 goals and 156 points in only 80 games for Burnaby, while attending school at Burnaby North Secondary [...] Soon after, he was added to the Lethbridge Broncos of the Western Hockey League (WHL) for {{the last part of the}} 1985–86 season.|$|E

500|$|Connal, <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{from his}} home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, also noticed the fourth quarter was running [...] "terribly slow". At 6:45, he called Cline again, and both men agreed the game would not end on time. Both {{supported}} running the end of the game, but given Goodman's instructions, his permission was required. Connal agreed to call NBC Sports president Lindemann, and that he and Lindemann would then speak to Goodman. After promising Cline a return call, Connal reached Lindemann by telephone. Lindemann agreed {{that the end of the}} game should be broadcast, and both men began trying to reach Goodman. Lindemann was successful in reaching Goodman, and asked the network president, [...] "What about the instruction to broadcast operations control that Heidi had to go on at 7:00 ET, no matter what?" [...] Goodman replied, [...] "That's crazy. It's a terrible idea." [...] Lindemann then set up a three-way conversation with himself, Goodman and NBC Television president Don Durgin. After several minutes of discussion, Durgin agreed to delay the start of Heidi until after the game was completed. Sportswriter Kyle Garlett, in his history of sports gaffes, noted, [...] "And even though earlier executives had told [...] to make sure he started Heidi on time, those same executives changed their minds late in the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Pacers coach Rick Carlisle {{said after}} the game, [...] "I felt like I was {{fighting}} for my life out there." [...] One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player [...] "went through me like I was butter", and then NBA Commissioner David Stern, <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> on TV, recalled that he said, [...] "Holy [...]" [...] (O'Neal later said, [...] "As bad as it looked on TV, {{it was at least}} 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach Chuck Person compared the situation to being [...] "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." [...] Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. Derrick Coleman stood near Brown and Brown's ball boy son to protect them. The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win. Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a folding chair that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave. Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after his}} sister's birth, Kubrick began {{schooling}} in Public School 3 in the Bronx, {{and moved to}} Public School 90 in June 1938. Although his IQ was discovered to be above average, his attendance was poor, and he missed 56 days {{in his first term}} alone, as many as he attended. He displayed an interest in literature from a young age, and began reading Greek and Roman myths and the fables of the Grimm brothers which [...] "instilled in him a lifelong affinity with Europe". He spent most Saturdays during the summer watching the New York Yankees, and would later photograph two boys <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in an assignment for Look magazine to emulate his own childhood excitement with baseball. [...] When Kubrick was 12, his father Jack taught him chess. The game remained a lifelong interest of Kubrick's, appearing in many scenes of his films. Kubrick, who later {{became a member of the}} United States Chess Federation, explained that chess helped him develop [...] "patience and discipline" [...] in making decisions. At the age of 13, Kubrick's father bought him a Graflex camera, triggering a fascination with still photography. He befriended a neighbor, Marvin Traub, who shared his passion for photography. Traub had his own darkroom, where the young Kubrick and he would spend many hours perusing photographs and watching the chemicals [...] "magically make images on photographic paper". The two indulged in numerous photographic projects for which they roamed the streets looking for interesting subjects to capture, and spent time in local cinemas studying films. Freelance photographer Weegee (Arthur Fellig) had a considerable influence on Kubrick's development as a photographer; Kubrick would later hire Fellig as the special stills photographer for Dr. Strangelove (1964). As a teenager, Kubrick was also interested in jazz, and briefly attempted a career as a drummer.|$|E
