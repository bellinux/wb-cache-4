5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement {{was applied to the}} {{external}} faces of the mosque with the intention of protecting the mosque from <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some distortions of the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{caused a}} {{significant}} amount of damage in Hong Kong and China. It was considered the worst storm to hit Hong Kong since the typhoon in 1937. The storm destroyed weak shacks made by refugees from the mainland, leaving thousands homeless. There were multiple landslides, and most of the infrastructure were damaged. More than 400 small watercraft were either damaged or destroyed. In China, dikes and dams were damaged severely, multiple public buildings collapsed, and destroyed large swaths of farmland. Significant <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> was also reported in Taiwan. More than 1,600 people died during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The first {{advisories}} {{were issued}} by the Canadian Hurricane Centre on September26, although at that time they broadly suggested the possibility existed for <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> across Atlantic Canada. As Juan approached on September27, warning broadcasts on local media in Atlantic Canada were changed accordingly. The public and emergency officials in the expected landfall area were told to make preparations for a potential disaster, after the CHC bulletins indicated the possibility existed for significant wind damage and flooding from both heavy rain and storm surges, as well as power outages.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} dropped torrential rainfall {{over the}} Southeast United States, causing unprecedented devastation in the region. The storm {{was considered the}} worst to impact in the region in at least 29years. Precipitation peaked at 20.65in (525mm) in Idlewild, North Carolina. The heavy rainfall caused streams to greatly exceed their respective flood stages, damaging waterfront property. Many of the deaths occurred in North Carolina, where 30people died. Transportation was disrupted {{as a result of}} the debris scattered by the <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain.</b> In Caldwell County alone, 90percent of bridges were swept away. Overall, the storm caused 50fatalities and $13million in damages.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Tuesday 23 February, Gothenburg passed Cooktown {{at about}} 2:00pm. The <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> {{severely}} increased and cloud cover became so thick it blocked out the sun. Despite this, she continued the journey south into worsening weather, {{in a deep}} water passage between the North Queensland coastline and the Great Barrier Reef, known as the inner route. Although taking this route provided some protection from the open sea, captains had to navigate and thread {{their way through a}} number of then uncharted reefs. All passengers and crew expected to be in Newcastle on Sunday evening for a scheduled stopover.|$|E
5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people {{to lose their jobs}} in the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E

5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{primarily}} in Cornwall and the Upper Boat Studios in Wales. The {{exterior of the}} pirate ship was filmed at a dock in Cornwall, while the lower decks were built from a set at the studio. The principal challenge to film at the dock was to ensure the audience would not see it. The crew set up smoke machines to simulate fog. To create the storm the crew used <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> machines, the latter of which went through 15,000 litres of water. The loud noise from the wind machines caused communication difficulties during takes. Anticipating they would get soaked, the cast present on the deck wore dry suits underneath their clothes. Before filming began on the storm sequences, Darvill heard that he would perform the stunt where he is thrown into the sea, and was willing to perform it. The stunt would later be performed by a double.|$|E
5|$|In Fort Myers, {{property}} damage was slight, limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing shacks along the waterfront. Nearly all cigar factories in Tampa were closed after <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> drove too much moisture into the buildings. Offshore, the fishing smack Wallace A. McDonnell was beached near Piney Point, though {{all of the}} crew survived. Additionally, the Cuban schooner Isabel Alvado sank offshore Boca Grande. The crew, who were immigrants, were rescued by the Coast Guard and later deported. In Martin County, a bridge connecting Stuart and Palm City was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result. A temporary ferry service across the St. Lucie River was established and operated until repairs to the bridge were complete {{in the summer of}} 1929. In Fort Pierce, most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas. A warehouse, fish houses, docks, and a bridge across the Indian River were destroyed, while several other buildings were unroofed. Damage in the city totaled about $150,000.|$|E

5|$|The first area {{affected}} by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>rain</b> damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained {{an area of}} moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the Blue Ridge Mountains, {{a process known as}} orographic lift. Flooding affected roads and low-lying areas along the Potomac River. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the Poconos and along the Delaware River. Rushing waters demolished about 150road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30dams. The swollen Brodhead Creek virtually submerged a summer camp, killing 37people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101people and caused an estimated $70million in damage (1955USD). Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York.|$|E

In Carbonear a boy broke his leg after being blown into a car and thousands of dollars in damage, as well as broken polls, uprooted trees, interrupted telephone service, damaged chimneys and power outages were reported in St. John's, Canada. There were also reports of roof damage and a trailer being torn for its foundation. Three flights were cancelled, schools were closed and the ferry service between Bell Island and Portugal Cove was disrupted. On September 23 there were reports of boats that had been lost and in Harbour Grace and Harbour Main. There was also a report of a garage being flipped with a car still in it. There were also reports of a street and two mines being flooded in Corner Brook and it was reported that there was $2 million damage to the province. There was extensive damage to waterfront property on the southern coast of Newfoundland. On September 24 there were reports of fishermen losing gear, a house being blown off its foundation in Foxtrap, damage to the phone company, a washed out road in Swift Current and damage to the power company. On September 27 it was reported that buoys were destroyed in Harbour Grace, Fortune and Stag Harbour. There was also damage done to a freighter in Conception Bay.|$|E
