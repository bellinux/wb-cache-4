2500|$|A caisson lock {{was invented}} in the late 18th century as a {{solution}} to minimise the use of great volumes of water required to raise and lower canal boats through large height differences. [...] It was normal to only raise and lower boats through small height differences of a few feet when traversing undulating terrain. A solution was required when either large height differences were encountered or water was in short supply. The Caisson (or Caisoon) was thought to be one solution. [...] The technology of the time was not capable of achieving this type of construction economically with current building materials. [...] This design attempted was a type of canal lock in which a narrowboat is floated into a sealed <b>watertight</b> <b>box</b> and raised or lowered between two different canal water levels. It was designed primarily as a water-saving measure, and also was an attempt to minimise construction costs compared with other engineering solutions of the time. In use it was capable of replacing up to seven conventional locks. Other design benefits were speed of boat descent/ascent, and only a little loss of water when operating compared with a conventional boat lock.|$|E
2500|$|The trio {{of ships}} {{incorporated}} advanced safety precautions into their designs, intended {{to mitigate the}} risk of flooding and all but eliminate the chances of foundering. Each ship featured an inner skin, a second layer of [...] thick steel above the keel which created a <b>watertight</b> <b>box</b> {{along the bottom of}} the hull known as a [...] "double bottom." [...] 15 transverse steel bulkheads reaching [...] up to E Deck (D Deck {{in the case of the}} two forward most bulkheads) divided the hulls of each ship into 16 watertight compartments, each equipped with an electric pump to remove floodwater. The compartments could be sealed by automatic doors from the bridge in the event of a collision, preventing water from spreading to other parts of the ship. Olympic and Titanic were so designed that either could stay afloat with four compartments breached. The Olympic-class liners also eliminated converse bulkheads, such as those on Lusitania and Mauretania, which separated the coal bunkers along either side of the hull from the engine rooms and boiler rooms in the center. Such an arrangement was believed to increase the risk of a ship capsizing by trapping water lengthwise along the ship and increasing her list to one side.|$|E

Besides, messages travel farthest at night; and the operator wouldn't be seen crossing the sands. I don't know whether he could carry the necessary apparatus, but he might hide it in a <b>watertight</b> <b>box.</b> The candle {{will be out in}} a minute, so we can't look." ...|$|E
25|$|Four days later, on June 20, {{more human}} remains {{were found on}} the upper deck between the aft turret and the engine room. These {{included}} two forearms and a foot in a boot. All the remains were heavily charred. Additionally, workers were recovering {{a very large number of}} relics such as bayonets, binoculars, books, clothing, dishes, and papers (some of them in <b>watertight</b> <b>boxes,</b> and still dry). The water level was now down , and dropping.|$|R

Mudie's soon had outlets on Cross Street in Manchester and on New Street in Birmingham.London book deliveries were carried out by vans, {{and the expansion of}} railroads and trains allowed people to order books across the country. International orders were also issued and shipped abroad in tin boxes. Mudie's also exported books using <b>watertight</b> <b>boxes,</b> some of which were reported to have survived shipwreck.|$|R

60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he raised a}} plank of the deck {{in front of the}} {{foremost}} hole, and disclosed a sort of narrow box about six feet long by six inches broad. The plank was hinged at one end and fastened with a hook at the other so as to form a lid to the box. The hole thus disclosed was not an opening into the interior of the canoe, but was a veritable <b>watertight</b> <b>box</b> just under the deck, so that even if it were to get filled with water not a drop could enter the canoe itself. But the plank-lid was so beautifully fitted, besides shutting tightly down on india-rubber, that the chance of leakage through that source was very remote. Although very narrow, this box was deep, and contained a variety of useful implements; among them a slender mast and tiny sail, which could be rendered still smaller by means of reef-points. All these things were fitted into their respective places with so keen an eye to economy of space that the arrangement cannot be better described than by the familiar phrase--multum in parvo.|$|E

50|$|The AML-30 and AML-90 spawned amphibious models, which bore {{propellers}} and form-fitting, <b>watertight</b> <b>boxes</b> {{over their}} hulls. These were then inflated with polyurethane, allowing the armoured car to float. The polyurethane lining {{had the advantage}} of being self-extinguishing if ignited by flame, and of providing a detonation point for a hollow charge shell before it could reach the armour plate. Amphibious AMLs were propelled through the water at 7 km/h and were steered by their front wheels. The amphibious box increased the weight of the chassis by about ten percent.Individual armies have also retrofitted existing AMLs with new armament adopted from other armoured vehicles, such as the complete turret and 30mm RARDEN autocannon of the FV107 Scimitar light tank.|$|R

5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a <b>watertight</b> brass <b>box</b> {{which could be used}} to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver to dictate observations to someone on the surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|R
5000|$|In 1928, the Laurentian Forest Protective Association {{erected a}} steel tower (80 foot high for forest fire detection), built a {{telephone}} line along the railway and installed a free telephone at the sanatorium; the La Tuque Telephone company will supply phone {{service to the}} village in 1966. In 1930, the sanatorium had 115 patients; the body of deceased patients was returned to their family by train (in a <b>watertight</b> wooden <b>box</b> as per railway instructions). The sanatorium will {{have as many as}} one hundred employees and more than 225 patients. Up to 1933, the patients had to pay for their hospitalisation. In October 1943, a fire destroyed St-Helen's wing and the [...] "Center" [...] which were made of wood; the chapel, the dining room, the pharmacy and the kitchen were destroyed (photo circa 1940). Only the brick building of the sanatorium, the Couillard's wing, survived. The service buildings included: the infirmary, the [...] "ruche", the school, the laundry, the nun's villa and five houses for employees (of which the superintendent's house, closest to river Batiscan, is probably sir Turner's fishing camp). The farm buildings included a barn, sheds for the machinery and a green house located near the [...] "ruche" [...] with a vegetable garden. There was a six-door boat shed near the beach on the lake.|$|R
5000|$|Released in December 2010, the Traxxas Spartan {{is a new}} {{single drive}} Radio-controlled boat. The Spartan {{represents}} Traxxas' first all-new boat design in several years. Like the Villain series, it is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek [...] "deep V" [...] style hull. Unlike the Villain series, the Spartan is significantly longer (by 9.8 inches) and has a slightly wider beam (by 1.25 inches), which combine to give the Spartan a much sleeker overall profile. The Spartan also has an abundance of modern features which set it apart from earlier Traxxas boats. The most noticeable is Traxxas' new marine version of its Castle Powered Velineon brushless system, consisting of the new VXL-6s brushless ESC, and Velineon 540XL (1410 castle motor)brushless motor. Both the ESC and the motor are water-cooled, with the motor featuring a unique sealed composite water jacket that allows cooling water to directly contact the motor case, rather than the simple coiled metal tubing water jackets used on other Traxxas boats. The drive system is also {{a departure from the}} steerable outdrive system (the prop and rudder are one unit and are steered together) traditionally used on Traxxas boats. Instead, power on the Spartan is routed via direct drive (no reduction gears) to a single fixed surface piercing prop and steering is controlled by an aluminum rudder operated by a high torque waterproof servo. The Spartan is also uses Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system (a first on Traxxas boats) with a 5-channel receiver located inside a <b>watertight</b> <b>box.</b> Other notable features include stainless steel trim tabs and turn fins (which help improve stability and turning performance), Traxxas high current battery connectors, 12 gauge power wire, and stainless steel hex hardware. The claimed top speed is 30 mi/h kn with the included dual 8.4 volt NiMH batteries. However, the top speed rises to 50 mi/h kn with optional double 3S LiPo battery packs, which Traxxas claims as the fastest top speed for any RTR (ready to race) radio controlled boat.|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the mechanical properties of the snowpack is necessary for avalanche prediction, hydrology, and climate change studies. A penetrometer is being developed that will drive a pressure sensor on a 3 -meter rod into the snow for high resolution point measurements {{at a rate of}} 5 kHz. In addition to the sensor and driving rod, the device contains an embedded system that allows the user to control the drive motor, retrieve and store data from the sensor to a micro SD card, and interface retrieve time and position information from a GPS. This embedded system is enclosed in a <b>watertight</b> <b>box</b> for protection while still allowing for user interaction. The current version of the penetrometer’s embedded system cannot reliably control and record data from the motor and sensor. This embedded system is being redesigned and rebuilt with an emphasis on reliability, to ensure that the penetrometer can be used effectively. The new design will be a microcontroller-based solution developed on the widely available Arduino platform, equipped with an LCD screen to display system status and menu options. Initially the penetrometer will be a stand-alone device meant to be operated by hand; however, future uses may call for it to remain stationed in remote areas to take measurements from onboard the Geosciences Greenland Rover robot...|$|E
