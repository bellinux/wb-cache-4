500|$|In an {{interview}} with Locus, Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of [...] "Englishness" [...] into Jonathan Strange: [...] "I wanted to explore my ideas of the fantastic, {{as well as my}} ideas of England and my attachment to English landscape....Sometimes it feels to me as though we don't have a fable of England, of Britain, something strong and idealized and romantic. I <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> on things like Chesterton and Conan Doyle, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) of what it was to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place". In particular, [...] "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible {{about the rest of the}} world", which connects Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.|$|E
500|$|All {{seven of}} the {{transports}} were hit and most were burning or sinking about [...] south east of Finschhafen, along with the destroyers Shirayuki, Tokitsukaze and Arashio. Four of the destroyers – Shikinami, Yukikaze, Uranami and Asagumo – picked up as many survivors as possible and then retired to Rabaul, accompanied by the destroyer , which had come from Rabaul to assist. That night, a force of ten U.S. Navy PT boats – {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Commander Barry Atkins – set out to attack the convoy. Two boats struck submerged debris and were forced to return. The other eight arrived off Lae {{in the early hours of}} 4 March. Atkins spotted a fire that turned out to be the transport Oigawa Maru. PT-143 and PT-150 fired torpedoes at it, sinking the crippled vessel. In the morning, a fourth destroyer – Asashio – was sunk when a B-17 hit her with a [...] bomb while she <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> survivors from Arashio.|$|E
500|$|The {{exact number}} {{killed in the}} {{takeover}} is unknown. Several sources put the figure anywhere between several dozen and a thousand. According to the ICTY, at least 48 civilians were killed of which 45 were non-Serbs. Around 3 April, a local policeman was ordered to guard a hearse which <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> bodies from the streets and houses of the town. The killings were eliticidal {{with the aim of}} erasing cultural history and included [...] "political leaders, businessmen, and other prominent Bosniaks", but also included women and children. A number of Serbs who had attempted to stop the massacre were also killed. An investigation by the ICTY later stated that the victims had been shot [...] "in the chest, mouth, temple, or back of the head, some at close range" [...] and that none had been wearing military uniforms. According to the historian Professor Eric D. Weitz of the City College of New York, the killing of Bosniaks in Bijeljina was a genocidal act. The acts against civilians in Bijeljina and those carried out by the JNA and special forces that followed were an attempt to intimidate and sidetrack the Bosnian government and general public from pursuing independence.|$|E

500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{his defeat}} in New Hampshire, Lieberman {{declared}} that his campaign <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> [...] "Joementum"; however, {{he failed to}} provide such momentum during the New Hampshire primary debates, held at Saint Anselm College days before the primary. On February 3, 2004, Lieberman withdrew his candidacy after failing to win any of the five primaries or two caucuses held that day. He acknowledged to the Hartford Courant that {{his support for the}} war in Iraq was a large part of his undoing with voters.|$|E
2500|$|The 2004 presidential {{campaign}} of Joe Lieberman, the long-time Class 1 United States Senator from Connecticut and the [...] vice-presidential nominee under Al Gore {{in the previous}} election, began on January 13, 2003, when he announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination as a candidate in the 2004 presidential election. Describing his Presidential hopes, Lieberman opined that his historically hawkish stance would appeal to voters. Prior to his defeat in New Hampshire, Lieberman famously declared his campaign <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> [...] "Joementum". On February 3, 2004, Lieberman withdrew his candidacy after failing to win any of the five primaries or two caucuses held that day.

2500|$|At midnight between July 12 and 13, Obrenović set {{out with}} some units north of Liplje to {{organize}} an ambush of forward components of 28th Division. [...] The ambush was laid, but no ARBiH units arrived. [...] Leaving some troops at Snagovo, Obrenović and the rest returned to Zvornik. When he arrived at brigade headquarters, he was informed that the column had been stopped on the road from Kravica, Konjević Polje, to Milici, {{and that there were}} no troops in their area. [...] Shortly thereafter he received word from intercept groups that chatter <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> in the area stretching from Cerska toward Kamenica, despite Drina Corps' reassurance that there was no troop presence there. 28th Division radio intercepts showed that their security slipped up and the Serbs were able to learn that their numbers were 1,000-1,500 in that area. Later on July 13 Obrenović strengthened the units that had stayed up there providing the ambush, and he decided to organise a provisional unit, grouping squad and platoon from the units at his disposal: 15 soldiers from the engineers company, five or six soldiers from the staff command, and about 15 to 20 soldiers from the logistics battalion, a remaining platoon from the 5th Battalion, and an intervention platoon; this formed a unit with the strength of a company.|$|E
2500|$|Ferguson had emptied two 15-round {{magazines}} {{during the}} shooting. While he was reloading his third magazine, somebody yelled, [...] "Grab him!" [...] Three passengers – Michael O'Connor, Kevin Blum, and Mark McEntee – tackled Ferguson and pinned him {{to one of}} the train's seats. Several other passengers ran forward to grab his arms and legs and help hold him pinned across a three-seat row with his head towards the window and legs towards the aisle. While he was pinned, Ferguson said, [...] "Oh God, what did I do? What did I do? I deserve whatever I get." [...] He also repeatedly pleaded with those holding him, [...] "Don't shoot me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry." [...] Five to six people continued to hold him pinned for some time while they awaited relief. While those who had not tackled him, but were holding him down, inquired as to the location of the gun, they were assured that it had been kicked away and that there had only been one gunman. Most, if not all passengers still in the car were concerned that no further violence take place and that the shooter be held rather than attacked. He was held down for several minutes. Soon, Andrew Roderick, an off-duty Long Island Rail Road police officer who <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> his wife from the train, boarded the train car and handcuffed Ferguson.|$|E
2500|$|Mirror neurons are neurons {{that fire}} both when an animal acts {{and when the}} animal observes the same action {{performed}} by another. Thus, the neuron [...] "mirrors" [...] {{the behavior of the}} other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate and other species including birds. The function of the mirror system is a subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for the perception action coupling (see the common coding theory). They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some researchers also speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to theory of mind skills, while others relate mirror neurons to language abilities. Neuroscientists such as Marco Iacoboni (UCLA) have argued that mirror neuron systems in the human brain help us understand the actions and intentions of other people. In a study published in March 2005 Iacoboni and his colleagues reported that mirror neurons could discern if another person who <b>was</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> a cup of tea planned to drink from it or clear it from the table. In addition, Iacoboni {{and a number of other}} researchers have argued that mirror neurons are the neural basis of the human capacity for emotions such as empathy. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of self-awareness.|$|E
