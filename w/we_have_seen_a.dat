No sightings, double knocks or calls, no replies to our many double-knock imitations. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> few {{cavities}} of the appropriate size and shape for ivory-bills, but these can be old, or exceptionally large pileated woodpecker cavities, or mammal-enlarged pileated woodpecker cavities.… Given the results, it is unlikely a population of any meaningful size of ivory-billed woodpeckers exists in south Florida.|$|E
500|$|Bardulf {{was known}} for his legal expertise, which led to him being one of the few justices {{mentioned}} by name in Glanvill, an early medieval English legal text, although whether by the original author or by a glossator, is unclear. His long career as a justice helped create a sense of continuity in judicial matters through the reigns of the Angevin kings. He remained on such good terms with Hubert Walter, that when Walter was appointed chancellor at the beginning of John's reign, Bardulf made a comment to the new chancellor that included a pointed barb about the last Archbishop of Canterbury to also be chancellor, Thomas Becket. Bardulf was on good enough terms {{that he was able to}} tease Walter that [...] "We have never heard nor seen an archbishop become a chancellor, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> chancellor become an archbishop." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert added Ugetsu to his Great Movies list in 2004, {{calling it}} [...] "one of the {{greatest}} of all films", and said that [...] "At the end of Ugetsu, aware <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> fable, we also feel curiously as if we have witnessed true lives and fates". Director Martin Scorsese has also listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In 5001 Nights at the Movies, film critic Pauline Kael found it to be [...] "subtle, violent yet magical", and termed Ugetsu as [...] "one of the most amazing of the Japanese movies that played American art houses". [...] In 2000, The Village Voice newspaper ranked Ugetsu 29th on their list of the 100 best films of the 20th century. Ugetsu has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's critical consensus stating, [...] "With its thought-provoking themes, rich atmosphere, and brilliant direction, Kenji Mizoguchi's [...] is a towering classic of world cinema".|$|E

He was branded [...] "Leeds' dumbest criminal" [...] by councillor Les Carter, who added: [...] "In the last three years, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> 32 per cent reduction in crime in Leeds.
