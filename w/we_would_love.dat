2500|$|After {{four years}} on the air, the series was {{canceled}} by Fox. In a situation similar to the animated Family Guy, however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Adult Swim brought Futurama back to life.

When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films— (2007), [...] (2008), [...] (2008) and [...] (2009)—would be produced.
