5|$|After the trial, Boone {{returned}} to North Carolina {{to bring his}} family back to Kentucky. In the autumn of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including (according to tradition) the family of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone's Station. He began earning money at this time by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so settlers needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash from various settlers and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> a tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the settlers forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E

At Fort Gage, the Virginians {{captured}} Rocheblave, who <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> his bed when the Americans {{burst into the}} lightly guarded fort. The next morning, Clark worked to secure the allegiance of the townspeople, a task made easier because Clark brought news of the Franco-American alliance. Residents were asked to take oath of loyalty to Virginia and the United States. Father Pierre Gibault, the village priest, was won over after Clark assured him that the Catholic Church would be protected under the laws of Virginia. Rocheblave and several others deemed hostile to the Americans were kept as prisoners and later sent to Virginia.|$|E

25|$|As Helmsman Cho sharply {{turned the}} wheel from 135 to 150 degrees, Sewol began to list to port and tilt towards the water. The overall effect {{was that the}} ship turned about 45 degrees to the right, then rotated 22 degrees on the spot for a span of 20 seconds. The cargo falling {{to one side of}} the ship caused Sewol to lose all her {{restoring}} force and allowed water to flow into the ship through the side door of the cargo loading bay and the car entrance located at the stern. This scenario was confirmed by simulations separately run by the expert advisory panel on the joint investigation team, the Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, and the Advanced Marine Engineering Center of Seoul National University. The chief engineer testified that the tilting lasted for about two to three minutes after the initial tilt. During this time, Oh Yong-seok, an off-duty helmsman who <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> his cabin, was awakened when he was thrown against its port side. As of 8:50a.m., Sewol was leaning 30 degrees to port.|$|E

[...] During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> my room like one dead... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me... spoke animatedly, with pauses, ... work out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1890, the Bridegrooms {{had moved}} to the National League. Burns, now 26, led the league in home runs (13) and RBI (128). He hit for the cycle on August 1, 1890—becoming the first Bridegroom to do so. The team won the National League pennant, and faced the Louisville Colonels in the 1890 World Series. The series ended in a 3–3–1 tie: bad weather led to the {{cancellation}} of more games. After the 1891 season, Burns's 1892 RBI total was third in the league, and his hits, doubles, triples, and batting average marks were the second highest on the Brooklyn team, now named the Grooms. In 1893, between games of a doubleheader, a teammate of Burns, Tom Daly, <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> center field when Burns stabbed Daly with a penknife. Daly awoke and turned on the knife, leading to a severed tendon which kept Daly out for two weeks. Burns' 1894 batting average (.355) was the highest of his career; his hit and run totals were also the second highest in his career. Burns continued to play for the club until 1895, when he played for the New York Giants. In his final MLB year, Burns batted a combined [...]258 over 25 games.|$|E

LZ 85 continued southward to Northampton which she reached at 10.45pm, drpping 22 bombs, including 9 firebombs, over Kingsthorpe, Dallington, Far Cotton and St. James End districts. The fifth bomb that was dropped passed through the roof of 46 Parkwood Street, just west of the train station, killing Mrs Eliza Gammons instantly while she <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> her bedroom.

2500|$|In the Apuseni {{region of}} Transylvania, {{the most active}} group was led by Leon Șușman. The group mainly hid {{in the woods and}} {{acquired}} part of its armament from a Iron Guard band that the Germans parachuted in the area in 1944-45. To eliminate this resistance group, the Securitate used informers against them and intercepted the correspondence of family members. An armed group called [...] "The National Defense Front-The Haduc Corps" [...] was headed by a former officer of the Royal Army who participated in the war against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, Major Nicolae Dabija. Resistants from this group robbed the Tax Office in Teiuș, armed with a rifle and handguns. The Securitate learned about the location of this group after an arrested resistant revealed their location on Muntele Mare and about their strength. An operation conducted by the Securitate forces decided to attack the rebels on the morning of March 4, 1949. Securitate forces led by Colonel Mihai Patriciu charged the peak where the rebels were located, with a gunfight and later hand-to-hand combat occurring. The Securitate suffered three deaths and three others wounded. Dabija was arrested on March 22, 1949 after a local villager, whose barn he <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in,</b> notified the authorities of his presence. On October 28, 1949, seven members of the group, including Major Nicolae Dabija, were executed in Sibiu.|$|E

[...] Captain Sawyer was found clinging to a life preserver that he never had time to put on. [...] Second mate Lehnt [...] was found clinging to the bottom of a capsized lifeboat. [...] Watchman Jacobson fought his way back to the surface after being dragged down with the ship and swam for about 20 minutes until the King’s lifeboat picked him up. [...] Boatswain Walter Richter <b>was</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>in</b> his bunk wearing only long underwear when alarm bells sounded. [...] When he raced to the deck, the explosion blew him overboard, blowing off his underwear. [...] The steamer J.J. Turner picked him up clinging to a hatch cover that he rode as a raft. Crewmembers on the Turner reported that wooden ports in the interior of the ship had been blown through her steel sides. [...] Most of the crewmembers were likely blown to pieces by the boiler explosion or were trapped in the suction of the powerful whirlpool when the Superior City sank.

The news filled them with a sense of ecstasy and excitement. The team was flown to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, in March 1984, and from there the team moved onwards. Recalling her first glimpse of the Mount Everest, Bachendri once reminisced: [...] "We the hill people have always worshiped the mountains…my overpowering emotion at this awe-inspiring spectacle was, therefore, devotional". The team commenced its ascent in May 1984. Her team almost met disaster when an avalanche buried its camp, and more than half the group abandoned the ascent because of injury or fatigue. Bachendri Pal and the remainder of the team pressed on to reach the summit.
