5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that phosphorus, used as a fertilizer in the EAA, <b>was</b> <b>flushed</b> into canals and pumped back into the lake. When the lake drained, the phosphorus entered {{the water in the}} marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of the}} food chain.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} the native {{vegetation}} throughout the catchment to accommodate the increasing demand for farmland {{has contributed to the}} silting-up of the river with loose soils from eroded farmland, although most of the silting is due to the construction of the many hydrodams. In its pre-1930s wild state, the silt <b>was</b> <b>flushed</b> from the river every winter by flood surges. The remnants of these {{can be seen in the}} silt channels carved out of what is now St Andrews golf course, adjacent to the river in Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|Work {{began on}} 30 July 1792. The River Leen {{ran along the}} {{southern}} edge of the city between Lenton in the west and Leen Bridge, a series of flood arches to the east. The river bed was enlarged to form the canal, while the river was diverted into a new covered channel further to the north. The flood arches were replaced by a new bridge, and the canal turned sharply to the south, to join the Trent. The proprietors wanted a basin where the canal joined the river, with a lock above that, but Jessop argued that such an arrangement would lead to the entrance becoming blocked with sand. Building the lock close to the river would ensure that the sand <b>was</b> <b>flushed</b> away whenever the lock was emptied. The town section was officially opened on 30 July 1793, giving access to wharves, although there was still much work to be completed. To the east of Leen Bridge, a weir was constructed, to feed water into the Brewery Arm, an enlargement of the river channel. At its far end, another weir overflowed back into the new course of the Leen. A second arm, the Poplar Arm, was made using water channels on Eastcroft Meadow, and joined the Brewery Arm.|$|E

500|$|The European {{nightjar}} is crepuscular and nocturnal. During the day {{it rests}} on the ground, often in a partly shaded location, or perches motionless lengthwise along an open branch or a similar low perch. The cryptic plumage {{makes it difficult to}} see in the daytime, and birds on the ground, if they are not already in shade, will turn occasionally to face the sun thereby minimising their shadow. If it feels threatened, the nightjar flattens itself to the ground with eyes almost closed, flying only when the intruder is [...] away. It may call or wing clap as it goes, and land as far as [...] from where it <b>was</b> <b>flushed.</b> In the wintering area it often roosts on the ground but also uses tree branches up to [...] high. Roost sites at both the breeding and wintering grounds are used regularly if they are undisturbed, sometimes for weeks at a time.|$|E

A massive traffic jam on Route 1 {{prevented}} half of the fans from getting in until halftime. [...] Once the stadium was fully occupied, the water pressure proved inadequate. [...] The Massachusetts Board of Health threatened to close the stadium unless the problem was fixed. [...] The team then built water tanks to boost pressure.

2500|$|By the 1880s, the {{free-standing}} {{water closet}} was sold and quickly gained popularity; the free-standing water closet {{was able to}} be cleaned more easily and was therefore a more hygienic water closet. Twyford's [...] "Unitas" [...] model was free standing and made completely of earthenware. Throughout the 1880s he submitted further patents for improvements to the flushing rim and the outlet. Finally in 1888, he applied for a patent protection for his [...] "after flush" [...] chamber; the device allowed for the basin to be refilled by a lower quantity of clean water in reserve after the water closet <b>was</b> <b>flushed.</b> The modern pedestal [...] "flush-down" [...] toilet was demonstrated by Frederick Humpherson of the Beaufort Works, Chelsea, England in 1885.|$|E
2500|$|Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari {{as well as}} tafsir {{have given}} an oral {{depiction}} of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when {{he is supposed to}} have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that [...] "Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion". Others say his face <b>was</b> <b>flushed</b> as if he just had a bath ("a reddish man with many freckles on his face {{as if he had just}} come from a bath"). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as [...] "a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary". However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet [...] "did not say that Jesus was of red complexion", rather he was [...] "a man of brown complexion and lank hair". In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of [...] "moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout most of {{the history}} of New York City, and New Amsterdam before it, the East River has been the {{receptacle}} for the city's garbage and sewage. [...] "Night men" [...] who collected [...] "night soil" [...] from outdoor privies would dump their loads into the river, and even after the construction of the Croton Aqueduct (1842) and then the New Croton Aqueduct (1890) gave rise to indoor plumbing, the waste that <b>was</b> <b>flushed</b> away into the sewers, where it mixed with ground run off, ran directly into the river, untreated. [...] The sewers terminated at the slips where ships docked, until the waste began to build up, preventing dockage, after which the outfalls were moved {{to the end of the}} piers. [...] The [...] "landfill" [...] which created new land along the shoreline when the river was [...] "wharfed out" [...] by the sale of [...] "water lots" [...] was largely garbage such as bones, offal, and even whole dead animals, along with excrement [...] human and animal. [...] The result was that by the 1850s, if not before, the East River, like the other waterways around the city, was undergoing the process of eutrophication where the increase in nitrogen from excrement and other sources lead to a decrease in free oxygen, which in turn lead to an increase in phytoplankton such as algae and a decrease in other life forms, breaking the area's established food chain. The East River became very polluted, and its animal life decreased drastically.|$|E
