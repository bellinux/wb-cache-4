40|$|Background: Sulfur mustard (SM) is an alkylating {{chemical}} warfare agent that was widely used during Iran-Iraq war between 1983 and 1988. SM exposure leads to various late complications. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the late cardiovascular effects of SM in war-disabled Iranian victims. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort case control study on 50 patients with symptoms of SM exposure and 50 cases who had been in Iran-Iraq war, without chemical injury. We performed exercise stress test and echocardiography for all of patients. Results: The study group comprised 100 males of mean age 45. 6 &# 177; 6. 2 years. In chemical war injury group, two patients (4 &#x 0025;) had positive exercise stress test. On coronary angiography, they were found to have coronary artery disease. One patient had severe mitral regurgitation and normal coronary angiography; he was referred for mitral valve replacement. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic abnormality was detected in 23 &#x 0025; of these subjects. In another group, 5 &#x 0025; had LV diastolic abnormality (P = 0. 02) and all of them had normal stress test. Conclusions: Cardiovascular abnormalities are another late complication in chemical <b>war</b> <b>disabled</b> Iranian victims. Diastolic dysfunction was the most common abnormality in both groups of patients...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2013. Major: English. Advisor: Siobhan S. Craig. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 221 pages. This dissertation examines disability's presence in World War II-era literature and {{film in the}} context of broader cultural anxieties regarding masculinity and the place of the American man at midcentury. Because disability disrupts understandings of the body and sexuality in both military settings and society at large even today, this dissertation sheds light on contemporary debates surrounding disabled veterans, connecting these issues to a broad crisis of American masculinity that emerged following the Second World War. While scholars in disability studies have often read disability in literature and film primarily as a problematic signifier for otherness, and psychoanalytic film critics have seen disability more broadly as a representation of lack itself, this dissertation argues that neither of these positions fully accounts for the role disability assumes in literary and cinematic texts produced in the United States following World War II. In particular, this work deals with texts depicting a sudden onset of disability {{and its impact on the}} sense of self for person whose identity was, at least in part, predicated on the possession of an `able' body, These texts demonstrate how an unexpected injury transforms a subject's body from `able' to `disabled' and, as such, shifts the individual's subject position from within the gendering matrix to one that exists outside that matrix, making visible the structures enabling our shared notions of heteronormative masculinity. Returning home from <b>war,</b> <b>disabled</b> American GIs learned to live with broken bodies presenting a constant reminder of the lasting impact of wartime violence otherwise absent in America's pristine postwar landscape; these men faced particularly pronounced difficulties reintegrating into postwar American society, due largely to the destabilizing effect of physical disability on traditional, heteronormative notions of masculinity. Film and literary representations of disabled veterans [...] which stage a sudden loss of masculinity in a subject that once epitomized maleness through his physicality [...] demonstrate the fragile nature of all masculinities in the postwar era...|$|E
40|$|The Great War was {{unprecedented}} both in its devastation and in {{the significance}} people attached to it, which this dissertation contends led to a crisis of representation that manifested in literary tropes and discourses of sterility. Some authors used sterility to represent the war as a cultural and historical apocalypse, others {{as a basis for}} questioning how literature, Western civilization, and humanity itself could continue after such a catastrophe. "Static Chaos" theorizes how thematic renderings of sterility work alongside modernist formal experimentation to sever reproductive literary traditions. The widespread instances of sterility reveal the deep effects of the war on non-combatants as well as combatants, as demonstrated through analysis of novels by a diverse group of authors from Britain and United States [...] Rebecca West, Willa Cather, Ernest Hemingway, Claude McKay, and Ford Madox Ford. The study moves chronologically yet it also follows a narrative logic of thwarted human sexual experience beginning with novels focused upon problematic virginity, then those depicting the inability or unwillingness to procreate, and then one preoccupied with pregnancy overshadowed by illegitimacy and stillbirth. This dissertation draws upon trauma theory and grief and mourning theory, which reveal how, in addition to individual experiences of psychological trauma, the <b>war</b> <b>disabled</b> traditional means of coping, leading to a widespread inability to mourn that was traumatizing in itself. I name this state "traumatic grief" and argue that its pervasiveness led authors to break with a longstanding interconnection between making war and making babies. "Static Chaos" also expands theories that diagnose narrative's mimetic relationship to human sexual intercourse and sexuality, particularly those of Judith Roof and Lee Edelman who assert narrative's heterosexuality based on its traditional logic of continuation. I argue that post-war formal experimentation in modernist literature renders narrative metaphorically sterile by disrupting reproductive traditions and conventions. These formal components include generic manipulation, representations of inversion and paradox, ambiguous or inconclusive endings, and parodic or circular plot structures. Together with themes of sterility, these formal elements work to depict the post-war world as fixed in a barren wasteland, trapped in static chaos...|$|E
