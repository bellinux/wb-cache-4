40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Under {{the auspices}} of a United Stated Department of Education National Workplace Literacy Program grant, the Columbia-Willamette Skill Builders, a {{community}} college consortium, developed a prototype <b>workplace</b> educator <b>training</b> program in 1994. The Skill Builders <b>workplace</b> educator <b>training</b> program was 9 months long and offered 90 hours of instruction, including a 20 to 40 hour workplace field experience. Twenty-six people completed the prototype program. This investigative study posed two research questions: 1. What can we learn by identifying and evaluating the critical elements in a prototype <b>workplace</b> educator <b>training</b> program? 2. What can be gleaned through this investigation that can be utilized to design a <b>workplace</b> educator <b>training</b> program? <b>Workplace</b> educator is a new term emerging {{from the field of}} workplace literacy. A workplace educator facilitates basic learning involving language and computation, as well as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and decision-making. An examination of the pertinent literature identified five fields that impact on workplace education: <b>workplace</b> basics; <b>training</b> and development; <b>workplace</b> literacy and the contextual teaching approaches; current management theory with an emphasis on the high performance work organization; and workplace learning. The critical elements involved in the prototype program were identified through extensive inquiry using questionnaires, survey evaluation instruments, personal interviews, reports, journal review of the participants, and a focus group of Portland, Oregon, area employer representatives managing workplace education. The identified critical elements include an understanding of: (a) education in the workplace; (b) the characteristics of workplace educators; (c) workplace culture and organizational practices; (d) business/ education relationships; (e) the educational environment; (f) needs assessment/evaluation and assessment procedures; (g) workplace program design; (h) how to facilitate learning; (i) the development of communication skills for the workplace educator; (j) culture, class, and gender diversity in the workplace; and (k) appropriate uses of instructional technology. In addition, the data were examined through an evaluation research framework using the Stufflebeam (1983) CIPP (context, input, process, and products) model. The analysis showed that the program was highly satisfactory to the participants. The most important finding in this study is the need for workplace educators to fully understand the workplace...|$|R

40|$|The work of {{internal}} verifiers (IVs) {{is integral to}} ensuring that the operation of vocational qualifications meets the local needs of learners and employers, while also maintaining reliable quality nationally and throughout occupational sectors. Arguably, though, the role of IVs {{in the management of}} vocational learning often remains narrowly defined and under-utilised. This article examines the benefits accruing to organizations when their employees act as IVs, as well as the benefits accruing to those who undertake the role. Drawing principally upon interview data, the article describes and classifies prevalent variations of the IV's role within <b>workplaces,</b> <b>training</b> providers and colleges. It identifies six key areas of impact in which the benefits derived from the work of IVs can be measured. The article concludes by suggesting a minimum framework necessary for IVs to impact effectively upon quality assurance, and for IVs themselves to feel professionally supported and developed...|$|R
