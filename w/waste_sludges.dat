40|$|The {{purpose of}} work was to {{establish}} the concept of integrated treatment of <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> and biodegradable wastes in Gorenjska region, which should be accordant with legislation and economicaly feasible. Adequate EU and RS strategies, legislation and well-known good practises (IPPC directive/BAT/BREF) were studied. Alternative contemporary proceedings for <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> and biodegradable wastes treatment were checked and compared by SWOT analysis. An examination of actual treatment with such kind of wastes was carried out for Gorenjska region. Three different options of contemporary biodegradable wastes and <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> treatment were experimentally checked. Findings were corroborated with physical – chemical – biological analyses of entry materials and final products and also with characteristics and products applicability of single option. An economic seight was studied for single option, too. In view of received data the most appropriate method for integrated treatment of <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> and biodegradable wastes in Gorenjska region was proposed; namely anaerobic digestion with biogas production, followed by composting of the residue. Entry quantities of <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> and biodegradable wastes were anticipated; also size and site of the Centre for integrated treatment of <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> and biodegradable wastes of Gorenjska region were suggested. In the centre considerable quantities of biogas can be produced and utilised for electricity and heat cogeneration. The coproduction was estimated of about 260 kW electricity power and 375 kW heat power. Composting of the digested sludge takes place in special unit out of the centre.

It was done by determining the effect of ultrasonic power, extraction time and types of solvent used into the samples. The treatment of <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> using Hexane, Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a medium solvent was conducted using ultrasonic bath (maximum power is 240 W) at a different number of power scales, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9. The effects of treatment duration have been tested at different times which are 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 minutes. The types of solvent have been analyzed between the effect of Sodium chloride (NaCl) and Potassium hydroxide (KOH).

A decrease {{in the amount of}} <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> would be both environmentally and economically attractive. Aquatic worms can be used {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>waste</b> <b>sludge.</b> After predation by the worms, the amount of final sludge is lower. Additionally it has a distinctive granular structure with improved dewaterability characteristics. If a useful application can be found for the worms that are produced in the predation process, then a valuable product would be obtained from a waste material. Aquatic worms can be used for improved processing of <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> and recovery of resources. The <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> is produced in biological {{waste water treatment}}. In the Netherlands, this sludge is mostly thickened, dried and incinerated. These are costly operations in which only some energy is recovered.

In a new reactor concept the worms are placed in a mesh, thereby retaining them in the reactor and allowing for separate collection of the compact worm faeces. The latter results in much more efficient processing of the remaining solids, i. e. the worm faeces.
