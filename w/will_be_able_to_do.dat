500|$|In September 1926, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Wynter gave {{a lecture}} to the United Services Institute of Victoria {{entitled}} [...] "The Strategical Inter-relationship of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force: an Australian View", {{which was published}} in the April 1927 edition of British Army Quarterly. In this article Wynter argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe, which would prevent Britain from sending sufficient resources to Singapore. He contended that Singapore was vulnerable, especially to attack from the land and the air, and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN. [...] "Henceforward", wrote Australian official historian Lionel Wigmore, [...] "the attitude of the leading thinkers in the Australian Army towards British assurances that an adequate fleet would be sent to Singapore at the critical time was (bluntly stated): 'We do not doubt that you are sincere in your beliefs but, frankly, we do not think you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.|$|E

She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E

The soundtrack, which features the single, {{went on to become}} Cyrus' fourth entry to top the Billboard 200; this made her, at sixteen, the youngest performer in history to have four number one albums on the chart. She released her fourth soundtrack as [...] "Hannah Montana" [...] in July 2009, which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. Cyrus later launched her first fashion line, Miley Cyrus and Max Azria, through Walmart. It was promoted by the release of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] (2009) and the EP The Time of Our Lives (2009). Cyrus said the album was [...] "a transitioning album [...] really to introduce people to what I want my next record to sound like and with time I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that a little more". [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] went on to become one of Cyrus' most successful singles to date, and is considered one of her signature songs. She next embarked on her first world tour, the Wonder World Tour (2009), which was a critical and commercial success. On December 7, 2009, Cyrus performed for Queen Elizabeth II {{and other members of the}} British Royal Family at the Royal Variety Performance in Blackpool, Lancashire.|$|E

500|$|Lindstrom {{explained}} that they integrated the elements of climbing, shooting and puzzle solving. This instalment also features a new melee combat system, requiring Lara in some instances to use [...] "direct combat and evasive manoeuvres to distance herself from her attacker". Notably, Lara's bike, among other things, is a key component in solving the puzzles she will encounter in her adventure. Pick-ups have multiple uses as weapons and tools in interaction with the environment, and Lindstrom stated that Lara [...] "can also split up her guns and fire at two different targets simultaneously," [...] or hold an item {{with one hand and}} fire a gun with the other. The grappling hook can be stretched taut and used to pull objects off ledges, illustrating what project lead Rob Pavey said, that [...] "Lara <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything that you'd expect her to be able to do," [...] which he called [...] "the big theme this year." [...] Lindstrom describes this as [...] "a philosophy called 'What Could Lara Do?'—WCLD. It's short-hand for having the player be able to use their own intuition about what someone with her abilities {{should be able to do}} in an environment such as this, and consistency across the different mechanics and abilities. If she can throw a grenade, then if she can pick up this pole, why can't she throw it?" [...] Crystal Dynamics also made the game non-linear, offering elaborate multi-stage puzzles.|$|E

2500|$|The {{upper end}} {{is related to}} the {{stringent}} requirements of choosing keys used in encryption. [...] In 1999, an Electronic Frontier Foundation project broke 56-bit DES encryption in less than a day using specially designed hardware. In 2002, distributed.net cracked a 64-bit key in 4 years, 9 months, and 23 days. As of October 12, 2011, distributed.net estimates that cracking a 72-bit key using current hardware will take about 45,579 days or 124.8 years. Due to currently understood limitations from fundamental physics, there is no expectation that any digital computer (or combination) will be capable of breaking 256-bit encryption via a brute-force attack. Whether or not quantum computers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in practice is still unknown, though theoretical analysis suggests such possibilities.|$|E
