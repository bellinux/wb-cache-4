5|$|In May 2012, over thirty-three {{vehicles}} were {{donated by the}} U.S. government to the SNA. The vehicles include 16 Magirus Trucks, 4 Hilux Pickups, 6 Land Cruiser Pickups, 1 <b>Water</b> <b>Tanker,</b> and 6 Water Trailers. On 9 April 2013, the U.S. government approved the provision of defense articles and services by the American authorities to the Somali Federal Government. It handed over 15 vehicles to the new Commandos in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Two {{submarine}} tenders were {{operated by}} the KJRM, one was converted from a German-built <b>water</b> <b>tanker</b> obtained from the Austro-Hungarians, {{and the other was}} a British commercial vessel converted to the role at the time British-built submarines were acquired. The latter ship was captured by the Italians in April 1941 but survived the war to see service in the post-war Yugoslav Navy.|$|E
25|$|Residents that do {{not receive}} enough water in summer are forced to buy <b>water</b> from <b>water</b> <b>tankers.</b> This <b>water</b> is very {{expensive}} compared to subsidized tap water. The quality of the <b>tanker</b> <b>water</b> is dubious, since it is drawn from wells that tap aquifers that may be polluted. Furthermore, {{there is a risk}} of contamination in the <b>water</b> <b>tankers</b> and in roof tanks.|$|R

5|$|Renown briefly {{served as}} a tender to HMS Victory in October before her refit was {{completed}} in November. During the Coronation Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911 for King George V, the ship {{was used as an}} accommodation ship. She was slightly damaged when <b>water</b> <b>tanker</b> Aid rammed her on 26 November 1911. Renown was offered for sale on 31 January 1913 and partially dismantled. In December 1913, she was moored at the Motherbank, awaiting disposal. On 1 April 1914 she was sold at auction to Hughes Bolckow for scrap at a price of £39,000. She was broken up at Blyth.|$|E
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a <b>water</b> <b>tanker</b> was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E
25|$|Water tariffs in Peru are {{somewhat}} {{low compared to}} other Latin American countries and water bills are often not paid. As a result, according to an estimate, 95% of the country's urban service providers can be considered bankrupt. In many urban areas {{it is common to}} spend significant sums to <b>water</b> <b>tanker</b> operators, which are prevalent because of intermittent supply and deficient coverage. In rural areas, tariffs are even lower than the already low tariffs in urban areas, making it impossible to properly maintain water systems.|$|E

The company donated $50,000 to the American Red Cross and launched a check stand campaign benefitting the organization to get the community involved in the relief effort. The company said in a news release 100 percent of the donations from the campaign will support the American Red Cross’s disaster relief efforts. H-E-B also activated its emergency response units, sending the H-E-B Eddie Garcia Mobile Kitchen and <b>water</b> <b>tanker</b> to West, including donations of meals and water to the victims and first responders.|$|E
25|$|To {{mitigate}} {{this lack}} of low-level radar coverage, the Air Force also operates four Plessey Tactical Mobile Radar (TMR) systems (in service with 142 Squadron SAAF). These systems can cover altitudes below 700metres, {{but they have a}} shorter range than the Umlindi systems, at 150km. The deployment of these systems require the use of a MAN 8×8 truck (one per system), one or two light vehicles for command and control purposes, a <b>water</b> <b>tanker,</b> a diesel bowser and a technical workshop vehicle. These systems can operate 24 hours a day with less than 20 personnel (including personnel from other AFMDW units like the Mobile Communications Unit and 501 Squadron).|$|E
25|$|Prices {{for water}} sold by tanker trucks. A cubic meter of water {{supplied}} by a <b>water</b> <b>tanker</b> may {{cost as much}} as 6 Riyals (US$1.50), or about 20 times more than water supplied through the network. Citizens who are not connected to the piped network, who are often poor, pay up to 40 times more for water than connected households. The monthly water bill is about 1 Riyal (US$0.27), compared to an average mobile phone bill of 200 Riyals. The price of a 19 cubic meter tank is 150 SR, and the price of a 30 cubic meter tank is 180 SR. Although price may change during holidays and peak seasons, and not all cities are the same.|$|E

[...] Major mafias active in the city included land mafia, <b>water</b> <b>tanker</b> mafia, transport mafia and a sand and gravel mafia. Karachi's highest death rates occurred in the mid 1990s when Karachi was much smaller. In 1995, 1,742 killings were recorded, when the city had an estimated 6 to 14 million less residents.|$|E

She joined the trawlers [...] and [...] and the Royal Canadian Navy corvette [...] to form Escort Group 138 for the operation. In early June 1944, the group moved to Milford Haven, Wales, to meet Convoy ECB 3, which consisted of 11 coasters operating as stores ships, three empty MT ships, two armament stores carriers, and a <b>water</b> <b>tanker.</b> The convoys departure was delayed when the invasion was postponed from 5 to 6 June due to bad weather, but on 6 June ECB 3 and its escorts got underway and proceeded to the Solent. On 8 June, {{the third day of}} the invasion, the convoy proceeded to the invasion beaches, with Watchman and the other escorts driving off an attack by German motor torpedo boats [...] S-boats, known to the Allies as [...] "E-boats" [...] along the way. After ECB 3 arrived off the beachhead, Watchman detached on 11 June and returned to Milford Haven. On 13 June, she began escort duty in support of convoys carrying reinforcements and supplies to the beachhead, continuing until she was released from Neptune later in June.|$|E
