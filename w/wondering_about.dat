5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E

Yamaguchi wrote the song as a documentary of the specific feelings that he had when listening to Bach at night time. He wrote the song as a love song, inspired by everyday things. The imagery in the song was inspired by music interacting with the brain of someone falling asleep, creating mixed-up dreams.|$|E

The success of the program leaves Erskine <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> replicating the experiment on other human beings. The process itself has been inconsistently detailed: While in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the Super-Serum, when the origin was retold in the 1960s, the Comic Code Authority had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse, and thus the Super-Serum was retconned into an oral formula. Later accounts hint at a combination of oral and intravenous treatments with a strenuous training regimen, culminating in the Vita-Ray exposure.|$|E
25|$|According to his successor, Dr Meek, Mr M’Culloch {{had been}} in the habit of preaching out of doors, in the nearby gorge, because of the poor repair of the church. It was here, after sermon, that he shared the letters and written sermons he {{received}} from New England. Towards the end of January 1742, two men, Ingram More, a shoemaker, and Robert Bowman, a weaver, went through the parish, and got about 90 heads of families to sign a petition to the minister, asking that he give them a weekly lecture. Thursday evening was set for this. The first two lectures passed off as expected, and only a few persons came back to the manse for further prayer and discussion.

25|$|In 1998 the Feyenoord Supporters Vereniging were <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> {{whether or}} not it would be {{possible}} to create more atmosphere inside the stadium mainly during important matches. As a result, a few huge flags were produced and brought into the stadium prior to matches played by Feyenoord. The flags were a success, but people started asking for more activities and a meeting between fans and officials were arranged. In 2000 Harry Veth was given permission to establish a group of five Feyenoord fans called TIFO team Feyenoord Rotterdam. Besides creating more flags and small pieces of paper released from the second platform the team also started to organise bigger activities. The first big activity was held on 10 December 2000 when Feyenoord faced Ajax and 40 fog machines were activated when the players entered the pitch. In the following years many different and various activities were held to improve the atmosphere inside the stadium. Feyenoord's TIFO team became famous abroad as well and the Italian TIFO foundation awarded Feyenoord the Best of TIFO Award 2000/2001.|$|E

Written by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, the song is presented during a sequence where Eva throws out her husband's mistress on the streets.

After a bit more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon {{the man and woman}} to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest while on the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader, who, speaking the language of the protagonists poorly, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls [...] "the planet's mightiest river" [...] at bay, which is presently days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they {{have no choice but to}} remain with the mountain people.

500|$|The Liberals {{concluded}} {{their campaign}} {{with a large}} rally at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on June 7. Entertainment at the event {{was provided by the}} Leslie Bell singers, and according to Grosart, many in the audience were Tory supporters who had turned out to hear them. St. Laurent's speech at the rally was interrupted when William Hatton, a 15-year-old boy from Malton, Ontario, climbed onto the platform. Hatton carried a banner reading, [...] "This Can't Be Canada" [...] with a Liberal placard bearing St. Laurent's photograph, and moved to face the Prime Minister. Meisel describes Hatton as an [...] "otherwise politically apathetic boy who... slowly and deliberately tore up a photograph of the Prime Minister as the latter was speaking" [...] and states that Hatton engaged in [...] "intensely provocative behavior". Liberal partisans interceded, and in the ensuing fracas, Hatton fell from the platform, audibly hitting his head on the concrete floor. St. Laurent watched in apparent shock, according to his biographer Dale Tompson, as officials aided the boy and took him from the hall. According to Tompson, the crowd [...] "turned its indignation on the men on the platform" [...] and spent the remainder of the evening <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> the boy's possible injuries rather than listening to the Prime Minister's speech. Hatton was not seriously injured, but, according to Newman, [...] "the accident added to the image of the Liberal Party as an unrepentant arrogant group of old men, willing to ride roughshod over voters". Grosart later described the incident as [...] "the turning point" [...] of the campaign. Professor Meisel speculated that the Hatton incident might have been part of an organized campaign to annoy St. Laurent out of his pleasant [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] persona, and Grosart later related that Liberal frontbencher Jack Pickersgill always accused him of being behind the boy's actions, but that the incident was [...] "a sheer accident". Hatton's mother described his actions as [...] "ust a schoolboy prank," [...] and a reaction to reading an article about how the art of heckling was dying. According to public relations executive J.G. Johnston in a letter to Diefenbaker on June 10, Hatton had come to the rally with several other boys, including Johnston's son, but had gone off on his own while the other boys paraded with Diefenbaker posters which had been smuggled inside. According to Johnston, Hatton was caught on CBC tape saying to St. Laurent, [...] "I can no longer stand your hypocrisy, Sir" [...] before tearing the St. Laurent poster. Attempts by Johnston to have the Liberal activist who pushed Hatton off the platform arrested failed, according to Johnston, on the ground that the police could find no witnesses.|$|E

Monte's version was initially banned from British broadcasts for undesirable innuendo, but has been played to a family-filled baseball stadium at almost every New York Mets home game since the mid-1990s, {{as the result of}} a fan survey.

2500|$|The {{search for}} and rescue of Ziva was {{written into the}} seventh season premiere, but rather than show her in captivity, the writers decided to script the episode from Tony's point of view. This allowed them to shock the {{audience}} by opening the episode with Tony strapped to the interrogation chair, rather than Ziva, as well as keep viewers <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> Ziva's fate. Brennan relayed, [...] "You'll think you know what's going on, but then you'll go, 'Am I seeing things? What just happened?'" [...] Within the episode, Tony, {{under the influence of}} truth serum, recounts to Saleem the events that occurred during the four months since Ziva's disappearance: the team at first attempted to replace Ziva without success. After becoming concerned about her continued lack of communication, they hacked into Mossad's database and learned that she had been put on the assignment to find and kill Saleem. Gibbs then informed them that the Damocles, the ship the Mossad team had taken, had sunk in a storm and that there were no survivors. Tony subsequently became despondent for some time until deciding that they needed to avenge Ziva's death by killing Saleem. This led to him and McGee intentionally being taken captive and interrogated upon locating the camp through the shipment of the fictional drink, [...] "Caf-Pow!".
