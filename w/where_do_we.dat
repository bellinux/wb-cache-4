25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, <b>Where</b> <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E

Referring to Paul Gauguin's painting of the same name the questions are: <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> come from? What are we? Where are we going? Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms [...] "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the Stone Age, Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.|$|E

He appeared in the same piece again the following year, but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income, {{rather than as a}} possible future career. In October 1901, Ethel was appearing in Philadelphia in Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable. She persuaded the director to allow Barrymore to accept the part of the minor character, and Barrymore traveled from New York, learning his lines on the train. In the first act, he stopped {{in the middle of his}} dialogue, unable to remember the text, and asked the audience and his fellow actors, [...] "I've blown up. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> go from here?", which led the cast to improvise the remainder of the scene.|$|E

Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> go from here?"

[...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] is an uptempo rock song which was described by The Quietus as [...] "classic Manson". Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album.

[...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that both [...] "Crawl" [...] and another song from Graffiti, [...] "So Cold", come off as [...] "thoughtful, even if they're not quite mea culpas" [...] and further suggested that [...] "In these moments Mr. Brown is pining, mildly apologetic." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "genuinely affecting second single", and stated that [...] "Less forgiving listeners" [...] looking for [...] "signs of contrition" [...] may find them on the track. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said that, of the six tracks on the album's deluxe edition that could be interpreted as dealing with Brown's relationship with Rihanna directly, [...] "Crawl" [...] is [...] "by far the most catchily contrite." [...] Rap-Up said that the song shows Brown [...] "taking baby steps back to love and into the spotlight," [...] and said that it found Brown [...] "longing to mend a broken relationship" [...] as in his 2008 Jordin Sparks collaboration, “No Air”.|$|E

The script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea. In an interview with Empire magazine, Ratner stated [...] "I'm working very hard on the fourth.
