5000|$|Radio waves {{were first}} {{predicted}} by mathematical {{work done in}} 1867 by the boys. Maxwell noticed wavelike properties of light and similarities in electrical and magnetic observations. His mathematical theory, now called Maxwell's equations, described light waves and radio waves as waves of electromagnetism that travel in space, radiated by a charged particle as it undergoes acceleration. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the reality of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves by experimentally generating radio waves in his laboratory, showing that they exhibited the same wave properties as light: standing <b>waves,</b> <b>refraction,</b> diffraction, and polarization. Radio waves, originally called [...] "Hertzian waves", were first used for communication in the mid 1890s by Guglielmo Marconi, who developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>refraction</b> disperses {{wave energy}} through the bay, {{and along with}} the {{sheltering}} effect of the headlands this protects bays from storms. This effect means that the waves reaching the shore in a bay are weaker than the waves reaching the headland, and the bay is thus a safer place for water activities like surfing or swimming.

40|$|Abstract—A time-domain pure-state {{polarization}} {{analysis method}} {{is used to}} characterize surface waves traversing California parallel to the plate boundary. The method is applied to data recorded at four broadband stations in California from twenty-six large, shallow earthquakes which occurred since 1988, yielding polarization parameters such as the ellipticity, Euler angles, instantaneous periods, and wave incident azimuths. The earthquakes are located along the circum-Pacific margin and the ray paths cluster into two groups, with great-circle paths connecting stations MHC and PAS or CMB and GSC. The first path (MHC-PAS) is {{in the vicinity of}} the San Andreas Fault System (SAFS), and the second (CMB-GSC) traverses the Sierra Nevada Batholith parallel to and east of the SAFS. Both Rayleigh and Love <b>wave</b> data show <b>refractions</b> due to lateral velocity heterogeneities under the path, indicating that accurate phase velocity and attenuation analysis requires array measurements. The Rayleigh waves are strongly affected by low velocity anomalies beneath Central California, with ray paths bending eastward as waves travel toward the south, while Love waves are less affected, providing observables to constrain the depth extent of anomalies. Strong lateral gradients in the lithospheric structure between the continent and the ocean are the likely cause of the path deflections.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} transport mechanisms results from <b>wave</b> <b>refraction.</b> Since waves rarely break onto a shore at right angles, the upward movement of water onto the beach (swash) occurs at an oblique angle. However, the return of water (backwash) is at right angles to the beach, resulting in the net movement of beach material laterally. This movement is known as beach drift (Figure 3). The endless cycle of swash and backwash and resulting beach drift can be observed on all beaches. This may differ between coasts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>refraction</b> is {{the process}} by which wave crests realign {{themselves}} as a result of decreasing water depths. Varying depths along a wave crest cause the crest to travel at different phase speeds, with those parts of the wave in deeper water moving faster than those in shallow water. This process continues until the crests become (nearly) parallel to the depth contours. Rays—lines normal to wave crests between which a fixed amount of energy flux is contained—converge on local shallows and shoals. Therefore, the wave energy between rays is concentrated as they converge, with a resulting increase in wave height.|$|E

Twenty-five three component OBSs were deployed along a 120 km long profile, and the semi-regional shear-wave velocity model derived from modelling the horizontal components is compared with a regional model from 5 OBSs along the same profile. The overall shear-wave velocity distribution of the two models are fairly similar, proving that the regional procedure with large OBS spacing provides a reliable regional shear-wave velocity model. The semi-regional model is more detailed than the regional model due to the much closer receiver spacing. The vertical resolution is improved, especially in the shallow sediments, and this enables a more detailed lithological interpretation to be carried out. Intermediate and deep sediments are also better resolved in the semi-regional model, indicating both vertical and lateral changes in the lithology. The V [...]...|$|R
40|$|Intense (at least 10 mV/m) {{electrostatic}} plasma waves {{have been}} detected near the upper hybrid frequency between + or - 50 deg MLAT during recent GEOS- 1 crossings.

The effects of <b>wave</b> <b>refractions</b> were taken into account in the convective amplification calculations. Specific results are presented for the upper hybrid wave growth of an IUH event occurring at 10 deg MLAT. It is shown that a density gradient may be necessary to explain the observed amplification at 10 deg MLAT. At the equator, however, the long scale length of the magnetic field gradient enables large amplitudes to be attained without a density gradient.

It is suggested that the known variation of velocity with depth in the mantle can account for the observed dispersion. The small scatter in the velocities and the absorption of these waves suggests that, unlike shorter-period surface <b>waves,</b> <b>refraction</b> and attenuation effects are negligible at the continental margins.

50|$|LSD helps create many landforms {{including}} barrier islands, bay {{beaches and}} spits. In general LSD action serves to straighten the coast because {{the creation of}} barriers cuts off bays from the sea while sediment usually builds up in bays because the waves there are weaker (due to <b>wave</b> <b>refraction),</b> while sediment is carried away from the exposed headlands. The lack of sediment on headlands removes the protection of waves from them and makes them more vulnerable to weathering while the gathering of sediment in bays (where longshore drift is unable to remove it) protects the bays from further erosion and makes them pleasant recreational beaches.|$|E
50|$|True tombolos {{are formed}} by <b>wave</b> <b>refraction</b> and diffraction. As waves near an island, they are slowed by {{the shallow water}} {{surrounding}} it. These waves then bend around the island {{to the opposite side}} as they approach. The wave pattern created by this water movement causes a convergence of longshore drift {{on the opposite side of}} the island. The beach sediments that are moving by lateral transport on the lee side of the island will accumulate there, conforming to the shape of the wave pattern. In other words, the waves sweep sediment together from both sides. Eventually, when enough sediment has built up, the beach shoreline, known as a spit, will connect with an island and form a tombolo.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, {{if there}} is no estuary then it is {{possible}} for the spit to grow across {{to the other side of}} the bay and form what is called a bar, or barrier. Barriers come in several varieties, but all form in a manner similar to spits. They usually enclose a bay to form a lagoon. They can join two headlands or join a headland to the mainland. When an island is joined to the mainland with a bar or barrier it is known as a tombolo. This usually occurs due to <b>wave</b> <b>refraction,</b> but can also be caused by isostatic change, a change in the level of the land (e.g. Chesil Beach). An example of this is along the Holderness coastline.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the hydrodynamic processes associated with detached breakwater schemes. It {{is based on}} a physical model study of the Elmer breakwater scheme, undertaken in the UK Coastal Research Facility. The main objectives were to investigate the influences on the hydrodynamics of wave directionality and directional spread, irregular bathymetry and breakwater permeability. In contrast to previous studies, it was found that one circulation cell was dominant across the middle of the bays for both random and monochromatic <b>waves.</b> <b>Refraction</b> due to the irregular bathymetry had a significant influence on the wave-induced currents behind the breakwaters. In addition, transmission through and overtopping of the breakwaters were responsible for the observed current patterns. Long-period waves were formed in the near-shore for multidirectional waves, resulting in long period oscillations of the currents. These complex hydrodynamic processes are not included in most current numerical models used in the design of offshore breakwater schemes. The paper concludes that a new generation of models is needed to incorporate these processes, but recommends the most appropriate techniques to use in the meantime...|$|R

50|$|On coasts two {{different}} types of arches can form depending on the geology. On discordant coastlines rock types run at 90° to the coast. <b>Wave</b> <b>refraction</b> concentrates the wave energy on the headland, and an arch forms when caves break through the headland. Two examples of this type of arch are London Archpreviously known as London Bridgein Victoria, Australia, and Neil Island in Andaman, India. When these arches eventually collapse, they form stacks and stumps. On concordant coastlines rock types run parallel to the coastline, with weak rock such as shale protected by stronger rock such as limestone. The wave action along concordant coastlines breaks through the strong rock and then erodes the weak rock very quickly. Good examples of this type of arch are the Durdle Door and Stair Hole near Lulworth Cove on Dorset's Jurassic Coast in south England. When Stair Hole eventually collapses it will form a cove.|$|E
50|$|Sediment {{removed from}} the cliffs, brought onshore from {{offshore}} and the sediment supplied by rivers that remains in the lower foreshore zone undergoes longshore transport. The main agents are swash and backwash, which act to move the material {{up and down the}} beach in a zigzag fashion. Almost all of the changes in beach morphology and sediment distribution observed are produced by swash and backwash (Kirk, 1967). The direction and rate of longshore sediment transport {{is a function of the}} angle of wave approach, wave strength and the time between successive waves (Hart et al., 2008). The end result of this is a net northward migration of coarse sediment, predominantly in the swash zone (Hart et al., 2008). This is because only swell/waves moving from south to north are generally strong enough to move large sediment (Kirk, 1967). Sediment {{removed from the}} backshore is predominantly moved offshore rather than along shore as only large southerly storm waves and their subsequent swash, which usually flow perpendicular to the beach are able to reach this area (Kirk, 1967). The direction of wave approach is often relatively perpendicular due to <b>wave</b> <b>refraction.</b> This means that longshore transport mainly occurs in the nearshore swash zone.|$|E
