Hell generally signifies the Infinite Terror, the thing a man is infinitely afraid of, and shudders and shrinks from, struggling with his whole soul to escape from it. There is a Hell therefore, if you will consider, which accompanies man, in all stages of his history, and religious or other development: but the Hells of men and Peoples differ notably. With Christians it is the infinite terror of being found guilty before the Just Judge. With old Romans, I conjecture, it was the terror not of Pluto, for whom probably they cared little, but of doing unworthily, doing unvirtuously, which was their word for unmanfully. And now what is it, if you pierce through his Cants, his oft-repeated Hearsays, what he calls his Worships and so forth,--what {{is it that the}} modern English soul does, in very truth, dread infinitely, and contemplate with entire despair?

40|$|In {{recent times}} Barbados has been {{experiencing}} potentially serious Balance of Payments adjustment problems, which, if not remedied, could have serious, long term consequences for macroeconomic stability within the domestic economy. To address the current problems, the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance recently announced {{a series of}} measures aimed primarily at reducing imports of luxury goods and curtailing credit to the private sector. Against this backdrop, our paper explores the idea of dealing with Balance of Payments adjustment problems in Barbados, from a conceptual perspective. Within this context, our paper addresses two key questions: First, is there {{a solution to the}} current BOP problems being experienced by Barbados? Second, if there is a solution, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> <b>With</b> respect to the first question, we present clear evidence that suggest there is indeed a solution to the current Balance of Payments problems Barbados is experiencing. We argue that the measures announced by the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are economically sound from a structuralist perspective, but could only create short-term solutions. Furthermore, the success of the measures depends heavily on moral suasion, and the willingness and ability of Barbadians to comply with the measures. Hence, in relation to the second question, the long term solution to Barbados ’ Balance of Payments problems requires the revisiting of a policy of Import Substitution that allows for open import competition, but does not involve excessive use of protectionist measures, which would clearly violate current WTO governed rules for free trade. ...|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian Rom {{community}} (Gypsies) leads a {{life outside}} large society. Most {{of the members}} are illiterate and poor and they are dependent on social security. Moreover, the Rom children {{are not going to}} school because education is {{not a part of the}} Rom culture. This situation raises various ethical dilemmas regarding cultural rights and obligations. In this thesis the author asks which of the conflicting rights should weigh most: The parent’s right to bring up their children in accordance with their own culture and beliefs, or the child’s right to education? The author’s argument is structured around two main problem areas. First, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> education that is good for all people? The short answer to this question is that education is important for functioning in society. Knowledge provides for a wider range of opportunities, and how to use this knowledge is up to each person. The other problem area is the limits of cultural toleration in liberal societies. Here, the author argues that although the right to culture is important, liberalism cannot accommodate illiberal practices. Childrearing that restricts the child’s access to the world outside its original community is one example of intolerable practices. In order to get the Rom children in to school, dialogue is the preferable way to go. However, if the establishment of dialogue is impossible because of fundamentalist or non-dialogical attitudes, an alternative argument is provided: Discursive paternalism is a compulsion to argue on contested norms. This compulsion reconciles individual freedom (autonomy) and paternalism, and can therefore be justified by liberals.

A connection to school and work life is important for their physical and mental health, and the health of future generations. Prevention of school drop outs is important in relation to promoting public health. The {{purpose of this study is}} to increase the understanding as well as the theoretical foundation for contributing causes, for why girls quit high school. We look at the underlying causes, with special focus on the determinants of upbringing and school. The aim of the study is: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> upbringing and school, that the girls in this study believes is significant for their own drop out? We have analysed a qualitative material consisting of the results from our interviews with eight girls between 16 and 20 years of age from Aust-Agder and Vest-Agder counties. We used the Lifeline-Interview Method (LIM), and the results are compared with Antonovsky’s sense of coherence theory (SOC), Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy, and earlier research. Even the girls with both good grades and possibilities to finish high school, can quit. The triggering causes are traced back to upbringing and school by the girls themselves. The study shows that the family and school can do a difference and promote good health. To provide positive experiences, it is important to have adults available with a focus on combating bullying. Life experiences are important for how they cope with life, and the results show that even girls who have quit high school, and have faced big challenges, still possess dreams and have a positive perspective about their futures.
