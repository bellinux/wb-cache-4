5|$|<b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about Lancaster's {{character}} than {{of most of}} {{his contemporaries}} through his memoirs, the Livre de seyntz medicines (Book of the Holy Doctors). This book is a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety, but it also contains details of historical interest. It, among other things, revealed that Lancaster, {{at the age of}} 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from gout. The book is primarily a devotional work though; it is organised around seven wounds which Henry claims to have, representing the seven sins. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer's {{second major}} {{departure}} from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated {{as a response}} to the radical philosophical skepticism of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.|$|E
25|$|John is {{the first}} ruler of Trebizond for whom <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> than a few {{incidents}} and hints; there is enough information to compose a connected narrative of {{the first part of}} his reign. The chronicle of Michael Panaretos, which is often terse and even cryptic, is relatively full for John's reign, and external sources add further details to Panaretos' account. Emperor John II faced many challenges to his rule, which partly explains his marriage to the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos.|$|E

500|$|The USGS {{found that}} the {{farthest}} landslide from the 2011 Virginia earthquake was [...] from the epicenter. This {{is by far the}} greatest landslide distance recorded from any other earthquake of similar magnitude. Previous studies of worldwide earthquakes indicated that landslides occurred no farther than [...] from the epicenter of a magnitude 5.8 earthquake. The study suggested that the added information about East Coast earthquakes may prompt a revision of equations that predict ground shaking. [...] "What makes this new study so unique is that it provides direct observational evidence from the largest earthquake to occur in more than 100 years in the eastern U.S. Now that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the power of East Coast earthquakes, equations that predict ground shaking might need to be revised." ...|$|E

6000|$|Wished <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> of Melbourne. He was in {{many ways}} a very fine fellow. “In two of the most {{important}} of all the relations of a prime minister, he was perfect; I mean first, his relations to the Queen, second to his colleagues.” ...|$|R

Thy mother was a saint, I believe; but I fear I learned it too late. Well, a blessing often comes at the {{eleventh}} hour!" ...|$|R
40|$|Many policymakers {{have reacted}} {{to both the}} {{financial}} crisis and the recent Eurozone sovereign debt problems {{as though they were}} unexpected. This column argues that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> than enough to anticipate both problems, that the evidence was easily accessible. The institutional and political weaknesses of the Eurozone were hardly a mystery...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at present, my dear. I'll {{make some}} {{inquiries}} concerning Cragg and when <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about him we can better judge {{how best to}} help Ingua. Are you sure that is her name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like his}} looks," [...] the young fellow said. [...] "At any rate, {{we are not}} like to quarrel with him. As to more than that, we can say better when <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> of each other." ...|$|E
60|$|At length we {{were within}} about forty yards of that dying fire and, {{afraid to go}} further, came to a stand--or rather, a lie-still--behind some bushes until <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more.</b> Hans lifted his head and sniffed with his broad nostrils; then he whispered into my ear, but so low that I could {{scarcely}} hear him.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{the less}} I say of these sick experiences, the less tedious {{and the more}} intelligible I shall be. I do not recall them to make others unhappy or because I am now the least unhappy in remembering them. It may be that if <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> of such strange afflictions we might be the better able to {{alleviate}} their intensity.|$|R

2500|$|... "We {{were happy}} enough {{working on the}} land, but <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> and more {{certainly}} that {{the ways of the}} old settlements were not for us. This was not the way we hoped to settle the country—this old way with Jews on top and Arabs working for them; anyway, we thought that there shouldn't be employers and employed at all. There must be a better way." ...|$|R
60|$|So far {{at least}} we may go, towards {{improving}} the quality of the average birth now, but it is manifestly only a very slow and fractional advance that we shall get by these expedients. The obstacle to any ampler enterprise is ignorance and ignorance alone--not the ignorance of a majority in relation to a minority, but an absolute want of knowledge. If <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>we</b> could do more.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. No {{more than}} you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady <b>we</b> should <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about Sir Charles's death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Harry. I {{knew you}} would stick by me. Of course, I don't want to do any mad sort of thing. There is no hurry, anyhow, and, as you say, when <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about it, {{we may be able}} to hit upon some sort of plan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> than that,' resumed the first, 'for {{she told}} us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, {{she was on her}} way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{dealing with}} occult laws, however, we must allow {{for our own}} {{complete}} ignorance of the subject. Did <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> we might see {{that there was some}} analogy between that foul bog and the sacrilege which had been committed, and that their ritual and customs demanded that just such a death was the one appropriate to the crime.|$|E

6000|$|We bade {{good-bye to}} [...] "our friends the Bermudians," [...] as our {{programme}} hath it--the {{majority of those}} we were most intimate with were negroes--and courted the great deep again. I said the majority. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> negroes than white people, {{because we had a}} deal of washing to be done, but we made some most excellent friends among the whites, whom it will be a pleasant duty to hold long in grateful remembrance.|$|R

60|$|But this Age of Confusion was {{compatible}} with much intellectual activity {{and with the}} existence of many local centres of art and civilized living. When <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> of Chinese history we shall find that China also had her Miletus and her Athens, her Pergamum and her Macedonia. At present we must be vague and brief about this period of Chinese division simply because our knowledge is not sufficient for us to frame a coherent and consecutive story.|$|E
