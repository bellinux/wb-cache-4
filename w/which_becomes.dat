5|$|Chinook Pass is {{the border}} between Pierce and Yakima {{counties}} and Mount Rainier National Park and the Wenatchee National Forest. The pass is also where the highway crosses the Pacific Crest Trail, a National Scenic Trail that was completed in 1993. East of Chinook Pass, the roadway begins to parallel the American River northeast to follow the Little Naches River, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> the Naches River. After a junction with {{the other end of}} the proposed SR168, named Little Naches Road, the highway exits the Wenatchee National Forest and enters Naches. The byway ends at US12 in Naches near the Naches Selah Canal.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E

5|$|Family is {{the primary}} social and {{political}} grouping in Torajan society. Each village is one extended family, the seat {{of which is the}} tongkonan, a traditional Torajan house. Each tongkonan has a name, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> the name of the village. The familial dons maintain village unity. Marriage between distant cousins (fourth cousins and beyond) is a common practice that strengthens kinship. Toraja society prohibits marriage between close cousins (up to and including the third cousin)—except for nobles, to prevent the dispersal of property. Kinship is actively reciprocal, meaning that the extended family helps each other farm, share buffalo rituals, and pay off debts.|$|E
5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E

5|$|Tidal flexing kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> {{a source of}} heat. Depending {{on the amount of}} tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E

5|$|After {{intersecting}} with NY289, NY178 progresses northeastward, {{intersecting with}} the western terminus of CR84 {{in the community of}} Thomas Settlement. After leaving Thomas Settlement, NY178 intersects with CR77 and turning to the southeast through a rural region before entering the village of Adams at an intersection with Cobbville Road. There, the surroundings become further residential, before the highway connects to I-81 at exit41. After the interchange, NY178 becomes known as Church Street West, crosses over a railroad line and enters the downtown portion of Adams. After the intersection with Clay Street, NY178 intersects with US11 (Main Street), where the NY178 designation ends. The right-of-way continues eastward as Church Street East, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> CR69 at the east village line.|$|E
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
50|$|As {{the first}} phase of The Kendrew Quadrangle project Dunthorne Parker Architects were {{appointed}} by the College to refurbish three Grade II Listed buildings fronting on to St Giles. Works were carried out to No 20 St Giles <b>which</b> <b>became</b> alumni residential accommodation, The Black Hall, a 17th-century building, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> teaching accommodation and The Barn, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> an exhibition and performance space. This project was awarded an Oxford Preservation Trust Plaque in 2008.|$|R

5|$|At home, Bart {{comes up}} with a {{character}} called Angry Dad, based on the frequent angry outbursts of his father, Homer. Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> a hit with the kids in school. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one day at work. Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him. Marge and Lisa stops him and calms him down, and Homer agrees to suppress his anger from that point on.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after a meteorite crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance, investing in the development of technology to harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community. Nod soon controls nearly half of the supply and uses these assets to sustain a rapidly growing army of followers worldwide. The group is led by a self-proclaimed messianic figure known only as Kane.|$|E
5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, <b>which</b> <b>becomes</b> a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E

5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Sohio, now part of BP.
