25|$|<b>Worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{unfavorable}} situation, Master Yin Shun {{decided to}} reverse the trend. The society, including the Buddhist sangha, of that time saw women as inferior to men. Women had few chances to receive an education. Inspired by Master Yin Shun's belief that studies would enhance a nun's spiritual growth, a nun named Xuanshen opened the Hsinchu Women's Buddhist Institute in her convent.|$|E

Al Jean was also quite <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> segment {{because it was the}} longest running black-and-white segment they had ever aired, and he thought that some people might be concerned that their televisions were broken. The [...] "He was a zombie?" [...] line, created by Mike Reiss, is, in the opinions of the writers, one of the all-time classic lines from the series.|$|E

[...] According to the Washington Post, Marshall justified the legislation by saying: [...] "If I needed a blood transfusion and the guy next to me had committed sodomy 14 {{times in the last}} month, I'd be worried," [...] and [...] "It's a distraction when I'm on the battlefield and have to concentrate on the enemy 600 yards away and I'm <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> guy who's got eyes on me." ...|$|E

In terms of ensuring that infected pigs do not spread the disease to Cambodia, the Cambodian Pig Raiser Association said it has told the government it should ban live pig imports. But Khlauk Chuon, the deputy director of Camcontrol at the Ministry of Commerce, said they would only ban live pig imports from a country that has been hit with swine flu. [...] "We are very <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> new disease because it can transfer from pig to human, from human to human and from human to pig," [...] Khlauk Chuon added. 6 cases has been confirmed in Cambodia, including one domestic case.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} a famine, so the {{residents}} in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. She saw that her brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, [...] "I feel bad when I can fill my own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat." [...] His sister replied, [...] "You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and not tell me about this?" [...] She then took grain from her personal stores {{and gave it to}} Luo Tong, and also informed their mother about it. Luo Tong's mother agreed with what they were doing, and she distributed grain to the people. Luo Tong became famous after this incident.|$|E

2500|$|In autumn, Jiang Wei led Shu {{forces to}} attack the Wei-controlled Yong Province, had two fortresses {{constructed}} at Qushan (麴山; southeast of present-day Min County, Gansu), and ordered his officers Ju An (句安) and Li Xin (李歆) to guard them. He also contacted the Qiang tribes and requested assistance from them in harassing the commanderies in Yong Province. Guo Huai discussed with Chen Tai, the Inspector of Yong Province, {{on how to deal}} with the Shu invasion. Chen Tai said, [...] "The fortresses at Qushan may be well-defended, but the roads leading into Shu are difficult to travel, so they will require a sufficient amount of supplies. The Qiang tribes are <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> weakness of the Shu army, so they may not be willing to help Shu. If we surround the fortresses and attack them, we can easily capture them. Even if Shu reinforcements arrive, the dangerous mountainous terrain will cause them to be worn out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baby Emma Henry {{originated}} {{the role}} and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully [...] "Mummy Shell" [...] and referred to Letitia Dean who played her mum's best friend, [...] "Daddy Sharon". Tully has commented, [...] "What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows my real name but she knows to call me 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved {{for a couple of}} weeks, I like to visit her at home, so she's always relaxed with me." [...] Tully <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body. Tully said, [...] " [...] has seen me in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her". At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed. Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 1942 Japanese after action report, [...] "In {{order to}} keep strict radio silence, steps such as taking off fuses in the circuit, and holding and sealing the keys were taken. During the operation, the strict radio silence was {{perfectly}} carried out... The Kido Butai used the radio instruments {{for the first time}} on the day of the attack since they had been fixed at the base approximately twenty days before and proved they worked well. Paper flaps had been inserted between key points of some transmitters on board [...] to keep the strictest radio silence..." [...] Commander Genda, who helped plan the attack, stated, [...] "We kept absolute Radio Silence." [...] For two weeks before the attack, the ships of Kido Butai used flag and light signals (semaphore and blinker), which were sufficient since task force members remained in line of sight for the entire transit time. Kazuiyoshi Koichi, the Communications Officer for , dismantled vital transmitter parts and kept them in a box that he used as a pillow to prevent Hiei from making any radio transmissions until the attack commenced. Lieutenant Commander Chuichi Yoshoka, communications officer of the flagship, Akagi, said he did not recall any ship sending a radio message before the attack. Furthermore, Captain Kijiro, in charge of the Kido Butais three screening submarines, stated nothing of interest happened on the way to Hawaii, presumably including signals received from the supposedly radio silent Kido Butai. Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka stated, [...] "It is needless to say that the strictest radio silence was ordered to be maintained in every ship of the Task Force. To keep radio silence was easy to say, but not so easy to maintain." [...] There is nothing in the Japanese logs or after action report indicating that radio silence was broken until after the attack. Kusaka <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> when it was briefly broken on the way home.|$|E

60|$|Victory hangs now, to be explicit, upon two factors. The {{first and}} most {{immediate}} of these is a certain canny captain of many wars whose regiment is still {{at the disposal of}} either army--for a price, a regiment which has hitherto remained strictly neutral.

60|$|I am <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> thing because, {{to confess}} the horrid truth, I wear a made-up tie myself. On foggy afternoons I steal {{out of the}} house disguised.

I creep along the wall till I find a common hosier's shop, and then, in an assumed voice, I tell the man what it is I want. They come to fourpence halfpenny each; by taking the half-dozen I get them for a trifle less. They are put on in a moment, and, to my vulgar eye, look neat and tasteful.|$|E

Why, those blasted Teutons wanted us to believe it! That's why some of the seals were broken, and why the old man himself hung about like a hen that's lost one of its chickens. They want us to believe that we've got the goods right in that box, and to hold up the search for a time while they get the genuine stuff out of the country. I admit right here, Mr. Crawshay, that it was you who put this into my head at Halifax.

25|$|A {{significant}} {{source of}} abstract groups is given by {{the construction of a}} factor group, or quotient group, G/H, of a group G by a normal subgroup H. Class groups of algebraic number fields were among the earliest examples of factor groups, of much interest in number theory. If a group G is a permutation group on a set X, the factor group G/H is no longer acting on X; but the idea of an abstract group permits one not to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> discrepancy.|$|R
