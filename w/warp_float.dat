5000|$|Twill fabrics {{technically}} have a {{front and}} a back side, unlike plain weave, whose two sides are the same. The front side of the twill is called the technical face and the back the technical back. The technical face side of a twill weave fabric is the side with the most pronounced wale; it is usually more durable and more attractive, is most often used as the fashion side of the fabric, and is the side visible during weaving. If there are <b>warp</b> <b>floats</b> on the technical face (i.e. if the warp crosses over two or more wefts), there will be filling floats (the weft will cross over two or more warps) on the technical back. If the twill wale goes up to the right on one side, it will {{go up to the}} left on the other side. Twill fabrics have no [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down" [...] as they are woven.|$|R
40|$|Usually, {{a fabric}} weave pattern is {{recognized}} using methods which identify the <b>warp</b> <b>floats</b> and weft floats. Although these methods perform well for uniform or repetitive weave patterns, {{in the case}} of complex weave patterns, these methods become computationally complex and the classification error rates are comparatively higher. Furthermore, the fault-tolerance (invariance) and stability (selectivity) of the existing methods are still to be enhanced. We present a novel biologically-inspired method to invariantly recognize the fabric weave pattern (fabric texture) and yarn color from the color image input. We proposed a model in which the fabric weave pattern descriptor is based on the HMAX model for computer vision inspired by the hierarchy in the visual cortex, the color descriptor is based on the opponent color channel inspired by the classical opponent color theory of human vision, and the classification stage is composed of a multi-layer (deep) extreme learning machine. Since the weave pattern descriptor, yarn color descriptor, and the classification stage are all biologically inspired, we propose a method which is completely biologically plausible. The classification performance of the proposed algorithm indicates that the biologically-inspired computer-aided-vision models might provide accurate, fast, reliable and cost-effective solution to industrial automation...|$|R

50|$|The sheen and softer feel of sateen is {{produced}} through the satin weave structure. <b>Warp</b> yarns are <b>floated</b> over weft yarns, for example four over and one under. (In a weft-faced satin or sateen, the weft yarns are <b>floated</b> over the <b>warp</b> yarns.) Standard plain weaves use a one-over, one-under structure. The long floats produce a surface that is smooth {{to the touch}} and reduces light scattering to increase shine. This weave structure is more susceptible to wear than other weaves.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study shows}} {{the effect of}} fabric {{tightness}} and fabric material on the mechanical properties of fabricâ€“cement composites. Six fabric designs from the same fabric material were used. These fabric designs are vary in the specific tightness. Also, three fabric materials with the same fabric design were used in this work. Different sets of specimens were made, after that these specimens were tested on tensile and bending testing machines. It {{was found that the}} mechanical properties of the composite materials were influenced by the length of the <b>warp</b> thread <b>float,</b> i. e. the longer is the yarns float in the fabric, the greater is the tensile strength properties of the reinforced fabric, its construction and the material of the reinforced fabric. Therefore, it is recommended to use fabric with yarns with higher tenacity {{in the direction of the}} application of load and with either long float or minimum number of intersections...|$|R
5000|$|Satin is a weave that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave {{is characterized by}} four or more fill or weft yarns <b>floating</b> over a <b>warp</b> yarn or vice versa, four <b>warp</b> yarns <b>floating</b> over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|R

As Pitchfork observed, [...] "the song <b>warps</b> and bends, <b>floating</b> through genres, epochs, and emotions {{with a sense of}} hallucinatory wonder" [...] and recalls the Beatles song [...] "A Day in the Life". In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes observes, [...] "It's completely ridiculous. It's also remarkably beautiful and affecting." [...] Louis Lepron of Kombini believed the multitude of styles and science fiction aesthetics on the track is an homage to musical films including Phantom of the Paradise, the soundtrack of which Williams had composed. The song's opening is a specific reference to a scene in the film in which the title character's voice is gradually enhanced in a studio booth. De Homem-Christo stated that [...] "Touch" [...] is [...] "like the core of the record, and the memories of the other tracks are revolving around it." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{innovative}} lightweight materials are rapidly {{increased in the}} recent years, owing to their cost-effective, high-strength, environmentally-sound use of materials and process technologies, {{in addition to that}} they reduce the weight of a product. The characteristics of 3 D-spacer fabrics {{as one of the most}} important lightweight materials in future are multifaceted not only owing to its extremely light materials, but also because of exceptionally high stiffness to weight ratio compared to other constructions. It is also one possible method for improving the properties of fabric-reinforced composites. It can enhance the through-the-thickness properties, such as shear strength, dimensional stability, damage, tolerance, and fracture toughness that are critical for many structural applications. Spacer fabric has been employed in high-technology applications because of its critical mechanical properties related to high tensile strength, tear strength and stiffness. Furthermore, its multidirectional structures allow with more reinforcement along the thickness direction leading to an increase in stiffness and strength properties. The fundamental aim of this thesis exists in the development of a new kind of woven spacer fabrics for the light weight composites materials, in an effort to weave spacer fabrics that can not be realized with the old technology which are mentioned above. Therefore, the work in brief focuses on two main goals: 1. Development of a new kind of spacer fabrics for composites in the lightweight constructions. 2. Development of special devices of a narrow weaving machine for standing the process of the new kind of spacer fabrics production. The slippage strength test had to be carried out for the <b>floated</b> <b>warp</b> yarns through the ground fabrics by using different elements of woven fabric structures variables represented in different fabric constructions, different weft densities and different repeats of constructions by using different materials. The importance of this test related to the backward-movement of the <b>floated</b> <b>warp</b> yarns which is the crucial stage in the weaving process of spacer fabrics during the backward-movement. The results of this test determine the required forces for the backward-movement, on the other side it is the best method to observe the behavior of structure elements during the backward movement. The results of the slippage strength had been statistically analyzed, and the weaving process for the spacer fabrics had been achieved. It was concluded that the best properties for the woven spacer fabrics and the optimum case for the weaving process on the test weaving machine had been achieved when the following items are realized: Development of the narrow weaving machine is closed in assisting operations, let-off and take-up and enhancement for take-up processes. Extra let-off and take-up devices must be constructed at the weaving machine. Extra let-off device has to be used for controlling the <b>floated</b> <b>warp</b> yarns of ground fabrics. On the other side, extra take-up and the developed take-up devices have to be used for controlling the woven spacer fabrics. The experimental results give fundamental knowledges for the next steps in research and development of woven spacer fabrics made of high-performance yarns on the wide weaving machine. Die Ziele der Arbeit bestanden in der Entwicklung der Geometrie der Spacer Fabrics und der notwendigen Falteneinrichtung an der Bandwebmaschine. Spacer Fabrics werden ausschlieÃŸlich aus zwei DeckflÃ¤chen, die durch eingewebte Stege verbunden sind, gefertigt. Zur Entwicklung der Spacer Fabrics muss eine Doppelnadel-Bandwebmaschine mit zwei WebfÃ¤chern eingesetzt werden. FÃ¼r die Faltenwebeinrichtung werden der entwickelte Extra-Kettablass und der Extra-Abzug benÃ¶tigt. Der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Abzuges erfolgen durch einen Synchronantrieb und der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Ablasses durch Pneumatik. Eine frei programmierbare Steuerung der Faltenwebeinrichtung ermÃ¶glicht eine sichere und optimierte Synchronisation zwischen Webprozess und Faltenbildung. Im Ergebnis einer systematischen Strukturentwicklung von Spacer Fabrics und der Simulation ihrer gÃ¼nstigen Herstellung mittles eines speziell entwickelten Slippage Strength Tests werden die optimalen Strukturen ermittelt. Die experimentellen Untersuchungen bringen grundlegende Erkenntnisse fÃ¼r die folgenden Forschungsschritte zur Entwicklung von gewebten Spacer Fabrics mit Hochleistungsgarnen auf Doppelgreiferwebmaschinen...|$|R
50|$|The best rope for warps is nylon {{which is}} strong and flexible. Terylene (polyester) is {{stronger}} but has less flex. Both ropes sink, so they avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water. Neither breaks down quickly in sunlight. Polypropylene or polythene are not suited to <b>warps</b> as they <b>float</b> and are much weaker than nylon and only slightly stronger than natural fibres. They break down in sunlight. Natural fibres such as manila or hemp are still used in developing nations but absorb much water, are relatively weak and rot. They do give good grip and are often very cheap. All anchors should have chain at least equal to the boat's length. Some skippers prefer an all chain warp for added security in coral waters. Boats less than 8 m typically use 6 mm galvanized chain. 8-14 m craft use 9 mm chain and over 14 m use 12 mm chain. The chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel eye or spliced to the chain using a chain splice. The shackle pin should be securely wired. Either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles.|$|R
