40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{automatic}} facial expression recog-nition in image sequences, is introduced which {{make use of}} Candide <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> model and active appearance algorithm for tracking, and Bayesian classifier for classification. On the first frame of face image sequence, Candide <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> model is adapted properly. In subsequent frames of image sequence, facial features are tracked using active appearance algorithm. The algorithm adapts Candide <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> model to the face {{in each of the}} frames and tracks the grid in consecutive video frames over time. Last frame of image sequence corresponds to greatest facial expression intensity. The difference of the node coordinates between the first and the greatest facial expression intensity frame, called the geometrical displacement of Candide <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> nodes is used as an input to a classifier, which classifies facial expression into one of the class such as happy, surprise, sad, anger, disgust and fear. The experimental results show that the proposed method is better in classification correctness in comparison with binary SVM tree classifier.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design of}} modules in {{the current version of}} the TINA stereo based 3 D vision system responsible for the recovery of geometric descriptions and their subsequent integration into partial <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> models. The approach differs considerably from that described in an earlier version of the TINA system [2, 3]. Our strategy for the construction of partial <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> descriptions is broken into the following three processing stages: (1) Stereo processing. This is edge based and uses camera calibration information to provide a restriction on allowable matches between edges extracted from the left and right images. The algorithm does not, however, at this stage recover an accurate estimate of disparity of each pair of matched edges. (2) Geometrical description. This relies on the identification of higher level 2 D primitives from the edge strings in one, other or both images and their subsequent combination with stereo matching, and calibration data to allow the recovery of 3 D primitives. (3) <b>Wire</b> <b>frame</b> generation. Based upon 2 D and 3 D proximity and connectivity heuristics potential <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> components are identified. 1...|$|R
40|$|In an {{experiment}} in space {{it was found that}} when a cubical frame was slowly withdrawn from a soap solution, the <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> retained practically a full cube of liquid. Removed from the frame (by shaking), the faces of the cube became progressively more concave, until adjacent faces became tangential. In the present paper a mathematical model describing the shape a liquid takes due to its surface tension while suspended on a <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> in zero-g is solved by use of Lagrange multipliers. It is shown how the configuration of soap films so bounded is dependent upon the volume of liquid trapped in the films. A special case of the solution is a soap film naturally formed on a cubical <b>wire</b> <b>frame...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{diffusive}} {{growth rate}} of a polyhedral cell in dry three-dimensional foams depends on details of shape beyond cell topology, {{in contrast to the}} situation in two dimensions, where, by von Neumann's law, the growth rate depends only on the number of cell edges. We analyze the dependence of the instantaneous growth rate on the shape of single foam cells surrounded by uniform pressure; this is accomplished by supporting the cell with films connected to a <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> and inducing cell distortions by deforming the <b>wire</b> <b>frame.</b> We consider three foam cells with a very simple topology; these are the Platonic foam cells, which satisfy Plateau's laws and are based on the trivalent Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron). The Surface Evolver is used to model cell deformations induced through extension, compression, shear, and torsion of the <b>wire</b> <b>frames.</b> The growth rate depends on the deformation mode and frame size and can increase or decrease with increasing cell distortion. The cells have negative growth rates, in general, but dodecahedral cells subjected to torsion in small <b>wire</b> <b>frames</b> can have positive growth rates. The deformation of cubic cells is demonstrated experimentally...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of a}} a twodimensional surface in an arbitrary spacetime can be visualized by embedding it isometrically in threedimensional Euclidean space. We discuss the differential equations which determine the embedded surface and the conditions which guarantee {{the existence of a}} global embedding of a surface, as opposed to a local embedding of some part of it. The horizon of a Kerr black hole, with different values of the angular momentum parameter, is used to demonstrate the general technique and the existence or nonexistence of a global embedding. Another example is the Misner initial data for the collision of two black holes. In order to actually represent the embedded surface on a screen or on paper, a <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> can be constructed by covering the surface with triangles, plotting the points and the connecting links of the <b>wire</b> <b>frame.</b> As an alternative to solving the embedding equations and subsequently covering the embedded surface with a <b>wire</b> <b>frame,</b> it is possible to directly determine the positions of the points of the <b>wire</b> <b>frame</b> by solving a nonlinear system of algebraic equations. With this technique, no a priori knowledge about regions with positive and negative Gaussian curvature or the boundaries between them is required.
