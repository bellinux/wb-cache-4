Canberra also had a high proportion of public servants who felt that they were already a part of the government, and knew how to work with the system.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt,</b> forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E

Libertarian economist Milton Friedman after 1960 attacked Social Security from a free market view stating that it had created welfare dependency.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which someone said something that should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to identify what was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> slightly uncomfortable to be reminded that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E

500|$|William III {{recognised}} Marlborough's qualities as {{a soldier}} and strategist, but the refusal of the Order of the Garter and failure to appoint him Master-General of the Ordnance, rankled with the ambitious Earl; nor did Marlborough conceal his bitter disappointment behind his usual bland discretion. Using his influence in Parliament and the army, Marlborough aroused dissatisfaction concerning William's preferences for foreign commanders, an exercise designed to force the King's hand. Aware of this, William in turn began to speak openly of his distrust of Marlborough; the Elector of Brandenburg's envoy to London overheard the King remark {{that he had been}} treated – [...] "so infamously by Marlborough that, had he not been King, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> it necessary to challenge him to a duel".|$|E

The B-side, [...] "When I Get You Alone" [...] – a cover version of Robin Thicke's 2002 single – was recorded live on Australian Idol episode [...] "Up Close & Personal" [...] in October 2003. Sebastian's second single, [...] "All I Need Is You", followed in February 2004 and also debuted at number-one.

500|$|Sivaji Ganesan {{was cast}} as the male lead. Both the female leads– B. Saroja Devi and Sowcar Janaki– were cast in roles {{different}} from what they were earlier proposed for. According to Ganesan's eldest son Ramkumar, [...] "Sivaji always thought of Sowcar Janaki as classy and sophisticated," [...] which was why he cast her as a [...] "modern woman" [...] in Puthiya Paravai. [...] "Before that Sowcar had only acted in homely roles". Mirasi, who made a cameo appearance as the hero's father in the film, was initially not convinced about Janaki acting in the film. But after seeing her performance in the song [...] "Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo", Mirasi decided to include her {{for the rest of the}} film. Janaki added her own subtle distinctions and inputs to her role as portraying an out-and-out seductive vamp, according to her, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> deplorable. Nagesh, S. V.

500|$|Of Etty's two {{original}} works {{exhibited at}} the RA in 1830, The Storm, inspired by Psalm 22, attracted little interest and was dismissed by The Gentleman's Magazine—typically a staunch supporter of Etty's work—as [...] "a sad failure". The other painting exhibited was Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, which was to prove {{one of the most}} controversial works of Etty's career. Candaules is based on a story from Herodotus in which king Candaules arranges for his servant Gyges to spy on his wife Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Gyges is discovered and at Nyssia's behest kills Candaules, marries Nyssia and rules the kingdom in his stead. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia removes the last of her clothes. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty aimed for the viewer to feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt,</b> forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that Drayton and Brown were not seized and their consent to the search was voluntary. He explained that [...] "aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen". Additionally, Justice Kennedy emphasized that [...] "f a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized". Citing the Court's analytic framework established in Florida v. Bostic, Justice Kennedy concluded that a reasonable person <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> free to [...] "leav the bus or otherwise terminat the encounter". Justice Kennedy noted that the officers did not brandish weapons, they did not make [...] "intimidating movements", they left the aisle clear, and they [...] "spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite, quiet voice". He noted that [...] "t is beyond question that had this encounter occurred on the street, it would be constitutional", {{and the fact that the}} encounter occurred on a bus does not make it illegal.|$|E

She <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> it a few months earlier, for, while she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had no harm come to him, there was no hiding the fact that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> set her free from an almost intolerable bondage.

500|$|The United States Supreme Court first {{clarified}} {{the applicability}} of the Fourth Amendment to searches and seizures on buses in the 1991 case Florida v. Bostick, where the Court held that police officers may approach bus passengers on a random basis and ask questions and request their consent to searches, [...] "provided a reasonable person would understand {{that he or she is}} free to refuse". The Court rejected the argument that police questioning on board a bus constitutes a per se seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and instead held that courts should use a [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test to determine whether a passenger <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> [...] "free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter", or whether a passenger was free [...] "to ignore the police presence and go about his business". Additionally, the Court ruled that even if law enforcement officers have no basis for suspecting individuals are engaged in criminal activity, officers may still approach passengers, ask them questions, request identification, and request consent to search luggage, so long as officers do not coerce passengers to cooperate with their efforts.|$|E
500|$|At {{the scene}} of the crime, the pair deduce Krusty could not have been the robber because the robber used the {{microwave}} not suitable for those with a pacemaker, and read at the magazine rack. They go to Sideshow Bob with the intention of finding if Krusty had any enemies, but are given tickets to his show. At the live broadcast, Bart is invited up on stage with Sideshow Bob, where he points out the facts regarding the microwave and magazine, which Sideshow Bob dismisses. When Sideshow Bob says he has [...] "a lot of big shoes to fill", Bart remembers how Homer stepped on the robber's foot, causing him to scream in pain. Bart realizes that despite wearing clown shoes all the time, Krusty never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> Homer stepping on them due to his small feet. Bart then deduces that Sideshow Bob is the real robber, since he had the most to gain through Krusty's downfall and has large feet. To prove his theory, he hits the end of Sideshow Bob's shoe with a mallet, causing Sideshow Bob to scream in pain and exposing him as the robber to the public. The police, having watched the show, realize they wrongfully put Krusty in jail for a crime he did not commit and head down to the studio to arrest Sideshow Bob.|$|E
500|$|McKellen has {{appeared}} in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot), Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer {{that it is a}} work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie– not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it". McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner. In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. On 23 August 2013 the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015.|$|E
