25|$|Justice Douglas {{asserted}} {{that there should}} be no distinction made between prospective relief and retrospective relief, as the drain on the state's treasury is the same in either case. He also strongly contended that Illinois had <b>waived</b> its <b>immunity</b> by entering the federal program, because the Court had recently found other states to have <b>waived</b> <b>immunity</b> by joining similar programs. Therefore, Douglas reasoned that Illinois had to have been aware of the possibility that entering the program would <b>waive</b> its own <b>immunity,</b> and its decision to participate in light of that danger showed a willingness to be held liable.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{the federal}} {{government}} has sovereign immunity and may not be sued unless it has <b>waived</b> its <b>immunity</b> or consented to suit. The United States has <b>waived</b> sovereign <b>immunity</b> to a limited extent, mainly through the Federal Tort Claims Act, which <b>waives</b> the <b>immunity</b> if a tortious act of a federal employee causes damage, and the Tucker Act, which <b>waives</b> the <b>immunity</b> over claims arising out of contracts to which {{the federal government}} is a party. The United States as a sovereign is immune from suit unless it unequivocally consents to being sued. The United States Supreme Court in Price v. United States observed: [...] "It is an axiom of our jurisprudence. The government is not liable to suit unless it consents thereto, and its liability in suit cannot be extended beyond the plain language of the statute authorizing it." [...] Price v. United States, 174 U.S. 373, 375-76 (1899).|$|R
50|$|Rehnquist first {{stated that}} the tribe does not <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> by instituting an action in the {{district}} court, noting that the court had previously determined that tribes were immune from counter-claims or cross-suits, absent Congressional authorization to the contrary. He next addressed the state's argument that tribal land held in trust {{was not the same}} as reservation land, and found the state's position unpersuasive. Tribal land, whether held in trust or as part of a reservation, is set apart {{for the use of the}} tribe, and as such qualifies for immunity. The court then held that the Tenth Circuit erred in holding that tribe did not have to collect sales taxes on cigarettes sold to non-members.|$|E
50|$|The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution {{defines the}} scope of when and in what {{circumstances}} a state may be taken to federal court. Taken literally, the Amendment prohibits a citizen from suing a state in federal court through the sovereign immunity doctrine. However, the Court has articulated three exceptions: 1) Particular state officials may be sued, 2) States can <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> or consent to suit, and 3) Congress may authorize suits against a state through the abrogation doctrine. However, concerning this latter exception, the Supreme Court has held in Seminole Tribe v. Florida that Congress may not, outside of the Fourteenth Amendment, authorize federal lawsuits against states in abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment's guarantee of sovereign state immunity.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} for the official's home country to waive immunity; this tends to happen only when the individual has committed a serious crime, unconnected with their diplomatic role (as opposed to, say, allegations of spying), or has witnessed such a crime. However, many countries refuse to <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> {{as a matter of}} course; individuals have no authority to waive their own immunity (except perhaps in cases of defection). Alternatively, the home country may prosecute the individual. If immunity is waived by a government so that a diplomat (or their family members) can be prosecuted, it must be because there is a case to answer and it is in the public interest to prosecute them. For instance, in 2002, a Colombian diplomat in London was prosecuted for manslaughter, once diplomatic immunity was waived by the Colombian government.|$|E

5000|$|Lapides v. Board of Regents of University System of Georgia, , is a {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled that a state voluntarily waives at least part of its Eleventh Amendment immunity when it invokes a federal court's removal jurisdiction. There has subsequently been a [...] "circuit split" [...] in federal courts regarding whether a state <b>waives</b> <b>immunity</b> from liability or only a federal form.|$|R
50|$|The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled 3:2 {{that the}} Congo {{government}} had not waived its immunity in the Hong Kong courts, {{and that as}} a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong could not have policies on state immunity that was inconsistent with Chinaâ€™s. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied in Hong Kong should be absolute, and may be invoked when jurisdiction is sought in the foreign court in relation to an application to enforce a foreign judgment or arbitral award, or when execution is sought against assets in the foreign state. This means that sovereign states are absolutely immune to the jurisdiction in Hong Kong courts, including in commercial claims, unless the state waives its immunity. In order to <b>waive</b> <b>immunity,</b> there must be express, unequivocal submission to {{the jurisdiction of the}} Hong Kong courts â€œin the face of the court. Claimants should establish that the state party has waived their entitlement to immunity at the relevant stage, before proceedings can occur in court.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ( [...] et seq.) {{follows the}} {{principles}} {{introduced by the}} Vienna Conventions. The United States tends to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because {{a large number of}} U.S. diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the State Department asks the home country to <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to expel the diplomat. In many such cases, the diplomat's visas are canceled, and he and his family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.|$|E
50|$|On 9 May 2014, Rizalman {{was arrested}} by the New Zealand Police after {{following}} a 21-year old Wellington woman home and allegedly assaulting her. The following day, he appeared in the Wellington District Court and was charged with burglary and intent to rape, which carry a ten-year prison sentence. Rizalman claimed diplomatic immunity and was {{allowed to return to}} Malaysia on 22 May 2014. While the New Zealand Government has asserted that it wanted Rizalman to remain in the country to face trial, miscommunication between Malaysian and New Zealand officials led the Malaysian Government to believe that the New Zealand Government would not object to repatriating Rizalman and trying him before a Malaysian military court. According to the Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman, the Malaysian Government was always willing to <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> and to allow Rizalman to be tried in New Zealand. Details of the case were not divulged to the general public until early July 2014. Following his return to Malaysia, Rizalman was checked into a Malaysian military hospital for psychiatric evaluation. He was also scheduled to face a military board of inquiry and potentially a court martial.|$|E
50|$|The United States has <b>waived</b> {{sovereign}} <b>immunity</b> to {{a limited}} extent, mainly through the Federal Tort Claims Act, which <b>waives</b> the <b>immunity</b> if a tortious act of a federal employee causes damage, and the Tucker Act, which <b>waives</b> the <b>immunity</b> over claims arising out of contracts to which {{the federal government is}} a party. The Federal Tort Claims Act and the Tucker Act are not the broad waivers of sovereign immunity they might appear to be, as {{there are a number of}} statutory exceptions and judicially fashioned limiting doctrines applicable to both. Title 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 confers federal question jurisdiction on district courts, but this statute has been held not to be a blanket waiver of sovereign immunity on the part of the federal government.|$|R

2500|$|A {{grand jury}} {{composed}} of 10 black, 8 white, and 5 Hispanic jurors found no cause to indict Lifsh. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes explained that under New York law, the single act of [...] "losing {{control of a}} car" [...] is not criminal negligence, even if death or injury resulted. Lifsh <b>waived</b> <b>immunity</b> and testified before the grand jury. About an hour after hearing Lifshâ€™s testimony, the grand jury voted not to indict him. Subsequently, Lifsh moved to Israel, where his family lives, because his life was threatened. In Israel, Lifsh settled in the Lubavitch village of Kfar Chabad.|$|R
5000|$|For this purpose, the Act {{goes on to}} {{prescribe}} the test of allowable claims, which is, [...] "The United States shall be liable [...] [...] [...] {{in the same manner}} and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances[...] [...]," [...] with certain exceptions not material here. [...] It will be seen {{that this is not the}} creation of new causes of action but acceptance of liability under circumstances that would bring private liability into existence. This, we think, embodies the same idea that its English equivalent enacted in 1947 [...] expressed, [...] "Where any person has a claim against the Crown after the commencement of this Act, and, if this Act had not been passed, the claim might have been enforced, subject to the grant [...] [...] [...]" [...] of consent to be sued, the claim may now be enforced without specific consent. One obvious shortcoming in these claims is that plaintiffs can point to no liability of a [...] "private individual" [...] even remotely analogous to that which they are asserting against the United States. We know of no American law which ever has permitted a soldier to recover for negligence, against either his superior officers or the Government he is serving. Nor is there any liability [...] "under like circumstances," [...] for no private individual has power to conscript or mobilize a private army with such authorities over persons as the Government vests in echelons of command. The nearest parallel, even if we were to treat [...] "private individual" [...] as including a state, would be the relationship between the states and their militia. But if we indulge plaintiffs the benefit of this comparison, claimants cite us no state, and we know of none, which has permitted members of its militia to maintain tort actions for injuries suffered in the service, and in at least one state the contrary has been held to be the case. It is true that if we consider relevant only a part of the circumstances and ignore the status of both the wronged and the wrongdoer in these cases we find analogous private liability. In the usual civilian doctor and patient relationship, there is of course a liability for malpractice. And a landlord would undoubtedly be held liable if an injury occurred to a tenant as the result of a negligently maintained heating plant. But the liability assumed by the Government here is that created by [...] "all the circumstances," [...] not that which a few of the circumstances might create. We find no parallel liability before, and we think no new one has been created by, this Act. Its effect is to <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> from recognized causes of action and was not to visit the Government with novel and unprecedented liabilities. The relationship between the Government and members of its armed forces is [...] "distinctively federal in character," [...] as this Court recognized in United States v. Standard Oil Co., [...] wherein the Government unsuccessfully sought to recover for losses incurred by virtue of injuries to a soldier.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court's recent {{revival of}} state {{sovereign}} immunity is usually {{cited as a}} significant development in modern U. S. federalism. These decisions giving states a powerful defense against lawsuits lead to the question: How will the states react to the Court's rulings? How likely is it that states will consent to be sued?

40|$|Professor Epstein {{has long}} {{promoted}} replacing tort-based malpractice law {{with a new}} regime based on contracts. In Mortal Peril, he grounded his normative {{arguments in favor of}} such a shift in the positive, doctrinal history of charitable immunity law. In this essay, in three parts, I critique Professor Epsteinâ€™s suggestion that a faulty set of interpretations in charitable immunity law led to our current reliance on tort for malpractice claims. First, I offer an alternative interpretation to Professor Epsteinâ€™s claim that one group of 19 th and early 20 th century cases demonstrates a misguided effort to protect donor wishes. Rather, I maintain that these cases make more sense when understood in the context of trust law. Second, I argue that another group of cases â€” cases based on indigent patientsâ€™ implied waivers of tort rights in exchange for charitable services â€” is not best understood as being based on implied contracts, as Professor Epstein claims. Rather, these cases are better understood as enforcing tort privileges that arise from the charitable status of the defendant. Finally, I critique Professor Epsteinâ€™s contention that a charityâ€™s ability to <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> for some or all plaintiffs reveals that immunity doctrine more comfortably fits with contract theories than tort theories...|$|E
