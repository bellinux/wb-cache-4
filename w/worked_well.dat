30|$|The new {{proposed}} algorithm MGswapDD {{has removed}} all faults {{of the existing}} algorithm swapDD and is working well in all possible cases of swapping two deletions. It <b>works</b> <b>well</b> at all boundary conditions. It has also considered the partial overlapping of operations o 1.str and o 2.str. Also if o 1.str completely overlaps by o 2.str or o 2.str completely overlaps by o 1.str, then also it <b>works</b> <b>well</b> totally. Thus, it considers well overlapping and splitting of operations. The MGswapDD is practically implemented in lab and <b>works</b> <b>well</b> on partial or total overlapping of operations. In addition, it <b>works</b> <b>well</b> on not overlapping operations and boundary conditions.|$|R
5|$|This method <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> for digging soft {{dirt and}} gravel near the street surface. However, {{tunnelling}} shields were required for deeper sections, {{such as the}} Harlem and East River tunnels, which used cast-iron tubes. Rock or concrete-lined tunnels were used on segments from 33rd to 42nd streets under Park Avenue; 116th to 120th Streets under Broadway; 145th to Dyckman Streets (Fort George) under Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue; and 96th Street and Broadway to Central Park North and Lenox Avenue.|$|E
5|$|When {{repairs to}} Craven Sluices were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel.

Knock Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock Sluice was built, close to Craven Sluices, and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{took his}} fifth win {{of the season}} when he crossed {{the line at the}} end of the 56th lap, almost 15seconds ahead of the second-placed Massa. Räikkönen took third ahead of Alonso. Heidfeld managed to jump from ninth on the grid to finish in fifth place, just ahead of his {{teammate}} Kubica, who climbed from eleventh on the grid. A one-stop pit strategy <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy faded as he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella. Trulli, Sutil and Kovalainen were the three retirements from the 56lap race.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} AI, which some found inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his {{experience}} of enemies that can see Corvo {{from a great}} distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision. Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to G4's Jake Gaskill, the AI <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them. Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} with ESRO resulted in TSS providing telemetry for ESRO-IA, ESRO-IB, ESRO-2B, HEOS-1, HEOS-2, TD-1A and ESRO-4, {{all of which}} had low-Earth orbits.

As a result, we showed that Shleifer-style yardstick competition, which can <b>work</b> <b>well</b> under the static model, cannot <b>work</b> <b>well</b> under the dynamic model. On the other hand, franchise bidding may <b>work</b> <b>well</b> under certain conditions. Thus, we showed that franchise bidding is superior to yardstick competition...|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} failure modes were loss of {{sensitivity}} caused by dust infiltrating the speaker panels, and internal arcing of the panels caused by excessive {{power to the}} step-up transformer; use at high altitudes may also cause the same effect. Also, because of its novel electrical characteristics, the speaker could cause some amplifiers to become unstable and could result in damage to either or both.

5|$|The {{potential}} {{of both the}} car and Webber, who had certainly <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> to out-qualify his vastly more experienced teammate, was highlighted by the closeness they had to other teams which ran the Renault engine and although the Adrian Newey-designed car had flaws which contributed to Webber's scoreless season to that point. Though {{the pace of the}} car seemed to be picking up, with Coulthard qualifying in the top-10 for the , Webber was unable to convert his early weekend pace into a competitive grid position due to hydraulic problems. His race was much the same with a similar hydraulic problem leading to him retiring early in the race whilst teammate Coulthard notched up the team's first points with a fifth-place finish.|$|E

Alongside Kaepernick, Nevada's rushing offense was led by running back Vai Taua, who ran for 1,420yards and 14touchdowns. With two 1,000-yard rushers {{for the first time}} in school history, Nevada ran for an average of 291.4yards per game. Nevada was ranked fifth nationally in terms of total offense, averaging 510.6yards per game.|$|E

5|$|The {{walls of}} the inner ward contain {{extensive}} first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using {{the water from the}} moat, but the system {{does not appear to have}} <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|E
5|$|According to Piers Jackson, {{the thrust}} of the design was to produce a title that could {{showcase}} the full abilities of the PlayStation Portable, including its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Jackson also asserted that Resurrection was an entirely different game from the original; whilst the studio had taken the basic story and some of the locations from the original game, all the code, graphics and voice actors were changed. New additions to Resurrection included an expanded plot, added mini-games, multiplayer facilities and a cloud save function. During late stages of development, the studio attempted to preserve ideas that they thought <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> in the original, though their uses were altered or repositioned to keep the game fresh even to those who had played the original. The addition of the 'Anubis Stone' sub-plot was to strengthen the story arc and the creation of Al-Zalam was to act as Dan's internal monologue as well as the player's guide.|$|E
5|$|According to Schafer, Brütal Legend {{had been}} in {{development}} since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts. Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E

5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide sequencer. The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase sequencer into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats <b>worked</b> <b>well,</b> with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E
5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both <b>worked</b> <b>well</b> together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E
