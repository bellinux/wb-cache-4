25|$|Since {{the mutual}} {{violence}} of the peasants and the police, among whom there were units of freshly created riot police, <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of hand, on August 20 SL leadership decided to stop the strike. The police, which at first was shocked at {{the magnitude of the}} protest, took their revenge, pacifying villages and beating participants. This in return provoked hatred of the villagers. First processes of the arrested peasants began in December 1937 in the court in Przemyśl. Altogether, around 1000 people were sentenced to up to 5 years. Many of them stayed behind bars until September 1939, when prison guards left their posts behind, escaping the advancing German troops.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} sound in films had created new {{opportunities}} for musicians, and Montaner launched on a new career as a film performer. After a musical number in a 1934 film, she made two films in 1938. Radio, too, was developing as a mass medium which was wide open to musical talent. La Montaner was to {{make good use of}} both these opportunities. But by now her temperament <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of control. Gonzalo Roig detailed the story of her sacking from the Lecuona show, María la O, at the Teatro Martí. During a duet with the tenor about the rekindling of betrayed love, she began to tear his clothes off on stage! That was a step too far for the management.|$|E
25|$|Entering the 1969–70 season, Chappell hit four {{hundreds}} {{to earn a}} {{place on}} an Australian A trip to New Zealand. Scoring 519 runs at 57.70, he was the dominant batsman of the tour and with the Test team failing in South Africa, he only needed a solid start to the next season to force his way in to play against England in the 1970–71 Ashes Series. After acting as twelfth man in the first Test, he was selected to bat at number seven for the second match, the first Test played at Perth's WACA ground. During an historic century on debut, he teamed with Ian Redpath to add 219 runs and haul Australia out of a difficult situation. Just days after the Test, he belted 102 in two hours against the English in a tour match. However, the dream start affected Chappell, who struggled {{for the rest of}} the series, apart from a score of 65 in the last Test. In the main, he <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> by playing too many big shots early in his innings.|$|E
25|$|The Great Revolt {{began in}} the year 66 CE, {{originating}} in Roman and Jewish ethnic and religious tensions. The crisis escalated due to anti-taxation protests and attacks upon Roman citizens. The Roman governor, Gessius Florus, responded by plundering the Jewish Temple, claiming the money was for the Emperor, {{and the next day}} launching a raid on the city, arresting numerous senior Jewish figures. This prompted a wider, large-scale rebellion and the Roman military garrison of Judaea was quickly overrun by the rebels, while the pro-Roman king Herod Agrippa II, together with Roman officials, fled Jerusalem. As it became clear the rebellion <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of control, Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, brought in the Syrian army, based on Legion XII Fulminata and reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order and quell the revolt. Despite initial advances and conquest of Jaffa, the Syrian Legion was ambushed and defeated by Jewish rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon with 6,000 Romans massacred and the Legion's aquila lost. During 66, Judean Free Government was formed in Jerusalem including former High Priest Ananus ben Ananus, Joseph ben Gurion and Joshua ben Gamla elected as leaders. Yosef ben Matityahu was appointed the rebel commander in Galilee and Eleazar ben Hanania as the commander in Edom. Later, in Jerusalem, an attempt by Menahem ben Yehuda, leader of the Sicarii, {{to take control of the}} city failed. He was executed and the remaining Sicarii were ejected from the city. Simon bar Giora, a charismatic, but radical peasant leader, was also expelled by the new government.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using entirely analogue equipment until post-mastering. Grohl {{said it was}} done that way because he felt digital recording <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of control: [...] "when I listen to music these days, and I hear Pro Tools and drums that sound like a machine- it kinda sucks {{the life out of}} music." [...] According to Grohl, the analog strategy would make the record [...] "sound rawer and somewhat imperfect", something which guitarist Chris Shiflett agreed was beneficial, declaring that [...] "rock n'roll is about flaws and imperfections". Bassist Nate Mendel added that [...] "we grew up making records on tape, which has a certain sound, certain limitations", and drummer Taylor Hawkins said that the digital recording in contemporary rock n' roll lead to an artificial sound : [...] "they kinda played it and then how someone else manipulated it in a computer, to make them sound a certain way." [...] Hawkins believed an analog project would help the band reclaim its artistic freedom.|$|E
500|$|Accum paid {{particular}} attention to beer, introducing the subject with the comment: [...] "Malt beverages, and especially port, the preferred drink of the inhabitants of London and other large cities, is among the items which is most frequently adulterated {{in the course of}} supply." [...] He claimed that English beer was occasionally mixed with molasses, honey, vitriol, pepper and even opium. Among the most shocking customs he pointed out was the practice of adding fishberries, part of the Menispermaceae family, to port. It became evident during the French Revolutionary Wars that the practice <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of hand, and Accum attributed the intoxicating power of the drink to the addition of this plant matter. Accum used various sources to substantiate his claims. As evidence for his claims about Cocculus indicus he used, among others, import statistics, which he complemented with observations about when the price of Cocculus indicus from commodity price lists of brewing materials merchants increased. He also looked at historic price trends for the same commodities.|$|E
500|$|The Ramones {{began playing}} gigs in mid-1974, {{with their first}} show at Performance Studios in New York City. The band, {{performing}} in a style {{similar to the one}} used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in downtown Manhattan, specifically CBGB and Max's Kansas City. In early 1975, Lisa Robinson, an editor of Hit Parader and Rock Scene, saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist Joey Ramone related that [...] "Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life, She started writing about us in Rock Scene, and then Lenny Kaye would write about us and we started getting more press like The Village Voice. Word <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out,</b> and people starting coming down." [...] Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted Danny Fields, former manager of the Stooges, and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band [...] "had everything [...] ever liked," [...] and became the manager in November 1975.|$|E

The Symphony Sessions included ten compositions by Foster presented as a [...] "collage of video images" [...] in performance with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Recorded {{over a period of}} five nights in Vancouver, Foster wrote, arranged, produced and played piano for the project (which included a recording of the theme for the 1988 Winter Olympics) with the assistance of Jeremy Lubbock, David Paich, and Lee Ritenour. The music video for [...] "Check It Out", a song that appears on Mellencamp's 1987 album The Lonesome Jubilee, was filmed live at Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana on December 11, 1987. Directed by Marty Callner, Stevie Nicks: Live at Red Rocks is an hour-long recording of a live concert filmed at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado with special guests Mick Fleetwood and Peter Frampton. The music video for U2's [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] was filmed on the roof of a Los Angeles liquor store. During the filming process, police ordered the band to stop the shoot [...] "due to fears the crowd <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of hand".

Tremaine {{accepted}} the rough draft for $850, and announced it in the June 1934 issue, with a full-page editorial and a three-quarter-page advertisement. The novel was published in the August 1934 through February 1935 issues.

He added, [...] "When I read the lyrics I thought, all these guys are totally fucked up. I don't know who they are, because they're not Michael.

The pair picked up a win a few weeks later at the newly opened Eastern Creek Raceway in the 1990 Nissan Sydney 500.

2500|$|His {{last term}} in office was marked by tension between the NSW and Victorian Governments and a view that Askin <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> {{of touch with the}} voters. Late in 1974, Askin {{announced}} his resignation, and his last intervention was to support his Minister for Lands, Thomas Lewis, in his bid to be Askin's successor instead of the Deputy Leader and Minister for Education, Sir Eric Willis. It was reported that Lewis had offered to upgrade Askin's knighthood from Knight Commander (KCMG) to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) of the Order of St Michael and St George, while Willis was uncommitted. Askin retired from politics in January 1975 and was succeeded by Lewis as Premier. On 14 June 1975 he was elevated to Knight Grand Cross, for his service as Premier. [...] His resignation began a turbulent year for the government. [...] Lewis was ousted in a party room coup by Willis in 1976, but Willis only lasted four months before losing the 1976 election to Labor, ending the longest unbroken run for a non-Labor government since World War I. Askin remains the only person to take the Coalition into more than one election as the sitting Liberal Premier.|$|E
