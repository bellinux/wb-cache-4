This presentation will explain how the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries Technical Services implemented changes in workflow for ordering and cataloging e‐books. Including the topics of technology, user expectations, and getting reference librarians on board, we’ll cover the why of e‐books, <b>what</b> has <b>gone</b> <b>well,</b> and where we go from here...|$|R
5000|$|A project audit {{provides}} an opportunity to uncover issues, concerns and challenges encountered during the project lifecycle. Conducted midway through the project, an audit affords the project manager, project sponsor and project team an interim view of <b>what</b> has <b>gone</b> <b>well,</b> {{as well as what}} needs to be improved to successfully complete the project. If done at the close of a project, the audit can be used to develop success criteria for future projects by providing a forensic review. This review identifies which elements of the project were successfully managed and which ones presented challenges. As a result, the review will help the organisation identify what it needs to do to avoid repeating the same mistakes on future projects ...|$|R

Thus, the focus is not merely descriptive. The writer doesn’t just describe the situation, but revisits the scene with more detail and emotion to examine <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>well,</b> or reveal a need for additional learning — and may relate what transpired {{to the rest of the}} author's life.|$|E

The company permanently settled in Minneapolis in 1985 and, in 1992, moved into the renovated Allied Van Lines building in Minneapolis' Warehouse District. In 2001, the five original members officially took on duties as co-artistic directors. This collaborative style of direction made it possible for everyone to have an equal say of <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> onstage, as <b>well</b> as keep their creativity flowing.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, 2003. For most organisations the {{decision}} to implement performance management is not about introducing a completely new process. Most organisations start with annual appraisals and learn from them <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> or bad. Because of being {{under the rule of}} Britain, Lesotho inherited some of the systems mostly followed by many Commonwealth countries in the public service; some of which were confidential reporting systems for appraising employees. Investigations were made about the existing system at that time and the findings indicated {{that most of the people}} did not like it. They said it was subjective, and that it contributed to low morale, and weakened supervision/employee relations. It was realised that a new system was urgently needed. The new system was introduced which was for an open appraisal. Several attempts were made, but they failed because of lack of resources and poor communication and teamwork in the organization. This report sets out the observations and comments on the new system and the findings are discussed together with the implications of the system. The aim of this research is to investigate all the measures concerning the system whether they are being applied correctly, whether all measurements are effectively implemented and if the system is acceptable in the civil service. Finally, whether it fits the culture of the organization. If its not working the way it was expected to, what are the problems and how can such problems be solved?...|$|R

5000|$|Taking {{stock and}} the way forward: This session {{reflected}} on {{the experiences of the}} participants and allowed the stakeholders to discuss <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>well</b> during the week, what went not as well, and finally, what could and should be done to make the 2012 IGF even better. It was seen as important by many that both the theme of the meeting and the discussions in workshops had adequately incorporated the ideas of Internet Governance for Development. Youth participation needs to be strengthened, both physically and remotely, and youth needed to be included in all aspects of the IGF and at all levels, not only in ‘youth’ centered workshops and sessions. Though holding the Forum in Africa for the first time did increase developing country participation, the inclusion of developing country participants, women, and persons with disabilities, among others, must continue to be strengthened and improved each year.|$|E
5000|$|Rosswood, {{also the}} author of children's book My Uncle's Wedding, adopted a child with his husband after researching {{different}} parenting options for almost two years. They researched the differences between adoption, foster care, and surrogacy, eventually deciding on adoption. Speaking of the experience, Rosswood stated, [...] "We found tons of technical information out there from the perspective of agencies and professionals, but it was difficult to findinformation from the perspective of people who went through the journey themselves. <b>What</b> <b>went</b> <b>well?</b> Whatwent wrong? Now that you’ve been through the journey, is there anything you would have done differently?What advice would you give to others? And I didn’t just want these answers for one parenting path; I wantedanswers for all of them so we could compare and decide which would be best for our own family. I couldn’tfind a resource like that so I asked people to help me create one." ...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{attention}} concerning immigrant integration is devoted to problems {{at the bottom of}} society. This is understandable given that Britain?s post-war immigrants have had, for the most part, poorer educational and employment profiles than natives. But it means that problems of equality and opportunity {{at the top of the}} tree sometimes get overlooked. This essay looks at the problems associated with ethnic penalties in the professions, and other high reward/status sectors, and the extent to which these are due to persistent discrimination or to other factors. (And we should bear in mind that one problem here is lack of reliable data.) I will also look at things from the perspective of one runaway successful group, Indians, to assess <b>what</b> has <b>gone</b> <b>well</b> for them and what still holds back further gains...|$|R
5000|$|Reel to Reel is {{the debut}} album by American rapper Grand Puba. It was Puba's first solo venture, {{following}} group projects {{with the likes}} of the short lived group Masters of Ceremony and Brand Nubian. Both of the group’s albums were critically acclaimed but failed to duplicate that success in terms of album sales. The album was largely produced by Puba himself, with help from the Stimulated Dummies, Kid Capri and others. Reel to Reel includes the number one Rap hit [...] "360 Degrees (<b>What</b> <b>Goes</b> Around)", as <b>well</b> as the singles [...] "Check it Out" [...] (featuring a young Mary J.

40|$|Groundhog Day is {{a splendid}} {{film about the}} good life. To be sure, it does not offer a {{complete}} theory of The Good Life; it is a Hollywood blockbuster, after all, no more, no less. However, it presents us with Phil— the protagonist — and {{at the beginning of}} the film, Phil’s life clearly is a poor one, whereas at the end of the film, it is clearly a good one. I feel that if we could only understand what exactly it is that makes the difference between Phil’s poor life at the beginning and his good life at the end of the film, we will have grasped something important about <b>what</b> makes lives <b>go</b> <b>well.</b> In this article, I shall endeavour to develop just such an understanding. <b>What</b> makes lives <b>go</b> <b>well</b> is, of course, one of the oldest and most important questions in moral philosophy and in the course of time philosophers have come up with a number of answers. To name but the three most prominent ones, these are: hedonism, desire satisfaction accounts, and objective list theories. All of these theories have points in their favour, but all of them also face some serious problems and limitations. I will shortly introduce the theories and the film, and then discuss the constituent of the good life that the film illustrates. I shall argue that hedonism and desire satisfaction accounts cannot explain this constituent satisfactorily, and that, while objective list theories can, they can do so only in a very specific manner. I will end by refuting an objection t...|$|R

[...] "There is a strong sense in these communities that Parliament has not yet considered properly this narrowly averted national crisis. We need to establish what went right and also what can be improved upon." [...] He also later stated [...] "It is wrong to dismiss these floods as a once in a 500-year occurrence. There were floods six years ago this context, note the floods in 2007 didn't affect Mr Aldous' home constituency, but Mr. Aldous is making the point that the risk of flooding is a national problem that needs addressing and not just a regional issue. The flood of 2007 caused £6billion worth of damage. I think with rising sea levels these {{are going to be a}} thing of the future and we do need to be looking at protecting the most vulnerable areas." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Teaching in {{the vast}} {{majority}} of subjects, and across all year groups, is usually good and some of it is outstanding. Excellent practice exists in English and drama. Teaching is improving strongly in mathematics, ICT and business studies as a result of effective recruitment. Teaching in PE and modern foreign languages also has strengths.The large majority of teachers have high expectations of what the students can achieve, in keeping with senior leaders’ ambitions. They have good relationships with all students so that lessons are conducted in a pleasant atmosphere.A full range of strategies are used by teachers to ensure that learning is usually tailored to students’ needs. In one drama lesson, students coached each other, judging accurately the quality of each other’s performance and how it could be improved. Teaching in science is not consistently good enough yet to ensure that results are securely good or better. However, when teaching has been planned well, such as in a Year 8 lesson on electromagnetism, progress is faster.Teachers are becoming increasingly good at pausing to check students’ learning in lessons. The most skilled teachers confidently change course when they realise students need more work in a specific topic or skill. Many question students carefully to ensure knowledge is developing and understanding growing.Homework is used by many teachers to extend learning outside lessons. It is sometimes used to prepare for future lessons. These good uses of homework are not found consistently in all subjects. Parents say that the quality of homework has been improved recently but could be even more purposeful. They also say this about marking.Most teachers now mark work in keeping with the academy’s policy. They tell students <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>well</b> and how work might be even better. They increasingly ask students to respond to their marking, but not all students do so. Time is not always provided for students to improve their work or make corrections in lessons" [...] School Report: Woolmer Hill School, Page 5. December 2013 ...|$|E

40|$|Error {{disclosure}} involves initiating open discussions aboutclinical incidents. In {{cases where}} incidents lead to harm (which {{may or may}} not be attributable to an error), their dis-closure engages the people to whom the incident matters most—the patient, the family, the clinicians involved in the incident, and staff who carry general responsibility for the ser-vice. In these conversations, the participants talk about the technical aspects of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> wrong, as <b>well</b> as about their per-sonal experiences and needs. That is why disclosure of incidents harbors an unusual energy: everyone will be seeking what they regard as satisfactory closure. Clinicians, patients, family mem-bers, and support staff alike will want to know what they and others could have done differently, what difference such hypo-thetical actions might have made to what happened, and what they need to do in the future to prevent similar incidents from happening again...|$|R
5000|$|William E. Ketchum III of HipHopDX.com {{said that}} Birdman {{constructs}} a disc full of capable singles {{but not because}} of his own skills on the mic but his producers and his guest stars. Calling the album an album that's much more tolerable than Birdman detractors would expect or like to admit. He talked down to Birdman's rapping saying that [...] "unlike other materialistic rhymers, Birdman doesn't have any redeeming qualities; he doesn't have the charisma of Lil Wayne, he doesn’t have the dry wit and wordplay of Fabolous, and he lacks the larger-than-life persona of Rick Ross. He furthly states that the uninventive rhymes and the unvarying subject matter take their toll. In conclusion he stated that Birdman may {{not know how to}} rap well, but by leading a team of capable emcees and beatmakers around him, he knows how to make music. And in this industry, that sixth sense of knowing <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> where is, <b>well,</b> priceless.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{problems}} that translators of the Holy Qurʾān encounter when translating utterances containing conversational implicatures (henceforth Qurʾānic implicatures), where <b>what</b> is meant <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> beyond <b>what</b> is said into English. The study is based on utterances singled out from the Holy Qurʾān which have been analyzed with reference to three well-known translations of the Qurʾān. The translations provide an empirical basis for {{the discussion of the}} problems while translating Qurʾānic utterances into English. In addition, some well-known exegetes (tafsīr) have been consulted to facilitate the process of analyzing the conversational implicatures in their Qurʾānic context and clarify the intended meaning. Two important and interrelated issues have been discussed. These are: how the utterances, containing conversational implicatures, have been translated and how they should (or can) be translated in accordance with the interpretation. More often than not, translators of the Holy Qurʾān fail to construe some conversational implicatures; therefore some strategies have been suggested by the researcher...|$|R

She takes things very seriously and always tries to change <b>what</b> does not <b>go</b> <b>well.</b> She has {{a talent for}} singing and though {{initially}} ashamed to sing in public, she overcomes this during the series. During the summer (between the first two seasons), she realizes her feelings for Alex.

Nicole becomes frustrated when she sees Emma and Alex together; however, she and Alex eventually begin a relationship, which lasts until the end of Season 2, when she also leaves the band. In Season 3, feeling lost, she helps her former babysitter Sara keep The Blue Factory theatre alive and writes her first song 'Welcome to the Show', encouraged by the singer 'Nobody', and she develops feelings for him, not knowing that he is really Alex in disguise.|$|R

A few tips can make this double task easier. Before the consultation it is possible to define the student's learning objectives and to plan the consultation. During the consultation itself some teaching models exist (One minute preceptor, SNAPP) that facilitate the teaching by maximising the teaching moments for each student-patient encounter.

40|$|AbstractAt {{the request}} of the Dutch {{government}} Shell has been preparing for a possible CO 2 storage project in the town of Barendrecht since 2007. The project involves transport and storage of pure CO 2 produced at the Shell Pernis refinery (a by-product from hydrogen production) through 20 km of pipeline and into two depleted gas fields. Because this is a densely populated area public acceptance was recognised from the start as the key challenge for the project. This paper will describe the key elements of a comprehensive public acceptance strategy, and also a frank analysis of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>well</b> and what didn’t go well on the Barendrecht project...|$|E

40|$|We {{set out in}} {{this book}} to bring {{together}} examples of social work that can be described as'best' practice. As our Introduction makes clear, {{this is not to}} suggest that there is only one way to do social work, or an 'ideal' outcome in any practice situation. Instead the best practice described is about doing 'the best' the social worker is able to do at that time and in that place, in the context of that child and family. Crucially, as the accounts of the practitioners in this book demonstrate, best practice requires a facility for critical reflection, and the ability to act on that reflection to practice skilfully and learn from experience. Naomi, reflecting on her work with Linda, concluded that she could honestly state I could go back and manage that much better now. And Myra's case was important to Clive precisely because of what he learnt about intervening with authority in a chronically harmful situation. This kind of reflection on the process of social work and learning from <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> wrong as <b>well</b> as right is as much part of best - and critical - practice as cases that have unequivocally positive outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study {{is concerned with}} the concept of social inclusion, its significance, its origins, its definition and its history. It looks particularly at its development in the United Kingdom since the election of a Labour Government in 1997 and, in that context, the implementation of a Social Inclusion Strategy by a County Council referred to throughout as ‘Someshire’. It offers as an example of reflective inquiry an evaluation of aspects of the implementation of the Strategy led by the Council’s Education Department and some comments on the Council’s own, previous, evaluation of the whole Strategy. Through this study, it engages with a range of stakeholders including schools, County Council Officers and representatives of parents and school governors in an attempt to discover <b>what</b> has <b>gone</b> <b>well</b> and why. It concludes with a set of recommendations for action by a range of parties who, in their different policy contexts, might wish to promote social inclusion. Finally, this study has been written by a senior Local Education Authority Officer. This results in the emergence of two voices within it. In Chapter 1 there can be perceived the voice of the traditional researcher, attempting what Schon describes as the ‘technical rationality’ of traditional research. In Chapters 2, 4 and, to some extent, 5 the voice changes to that of the ‘reflective practitioner’ with its reliance on the ability to intuit, know-in-action, an ability derived from over thirty years working in education, principally as an educational manager.
