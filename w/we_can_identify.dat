25|$|Example 4. Ultimately {{constant}} sequences. Any Boolean {{combination of}} ultimately constant sequences is ultimately constant; hence these form a Boolean algebra. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> these with the integers by viewing the ultimately-zero sequences as nonnegative binary numerals (bit 0 {{of the sequence}} being the low-order bit) and the ultimately-one sequences as negative binary numerals (think two's complement arithmetic with the all-ones sequence being −1). This makes the integers a Boolean algebra, with union being bit-wise OR and complement being −x−1. There are only countably many integers, so this infinite Boolean algebra is countable. The atoms are the powers of two, namely 1,2,4,.... Another way of describing this algebra is as the set of all finite and cofinite sets of natural numbers, with the ultimately all-ones sequences corresponding to the cofinite sets, those sets omitting only finitely many natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Babylonian civilization, around 1200 B.C., two perfumeresses named Tapputi-Belatekallim and -ninu (first half of her name lost) were able to obtain the {{essences}} from plants by using extraction and distillation procedures. If we are to argue chemistry as the use of chemical equipment and processes, then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> these two women as the first chemists. Even {{during the time of the}} Egyptian dynasty, women were involved in applied chemistry, such as the making of beer and the preparation of medicinal compounds. A good number of women have been recorded to have made major contributions to alchemy. Many of which lived in Alexandria around the 1st or 2nd centuries AD, where the gnostic tradition led to female contributions being valued. The most famous of the women alchemist, Mary the Jewess, is credited with inventing several chemical instruments, including the double boiler (bain-marie); the improvement or creation of distillation equipment of that time. Such distillation equipment were called kerotakis (simple still) and the tribikos (a complex distillation device).|$|E

500|$|More {{recently}} {{it has been}} proposed that the true author was Henry Lovelich, a poet, whom Gregory would have known well, since they are both mentioned in the will of a prominent London merchant in July 1434. J.A.F. Thomson has suggested that, actually, the chronicler was a churchman, due among other things to the quantity of Latin aphorisms the later text contains, compared with the pre-1467 section; either way, Thomson agrees that whoever it was, {{must have been a}} man with [...] "London connections and a pride in the city." [...] One of the most recent biographers Gregory has noted how, in fact, [...] "a single reference, to a papal indulgence issued in 1455, associates Gregory personally with [...] chronicle... but the extent of his authorship is uncertain." [...] For instance Michael Hicks goes no further than to suggest tentatively that, of all the London chroniclers, “at least one was a mayor,” whilst Jeremy Catto believes that [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> no particular individual writer.“ Mary-Rose McLaren summed up the problem facing historians wishing to establish the authorship of the Edgerton MS when she pointed out that, comparing Gregory's chronicle with others of the period, {{there is more than one}} mayor named in it, and that in any case, it is not the only one to name Gregory as the mayor of London during that time.|$|E

2500|$|Excavation of Anglo-Saxon sites has {{produced}} some evidence for limited glass {{working in the}} form of crucibles for melting glass, glass debris and furnaces, although, to date, no furnaces have been found associated with crucibles or glass working debris, or vice versa. All the glass working furnaces that have been found are associated with ecclesiastical sites such as monasteries. This gives the impression that these centres sponsored the majority of glass working in Anglo-Saxon Britain, presumably to primarily work on making glass windows for the church buildings. Documentary sources suggest glass workers were [...] travelling around the country, producing glass on demand, possibly re-using broken glass, rather than there being a single centre producing worked glass objects which would then need to be transported. Although <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> the production processes it is still not known how much glass working took place in the Anglo-Saxon period and how widespread it was. The absence of evidence has often been used to argue that the majority of glass was imported from the continent. But this seems unlikely as there are limited numbers of glass vessel manufacturing sites found elsewhere in Europe and some of the Anglo-Saxon glass vessels are unique to England, suggesting the presence of some manufacture centres, possibly in Kent. Instead the number of glass working sites reflects not only the nature of the fragmented Anglo-Saxon archaeological record but also the nature of glass, which could be melted down and re-used.|$|E

First, we construct the taxonomy of query ambiguity, and ask human annotators to manually classify queries based upon it.

Experimental results show that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> correctly <b>identify</b> 87 % of labeled queries. Finally, we estimate that about 16 % of queries in a real search log are ambiguous...|$|R
