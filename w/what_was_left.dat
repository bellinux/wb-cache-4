5|$|Suslov was {{becoming}} progressively {{more critical of}} Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and his campaign to eliminate <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the old Stalinist guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E

5|$|Avant-garde {{musician}} Pierre Schaeffer led a 498-member French {{rescue team}} {{to look for}} survivors in Leninakan, and worked there until all foreign personnel were asked to leave after the plan to bulldoze <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the ruins was formulated. The total number of volunteer rescue personnel in Leninakan totalled 2,000, with teams from Austria, Canada, Switzerland, the United States and Yugoslavia. Nikolai Ryzhkov, the then Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was awarded the National Hero of Armenia {{for his work in}} rebuilding the city following the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, Nazi Germany made {{increasingly}} aggressive territorial demands, threatening war {{if they were not}} met. It seized Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939. Hitler made a non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas and a German administration was established in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, or shot.|$|E
5|$|Buttressed by <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of {{the legacy}} from his grandmother, Richardson {{determined}} to learn to act. He paid a local theatrical manager, Frank R Growcott, ten shillings a week {{to be a member}} of his company and be taught the craft of an actor. He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott's St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a gendarme in an adaptation of Les Misérables, and was soon entrusted with larger parts including Banquo in Macbeth and Malvolio in Twelfth Night.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Crushing {{can also}} be challenging. In 2013, the Philippines {{resolved}} to crush their five-ton stockpile, {{in part due to}} environmental objections to a large open fire. They first attempted to use a road roller on the tusks and then on smaller, sawn-off pieces. When that did not work, the pieces were repeatedly smashed with a backhoe bucket. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> was taken to a crematory. When the United States held a similar event a few months later, they opted to use a large rock crusher; a short time later, France employed a pulverizer to turn its illegal ivory into a powder onto which was then poured a composite material to ensure that none of the ivory could be used.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Fleetwood {{moved to}} London with Virginie {{and their son}} Louis. He rarely visited Lancashire again, and in 1847 he retired from politics. The family spent some time living in Virginie's home country, Spain. In 1861 Hesketh-Fleetwood {{expressed}} an intention to return to politics, but was prevented from doing so by his failing health. He died {{at his home in}} Piccadilly, London on 12 April 1866, following a lengthy illness. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His son Rev. Peter Louis Hesketh-Fleetwood (1838–1880) succeeded to the baronetcy, which became extinct on his death. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of Hesketh-Fleetwood's land in Lancashire was bought by the Fleetwood Estate Company in 1875.|$|E

5|$|Hugh died on 7 February 1235, at his episcopal {{residence}} at Stow Park. He was buried on 10 February 1235 in Lincoln Cathedral, {{in the north}} aisle. In 1233 he had written a new will, which mentions his brother and a niece named Agatha. He left bequests to his family, his household, Lincoln Cathedral, {{and a number of}} monasteries in his diocese. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> after the specific legacies was to be divided between poor religious houses, such as the Barrow Gurney Nunnery, students and teachers at Oxford University, Jewish converts and the poor on the episcopal manors.|$|E
5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service {{for an extended}} period of time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power for up to three months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of Sikkim, not much {{is known about the}} early history of Gangtok. The {{earliest}} records date from the construction of the hermitic Gangtok monastery in 1716. Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Most of the roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time.|$|E

5|$|On 28 March 2003 the {{pavilion}} at the pierhead caught fire. Fire crews {{were unable to}} save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it. The cause of the fire remains unknown, since fire investigators were unable to access the site for safety reasons, although it {{is thought to have}} been arson. A more severe fire burned through 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|On March 11 Thieu {{convened a}} meeting with Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm, Chief of the ARVN General Staff General Cao Văn Viên, and Lieutenant General Dang Van Quang to discuss the {{military}} situation in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, {{where most of the}} nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend every inch of South Vietnam’s territory, so the military had to be ‘lightened at the top and heavy at the bottom’.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Kateri i Radës {{were transported}} to a {{concrete}} platform {{in the port}} of Otranto as {{a monument to the}} tragedy. The project cost €150 thousand and was entrusted to the Greek sculptor Costas Varotsos. Before the project, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the ship lay {{in a corner of the}} port of Brindisi. The project was titled L'Approdo. Opera all'Umanità Migrante (The Landing. A work dedicated to Migrating Humanity). Photographers Arta Ngucaj and Arben Beqiraj published photographs of the ship on the Albanian-Italian newspaper Shqiptari i Italisë. The families of the dead requested for the relics of Kateri i Radës to be placed in Albania after Italian media reported that it was to be used as a monument.|$|E

5|$|Plans were {{formulated}} on 6 September {{to transport}} the British 1st Airborne Division to Taranto from their base in North Africa. They would {{take advantage of the}} Italian surrender to capture the port and establish anti-aircraft defences. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of the Italian fleet still using the harbour was expected to have left beforehand. The Allies believed that the division would face only minimal opposition and would be able to overcome any resistance with the limited naval support available, as Taranto was outside the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Sicily.|$|E
5|$|That the Germans {{had used}} gas {{chambers}} was confirmed on 23 July 1944, when the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin, Poland, {{was captured by}} Soviet soldiers, with its gas chambers intact and 820,000 shoes. Auschwitz itself was liberated by the 28th and 106th corps of the 1st Ukrainian Front of the Red Army on 27 January 1945. The SS had tried to destroy the evidence, but the Red Army found <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of four crematoria, as well as 5,525 pairs of women's shoes, 38,000 pairs of men's, 348,820 men's suits, 836,225 items of women's clothing, large numbers of toothbrushes, glasses and dentures, and seven tons of hair.|$|E
5|$|While Marlborough {{achieved}} honours on the battlefield, the Whigs, {{now in the}} ascendancy, {{drove the}} remaining Tories from the Cabinet. Marlborough and Godolphin, now distanced from Anne, would henceforth have {{to conform to the}} decisions of a Whig ministry, while the Tories, sullen and vengeful, looked forward to their former leaders' downfall. To compound his troubles, the Duchess, spurred on by her hatred of Harley and Abigail, had finally driven the Queen to distraction and wrecked <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> of their friendship.
