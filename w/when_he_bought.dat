5|$|One of {{the first}} notable people to have lived in Chiswick was the artist William Hogarth, who lived in Chiswick from 1749, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> the house now known as Hogarth's House. Hogarth {{lived in the house}} until his death in 1764. He is buried in St Nicholas's churchyard. The house later belonged to the poet and {{translator}} of Dante, Henry Francis Cary, who lived there from 1814 to 1833.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{of country}} estates became common around the 1920s. The annual tax payable had spiralled and was twenty {{times greater than}} in 1870 {{resulting}} in the break-up of many larger land-holdings. Pitfour was no exception and the dispersal of the estate continued piecemeal after the sequestration of George Arthur, the sixth laird. The main estate policies including the lake and other land were purchased by Bernard Drake in November 1926 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> Saplinbrae, the former minister's house. Drake was {{a partner in the}} electrical engineering company, Drake and Gorham.|$|E
5|$|In 1305 he is {{mentioned}} in a Venetian document among local sea captains regarding {{the payment of}} taxes. His relation with a certain Marco Polo, who in 1300 was mentioned with riots against the aristocratic government, and escaped the death penalty, as well as riots from 1310 led by Bajamonte Tiepolo (by mother side grandson of Trogir count Stjepko Šubić) and Marco Querini, among whose rebels were Jacobello and Francesco Polo from another family branch, is unclear. Polo is clearly mentioned again after 1305 in Maffeo's testament from 1309–1310, in a 1319 document according to which he became owner of some estates of his deceased father, and in 1321, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> {{part of the family}} property of his wife Donata.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Sir Roger Lewknor in 1543, his estates were divided among his descendants, and the castle and manor were split. John Levett of Salehurst {{purchased}} the castle in 1588. In 1623, most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir Nicholas Tufton, later Earl of Thanet. His son, John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet, inherited Nicholas's property on his father's death in 1631; it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> Bodiam Castle in 1639. John Tufton was {{a supporter of the}} Royalist cause during the English Civil War, and led an attack on Lewes, and was involved in a Royalist defeat at Haywards Heath. Parliament confiscated some of his lands in 1643, and more in 1644, as well as fining him £9,000 (£ today). To help pay his fine, Tufton sold Bodiam Castle for £6,000 (£ today) in March 1644 to Nathaniel Powell, a Parliamentarian.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{his wealth}} briefly surpassed $101billion. Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal {{value of his}} Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion. Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.|$|E
5|$|To the south, is the Croquet lawn, {{previously}} {{a tennis}} court – Lady Churchill was an accomplished and competitive player of both, although Churchill was not. Beyond the lawn {{are a number of}} structures grouped around the Victorian kitchen garden, many of which Churchill was involved in building. He had developed an interest in bricklaying <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> Chartwell and throughout the 1920s and 1930s constructed walls, a summerhouse and a number of houses on the estate. In 1928 he joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, a move which caused some controversy. Near the kitchen garden are the Golden Rose walk, a Golden Wedding anniversary present to the Churchills from their children in 1958, and Churchill's painting studio, constructed in the 1930s, which now houses a large collection of his artistic works.|$|E

He bought camps and timberland in Canada, then in the upper peninsula of Michigan and finally in Northern California.|$|E
25|$|Children were {{frequently}} {{employed in the}} mills. The proprietor of a factory in New Lanark said that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> the mill he found 500 children working there, mostly {{between the ages of}} five and eight, who had been taken from the poor-houses. Although the children had been well fed and clothed, their growth was stunted in many cases. Another mill owner claimed that most of the children he employed, who were under the age of ten, had very poor parents. If they were deprived of work this would cause great hardship.|$|E

25|$|Baucus {{came under}} fire from critics calling him a beltway insider who no longer really lives in Montana and only {{occasionally}} comes to visit. Until 1991, Baucus owned a house in Missoula, where he practiced law for three years before running for Congress in 1974. He didn't own a home again in Montana until February 2002, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> half of his mother's house from the Sieben Ranch Company, the ranch started by Baucus's great-grandfather in 1897.

25|$|On 4 March 1994, McCann bought Celtic for £9million, finally wresting {{control from}} the family dynasties that had run the club for almost 100 years. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> the club it was {{reported}} to be within 24 hours of entering receivership due to exceeding a £5million overdraft with the Bank of Scotland. He turned Celtic into a public limited company through a share issue which raised over £14million, the most successful share issue in British football history. He also oversaw the building of a new stadium, the 60,000 seater Celtic Park, which cost £40million and at the time was Britain's largest capacity football club stadium. This allowed Celtic to progress as a club because over £20million was being raised each year from season ticket sales.|$|E
25|$|Leung {{came under}} severe {{criticism}} in January 2003 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> a HK$790,000 (US$101,282) Lexus LS 430, {{just weeks before}} he raised the tax on new vehicles in his March budget. Although Leung claimed that he had decided on the tax increase after buying the car, which he said his family needed because of the arrival of his first-born in February. Leung denied {{that he was trying}} to avoid the new tax, which would have cost him an additional HK$180,000. (USD 23,000). However, unlike other members of the Executive Council, Leung had failed to disclose the purchase to the council. News of the car purchase dealt a blow to the Hong Kong government's credibility as well as to the effectiveness of the newly introduced Principal Officials Accountability System (POAS).|$|E

25|$|The Boarman family home, {{commonly}} known as the Boarman House, is an historical landmark in the state of West Virginia. It {{is one of the oldest}} brick buildings in downtown Martinsburg and part of the city's walking tour of Civil War landmarks. Originally built by Philip Nadenbousch, it was purchased by Lieutenant Charles Boarman in 1832 and remained in the Boarman family for over a century before being sold to the King’s Daughters Circle in December 1943, and then to the Sisters of the Holy Ghost in 1953; the building was used for apartments and various offices, including an employment office for returning World War II servicemen, during this time. It was purchased in 1980 by West Virginia nonprofit corporation Associates for Community Development and, after extensive restorations, housed the Boarman Arts Center and the Martinsburg-Berkeley County Convention and Visitors Bureau from 1987 to 2001; the building featured Boarman's navigator's log and two portraits, one <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> the house as a young lieutenant and the other as an older officer.

25|$|In 1831 {{the federal}} {{survey of the}} Northwest Territory reached the Grand River; it set the {{boundaries}} for Kent County, named after prominent New York jurist James Kent. In 1833, a land office was established in White Pigeon, Michigan, with Campau and fellow settler Luther Lincoln seeking land in the Grand River valley. Lincoln purchased land {{in what is now}} known as Grandville, while Campau became perhaps the most important settler <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> 72 acres (291,000 m²) from the federal government for $90 and named his tract Grand Rapids. Over time, it developed as today's main downtown business district. In the spring of 1833, Campau sold Joel Guild, who traveled from New York, a plot of land for $25.00, with Guild building the first frame structure in Grand Rapids, which is now where McKay Tower stands. Guild later became the postmaster, with mail at the time being delivered monthly from the Gull Lake, Michigan to Grand Rapids.
