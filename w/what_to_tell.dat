5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E

John Callahan was unaware of any such incident, considering it a likely early flight of a stealth bomber, then in development. He asked the Alaskan Region to forward the relevant data to their technical center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he and his superior played back the radar data and tied it in with the voice tapes by videotaping the concurrent playbacks.|$|E

2500|$|... "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" [...] {{was written}} by Al Jean and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer. The character is based on Lou Grant, the character Asner played in the series The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. The episode features several other references to popular culture. For example, the song Homer sings upon being given the food critic job is set to the tune of [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] from the musical West Side Story. The restaurant Planet Springfield is a parody of Planet Hollywood, containing items such as the film script for The Cable Guy (1996), Herbie from The Love Bug (1968), a model of the RMS Titanic from Titanic (1997), an alien similar to those from Mars Attacks! (1996), models of a TIE fighter, an X-wing fighter and C-3PO from the Star Wars saga, as well as [...] "the coffee mug" [...] from the film Heartbeeps (1981) and [...] "the cane" [...] from Citizen Kane (1941), which is not a real prop.

2500|$|Rabbi Joshua ben Levi {{explained}} how, as [...] reports, Moses knew <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Aaron {{what to do}} to make atonement for the people, {{to stand}} between the dead and the living, and to check the plague. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that when Moses ascended on high (as [...] reports), the ministering angels asked God what business one born of woman had among them. God told them that Moses had come to receive the Torah. The angels questioned why God was giving to flesh and blood the secret treasure that God had hidden for 974 generations before God created the world. The angels asked, in the words of [...] "What is man, that You are mindful of him, and the son of man, that You think of him?" [...] God told Moses to answer the angels. Moses asked God what was written in the Torah. In [...] God said, [...] "I am the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the Land of Egypt." [...] So Moses asked the angels whether the angels had gone down to Egypt or were enslaved to Pharaoh. As the angels had not, Moses asked them why then God should give them the Torah. Again, [...] says, [...] "You shall have no other gods," [...] so Moses asked the angels whether they lived among peoples that engage in idol worship. Again, [...] (20:8 in the NJPS) says, [...] "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy," [...] so Moses asked the angels whether they performed work from which they needed to rest. Again, [...] (20:7 in the NJPS) says, [...] "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain," [...] so Moses asked the angels whether there were any business dealings among them in which they might swear oaths. Again, [...] (20:12 in the NJPS) says, [...] "Honor your father and your mother," [...] so Moses asked the angels whether they had fathers and mothers. Again, [...] (20:13 in the NJPS) says, [...] "You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal," [...] so Moses asked the angels whether there was jealousy among them and whether the Evil Tempter was among them. Immediately, the angels conceded that God's plan was correct, and each angel felt moved to love Moses and give him gifts. Even the Angel of Death confided his secret to Moses, and that is how Moses knew what to do when, as [...] reports, Moses told Aaron {{what to do to}} make atonement for the people, to stand between the dead and the living, and to check the plague.|$|E
