He was a key player in securing passage of the motor voter law in 1993. He supported increases to the federal minimum wage and a 1996 <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> <b>bill.</b> A supporter of research into clean coal technology, he also worked with West Virginia senator Jay Rockefeller to secure better retirement benefits for coal miners.

Welfare is not to be a permanent status for anyone in life." [...] At the time welfare caseloads climbed 36 percent from 1988 while one out of twelve Virginians were receiving food stamps. [...] In March 1995, after an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of support, Allen signed his <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> <b>bill</b> propelling Virginia ahead of the national welfare reform effort, [...] Among the key provisions outlined in the bill, the Virginia Initiative for Employment Not Welfare (VIEW) limited Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) benefits for welfare recipients to two years while recipients are required to work within ninety days of receiving benefits. [...] Following VIEW's implementation, welfare caseloads decreased 33 percent, from 73,926 families in March 1995 to 49,609 families in July 1997.

5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> <b>bills</b> that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich and {{his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|R
50|$|However, the Democrats {{lost their}} {{majority}} {{in both houses}} of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> <b>bills</b> before signing the third, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996. The tort reform Private Securities Litigation Reform Act passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party; Clinton enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico over unions' strong objections. In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives impeached Clinton on two charges; he was subsequently acquitted by the United States Senate in 1999. Under Clinton's leadership, the United States participated in NATO's Operation Allied Force against Yugoslavia that year.|$|R

5000|$|One {{of these}} <b>reforms</b> was the <b>Welfare</b> <b>Reform</b> and Work <b>Bill,</b> {{supported}} by Iain Duncan Smith (Secretary of State for Work and Pensions) and the Conservative Party. Many people have criticised the bill, with some even going {{as far as}} to defining it as a [...] "Pandora's box for Britain's poorest families". The cuts to tax credits have been criticised for unfairly disadvantaging the working poor, and a clause in the bill allows the benefits cap of £20,000 (£23,000 in London) to be reduced further, without any consultation with Parliament, thus making those from larger families even worse off. It also called for £12bn to be made in cuts, in accordance with the government's policy of austerity.|$|R
