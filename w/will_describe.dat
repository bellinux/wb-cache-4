25|$|In the {{following}} we <b>will</b> <b>describe</b> {{the role of}} injective resolutions {{in the context of}} the derived category, which is the basis for defining right derived functors, which in turn have important applications in cohomology of sheaves on topological spaces or more advanced cohomology theories like étale cohomology or group cohomology.|$|E
25|$|The {{polarization}} {{of the incoming}} photon (or beam) can be resolved as two polarizations on the x and y axis. If the input polarization {{is parallel to the}} fast or slow axis, then there is no {{polarization of}} the other axis, so the output polarization {{is the same as the}} input (only the phase more or less delayed). If the input polarization is 45° to the fast and slow axis, the polarization on those axes are equal. But the phase of the output of the slow axis will be delayed 90° with the output of the fast axis. If not the amplitude but both sinus values are displayed, then x and y combined <b>will</b> <b>describe</b> a circle. With other angles than 0° or 45° the values in fast and slow axis will differ and their resultant output <b>will</b> <b>describe</b> an ellipse.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} we <b>will</b> <b>describe</b> right derived functors. So, assume that F is left exact. Typical examples are F: A → Ab given by X ↦ Hom(X, A) or X ↦ Hom(A, X) for some fixed object A, or the global sections functor on sheaves or the direct image functor. Their right derived functors are Extn(ndash&,A), Extn(A,ndash&), H'n(X, F) or R'n'flowast& (F), respectively.|$|E

2500|$|... "Altar" [...] has {{a meaning}} in the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches that varies with context. Its most common usage does not denote the table itself, but the area {{surrounding}} it; that is to say, the entire sanctuary. This includes both the area behind the iconostasis, and the soleas (the elevated projection {{in front of the}} iconostasis), and the ambo. When one enters the sanctuary, one is said to be [...] "going into the altar". The altar table itself may be referred to as either the Holy Table or the Throne (chu Prestól).
