50|$|Before <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> SUGRA proper, let's recapitulate some {{important}} details about general relativity. We have a 4D differentiable manifold M with a Spin(3,1) principal bundle over it. This principal bundle represents the local Lorentz symmetry. In addition, {{we have a}} vector bundle T over the manifold with the fiber having four real dimensions and transforming as a vector under Spin(3,1).We have an invertible linear map from the tangent bundle TM to T. This map is the vierbein. The local Lorentz symmetry has a gauge connection associated with it, the spin connection.|$|E
50|$|Consider a Bubblesort, where {{adjacent}} {{records are}} swapped {{in order to}} get them into the right order, so that records appear to “bubble” up and down through the dataspace. If this has to be done in chunks, then when we have sorted all the records in chunk 1, <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> chunk 2, but we find that some of the records in chunk 1 need to “bubble through” chunk 2, and vice versa (i.e., there are records in chunk 2 that belong in chunk 1, and records in chunk 1 that belong in chunk 2 or later chunks). This will cause the chunks to be read and written back to disk many times as records cross over the boundaries between them, resulting in a considerable degradation of performance. If the data can all be held in memory as one large chunk, then this performance hit is avoided.|$|E
50|$|A Place {{beneath the}} Pipal Tree {{is about three}} generations of Sherpa women and their {{relationship}} with their own people, the monastic order in a famous monastery, and the ruling elite of Nepal. Of all her novels this one {{tells the story of}} a world that is now fast vanishing, of a time of hope in Nepal, and the fear of disintegration and things falling apart. By the time <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the current work in process, 'River', things have already fallen apart in Nepal and the poor are exploited as labourers in the Gulf States. This novel deals with Hari Prasad, a humble river boatman, who sells his labour through the auspices of a corrupt brother-in-law who is a politician in Kathmandu. Hari Prasad is eventually murdered and the denouement of this story deals with an essentially corrupt society where parties tout political ideals to which they do not adhere and the majority have to cope in whatever way they can.|$|E

50|$|Lifestyles as {{styles of}} thought: The {{approach}} interpreting lifestyles as principally styles of thought {{has its roots}} in the soil of psychological analysis. Initially, starting with Alfred Adler, a lifestyle was understood as a style of personality, in the sense that the framework of guiding values and principles which individuals develop in the first years of life end up defining a system of judgement which informs their actions throughout their lives. Later, particularly in Milton Rokeach’s work, Arnold Mitchell’s VALS research and Lynn Kahle’s LOV research, lifestyles’ analysis developed as profiles of values, reaching the hypothesis that it is possible to identify various models of scales of values organized hierarchically, to which different population sectors correspond. Then with Daniel Yankelovich and William Wells <b>we</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the so-called AIO approach in which attitudes, interests and opinions are considered as fundamental lifestyles’ components, being analysed from both synchronic and diachronic points of view and interpreted on the basis of socio-cultural trends in a given social context (as, for instance, in Bernard Cathelat’s work). Finally, a further development leads to the so-called profiles-and-trends approach, at the core of which is an analysis of the relations between mental and behavioural variables, bearing in mind that socio-cultural trends influence both the diffusion of various lifestyles within a population and the emerging of different modalities of interaction between thought and action.|$|E

Should a person later forget that they have adopted du, it is polite to remind them by saying, Wir waren doch per du (<b>We</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> 'du' terms).
