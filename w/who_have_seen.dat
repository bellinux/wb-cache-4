25|$|Such appreciations have {{subsequently}} been rare, and the self-contained artificiality of Clair's films, {{his insistence}} on the meticulous preparation of an often literary script, and his preference for filming in studio sets rather than on location increasingly set him apart from modern trends in film-making.

25|$|Among {{advanced}} players, {{there is}} little argument about whether technological changes have enabled higher scoring. The general consensus has been that they have.

Some argue that such high technology unfairly affects competition, making high scores too dependent on how much money one spends on equipment. The USBC, for various reasons, has struggled to regulate these changes well enough to protect the integrity of their honor score award program.|$|E

25|$|A {{great deal}} of effort is {{expended}} in keeping the Muggles unaware of magic. Originally the two worlds co-existed, however, persecution of those with magic meant Magical Laws {{have been put in}} place over the centuries, designed to keep the existence of the Magical World hidden from Muggles, the first and most important being the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692. Enchantment of Muggle artifacts is forbidden; under-age wizards are restricted from using magic outside school and any deliberate revelation of magical ability to the Muggle community is punishable, although allowances are made for the use of magic {{in the presence of a}} Muggle in case of life-threatening situation (for the wizard or the muggle). These laws are enforced by the Ministry of Magic, while a special arm of it, the Obliviators, has the job of making certain that Muggles <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> magic in action will be left with no inconvenient memories. Exceptions to the secrecy include wizards' Muggle relatives and the high political leaders, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for instance.|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations with people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the film the other way round.

What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E

[...] As a result, Holmes was taken to the town's whipping post on 5 September 1651 and given 30 lashes with a three-corded whip. [...] He told the magistrates, [...] "You have struck me as with roses", and he claimed to have felt no pain during the incident; however, he could only sleep by resting on his knees and elbows for many days afterwards.

500|$|Arctic Monkeys {{wasted no}} time in {{recording}} new material, and released a five-track EP on 24 April 2006, titled Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys?. Due to its length, the EP was ineligible to chart as a UK single or album. Furthermore, the record's graphic language has resulted in significantly less radio airplay than previous records, although this was not a reported concern according to an insider – [...] "since they made their name on the Internet... they don't care if they don't get radio play". The release of the EP Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? just three months after their record-breaking debut album has been criticised by some, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it as [...] "money-grabbing" [...] and [...] "cashing in on their success". The band countered that it regularly releases new music not to make money, but to avoid the [...] "boredom" [...] of [...] "spending three years touring on one album".|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Crawford's {{technique}} was also orthodox, {{although he was}} unusual in using his second and third fingers to spin the ball—most bowlers used their first and second. His bowling pace varied from fast to medium, and he spun the ball so much that his fingers snapped audibly as he released it. An accurate bowler, {{it was difficult for}} batsmen to score runs against him. Crawford could swing the ball away from the bat, but his most effective delivery was his off break: Clem Hill stated that Crawford could make the ball turn several inches, despite the hard pitches prevalent in Australia when he played there. John Arlott described him as [...] "the schoolboy genius who turned on Australian pitches where no one else deviated from straight". In 1937, Herbie Collins wrote, at a time when Wally Hammond was considered to be the world's leading all-rounder, that [...] "people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> both men consider [...] a better all-rounder".|$|E

[...] Those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> Maulbetsch in action marvel at the great momentum he can get up {{in two or three}} steps." [...] Noted football writer Walter Eckersall said: [...] "Mauly is a little fellow, being built close to the ground. [...] They say that when he plunges at the line his head is almost on a level with his shoe tops – that he hits so low that it's well nigh impossible to stop him." [...] An Iowa newspaper wondered how it was possible [...] "for a man to smash into a line of human bodies with the force that Maulbetsch does and come out of the game without a broken neck." ...|$|E

500|$|Hearing about Citizen Kane enraged Hearst so {{much that}} he banned any advertising, reviewing, or {{mentioning}} of it in his papers, and had his journalists libel Welles. Welles used Hearst's opposition as a pretext for previewing the film in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging. A special press screening took place in early March. Henry Luce was in attendance and reportedly wanted to buy the film from RKO for $1 million to distribute it himself. The reviews for this screening were positive. A Hollywood Review headline read, [...] "Mr. Genius Comes Through; 'Kane' Astonishing Picture". The Motion Picture Herald reported about the screening and Welles's intention to sue RKO. Time magazine wrote that [...] "The objection of Mr. Hearst, who founded a publishing empire on sensationalism, is ironic. For to most of the several hundred people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the film at private screenings, Citizen Kane is the most sensational product of the U.S. movie industry." [...] A second press screening occurred in April.|$|E
500|$|In April 1973, the Manchester Union Leader accused Chotiner {{of having}} {{organized}} the Watergate break-in. He responded by bringing suit for libel against the Union Leader and its lead investigator. In December 1973, the parties reached a settlement by which Chotiner received an undisclosed, but substantial, {{sum of money}} and the newspaper printed a front-page apology and retraction of its accusations in its December 31, 1973 edition. Chotiner described Watergate in January 1973 as [...] "a stupid, useless, inane experiment by people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> too many TV shows and especially too many productions of [...] ". According to The Washington Post, Chotiner was not close to Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and most other staffers at the White House and CRP. In a taped discussion of the fallout from Watergate, Haldeman told Nixon that his former campaign manager was not [...] "wired in", and the President expressed strong opposition to Chotiner {{being used as a}} White House contact. At the suggestion that Chotiner could defend him, Nixon worried that the attorney might not be willing to do so.|$|E

[...] Of the poems, he said [...] "I have been reading them with delight." [...] Yale poet Edward Rowland Sill, professor at the University of California and a keen critic of American literature, gave Coolbrith a letter of introduction that he wished her to send to publisher Henry Holt. It said, simply, [...] "Miss Ina Coolbrith, one of our few really literary persons in California, and the writer of many lovely poems; in fact, the most genuine singer the West has yet produced." [...] Quaker poet and former abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier wrote to Coolbrith from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to share his opinion that her [...] "little volume" [...] of poetry, [...] "which has found such favor with all <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it {{on this side of the}} Rocky mountains", should be republished on the East Coast.
