40|$|International audienceCompacted {{mixture of}} {{bentonite}} and sand {{has been proposed}} for using as buffer/backfill material in the disposal of high-level radioactive waste in many countries. The hydraulic behaviors and deformation properties of this material can {{be influenced by the}} chemical composition of groundwater. In the present work, the infiltration test of Pb(II) solution was conducted on compacted Gaomiaozi (GMZ) bentonite/sand mixture under unconfined conditions. The moisture migration characteristics and swelling properties were analyzed. Results show that the moisture migrates more quickly in the GMZ bentonite/sand mixture infiltrated with Pb(II) solutions than that in the pure GMZ bentonite hydrated with pure water for a same bentonite dry density. This difference could be explained by the chemical influence of Pb(II) on the thickness of diffuse double layer. For the bentonite/sand mixture with high bentonite content, its hydraulic conductivity depends on the bentonite dry density, regardless of the influence of the sand content. The hydration rate of the specimen {{is a function of the}} infiltration time and the distance from the <b>wetting</b> <b>end.</b> The largest swelling deformation was observed at the <b>wetting</b> <b>end.</b> At a given location, the vertical displacement was larger than any unilateral one of both sides. After the infiltration test, the inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer, mercury intrusion porosimetry, and environmental scanning electron microscope tests were conducted for investigation of the Pb(II) distribution and microstructural characteristics of the tested specimen. Results show that, as the distance from the <b>wetting</b> <b>end</b> increases, the Pb(II) content nonlinearly decreases from 4. 48 to 0. 07 mg/g while the micro-pore increases and the macro-pore decreases...|$|R

Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD). High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.|$|E
50|$|Retention agents (retention aids) {{are used}} in the {{papermaking}} industry. These are added in the <b>wet</b> <b>end</b> of the paper machine to improve retention fine particles and fillers during the formation of paper. Retention aids {{can also be used to}} improve the retention of other papermaking chemicals, including sizing and cationic starches. The improved retention of papermaking furnish components improves the operational efficiency of the paper machine, reduces the solids and organic loading in the process water loop, and can lower overall chemical costs. Typical chemicals used as retention aids are: polyacrylamide (PAM), polyethyleneimine (PEI), colloidal silica, and bentonite.|$|E

40|$|Direct dye {{with a high}} {{affinity}} for cellulose substrate was utilized as a cellulose anchor to promote retention of paper strengthening additives under various conditions associated with the <b>wet</b> <b>end</b> of a paper machine. Direct Red 28 (DR) was covalently linked to anionic polyacrylamide (A-PAM) via a condensation reaction using water-soluble carbodiimide. The DR-conjugated A-PAM (DR-A-PAM) demonstrated good retention efficiency, resulting in strength enhancement of handsheets. Anionic trash showed no interference {{with the performance of}} DR-A-PAM in the <b>wet</b> <b>end,</b> while the additive performance was sensitive to calcium ions. Surface plasmon resonance analysis gave useful information on the cellulose-anchoring ability of DR-A-PAM.

These results suggest that anionic DR moieties in DR-A-PAM molecules served as a cellulose-anchor, possibly due to multiple CH-π interaction between hydrophobic face of cellulose substrate and π-conjugated system of dye molecules.
