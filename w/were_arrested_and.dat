5|$|Tensions mounted {{over the}} {{following}} week as sit-in demonstrations spread to other cities and race riots broke out in nearby Chattanooga. On February 27, the Nashville student activists held a fourth sit-in at the Woolworths, McClellan, and Walgreens stores. Crowds of white youths again gathered in the stores to taunt and harass the demonstrators. This time, however, police were not present. Eventually, several of the sit-in demonstrators were attacked by hecklers in the McClellan and Woolworths stores. Some were pulled from their seats and beaten, and one demonstrator was pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs. When police arrived, the white attackers fled and none were arrested. Police then ordered the demonstrators at all three locations to leave the stores. When the demonstrators refused to leave, they <b>were</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>and</b> loaded into police vehicles as onlookers applauded. Eighty-one students <b>were</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>and</b> charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.|$|E

5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members <b>were</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>and</b> imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E

5|$|As the Polish troops {{entered the}} city, the first pogrom in modern Vilnius started, {{as noted by}} the Timothy D. Snyder, citing Michał Pius Römer. Dozens of people {{connected}} with the Lit-Bel <b>were</b> <b>arrested,</b> <b>and</b> some were executed; Norman Davies cites a death toll for all – Jews and non-Jews, under Polish rule – as 65. Jews constituted close to one-half of Vilnius's population, according to the German census of 1916, and many victims of fighting and subsequent repression in Vilnius were Jews. Henry Morgenthau, Sr. counted 65, Joseph W. Bendersky counted over a hundred.|$|E

5|$|Chinese media {{coverage}} of the Ürümqi riots was extensive, and was compared favourably to that of the unrest in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications were immediately cut off. In the weeks that followed, official sources reported that over 1,000 Uyghurs <b>were</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>and</b> detained; Uyghur-run mosques were temporarily closed. The communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of January 2010. By November2009, over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during the riots. Nine were executed in November 2009, and by February 2010, at least 26 had received death sentences.|$|E

During post-war questioning, Horthy insisted that he had not wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Bačka, but these claims have been dismissed by Tomasevich.|$|E

5|$|In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs {{founded the}} Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers.

Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013. Plans have since been made to erect 189 dwellings and a museum on the site.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, the Nazis felt {{strong enough}} to try to seize power in Munich. They decided to march on the city, {{inspired}} by Benito Mussolini's successful march on Rome. Known as the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler and his paramilitary Sturmabteilung (SA) troops failed {{to take control of}} Munich. Schaub and other Nazis <b>were</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>and</b> imprisoned with Hitler at Landsberg Prison.
