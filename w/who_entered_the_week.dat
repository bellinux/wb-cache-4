50|$|Big Brother (Slovenia) Season 2 ran for 92 days, {{starting}} on March 14, 2008, and ending on June 14, 2008. The {{host of the}} show was Nina Osenar. The prize was 92,000 Euro. This season the Big brother house was divided into two sides the rich side and the poor side. There were thirteen housemates <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> house on day one and four <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> at later dates. As an added twist this season two of the contestants (Tamara and Tjasa) were related. Also Mateja <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> house in <b>week</b> six was <b>the</b> girlfriend of housemate EITyeb. The winner of this season was Naske Mehić.|$|R
40|$|Forearm {{bone mineral}} content (BMC), as {{evaluated}} by photonabsorption densitometry, was measured in 28 cadaver kidney donor recipients <b>who</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> study 8 <b>weeks</b> postoperatively and were followed up for 18 months. BMC decreased signifiantly (p< 0. 05) but marginally in placebo-treated patients (n= 14) (initial BMC 1. 09 ± 0. 25 g/cm; final BMC 1. 05 ± 0. 24). Fourteen patients were prophylactically given 1, 25 (OH) 2 vitamin D 3 in a dose which avoided hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria (sim 0. 25 µg/day); under 1, 25 (OH) 2 vitamin D 3 prophylaxis a significant decrease of forearm BMC was observed no longer (initial BMC 0. 94 ± 0. 21 g/cm; final BMC 0. 95 ± 0. 21), but the difference between placebo and 1, 25 (OH) 2 vitamin D 3 narrowly missed statistical significance (p= 0. 066). It is concluded that the decrease of forearm BMC is negligible in transplant recipients with low steroid regimens. The data suggest a trend for prophylaxis with 1, 25 (OH) 2 vitamin D 3 to slightly ameliorate forearm (cortical) BMC loss. ...|$|R
