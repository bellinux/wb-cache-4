Realizing that the Somoza dictatorship was unsustainable, the Carter administration attempted to force him to leave Nicaragua.

At that point, the U.S. ambassador sent a cable to the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>saying</b> it would be [...] "ill-advised" [...] to call off the bombing, because such an action would help the Sandinistas gain power. When ABC reporter Bill Stewart was executed by the National Guard, and graphic film of the killing was broadcast on American TV, the American public became more hostile to Somoza. In the end, President Carter refused Somoza further U.S. military aid, believing that the repressive nature of the government had led to popular support for the Sandinista uprising.|$|R

Romm and her husband left the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> without meeting the president, and the Romms received an apology from the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>saying</b> that it was not <b>white</b> <b>house</b> policy to question writers and editors waiting to meet the president.|$|R

Hyams said he and Blackburn had been introduced by Confederate agent Stuart Robinson at the Queen's Hotel in Toronto in December 1863. According to Hyams, he had agreed to help Blackburn smuggle trunks of clothes used by patients infected with yellow fever into Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington D.C.; New Bern, North Carolina; and Norfolk, Virginia (the latter two cities being occupied by Union troops). Hyams said he was instructed to sell the trunks' contents to used clothing merchants, and that Blackburn, subscribing to the common nineteenth century belief that yellow fever could be spread by contact, hoped that by dispersing the [...] "contaminated" [...] articles throughout these major cities he could trigger an epidemic that would cripple the Northern war effort. Hyams further alleged that Blackburn had filled a valise with fine shirts and instructed him to deliver it to President Abraham Lincoln at the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>saying</b> they were from an anonymous admirer. Upon completion of these tasks, Hyams said, Blackburn had promised to pay him $60,000. Hyams claimed he delivered the trunks as agreed, but did not attempt to deliver the valise to President Lincoln. According to his testimony, he never received more than nominal compensation for his efforts, partially prompting his decision to reveal the plot to the authorities.|$|R
2500|$|Following their Stanley Cup win, the Bruins lost Mark Recchi to retirement, and Michael Ryder and Tomas Kaberle to free agency. The Bruins tweaked their roster {{by adding}} defenseman Joe Corvo and forward Benoit Pouliot. On October 6, 2011 - prior their first home {{game of the}} 2011-12 season against the Philadelphia Flyers - the Bruins raised their 2011 Stanley Cup Champions Banner to the roof at TD Garden. Members of the 1972 Championship Team, with Milt Schmidt and Bobby Orr leading the way, participated in the {{official}} Banner Raising Ceremony. The Bruins' short summer took its toll early, going 3–7–0 {{in the month of}} October, before responding with a 21–3–1 record to cap off 2011, highlighted by a near-perfect November in which the team did not lose in regulation. Sophomore forward Tyler Seguin shone the brightest during the streak, eventually paving the way for his first All-Star Game selection, joining teammates Zdeno Chara and Tim Thomas on Team Chara. On January 23, Thomas caused a stir by not attending the Bruins' visit to the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>saying</b> the government had [...] "grown out of control." [...] After an 8–4–1 record to begin 2012, the Bruins' inconsistent form resurfaced for much of February and March, during which they endured key injuries to Nathan Horton (concussion) and Tuukka Rask (groin), and an impotent power play. At the February 27 trading deadline they traded for Greg Zanon, Mike Mottau and one-time Bruin Brian Rolston, then signed goalie Marty Turco to add goaltending depth. The Bruins went on to finish second in the Eastern Conference with 102 points, winning the Northeast Division title.|$|R

But perhaps the most famous celebration was when Abby Wambach ran to the sideline and kissed her wife, Sara Huffman, whom she had married in 2013. During the 2015 tournament, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled it unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the right to marriage (Huffman and Wambach were not denied the right to marriage by their state, though prior to the 2015 SCOTUS decision, several states were attempting to make or had made same-sex marriages illegal). While Wambach and Huffman traditionally kept a low profile about their relationship, their kiss was broadcast live and the image went viral with the hashtag #LoveWins on Twitter. Wambach reflected, [...] "It's definitely not something that I ever considered before it happened. It was just in the moment and that's something that I'm proud of — that we could maybe move the needle into a more open-minded and accepting frame of mind… Hopefully, if that can help one person feel more confident about their life, then I'm proud."
