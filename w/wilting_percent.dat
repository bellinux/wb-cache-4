50|$|A flooded {{field will}} drain the {{gravitational}} {{water under the}} influence of gravity until water's adhesive and cohesive forces resist further drainage at which point it is said to have reached field capacity. At that point, plants must apply suction to draw water from a soil. The water that plants may draw from the soil is called the available water. Once the available water is used up the remaining moisture is called unavailable water as the plant cannot produce sufficient suction to draw that water in. A plant must produce suction that increases from zero for a flooded field to 1/3 bar at field dry condition (one bar is a little less than one atmosphere pressure). At 15 bar suction, <b>wilting</b> <b>percent,</b> seeds will not germinate, plants begin to wilt and then die. Water moves in soil {{under the influence of}} gravity, osmosis and capillarity. When water enters the soil, it displaces air from some of the pores, since air content of a soil is inversely related to its water content.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} description {{applies to}} a loam soil and agricultural crops. When a field is flooded, {{it is said}} to be saturated and all available air space is occupied by water. The suction required to draw water into a plant root is zero. As the field drains under the influence of gravity (drained water is called gravitational water or drain-able water), the suction a plant must produce to use such water increases to 1/3 bar. At that point, the soil is said to have reached field capacity, and plants that use the water must produce increasingly higher suction, finally up to 15 bar. At 15 bar suction, the soil water amount is called <b>wilting</b> <b>percent.</b> At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration; the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts. The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000 bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000 bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.|$|E
30|$|Observations on {{plant growth}} {{parameters}} like shoot length (cm), fresh shoot weight (g), root length (cm), fresh root weight (g), stalk length (cm), and flower stalk girth (cm) were recorded at 240  days after planting (DAP). For yield parameters, {{total number of}} flowers per plant, flower diameter (cm), disc diameter (cm), total number of normal flowers, total number of bent neck flowers, and vase life (days) were recorded till 240  DAP. Soil population of root-knot nematode was recorded. In roots, a number of females per gram of root, egg mass per gram of root, gall index, and <b>percent</b> <b>wilt</b> incidence were recorded at 240  DAP.|$|R
40|$|Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) single-column model {{simulations}} {{were performed}} {{in the late summer}} of 2012 in order to analyse the diurnal changes of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Five PBL schemes were tested with the WRF. From the radiometer and wind-profiler measurements at one station, derived PBL heights were also compared to the simulations. The weather conditions during the measurement period proved to be dry; the soil moisture was below <b>wilting</b> point 85 <b>percent</b> of the time. Results show that (1) simulation-based PBL heights are overestimated by about 500 – 1000 m with respect to the observation-based PBL heights, and (2) PBL height deviations between different observation-based methods (around 700 m in the midday) are comparable with PBL height deviations between different model schemes used in the WRF single-column model. The causes of the deviations are also discussed. It is shown that in the estimation of the PBL height the relevance of the atmospheric profiles could be as important as the relevance of the estimation principles...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of root morphology and plant physiology with drought/or salt tolerance should affect drought resistance in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). This experiment {{was developed to}} evaluate early vegetative and seedling growth of cotton from the unselected parents with two selected populations of M- 8844 - 0100, DPL 50, and TAM 94 L- 25 across two cycles for seedling drought. Three genotypes from three generations of selection were grown in tubes to evaluate early growth and in containers to evaluate seedlings for drought resistance in a greenhouse at College Station, TX in 2008 and 2009. The experiment {{during the winter months}} of 2008 resulted in shorter tap root length, fewer lateral roots, and lower fresh and dry weight for total root, lateral roots, and shoots. The drought selections in these genotypes affected the tap root fresh weight, and the number and weight of lateral roots. TAM 94 L- 25 averaged higher tap root fresh and dry weight, lateral root fresh weight and shoot fresh weight. DPL 50 exhibited greater weight of lateral roots and shoot fresh weight. No difference was found in <b>percent</b> <b>wilting</b> across generations for drought at 75 <b>percent</b> apparent <b>wilting</b> and recovery at 90 <b>percent</b> apparent <b>wilting...</b>|$|R
40|$|Three wilt {{resistant}} chickpea genotypes viz., JG 24, BCP- 2010 - 1 and GJG 0919 {{confirmed by}} field screening {{and also by}} activity profile of defense related enzymes were screened in normal and wilt sick soil for antioxidative enzymes at pre and post infection stages along with four wilt resistant and three wilt susceptible checks. The evaluation of antioxidative enzyme profile in normal and wilt sick soil of these chickpea genotypes exhibited a differential response. The activity of three antioxidative enzymes viz., APX (ascorbate peroxidase), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased significantly in wilt susceptible checks viz., JG 62, Vikas and at post infection stage. The non compatible interaction between wilt resistant genotype and pathogen demonstrated lesser increase. At preinfection stage mean APX activity did not vary significantly from normal soil to wilt sick soil, however significant increase was observed at post infection stage with 1. 08 µmoles ascorbate oxidized mg- 1 protein min- 1 in normal soil to 1. 75 µmoles ascorbate oxidized mg- 1 protein min- 1 in wilt sick soil. At the post infection stage the root APX activity increased significantly in wilt susceptible group of genotypes from 2. 07 to 2. 38 µmoles ascorbate oxidized mg- 1 protein min- 1 with mean percent increase of 97. 94 %. Though APX activity increased at post infection stage in wilt sick soil in the <b>wilt</b> resistant genotypes <b>percent</b> increase was from 33. 03 to 57. 64 with a mean percent increase of 40. 4 %. Same trend was recorded in GPX and SOD activity...|$|R
