After the resignation of Secretary of War William Eustis, Madison asked Monroe to serve in dual roles as Secretary of State and Secretary of War, but opposition from the Senate limited Monroe to serving as acting Secretary of War until Brigadier General John Armstrong won Senate confirmation. As the war dragged on, the British offered to begin negotiations in Ghent, and the United States sent a delegation led by John Quincy Adams to conduct negotiations. Monroe allowed Adams leeway in setting terms, so long as he ended the hostilities and preserved American neutrality.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August, Vlašić {{lines up}} in the Women's high jump {{qualification}} and successfully {{made it to the}} finals, placing 1st with the qualifying height for the final, 1,94 m. Two days later, she competes in a final of 17 competitors. She clears the bars of 1,88 m and 1,93 m at the second times of asking, before doing so at 1,97 m. She, Ruth Beitia, Mirela Demireva and Chaunté Lowe are the only athletes to clear the bar. Placing current third behind Beitia and Demireva but ahead of Lowe, all the four spots on countback, Vlašić <b>went</b> <b>very</b> close to clear at 2,00 m but failed on the three attempts. As no one else cleared, the Croatian earns the bronze medal behind Spain's Ruth Beitia and Bulgaria's Mirela Demireva. This was {{the first time since the}} 1980 Summer Olympics that the win was below 2,00 meters. For Vlašić, this bronze medal feels like gold. Moreover, she is the seventh female athlete in the history of the discipline (since 1928) to win two olympic medals.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand {{there are}} 520 clubs, 141,726 {{registered}} players and 2309 referees. In colonial New Zealand, rugby football served to hold {{loyalty to the}} Crown within the emigrant population, whilst introducing British culture to the Māori population. It was the New Zealand Natives' Rugby Tour of 1888/89 showed that New Zealand could compete with other nations, something they had trouble doing in another traditional sport, cricket. Similarly, the 1905-06 tour, in which the All Blacks <b>went</b> <b>very</b> close to a clean sweep tour (one loss against Wales), helped {{to create a sense}} of national pride around the All Blacks, as they appeared physically superior and pulled off an admirable performance on their British tour. It is also thought that this saw the emergence of the Kiwi as a national symbol. Rugby dominates New Zealand's sports media. Being the unofficial national winter sport of New Zealand, Rugby attracts large sporting attendances and viewership. As many as 5000 people have turned out to watch All Black training sessions, while the final of 2011 Rugby World Cup was the single most watched television event in New Zealand history. There is a pay TV channel dedicated to rugby in New Zealand.|$|E

After 41 games, the Magic were 33–8, leading the Southeast Division, as well as having one of the top four records in the league. At the start of February, Jameer Nelson, their all-star {{starting}} point guard, went down with a shoulder injury. He was expected to miss the remainder of the season. After trading for Rafer Alston, the Magic finished the regular season with a 59–23 record, it was the most games the team had won in a season since the 1995–96 season in which they had 60 wins. In the playoffs, the Magic beat the Philadelphia 76ers {{in the first round of}} the playoffs and then the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, in the Eastern Conference semifinals, behind assistant coach Patrick Ewing's guarantee that they would win Game 7 of that series. In their first conference finals since 1996, the Magic beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, which were led by the season's MVP, LeBron James. After dropping the first two games in the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Magic finally won their first ever game in the Finals in Game 3. Despite Nelson's return to the team for the Finals, the Lakers won the series and the championship by beating the Magic in five games.|$|E

500|$|Taking {{into account}} {{that this would be}} the band's first album on a major label, Killswitch Engage was adamant on making the best album that they could. This {{required}} Dutkiewicz to spend more time in the studio producing and writing songs as a whole, rather than just a collection of guitar riffs put together. D'Antonio stated the writing process for the record <b>went</b> <b>very</b> fast as he wrote the [...] "moshy, hardcore" [...] style riffs, Stroetzel wrote the thrash metal styled riffs, and Dutkiewicz wrote the [...] "catchy" [...] choruses. Leach said that his main goal when writing lyrics was to be used as an instrument to shine the light of God through his music. He felt that music lyrics in general featured too much negativity and wanted to have positivity shown in his.|$|E
500|$|In the film's {{period as}} a {{developing}} project under several studios, {{different versions of}} the screenplay were drafted by numerous screenwriters, beginning with Steve Oedekerk. Other screenwriters involved included David Hayter, Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer, Jeffrey Boam, Thompson Evans, and Chris Hauty. When Universal and DreamWorks re-partnered in 2007, they [...] hired Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus. In 2009, Ostby and Fergus were replaced by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Damon Lindelof. Kurtzman and Orci analyzed American Western films including The Searchers. Orci said, [...] "The first draft was very kind of jokey and broad and then it <b>went</b> <b>very</b> serious. You kind of swing {{back and forth between the}} two extremes and the tone until you find the exact right point where a Western and a sci-fi movie can really shake hands without it seeming unnatural."

500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it.

And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one <b>went</b> <b>very</b> quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E
500|$|DreamWorks {{contracted}} Amazon.com {{to create}} the official website, marking {{the first time that}} Amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film. The website included an overview, a photo gallery, cast and crew filmographies, and exclusive interviews with Spacey and Bening. The film's tagline—"look closer"—originally came from a cutting pasted on Lester's workplace cubicle by the set dresser. DreamWorks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers—one aimed at adults, the other at teenagers. Both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose. Reviewing the posters of several 1999 films, David Hochman of Entertainment Weekly rated American Beautys highly, saying it evoked the tagline; he said, [...] "You return to the poster again and again, thinking, this time you're gonna find something." [...] DreamWorks did not want to test screen the film; according to Mendes, the studio was pleased with it, but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward. The studio reluctantly agreed and showed the film to a young audience in San Jose, California. Mendes claimed the screening <b>went</b> <b>very</b> well.|$|E
500|$|The Stalingrad Tractor Factory (STZ) was {{considered}} {{as one of the}} factories for production of the T-26 from 1932, but production in Stalingrad did not start until August 1933. This process <b>went</b> <b>very</b> slowly, with great difficulties because of delays with deliveries of machining equipment and press tools for the newly built factory. In 1936–1939 the Design Office of the STZ developed several experimental tanks (6 TK, 4 TG, STZ-25, STZ-35) based on the T-26 tank and the STZ-5 transport tractor. For instance, the STZ-25 (T-25) had the turret, rear part of the hull, engine and some transmission details from the T-26 mod. 1938, but the STZ-25 wheeled-tracked tank weighed [...] and had 16–24mm sloped armour. Factory managers tried to promote tanks of their own design rather than producing T-26s. As a result, the STZ failed to organise the series production of the T-26, but this experience helped to bring the T-34 into production in Stalingrad in 1941. The T-26s produced by STZ had no visual differences from other T-26s, but Stalingrad tanks were less reliable and more expensive.|$|E

500|$|When Philomena Goins Doctor {{found out}} what her son had done, she became enraged and {{threatened}} to disown him, shook him, then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to CBS' 60 Minutes, and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist Ed Bradley. Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore's story and Bradley's television exposé were full of lies. A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, {{to keep them from}} becoming bitter. [...] Michael D'Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, [...] "veryone told me in their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up."

[...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting <b>went</b> <b>very</b> smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1830s, Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head {{devised a}} plan to {{relocate}} the Ojibwa of the Credit River, along with other Indian bands of southern Upper Canada, to Manitoulin Island. [...] Bond Head believed that the Indians needed to be removed completely from {{the influence of the}} white settlers of Upper Canada. [...] Jones, allied with Sir Augustus Frederick D’Este and Dr Thomas Hodgkin of the Aborigines' Protection Society in Britain, opposed the move. [...] They knew the poor soil of Manitoulin Island would force the Indian Bands to abandon farming and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. [...] After the surrender of the Saugeen tract, protected by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Jones became convinced the only way to end the perpetual threat of relocation of the Mississaugas was to obtain title deeds to their lands. [...] Jones travelled to England in 1837 to petition the Colonial Office directly on the issue. [...] He was accompanied by his wife and their niece Catherine Sunegoo. [...] The Colonial Secretary Lord Glenelg postponed meeting with Jones until the spring of 1838, as he was occupied with the Rebellions of 1837. [...] In the meantime, Glenelg refused to approve Bond Head's proposal. [...] Jones spent the intervening time touring England, preaching, giving speeches and fundraising for the Canadian Methodists. [...] Although Bond Head had sent a letter to Glenelg to discredit Jones, the Minister met with Jones in the spring of 1838. [...] The meeting <b>went</b> <b>very</b> well for Jones, as Glenelg promised to help secure title deeds for the Mississaugas. Glenelg also arranged an audience with Queen Victoria for Jones. [...] Jones met with her in September of that year, and presented a petition to Queen Victoria from the chiefs of the Mississauga Ojibwa community asking for title deeds to their lands, to ensure the Credit Mississaugas would never lose the title to their lands. [...] The petition was written in the Latin script, signed by the chiefs in pictographs and accompanied by wampum supplementing the information of the petition. [...] Jones, dressed in his Ojibwa regalia, presented the petition and interpreted it for Victoria, to ensure accurate and favourable reception. [...] Victoria approved her minister's recommendation that the Mississaugas be given title deeds. [...] He returned to Upper Canada shortly thereafter.|$|E
