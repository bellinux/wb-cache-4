As an example, performing the same numerical application but with TH equals to 2000K would give a twice lower value (around 140 kJ/mol), which allows thermochemical cycles with only two reactions. Such processes can be realistically coupled with concentrated solar power technologies like Solar Updraft Tower.

50|$|It was {{as early}} as 1881 <b>when</b> <b>T.H.</b> Green who wrote about the maximum power for all members of human society alike {{to make the best}} of {{themselves}} (Zakaria, 1999). However, it was not until the 1970s with John Rawls’ book ―A Theory of Justice and in the 1990s with Amartya Sen‘s book ―Development as Freedom where the notions of substantive freedom and the multidimensional nature of poverty were made explicit to the multilateral development banks. This recognition of the multidimensional nature of poverty as well as the combined failures of both markets and governments and the socio-political complexity of ground level realities has made it clear that relying on traditional top-down, state-led, ―big development‖ strategies would not be effective to combat poverty. Moreover, this resurgence in participatory development and bottom-up approaches in the NGO and development sector has come in only the last two decades as explained above.|$|E
