The pair dated until February 2009, {{when they decided to}} go on a break. Milian said that they were still really close, and decided to break up because it was [...] "hard to grow together <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> on two different coasts". The singer wanted to take more opportunities and learn more about herself, which she often let go when in a relationship, but felt that she was in a now-or-never situation. Milian described Lyon as an amazing guy, and said that although there was a chance for the couple in the future, she needed to focus on herself.|$|E

It {{begins with the}} singer [...] "dumbly" [...] trying to get noticed by [...] "these bright-eyed honeys", since he can't help to fall for their [...] "dubious charms", despite [...] "recognizing [...] sin while indulging in it". The song's lyrics {{are in the same}} vein as Gary Puckett & The Union Gap's [...] "Young Girl" [...] and The Knack's [...] "My Sharona" [...] as pointed out by HitFix's Melinda Newman. She added, the lyrics are [...] "sweet" [...] and tortuous as he sings [...] "Oh, I still dream of a simple life/ Boy meets girl/ makes her his wife/ But love don’t exist <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> like this...

500|$|Wenger regards a {{well-balanced}} diet as {{an essential}} part of a player's preparation. He was influenced by his time in Japan, where [...] "the whole way of life there is linked to health. Their diet is basically boiled vegetables, fish and rice. No fat, no sugar. You notice <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> there that there are no fat people". At Arsenal, Wenger brought in dieticians to explain the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, and acquired the help of Philippe Boixel, an osteopath for the France national team, to realign the players' bodies each month. Plyometrics, exercises designed to strengthen the muscles, were introduced and Wenger routinely made players stretch before and after matches. Until 2004, he encouraged his players to take Creatine for increased stamina, later stopping when he noticed side-effects. The innovations had a desirable effect on the team as it prolonged the careers of his defence, and made Arsenal stronger {{in the second half of}} seasons. Though Wenger's methods were common in Italian football, they had been unsuccessfully trialled in England until his arrival.|$|E

2500|$|After the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Friedman {{called for}} the U.S. State Department to [...] "shine a {{spotlight}} on hate speech wherever it appears", {{and to create a}} quarterly [...] "War of Ideas Report, which would focus on those religious leaders and writers who are inciting violence against others". Friedman said the governmental speech-monitoring should go beyond those who actually advocate violence, and [...] include also those whom former State Department spokesperson Jamie Rubin calls [...] "excuse makers". In his July 22 column, Friedman wrote against the [...] "excuses" [...] made by terrorists or apologists who blame their actions on third-party influences or pressures. [...] "After every major terrorist incident, the excuse makers come out to tell us ... why the terrorists acted. These excuse makers are just one notch less despicable than the terrorists and also deserve to be exposed. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> in an open society like London, where anyone with a grievance can publish an article, run for office or start a political movement, the notion that blowing up a busload of innocent civilians in response to Iraq is somehow [...] "understandable" [...] is outrageous. [...] "It erases the distinction between legitimate dissent and terrorism" [...] Mr. Rubin said, [...] "and an open society needs to maintain a clear wall between them." [...] As part of their response to this column, the editors at FAIR encouraged their readers to contact Friedman and inform him that [...] "opponents of the Iraq War do not deserve to be on a government blacklist-even if they oppose the war because they believe it encourages terrorism".|$|E

6000|$|Louis {{has done}} a great deal of work on his new story, The Master of Ballantrae, almost {{finished}} it in fact, while Mrs. Stevenson and I are deep in the mysteries of hatmaking, which is a ladies' accomplishment taking the place of water-colour drawing in England. It is a small compliment to present a hat to an acquaintance. Altogether we have about thirteen. Next door to us is Areia's out-of-door house, where he and the ladies of his family sleep and eat: it has a thatched roof of palm branches, and a floor of boards, the sides and ends being open to the world. On the floor are spread mats plaited of pandanus leaves, and pillows stuffed with silk cotton from the cotton tree. We make little calls upon the ladies, lie upon the mats, and smoke cigarettes made of tobacco leaves rolled in a bit of dried pandanus, and admire their work, or get a lesson; or they call upon us, and lie upon our mats. One day there was an election in the Farehau. It takes place all over the island once a year, and among others, the sub-chief and head-councillor is chosen. For the latter, our Rui was a candidate. In the beginning, the French deposed the born chiefs and told the people to elect men for themselves. The choice of Tautira fell upon Rui, who declined the honour, saying that Areia was his natural chief, and he could not take a position that should belong to his superior; upon which the people elected Areia chief, and Rui sub-chief and head-councillor. We all went over to the Farehau, where Areia sat {{in the middle of his}} councillors on a dais behind a long table. The Farehau is an immense bird-cage of bamboos tied together with pandanus fibre, and thatched with palms. In front of the dais the ground is deeply covered with dried leaves. The costume of the dignitaries was rather odd. Areia wore a white shirt and blue flannel coat, which was well enough; but on his plump legs were a pair of the most incredible trousers: light blue calico with a small red pattern, such as servant girls wear for gowns in England: on his feet were neat little shoes and stockings. Rui was a fine sight, and we were very proud of him; he sat, exactly like an English gentleman, holding himself well in hand, alert as a fox and keen as a greyhound: several men spoke from the farther end of the hall, making objections of some sort, we could see. Rui listened with a half satirical, half kindly smile in his eyes, and then dropped a quiet answer without rising from his seat, which had the effect of raising a shout of laughter, and quite demolishing his opponent. Voters came up to the table and dropped their bits of paper into a slit in a box: some led children by the hand, and some carried babies in their arms; across the centre of the great room children and dogs ran chasing each other and playing. I noticed two little maids who walked up and down for a long time with their arms intertwined about each other's waists. Near where we sat (we were on the dais, above the common herd), a pretty young lady having tied up her dog's mouth with a tuft of grass, industriously caught and cracked fleas from its back. Both Lloyd and I grew very sleepy, and as we did not like to leave till the election was decided, we just threw ourselves down and took a nap at the feet of the councillors: nor did we wake till the chief called out to us in English [...] "it is finished." [...] I never thought I should be able to calmly sleep at a public meeting on a platform in the face of several hundred people: but it is wonderful how quickly one takes up the ways of a people <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> with them as intimately as we do.|$|E
