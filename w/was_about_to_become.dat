5|$|After World War II, Scotland's {{economic}} situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only {{began to change}} in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of North Sea oil and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant Forties oilfield in October 1970 signalled that Scotland <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant Brent oilfield in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field (now Ardmore) in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year. Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace traditional heavy industries. This included a resurgent financial services industry and the electronics manufacturing of Silicon Glen.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, it was {{announced}} that Prime Minister John Curtin, with Blamey's approval, had appointed Mackay as High Commissioner to India. Sir Iven and Lady Mackay sailed from Perth, on SS Tanda on 14 February 1944. Their arrival in Delhi marked the beginning of an Australian diplomatic presence in India. When Lieutenant Iven Mackay was liberated, the Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia Command, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had him brought to Delhi to be reunited with his family. With the war's end, Mackay retired from the army on 27 February 1946, and the post of High Commissioner gradually became a civilian one. India was not yet independent, but <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> so, and Mackay met with future leaders Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Mackay and the Minister for External Affairs, Dr H. V. Evatt, supported Indian independence, while expressing the hope that India would remain in the British Commonwealth. Mackay also promoted trade between India and Australia, and fostered a plan for Indian students and technicians to study and train in Australia. His term as high commissioner ended in May 1948.|$|E

Soon after, Franco dispatched Serrano Súñer to Berlin to get an idea of Hitler's attitude, since Canaris had assured him that Germany would not forcibly intervene in Spain. When Serrano Súñer met Hitler on 16 September, Hitler did not press very hard for Spanish involvement in the war, perhaps because he planned to meet Franco himself very soon.|$|E

25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named Mrs. Smith, Helene {{tells the story of a}} woman who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that Mrs. Smith was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. Mrs. Smith, however, took solace in the deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, Mrs. Smith had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a mother herself, Mrs. Smith's fear about identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when Mrs. Smith gave birth to a still born child one month before full term.|$|E
25|$|However, {{just when}} {{it looked as if}} the new gun <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a great success, a great deal of {{opposition}} to the gun arose, both inside the army and from rival arms manufacturers, particularly Joseph Whitworth of Manchester. Stories were publicised that the new gun was too difficult to use, that it was too expensive, that it was dangerous to use, that it frequently needed repair and so on. All of this smacked of a concerted campaign against Armstrong. Armstrong was able to refute all of these claims in front of various government committees, but he found the constant criticism very wearying and depressing. In 1862 the government decided to stop ordering the new gun and return to muzzle loaders. Also, because of a drop in demand, future orders for guns would be supplied from Woolwich, leaving Elswick without new business. Compensation was eventually agreed with the government for the loss of business to the company. The government would not release the company from its agreement not to sell armaments abroad, so that avenue was closed to it. Eventually, the restriction was relaxed, and the company was able to sell guns to both sides in the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the series}} was indeed {{proving to be a}} hit, its late time slot in the country's largest media market began to concern its distributor. Even though Letterman's show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson were strong ratings winners and Jeopardy! was able to retain a good amount of the {{audience}} from its lead in shows, a late night time slot is not usually considered beneficial for a first run series. WNBC, however, was not left with much choice in the matter. At the time, the station cleared the NBC daytime lineup in its entirety and aired {{two and a half hours}} of news beginning at 5:00p.m. The only available slots the station had were the 9:00a.m. hour between the end of Today and the beginning of the daytime schedule, the 4:00p.m. hour between the end of the daytime schedule and Live at Five, and the 7:30p.m. slot between the end of NBC Nightly News and the beginning of primetime. Each one of those slots was spoken for, however. The popular Donahue was one of the station's biggest ratings draws in daytime and was not going anywhere (especially considering NBC's New York base <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> its home), which precluded Jeopardy! from moving there. WNBC, as a network-owned station, had also picked up the syndicated edition of Family Feud when it premiered along with the rest of the stations NBC owned, which took away the 7:30 slot. King World looked for a way out of its unfavorable situation with WNBC, but there was not much to be done. The two other major network affiliates in New York, WABC and WCBS, both had the same issue as WNBC in that both stations cleared their network's schedule completely and had other programming filing the holes in their schedules.|$|E
