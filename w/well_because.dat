5|$|In 1985, the New York City Health Department {{ordered that}} the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, {{heterosexual}} sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had {{to shut down}} as <b>well</b> <b>because</b> the city had just passed a gay rights ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments {{would have been a}} violation of that ordinance.|$|E
5|$|The {{executives}} of Columbia Records were {{not convinced that}} the album would sell <b>well,</b> <b>because</b> the project was {{a radical departure from}} his earlier success in the outlaw movement. The album included pop, jazz and folk music styles, in addition to country. It was recorded from December 3–12, 1977.|$|E
30|$|Another common metric, {{particularly}} for evaluating antimicrobial materials, is the MIC. The MIC {{was determined by}} identifying the lowest antimicrobial concentration that completely inhibited growth in all replicate <b>wells.</b> <b>Because</b> twofold dilutions of antimicrobial were considered, the expected precision of MIC determination was a factor of 2.|$|R
5000|$|These single celled algae {{are from}} 2 mm to 200 mm long. They live on {{substrates}} in shallow warm marine waters, usually less than 20 meters deep. They are very large cells.

5|$|The first IMO {{was held}} in Romania in 1959. Since then it has been held every year except in 1980. That year, it was {{cancelled}} due to internal strife in Mongolia. It was initially founded for eastern European member countries of the Warsaw Pact, under the Soviet bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as <b>well.</b> <b>Because</b> of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in eastern European countries, and gradually spread to other nations.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as <b>well</b> <b>because</b> they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as <b>well.</b> <b>Because</b> this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E

50|$|As {{a matter}} of fact the new {{building}} did not have the hoped for effect. The people of Padua continued to use the free <b>wells</b> <b>because</b> the aqueduct water was too expensive. This failure provoked the financial bankruptcy of the Società Veneta. Accordingly, the town hall administration, in 1892, decided to manage the service on its own through a special town hall authority.|$|R
50|$|This {{species was}} {{discovered}} in a hand-dug well in located within the Río Paraguá drainage, {{a tributary of the}} Río Iténez in Bolivia. This species is endangered by environmental degradation due to pollution, water extraction for drinking and irrigation, mineral extraction, and associated erosion. It is often killed when accidentally caught from <b>wells</b> <b>because</b> of a superficial resemblance to leeches.|$|R
5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as <b>well).</b> <b>Because</b> the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as <b>well.</b> <b>Because</b> control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{jury found}} for Heffernan and awarded him damages {{from the police}} {{officials}} and the city. Despite the verdict, Heffernan sought a retrial because Judge Peter G. Sheridan had not allowed him to pursue {{the freedom of speech}} claim; the defense did so as <b>well</b> <b>because</b> Judge Sheridan had allowed the freedom of association claim. While considering these motions, Judge Sheridan became aware of a conflict of interest through a former law firm and set aside the verdict, setting a new date for trial before Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh.|$|E

5|$|Saavedra {{settled in}} San Juan in 1814. He {{had a new}} son, Pedro Cornelio, and {{maintained}} a simple life growing grapes. He awaited the final decision of Posadas, but the supreme director had a political crisis at the time. The Spanish king Ferdinand VII {{had returned to the}} throne and demanded the colonies to return to their former organization, the royalists at Upper Peru were still a threat, and José Gervasio Artigas opposed Buenos Aires as <b>well,</b> <b>because</b> of its high centralism. As a result, Carlos María de Alvear became the new supreme director, who would decide the final fate of Cornelio Saavedra.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} episode to feature Jerry's parents. Only one casting session was {{performed}} to find the actors for the roles. Philip Sterling was originally cast {{to play the role}} of Morty Seinfeld, but was replaced with Phil Bruns.

5|$|Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, {{escaped from}} slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman {{had been hired}} out to Dr. Anthony Thompson, who owned a large {{plantation}} in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as <b>well.</b> <b>Because</b> the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted a runaway notice in the Cambridge Democrat, offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned. Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts. Ben may have just become a father. The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as <b>well</b> <b>because</b> she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
5|$|Following Chicken Fries' discontinuation, {{there was}} a call for the product's {{reinstatement}} from fans of the product on forums such as Reddit; Business Insider noted that {{they are one of}} the 17 most requested fast products that people would like to see returned to menus. Fans of the product also established several social media accounts dedicated to Chicken Fries' return on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Additionally, a Change.org petition was created that called on Burger King to reinstate the product to its menu. Perez Hilton's web site declared that Chicken Fries are one product of many that will never come back, while comedian Daniel Tosh featured a skit during one of the segments of his show, Tosh.0, to the product's return. They were re-released in August 2014 as a limited time offering (LTO). The return of the product met with a favorable reaction from those who were advocating for Chicken Fries to return to the Burger King menu. There was disappointment from these groups as <b>well</b> <b>because</b> of the product's status as a limited time offering. In March 2015, Burger King permanently re-added Chicken Fries to the menu in a large, international menu expansion in thirty countries.|$|E

5|$|Itte Detenamo participated on Nauru's behalf in the men's (105 kilogram) super-heavyweight weightlifting contest. He was the {{youngest}} person to represent Nauru at the London Games {{at the age of}} 25 and had participated for his country in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Detenamo qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2012 Oceania Weightlifting Championships in Apia, Samoa. His event took place on 7 August, and included 19 athletes in total. During the event's snatch phase, Detenamo was given three attempts. He successfully attempted to lift over 90 kilograms of weight in all three of his attempts. He then attempted 205 kilograms during the clean and jerk phase of the event, successfully lifting it on his first attempt. He did not succeed in lifting 215 kilograms on his second attempt, but was successful with 225 on his third. Overall the combination of Detenamo's highest scores in snatch (175) and clean and jerk (215) yielded a score of 390 points. He finished 14th in the event, ahead of Christian López of Guatemala (387 points) and behind Japan's Kazuomi Ota (400 points). Detenamo was 65 points behind the gold medallist Behdad Salimi of Iran. After the Games his coach Paul Coffa revealed Detenamo was carrying a minor shoulder injury and had been keen to perform <b>well</b> <b>because</b> of the athlete being away from Nauru {{for a long period of}} time.|$|E
