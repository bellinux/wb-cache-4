5|$|A film interlude, The Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom, {{was adapted}} by the {{animation}} studio Production I.G and premiered in Japanese theaters on August20, 2005, {{in conjunction with}} , between the two seasons of the anime series. Its plot continues the journey from Syaoran's group for Sakura's feathers. They locate one at the Country of Birdcages, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> confront the world's king {{in order to obtain}} it. It was directed by Itsuro Kawasaki and written by Midori Goto and Junichi Fujisaku. Character designs were provided by Yoko Kikuchi, and music was by Yuki Kajiura. Clamp artist Ageha Ohkawa liked how both films were connected, despite that both have different themes. Shochiku released the DVD for the film on February25, 2006, in Japan in both regular and premium editions. Funimation released the film on a single DVD in English on February19, 2009, in North America as a double feature with the xxxHolic film. It was released alongside a DVD box of the anime's first season on January19, 2010. It was re-released in Blu-ray format on May4, 2010, in a package that included the anime's second season.|$|E
5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, {{with just a few}} records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent tracking data has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|E

25|$|Narrative {{sections}} {{are presented}} as three-dimensional animated cinematics, with camera movements and full voice acting in Japanese and English. The Escape sections, which include thirteen different rooms, involve the player searching the room for tools and clues through a point-and-click interface in a first-person perspective and solving puzzles. The puzzles are mostly self-contained, and test the player's problem-solving skills and memory; among these are puzzles where the player has to decipher messages, and ones <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> align the sides of a three-dimensional object correctly.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the valley road as far as Täsch in 1971 {{resulted}} in a new focus of passenger volumes. Since then, many tourists have driven with their own cars to Täsch, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change to the trains of the BVZ, as the road to Zermatt remains closed to car traffic to this day, and can only be used with special permission. To cope with the additional passenger numbers from Täsch, a commuter service was introduced in May 1972 between Täsch and Zermatt. This service has since transported around two thirds of all passengers arriving in Zermatt.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of Dreamscape players are given a diary, in {{which most of the}} pages are empty except for titles at the top of each page. The titles {{themselves}} are named after all the locations that can be visited throughout the game world, and as such players can use this to work out <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to next. As the story processes the pages of the diary slowly fill up, giving extra information about the locations found in the game. It also provides back story to not only the main character, Wilson, but to the other characters as well. The diary also contains a map, which is designed to help players navigate the thirty acre world.|$|E
25|$|Wayang klitik figures {{occupy a}} middle ground between the figures of wayang golek and wayang kulit. They are {{constructed}} similarly to wayang kulit figures, but from thin pieces of wood instead of leather, and, like wayang kulit figures, are used as shadow puppets. A further similarity {{is that they are}} the same smaller size as wayang kulit figures. However, wood is more subject to breakage than leather. During battle scenes, wayang klitik figures often sustain considerable damage, much to the amusement of the public, but in a country in which before 1970 there were no adequate glues available, breakage generally meant an expensive, newly made figure. On this basis the wayang klitik figures, which are to appear in plays <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> endure battle scenes, have leather arms. The name of these figures is onomotopaeic, from the sound klitik-klitik, that these figures make when worked by the dalang.|$|E

500|$|In {{the season}} 10 episode [...] "Thirty Minutes over Tokyo", the family travels to Japan. The episode {{references}} and mocks {{several aspects of}} Japanese and American culture, as well as differences between the two. At a sumo wrestling match, Bart and Homer encounter the Japanese emperor, Akihito. After Homer throws him into a trunk of sumo thongs, Bart and Homer are put in jail, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> re-enact a kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin, do origami, flower arranging and meditation. The episode also references the Japanese's adaption to American culture. Although all other episodes of The Simpsons have been dubbed and broadcast on Japanese television, [...] "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] has never aired in Japan. The episode, which contains a scene showing Homer throwing the Emperor of Japan into a box filled with sumo thongs, was considered disrespectful.|$|E
500|$|According to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly {{willing to}} go to jail, or worse, to protect his son". The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper, which Schneider views as being a {{development}} of his protective nature over his family. Schneider believes that the season two episode [...] "Suspect"—where Jonathan is arrested, but his sole concern is protecting Clark's secret—summarizes the character well, and shows that the [...] "least important person in Jonathan's life is Jonathan". Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O'Toole have to [...] "police" [...] the creative team {{when it comes to the}} relationship between Martha, Jonathan, and Clark. According to Schneider, there are moments <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make sure that the characters are not taken to a place they would not normally go, specifically where the parents are useless without the [...] "innate intelligence of [...] teenager".|$|E
500|$|To helm the project, the {{producers}} Broadbent and Czernin approached John Madden, who {{was nominated for}} the Academy Award for Best Director for Shakespeare in Love in 1998. Madden considered the characters in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel to be of [...] "an analogous kind of geographical suspension", which have [...] "entered a strange world removed from their former reality, cut off from their past, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> invent a new life for themselves". Dench and fellow cast members Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson, and director John Madden jumped at the opportunity to all work {{together for the first}} time in one film. Producer Broadbent considers Dench's character to be central to the story, and that Evelyn is much like Dench herself, being [...] "the most wonderfully sympathetic person". John Madden considers Maggie Smith's character Muriel to be [...] "instinctively xenophobic, never stepping out of her comfort zone in any way", which is not uncommon in England.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Gilligan Unbound, American {{literary}} critic Paul Cantor described how [...] "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] references and mocks {{several aspects of}} Japanese and American culture, as well as differences between the two. At a sumo wrestling match, Bart and Homer encounter the Japanese emperor, Akihito. After Homer throws him into a trunk of sumo thongs, Bart and Homer are put in jail, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> re-enact a kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin, do origami, flower arranging and meditation. After Marge bails them out, Bart and Homer can speak fluent Japanese, and have fully absorbed, as Cantor writes, the [...] "exclusionary" [...] character of the Japanese culture, as Homer asks Bart (in Japanese, with English subtitles): [...] "Should we tell them [...] the secret to inner peace?", to which Bart replies (still in Japanese), [...] "No, they are foreign devils." [...] The episode also references the Japanese's adaption to American culture, and is, according to Cantor, [...] "filled" [...] with signs of how eagerly Japanese have taken to American culture. In one scene, the Simpsons eat at a restaurant called Americatown, filled with US memorabilia and having only American items on the menu. Another scene shows director Woody Allen filming a commercial for Japanese television.|$|E
500|$|From the {{earliest}} days of the academy, one form of punishment for cadets who commit regulatory infractions has been a process officially known as punishment tours. This process is better known to the cadets as [...] "hours" [...] because as punishment, cadets must walk a specified number of hours in penalty. Cadets are [...] "awarded" [...] punishment tours based upon the severity of the infraction. Being late to class or having an unkempt room may result in as little as 5 hours while more severe misconduct infractions may result in upwards of 60 to 80 hours. In its most traditional form, punishment tours are [...] "walked off" [...] by wearing the dress gray uniform under arms and walking back and forth in a designated area of the cadet barracks courtyard, known as [...] "Central Area." [...] Cadets who get into trouble frequently and spend many weekends [...] "walking off their hours" [...] are known as [...] "area birds." [...] Cadets who walk more than 100 total hours in their career are affectionately known as [...] "Century Men." [...] An alternate form of punishment to walking hours is known as [...] "fatigue tours," [...] where assigned hours may be [...] "worked off" [...] by manual labor, such as cleaning the barracks. Certain cadets whose academics are deficient may also conduct [...] "sitting tours," [...] <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> [...] "sit hours" [...] in a designated academic room in a controlled study environment, for which they receive half credit towards their reduction of tours. Cadets' uniforms are inspected before their tours begin each day. A small number of cadets may be relieved of their tours that day if their uniforms are exceptionally presentable. Another tradition associated with punishment tours is that any visiting head of state has the authority to grant [...] "amnesty," [...] releasing all cadets with outstanding hours from the remainder of their assigned tours.|$|E

2500|$|Lauren Davis, {{writing for}} Comics Alliance, summed Death-Day up as [...] "military science fiction filled with unnerving biomechanical creations. Death-Day {{is about a}} group of {{soldiers}} stranded on an exotic planet, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> defend themselves against grotesque monsters while attempting to find a way back to Earth. Max Sparber of MinnPost pointed out that the comic has a near-total lack of exposition, as most context of the story is left untold. It is unclear why a war is taking place between humanity and the enormous six-limbed monsters or on what world the characters are stationed. All that is clear is the mission of the military team: to destroy some sort of black orb behind enemy lines.|$|E
2500|$|Overwhelming needs {{cannot be}} met by the usual {{processes}} of schooling and include extreme instances such as abuse, neglect and illness. As well, a student’s socioeconomic status (SES) or dysfunctional family environment can cause {{them to come to}} school with needs that cannot be expressed nor met by educators. [...] To help meet those overwhelming needs of students, particularly those in poor neighborhood, the ethic of care philosophy dictates that schools should be full-service institutions. Medical and dental care, social services, childcare and parenting advice should be available on campus. In turn, students in these situations are often forced into academic courses and fight an uphill battle, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> engage in activities that are difficult to focus on, based on their circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|According to the UN's Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, {{access to}} an {{improved}} water source increased from 58% in 1990 to 96% in 2010.

In 2010, only 23% of Vietnamese had a tap in their home. There are substantial differences in access between urban and [...] "rural" [...] areas. 70% of the Vietnamese population lives in rural areas, but many so-called rural areas are actually small towns, e.g. in the densely settled Red River Delta.
