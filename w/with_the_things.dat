500|$|The {{influence}} of Imagism {{can be seen}} clearly {{in the work of}} the Objectivist poets, who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams. The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse. Clearly linking Objectivism's principles with Imagism's, Louis Zukofsky insisted, in his introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of Poetry, on writing [...] "which is the detail, not mirage, of seeing, of thinking <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> as they exist, and of directing them along a line of melody." [...] Zukofsky was a major influence on the Language poets, who carried the Imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development. Basil Bunting, another Objectivist poet, was a key figure in the early development of the British Poetry Revival, a loose movement that also absorbed the {{influence of}} the San Francisco Renaissance poets.|$|E

500|$|The 2008 {{launch of}} {{clothing}} line [...] "FAKE" [...] (Fleury's Artistic Kustom Enterprises) {{led him to}} approach the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League {{in the hope of}} convincing them to use his brand of practice jerseys. The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt. He made his professional baseball debut on August 9, 2008, at the age of 40, hitting a single in a pinch-hit appearance against the Yuma Scorpions. He started the second game at left field and struck out twice before he was replaced. [...] "I've had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise myself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I've done, the things I've accomplished. This was just another one of those days," [...] Fleury said of his appearance with the Vipers.|$|E
500|$|In the {{literature}} concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been {{second only to}} Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated. [...] Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients {{it would take to}} make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was [...] "causal powers" [...] of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version, which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> in the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{go for a}} shiny, {{high-tech}} {{science fiction}} look, the designers opted to recreate the setting and feel of the original Alien film using the work of concept artists Ron Cobb and Mœbius. As a result, the game features a lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future would look like. For example, the game features clunky machinery like phone receivers, monochrome displays, and distorted CRT monitors. To create period authentic distortion on in-game monitors, the developers recorded their in game animations onto VHS and Betamax video recorders, then filmed those sequences playing on an [...] "old curvy portable TV" [...] while adjusting the tracking settings. As digital hacking was not conceived in the 1970s, the game's hacking device was built the way {{it would have been}} built on the set of the movie, and requires players to tune into a computer's signal while selecting icons on its screen. Artist Jon McKellan noted, [...] "We had this rule: If a prop couldn't have been made in '79 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that they had around, then we wouldn't make it either." ...|$|E

David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we could have done this 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts".

And so do my films. If you see Matador through the perspective of traditional morality, it's a dangerous film because it's just a celebration of killing. Matador is like a legend.

According to Nolte, [...] "In Hitler's extermination of the Jews, {{it was not}} a case of criminals committing criminal deeds, but of a uniquely monstrous action in which principles ran riot in a frenzy of self-destruction". Nolte's theories about Nazi antisemitism as a rejection of modernity inspired the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka to argue that National Socialism was an attack on [...] "the very roots of Western civilisation, its basic values and moral foundations".|$|E

2500|$|The issue also {{contained}} Zukofsky's essays Program: 'Objectivists' 1931 and Sincerity and Objectification: With Special Reference to the Work of Charles Reznikoff, a reworking {{of a study}} of Reznikoff's work originally written some time earlier. In this second essay, Zukofsky expands on the basic tenets of Objectivist poetics, stating that in sincerity [...] "Writing occurs which is the detail, not mirage, of seeing, of thinking <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> as they exist, and of directing them along a line of melody", and that objectification relates to [...] "the appearance of the art form as an object".

2500|$|... "The Primer" [...] (in Polish: Elementarz) {{permanent}} {{exhibition in}} Majdanek is exhibited in barrack 53, {{and it is}} dedicated to the children who were in the camp. This exhibition was created by Tomasz Pietrasiewicz, the director of The Grodzka Gate – Theater NN Center. The purpose of this educational project is to demonstrate the fate of the children who were imprisoned in Death camp. The idea of the project was born when one of the survivors noticed that Majdanek Museum does not inform the visitors and does not show them the lives {{of the children in the}} camp. It was hard for pupils who visited Majdanek museum to identify themselves emotionally <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> which happened in Majdanek. By this exhibition the Majdanek museum enables pupils to turn the knowledge which is learnt in school into real education that concerns what had happened in [...] "The Camp World".|$|E

In the same year, Guccini separated from his wife Roberta (the song [...] "Eskimo" [...] is about this event), and started cohabitating with Angela.

2500|$|Other {{criticisms of}} Makin's An Essay point to {{her use of}} a {{masculine}} persona and her call {{for the education of}} [...] "rich" [...] women and girls. While her use of a masculine persona gives credence to masculine-centered ideologies and confirms that only men are capable of participating in the intellectual debate of the public sphere, taking on a male voice does give Makin more freedom. Also, as Mitzi Myers points out, [...] "the male voice is always there in pro-women writing, whether formally personified or not" [...] (1985:180). Universal educational models for all levels of society are not Makin's aim. Makin's pro-education treatise is directed towards women and girls of means. She alludes {{to the fact that the}} women and girls who should be educated are those [...] "persons that God has blessed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of this world, that have competent natural parts" [...] (Makin 1673). In other words, those that are rich and have spare time may make better use of their time [...] "in gaining arts, and tongues" [...] (Makin 1673), rather than [...] "to trifle away so many precious minutes merely to polish their hands and feet, to curl their locks, to dress and trim their bodies" [...] (Makin 1673).|$|E

[...] Further elaborating on the title, the statement uttered that the title was [...] "a real life mirror of Brandy as a woman, an artist, a musician and a performer, communicating what it means to be fully Human: strong yet vulnerable, candid and triumphant, in love with life and in touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of the spirit."
