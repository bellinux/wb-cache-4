5|$|At one point, Disney had {{approached}} Cyan Worlds about constructing {{a theme park}} inspired by Myst, which included scouting an island area within Disney's Florida properties that Rand Miller felt <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the Myst setting. However, plans for this park fell through over time.|$|E
5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production for Ruma Maida {{took three}} months. The {{characters}} were written without any particular actors in mind. Atiqah Hasiholan, {{who had previously}} starred in the Academy Award-submitted Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President, 2009), was cast as Maida. Yama Carlos, who played Sakera, was initially cast for another role but received the leading male role after a last-minute switch. The actor cast as Muchlisin, Frans Tumbuan, {{was the only one}} auditioned as Soeriaatmadja thought the role <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> him. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that, including extras, Ruma Maida had the largest cast of any film he had made to that point.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with}} the comic book when he got the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was {{before he became a}} writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role because she was very sweet, and the staff {{had a lot of fun}} during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E

25|$|Lisa Turtle was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} rich Jewish princess from Long Island, spoiled, materialistic, and obsessed with shopping. While still casting from the role, African-American actress Lark Voorhies was brought into Engel's office, and he immediately knew she <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role {{despite the fact that}} it meant rewriting the character.|$|E
25|$|The real {{development}} of Fall River's industry, however, would occur along the falling river {{from which it}} was named, about a mile north of Durfee's first mill. The Quequechan River, with its eight falls, combined to make Fall River the best tidewater privilege in southern New England. It <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> industrialization—big enough for profit and expansion, yet small enough to be developed by local capital without interference from Boston.|$|E
25|$|The series' crew {{also used}} a third Testarossa look-alike, {{which was the}} stunt car. Carl Roberts, who had worked on the Daytona kitcars, offered to build the stunt car. Roberts decided to use a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, which had the same {{wheelbase}} as the Testarossa and thus <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the body pieces. The vehicle was modified to withstand daily usage on-set, and continued to be driven until the series ended.|$|E

Perez performed at the Wolf Trap National Folk Festival, Carnegie Hall and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Spain opened Cuba's ports up {{to foreign}} ships, a great sugar boom began that lasted until the 1880s. The island <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> growing sugar, being {{dominated}} by rolling plains, with rich soil and adequate rainfall. By 1860, Cuba {{was devoted to}} growing sugar, having to import all other necessary goods. Cuba was particularly dependent on the United States, which bought 82 percent of its sugar. In 1820, Spain abolished the slave trade, hurting the Cuban economy even more and forcing planters to buy more expensive, illegal, and troublesome slaves (as demonstrated by the slave rebellion on the Spanish ship Amistad in 1839).|$|E

500|$|Once {{the script}} was finished, the filmmakers and Fox focused on getting Meryl Streep to play Miranda; Hacken {{recalled}} she {{was seen as}} so perfect for the part {{that no one had}} discussed any alternatives (although McKenna recalls writing provisional dialogue should the producers have had to settle for another actress). Weisberger, who initially couldn't imagine Streep playing the part, recalled that after seeing her on set it was [...] "crystal clear" [...] that she <b>was</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role.|$|E
