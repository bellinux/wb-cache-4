5|$|As {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> felt in late 1941, {{an idea for a}} series of secret observation posts (first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden) was put together under Operation Tracer.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Ruler 8's successor, Uh Chapat, Toniná <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> in decline. Only a single event, in 837, can be dated to his reign, {{although}} a stucco mural depicting captives with garrottes at their throats may belong to his period of rule.|$|E
5|$|Support for the French {{nationalist}} leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. In 1985, the French periodical Présent quoted Lefebvre as endorsing Le Pen on {{the grounds}} that he was the only leading French politician who <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> opposed to abortion.|$|E
50|$|These SDOH <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> {{related to}} health outcomes, are {{closely tied to}} public policy, and <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> {{understandable}} by the public. They tend to cluster together - for example, those living in poverty also experience numerous other adverse social determinants. The quality and equitable distribution of these social determinants in Canada and the USA <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> well below the standards seen in other developed nations.|$|R

5|$|After being {{recalled}} from Germania, Germanicus celebrated {{a triumph}} in Rome in AD17, {{the first full}} triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29BC. As a result, in AD18 Germanicus was granted control over {{the eastern part of}} the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> the successor to Tiberius. Germanicus survived a little over a year before dying, accusing Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.|$|E
5|$|After {{starring}} as {{a political}} cartoonist {{who falls in love}} in the 1990 film Funny About Love, Wilder performed in one final movie with Pryor, the 1991 feature Another You, in which Pryor's physical deterioration from multiple sclerosis <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> noticeable. It was Pryor's last starring role in a film (he appeared in a few cameos before he died in 2005) and also marked Wilder's last appearance in a feature film. His last two movies were not financially successful. Wilder's remaining work consisted of television movies and guest appearances in TV shows.|$|E
5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5000|$|Texture {{gradient}} : Fine {{details on}} nearby objects can <b>be</b> seen <b>clearly,</b> whereas such details are not visible on faraway objects. Texture gradients are grains of an item. For example, {{on a long}} gravel road, the gravel near the observer can <b>be</b> <b>clearly</b> seen of shape, size and colour. In the distance, the road's texture cannot <b>be</b> <b>clearly</b> differentiated.|$|R
50|$|By {{applying}} the Coase Theorem two possible solutions arise for internalizing this externality. These solutions can occur because the positive external benefits <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> identified and {{we assume that}} 1) transaction costs are low; 2) property rights <b>are</b> <b>clearly</b> defined.|$|R
50|$|Floor 10 is not offices, {{rather a}} power supply and {{building}} control floor. AA employees generally {{do not have access}} to this floor. It <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> visible from outside after dark as there is one floor which <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> in darkness.|$|R
5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan {{notice that}} he planned to bring him off during the second half and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E
5|$|He thought {{its closest}} {{relative}} <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> Banksia serrata and then B.ornata, {{and that the}} three formed a link with western species. Since Brown's original publication had treated all of Fraser's specimens as syntypes (shared type specimens) for the species, George also chose a lectotype (a single specimen {{to serve as the}} type specimen).|$|E
5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or that it is necessary for salvation. His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of unity of the church.|$|E

5|$|It was {{probably}} Amenhotep I {{who founded the}} artisans village at Deir el-Medina, whose inhabitants were responsible {{for much of the}} art which filled the tombs in the Theban Necropolis for the following generations of New Kingdom rulers and nobles. The earliest name found there is that of Thutmose I, however Amenhotep <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> an important figure to the city's workmen since he and his mother were both its patron deities.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|Significantly, the {{possibility}} that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates this case from the unsuccessful 1979 McInnis v R. appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction, arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, {{the majority in the}} McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very unlikely to have been acquitted, even with full representation. This <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> not the case with Dietrich.|$|E
50|$|The {{stand out}} exhibit {{here is the}} Police car. This <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a {{prototype}} more typical of the 'Street' cars of Tyco/Aurora. It looks far from being resolved and in scale and detail it <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> {{a long way from}} being signed off.|$|R

5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> seen to hover up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E
5|$|The League Cup <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> {{not one of}} Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the younger and less-known players. After being swept aside {{in the third round}} by Ipswich Town – a team {{at the bottom of the}} First Division – Ferguson came under intense scrutiny for fielding a reshuffled squad. However, the manager felt that it was, at the time, an unwanted domestic distraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows {{the church of the}} abbey much as it is today, {{with the exception of the}} high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.|$|E

5|$|The {{preserved}} {{contents of}} its digestive tract {{are typical of}} those of other predators', and this lifestyle {{is supported by the}} raptor-like nature of the spiny great appendages {{and the size of the}} eyes. The organism <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> a competent swimmer, propelling itself with the 'flippers' attached to its head, and using its wing-like lobes on the 11th segment to steer. These lobes presumably derived from the lateral lobes of Cambrian anomalocaridids, ancestors that used lobes along their sides to swim, and lacked the specializations of Schinderhannes.|$|E
5|$|The {{respondents}} {{also noted}} that Gaudron made similar comments in the Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention {{in the context of}} Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care. For this reason and others, they argued that the power to detain people for the purposes of criminal trial and punishment (as opposed to detention generally) <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> a judicial function, but there is no general rule and other powers to detain may not offend Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed after}} {{the outbreak of}} World War II. Poland was invaded in September 1939. Great Britain became involved, {{and a series of}} German victories in Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands during spring 1940 were alarming. Britain <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> threatened and its leadership discussed the possibility of an alliance with the Soviet Union. Under the circumstances, direct British confrontation over the Baltic issue was difficult.|$|E
