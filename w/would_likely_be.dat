5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But this <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> abandoned {{in part because of the}} volcano's remoteness.|$|E
5|$|There is no widely agreed criterion-based {{definition}} of a heavy metal. Different meanings may {{be attached to the}} term, depending on the context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, and a chemist <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> more concerned with chemical behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Vinokourov was the team's leader {{alongside}} Kreuziger. Vinokourov stated {{before the}} season that 2011 <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> his {{last year as a}} professional rider. He sustained a serious crash at the Tour de France. He broke his right femur and retired from the sport for a time, but he eventually went back on this decision and his decision from {{before the season}}, opting instead to return for the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|In Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau {{issued a}} land warning {{for the island}} {{in advance of the}} typhoon. Potential impacts, which <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> {{enhanced}} by the East Asian Monsoon, prompted Taiwanese president Chen Shui-bian to postpone political marches and campaign rallies intended for the upcoming presidential elections. In anticipation for the typhoon, schools and businesses in southern and eastern Taiwan were closed, along with the delaying of rail and air traffic. Kaohsiung International Airport was closed during the morning of December4.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{sites in}} {{southern}} Africa reflect the four characteristics of behavioral modernity. Blombos Cave, South Africa contains personal ornaments {{and what are}} presumed to be the tools used {{for the production of}} artistic imagery, as well as bone tools. Still Bay and Howieson's Poort contain variable tool technologies. These different types of assemblages allow researchers to extrapolate behaviors that <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> associated with such technologies, such as shifts in foraging behaviors, which are further supported by faunal data at these sites.|$|E
50|$|It <b>would</b> appear <b>likely</b> {{that some}} of this account is legend rather than history. The {{commentary}} referred to as that of 'Ma Yuan Tai (Ma Shi)' <b>would</b> most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> Ma Xuan Tai (c.1580). The commentary attributed to Zhang Yan Yin (Zhang Shi)' <b>would</b> most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> Zhang An Yin (Zhang Zhi Cong) (1619-1674). These dates {{would be consistent with}} the transmission of Chinese medicine to Vietnam in the 1700s.|$|R

Food would be cooked in a single {{cauldron}} over an open fire on the floor, it <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> reheated and topped up with fresh ingredients over a number of days. Some dishes could be cooked on a bakestone, a flat stone which could be placed above a fire to heat it evenly.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|At 42, Glenn was {{the oldest}} member of the {{astronaut}} corps and <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> close to 50 {{by the time the}} lunar landings took place. During Glenn's training, NASA psychologists determined that he was the astronaut best suited for public life. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy suggested to Glenn and his wife in December 1962 that he run for the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1964, challenging aging incumbent Stephen M. Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party candidacy for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Ohio the following day.|$|E

50|$|Stephen R. Kane, {{writing in}} The Astrophysical Journal Letters, notes that TRAPPIST-1 planets are {{unlikely}} to have large moons. The Earth's Moon has a radius 27% that of Earth, so its area (and its transit depth) is 7.4% that of Earth, which <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> have <b>been</b> noted in the transit study if present. Smaller moons of 200 - 300 km radius <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> not have <b>been</b> detected.|$|R

5|$|In 2015, the Canadian Gaming Association {{commissioned}} {{an opinion}} on the legality of DFS in Canada from former Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario general counsel Don Bourgeois. He determined that DFS <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> classified as a game of chance under Canadian law, going on to say {{in an interview that}} under the Criminal Code of Canada, games that mix chance- and skill-based elements are considered games of chance. However, Canadian authorities have not yet targeted DFS services; historically, the government has only targeted illegal gambling operations that have a presence within the country. While the service Sport Select offers legal sports wagering games through Canada's lotteries, it is subject to a legal prohibition on wagering on individual sporting events.|$|E
5|$|In January 1896 the British Government {{decided in}} effect to {{recognise}} the US right {{to intervene in}} the boundary dispute, accepting arbitration in principle without insisting on the Schomburgk line as a basis for negotiation. Negotiations between the United States and Britain over the details of the arbitration followed, and Britain was able to persuade the US of much of its views, even as {{it became clear that the}} eventual report of the Boundary Commission <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> negative towards the British claims. An agreement between the US and UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission's work was suspended in November 1896, though it still went on to produce a large report.|$|E
5|$|Intermittently, Penn State named Johnson, {{the lone}} {{remaining}} holdover from the Joe Paterno era, the interim {{head coach in}} an effort to stabilize the program to prevent recruit defection, as well as prevent current players, namely quarterback Hackenberg, whose father commented that he was undecided on whether or not to return, from transferring. A few weeks later, however, it appeared Hackenberg would return, as Ferguson followed through on his plans to transfer, and Franklin lauded Hackenberg in his introductory press conference. After the announcement of O'Brien's departure, star wide receiver Allen Robinson, a junior, declared that he would forgo his senior season, and enter the 2014 NFL Draft; according to projections from a CBSSports.com mock draft, Robinson <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> selected in the late first round.|$|E

5|$|Kishimoto {{has noted}} that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair.|$|E
5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} {{are not always}} a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property. SEGRAMs <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> less effective in such conditions. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E
5|$|State legislatures elected U.S. Senators {{until the}} {{ratification}} of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In 1849 one of New York's seats was up for election, and a Whig <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> elected to replace John Adams Dix. Seward, with Weed's counsel, decided to seek the seat. When legislators convened in January 1849, he was spoken of as the favorite. Some opposed him as too extreme on slavery issues, and intimated {{that he would not}} support the slaveholding President-elect Taylor, a Louisianan. Weed and Seward worked to dispel these concerns, and when the vote for the Senate seat took place, the former governor received five times the vote of the nearest other candidate, gaining easy election on the first ballot.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} at least one report of {{deliberate}} vandalism to the structure, but the primary concern relating to visitors to the site {{is the possibility of}} damage caused through tread wear. The site is not heavily trafficked and any wear to the structure since the 1980s <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> mitigated by the protection from the natural re-establishment of plant growth over its surface. Updates by the North York Moors National Park authority and English Heritage suggest that natural weathering and grazing sheep represent greater erosion risks to the structure than do human agents.|$|E
5|$|Ununennium and unbinilium ({{elements}} 119 and 120) are {{the lightest}} elements {{that have not}} yet been synthesized: all the preceding elements have been synthesized, culminating in oganesson (element 118), the heaviest-known element, which completes the seventh row of the periodic table. Attempts to synthesize elements 119 and 120 push the limits of current technology, due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half-lives, expected to be on the order of microseconds. Heavier elements <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> too short-lived to be detected with current technology: they would decay within a microsecond, before reaching the detectors.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association named Smith to the All-ACC first team as a wide receiver. In the 2010 Military Bowl against East Carolina, Smith had two catches for tenyards. Shortly after the game, he declared himself available for the 2011 NFL Draft in order to financially support his family. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. said, while he believed Smith could have potentially reached first-round status with another year, he <b>would</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> selected in the second or third round of the 2011 NFL Draft.|$|E
