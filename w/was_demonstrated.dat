Cleanroom fabrication and characterization of the technologies have <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated.</b> For the fabricated polymer-clad TSVs, resistance and synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements have <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated.</b> High-frequency measurements up to 170 GHz and time-domain measurements up to 10 Gbps have <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated</b> for the fabricated polymer-embedded vias.

In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E
5|$|Bigger {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated.</b>|$|E
