25|$|On 26 January 1565, the {{neighboring}} kingdoms of Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar, Bijapur and Golconda {{came together to}} treacherously defeat the Vijayanagar decisively in the Battle of Talikota. The surviving Vijaynagar forces fled with a large treasury to re-establish their headquarters at Vellore Fort in Tamil Nadu and Chandragiri (Andhra Pradesh) near Tirupathi. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> that the British would seek a land grant to establish the English East India Company Fort St. George in Madras.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Armistice, the Scots Greys were at Avesnes. To enforce the terms of the Armistice, the Scots Greys were ordered to cross into Germany, {{arriving}} there on 1 December 1918. However, although they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> to police the terms of the armistice until a final treaty could be completed, they were almost immediately dismounted. By the beginning of 1919, the Scots Greys were reduced to 7 officers and 126 other ranks. This was approximately the size of one of its pre-war squadrons. After almost five years of service on the continent, the Scots Greys returned home to Britain on 21 March 1919 via Southampton.|$|E

She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice", {{the first}} song of the album, {{contains}} [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section according to IGNs Ed Thompson. The main theme of the song is recovery from an abusive relationship, which also inspired all of the songs on Fallen. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the song was written for Evanescence's former guitarist Ben Moody. [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is a rock song that starts as a piano ballad before quickly becoming an alternative metal song that uses elements of nu metal, symphonic rock and pop music. Lee said she wrote the song for her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan of South African alternative metal band Seether. Described as a [...] "chick anthem", the song's protagonist explains the reasons {{the relationship between the}} pair will not work through the lyrics [...] "Don't cry to me…If you loved me, you <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> with me /...How could I have burned paradise? How could I…you were never mine". [...] "Weight of the World" [...] is a mixture of pop and metal, according to Stornoway Gazette. Inspired by the pressures of fame, it contains [...] "Eastern motifs" [...] and [...] "distorted vocals" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Feels like {{the weight of the world}} / Like God in heaven gave me a turn / Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you" [...] and in the chorus, [...] "If you love me, then let go of me / I won't be held down by who I used to be".|$|E
2500|$|The {{group is}} known for its caustic attacks on people it opposes and former members. In the past it has {{justified}} what it refers to as [...] "psywar techniques" [...] as necessary to shake people up; Johnson in 1983 quoted a LaRouche associate: [...] "We're not very nice, so we're hated. Why be nice? It's a cruel world. We're in a war and the human race is up for grabs." [...] Charles Tate, a former long-term LaRouche associate, told The Washington Post in 1987 that members see themselves as not subject to the ordinary laws of society: [...] "They feel that the continued existence of the human race is totally dependent on what they do in the organization, that nobody <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> without LaRouche. They feel justified in a peculiar way doing anything whatsoever." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cartañá’s {{academic}} career {{began in a}} small farming, rurally-located British school in Mallorca - The Academy – English Preparatory School. At 11 years of age, she moved to a strict Spanish Catholic School in the centre of Palma - Colegio San Cayetano. By the age of 17 she had convinced her parents to transfer her into the British schooling system, this time attending Ardingly College, a British Boarding school in West Sussex, so she could study Performing Arts. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> that Cartañá would start developing her performance skills through theatre studies, speech and drama lessons, and an acting course with LAMDA, as well as forming the school's first gospel choir who, in their spare time, practiced songs such as Whitney Houston's version of [...] "Jesus Loves Me" [...] and mimicking En Vogue's [...] "Does Anybody Hear Me".|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> today".|$|E
2500|$|Commenting to Digital Spy {{about her}} return, Lawrence said: [...] "I've {{not been in}} the show for 11 years and it's not like I've ever thought [...] "I'll never go back", you just think that your chance to go back has gone. It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is {{a literal}} song which depicts the {{difficult}} situation {{of a female}} protagonist dealing with a lover who suffers from an addiction; she eventually decides {{to move away from}} this dysfunctional relationship and leave him. According to Lee, writing a song with literal meaning was an unusual practice for her. A writer for The Daily Princetonian concluded that [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Lithium" [...] from The Open Door were both dedicated to Lee's ex-boyfriend, with the latter song exploring his perspective of the story started by Lee in the former one. Andree Farias from Christianity Today felt that the song was [...] "self-explanatory". A Stornoway Gazette [...] writer called it a [...] "tough-love" [...] song which finds the protagonist [...] "hoping that he'll crash and burn and finally learn a lesson". In the song, Lee accuses her lover numerous times, as illustrated in the chorus lines [...] "Don't cry to me/ If you loved me/ You <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> with me" [...] and the bridge lines [...] "You never call me when you're sober/ You only want it cause it's over". The lines [...] "make up your mind" [...] repeated during the song's chorus are replaced with [...] "I've made up your mind" [...] at the end, indicating that the protagonist has moved on, eventually realizing her worth. The song closes off with Lee giggling, which was described as [...] "the proverbial last laugh".|$|E
