As she mourned his death, she caused anemones to grow {{wherever}} his blood fell, and declared a festival {{on the anniversary of}} his death. According to Lucian's De Dea Syria, the river Adonis in Lebanon ran red with blood. The myth of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably derived from the Near Eastern legend of Ishtar and Tammuz.|$|E
25|$|He was {{cousin of}} Douglas Strutt Galton and half-cousin of Charles Darwin and both {{families}} boasted Fellows of the Royal Society and members <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> invent in their spare time. Both Erasmus Darwin and Samuel Galton were founding {{members of the}} famous Lunar Society of Birmingham, whose members included Boulton, Watt, Wedgwood, Priestley, Edgeworth, and other distinguished scientists and industrialists. Likewise, both families were known for their literary talent: Erasmus Darwin composed lengthy technical treatises in verse; Galton's aunt Mary Anne Galton wrote on aesthetics and religion, and her notable autobiography detailed the unique environment of her childhood populated by Lunar Society members.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of The Gremlins by Random House {{consisted of a}} 50,000 run for the U.S. market with Dahl ordering 50 copies for himself as promotional material, handing them out to everyone he knew, including the British Ambassador in Washington Lord Halifax, and the First Lady of the U.S. Eleanor Roosevelt, <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> read it to her grandchildren. The book was considered an international success with 30,000 more sold in Australia but initial efforts to reprint the book were precluded by a wartime paper shortage. Reviewed in major publications, Dahl was considered a writer-of-note and his appearances in Hollywood to follow up with the film project were met with notices in Hedda Hopper's columns.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Remington {{was away}} at war {{during most of}} the first four years of his son's life. After the war, he moved his family to Bloomington, Illinois for a brief time and was {{appointed}} editor of the Bloomington Republican, but the family returned to Canton in 1867. Remington was the only child of the marriage, and received constant attention and approval. He was an active child, large and strong for his age, <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> hunt, swim, ride, and go camping. He was a poor student though, particularly in math, which did not bode well for his father's ambitions for his son to attend West Point. He began to make drawings and sketches of soldiers and cowboys at an early age.|$|E
25|$|Wilson became {{increasingly}} concerned that Tudor, with the connivance of Lloyd George, <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> drop hints to that effect, was operating an unofficial policy of killing IRA men in reprisal {{for the deaths}} of pro-Crown forces. Wilson wrote to Macready (June 1920) that “the discipline and good name of the Army is worth half a dozen Irelands” – although sympathetic, he had been deeply concerned to hear of troops smashing up Fermoy in reprisal for the kidnapping of General Cuthbert. However, Macready also told Wilson that the Army was arranging “accidents” for suspected IRA men, but not telling the politicians as he did not want them “talked and joked about after dinner by Cabinet Ministers”. Lloyd George refused to formally declare martial law, not least because in July 1920 the Amritsar Massacre (of April 1919) was being debated by Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Edward Estlin Cummings {{was born}} on October 14, 1894, to Edward Cummings and Rebecca Haswell Clarke who were Unitarian. They were a {{well-known}} family in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was a professor at Harvard University and later the nationally known minister of South Congregational Church in Boston, Massachusetts. His mother, <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings's parents supported his creative gifts. Cummings wrote poems and also drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He also {{grew up in the}} company of such family friends as the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce. He graduated from Harvard University in 1915 and then received an advanced degree from Harvard in 1916. Many of Cummings' summers were spent on Silver Lake in Madison, New Hampshire where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby Joy Farm where Cummings' had his primary summer residence.|$|E

[...] After spending {{the first decade of}} her life at the Central Park Zoo, Pattycake moved permanently to the Bronx Zoo in 1982. [...] She was the mother of ten baby gorillas, including twins born in 1995.

[...] After suffering from arthritis and cardiac problems for some time, Pattycake succumbed to heart disease in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{became a}} member of the Globetrotters team which made history by playing in Moscow in 1959, enjoyed a sold out tour of the USSR and prior to the start of a game at Moscow's Lenin Central Stadium, were greeted by the General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. One {{particular}} Trotter skit involved Trotters captain Meadowlark Lemon collapsing to the ground, and instead of helping him up, Chamberlain threw him several feet high up in the air and caught him like a doll. [...] " [...] was the strongest athlete who ever lived", the 210-pound Lemon later recounted. In later years, Chamberlain frequently joined the Trotters in the off-season and fondly recalled his time there, because he was no longer jeered at or asked to break records, but just one of several artists <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> entertain the crowd. On March 9, 2000, Chamberlain's number 13 was retired by the Trotters.|$|E

500|$|In {{her letters}} to her {{siblings}} in Tobolsk, Maria described her unease {{at the new}} restrictions on the family at Yekaterinburg. She and her parents were searched by guards at the Ipatiev House and were warned they {{would be subject to}} further searches. A wooden fence was installed around the house, limiting their view of the street. [...] "Oh, how complicated everything is now," [...] she wrote on May 2, 1918. [...] "We lived so peacefully for eight months and now it's all started again." [...] Maria passed the time by attempting to befriend members of the Ipatiev House Guard. She showed them pictures from her photo albums and talked with them about their families and her own hopes for a new life in England if she was released. Alexander Strekotin, one of the guards, recalled in his memoirs that she [...] "was a girl <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have fun." [...] Another of the guards recalled Maria's buxom beauty with appreciation and said she didn't assume an air of grandeur. One former sentry recalled that Maria was often scolded by her mother in [...] "severe and angry whispers," [...] apparently for being too friendly with the guards at Yekaterinburg. Strekotin wrote that their conversations always began with one of the girls saying, [...] "We're so bored! In Tobolsk there was always something to do. I know! Try to guess the name of this dog!" [...] The teenage girls walked by the sentries, whispering and giggling in a manner that the guards considered flirtatious.|$|E

2500|$|The show also {{featured}} frequent skits with politicians, who were portrayed as various extreme caricatures {{of their most}} infamous personality quirks. Notable re-occurring figures included Prime Minister Jean Chrétien (Abbott), who could barely speak a single sentence of English without committing {{at least a dozen}} outlandish pronunciation and grammatical errors, the nasally-voiced Preston Manning (Ferguson) <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> shout [...] "REFOOOOOOORM!", a screaming, bitchy Sheila Copps (Goy), the tyrannical Lucien Bouchard, the dopey and overly-image conscious Stockwell Day, the strutting, clucking, pompous Joe Clark, and the power-hungry Paul Martin (all Ferguson).

2500|$|By {{the age of}} 7, Puyi {{had emerged}} with two sides to his personality; the sadistic emperor <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have his eunuchs flogged, {{expected}} everyone to kowtow to him and enjoyed puppet shows and dog fights, and the boy who slept at night with Wang, suckling her breasts, and content to be loved for just once in the day. Wang {{was the only person}} capable of controlling Puyi; once, Puyi decided to [...] "reward" [...] a eunuch for a well done puppet show by having a cake baked for him with iron filings in it, as Puyi said [...] "I want to see what he looks like when he eats it". With much difficulty, Wang talked Puyi out of this plan.|$|E
2500|$|Tipton {{was never}} {{formally}} {{married in a}} ceremony, but several women had drivers' licenses identifying them as Mrs. Tipton. In 1960, Tipton ended his relationship with Cox to settle down with nightclub dancer and stripper Kitty Kelly (later known as Kitty Oakes), who was known professionally as [...] "The Irish Venus". They were involved with their local PTA and with the Boy Scouts. They adopted three sons, John, Scott, and William. After Tipton's death, Kitty gave several interviews about him and their relationship. In early interviews, she said, [...] "He gave up everything... There were certain rules and regulations in those days {{if you were going}} to be a musician," [...] in reference to breaking into the 1920−30s music industry.

2500|$|Puyi's {{upbringing}} {{was hardly}} {{conducive to the}} raising of a healthy, well-balanced child. Overnight, he was treated as an emperor and unable to behave as a child. The adults in his life, except for his wet-nurse Wang Wen-Chao, were all strangers, remote, distant, and unable to discipline him. Wherever he went, grown men would kneel down in a ritual kowtow, averting their eyes until he passed. Soon the young Puyi discovered the absolute power he wielded over the eunuchs, and he frequently had them beaten for small transgressions. As an emperor, Puyi had his every whim catered to while no one ever said no to him, making him into a sadistic boy <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> have his eunuchs flogged. The Anglo-French journalist Edward Behr wrote about Puyi's powers as emperor of China, which allowed him to fire his air-gun at anyone he liked: ...|$|E
2500|$|Capp {{is often}} {{associated}} with two other giants of the medium: Milton Caniff (Terry and the Pirates, Steve Canyon) and Walt Kelly (Pogo). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally referenced each other in their strips. According to one anecdote (from Al Capp Remembered, 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home—leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's baby grand piano. According to Capp, <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between Argentina and the United States, and b. [...] "Because you can't play the piano, anyway!"

2500|$|Zelica {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a buggy horse with her colt running freely alongside until he was weaned at around five or six months. At first, the young horse showed little promise. [...] "The only redeemable feature about the little fellow was that he was friendly and cute" [...] recalled Messner. [...] "I honestly thought the colt's future would be confined to hauling a delivery wagon." [...] However, a close friend named John Wattles, the owner of the livery stable in which Dan Patch was foaled, saw potential in the colt. Wattles received permission from Messner to train Dan Patch and gradually developed the horse's abilities. By late 1898, Messner was able to use Dan Patch as his buggy horse since Zelica was again in foal, and even hooked the horse up to his sleigh over the winter. The locals were increasingly impressed by the almost black colt, <b>who</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> move fast but was biddable enough to pull young boys behind him on the sleigh.|$|E
