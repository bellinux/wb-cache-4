40|$|In a confectionary factory, {{integrated}} pest-management {{techniques were}} used for 12 months. Ephestia cautella is the major pest in this industry. Its presence was monitored using pheromone <b>traps</b> and <b>water</b> <b>traps.</b> The most critical areas were identified and <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> were better at identifying these areas than pheromone traps. Intensive cleaning and structural improvements were carried out when necessary. <b>Water</b> <b>traps</b> {{have been used as}} a mass trapping system because they catch both males and females. Catches in <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> showed a decrease in population density after 8 - 9 months. In a confined area, a mating disruption system was applied to interfere with moth mating. Most females caught with <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> were mated, although in the area where mating disruption was applied, the percentage of unmated females was higher compared with areas where mating disruption was not used...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the water microtraps (cross-linked poly(methacrylic acid) sodium salt spherical particles) with high sorption capacity and low diffusion coefficient on the water penetration through the epoxy coating has been investigated. Water diffusion coefficients for the pure epoxy coating as well as composite coatings with 5 % and 3. 7 % content of <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> have been estimated by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and microbalance measurement methods. Experimental results were compared with the mathematical model of diffusion in composite media. The presence of the particles capable of binding <b>water</b> reversibly (<b>water</b> <b>traps)</b> significantly slows down the diffusion rate. Composites with <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> dispersed in the whole volume of the coating and sandwich-structured coatings composed of 3 layers with particles located only inside the middle layer have been examined. The diffusion rate {{has been found to}} depend not only on the concentration of the <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> but also on the location of the particles inside the coating. Both kinds of composites exhibit lower diffusion coefficient in comparison with the pure coating, however {{in the case of the}} sandwich-structured composites this effect is significantly stronger and much closer to that predicted by the model. Water diffusion coefficient for the sandwich-structured composite with 5 % addition of <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> is ca. three times lower than for the pure epoxy coating...|$|R
40|$|In an assay {{performed}} in November 2010, adults captured in sexual pheromone <b>water</b> <b>traps</b> {{with and without}} light were counted. In traps with light {{a part of the}} insects were sampled for sex identification. <b>Water</b> <b>traps</b> for mass trapping which combined the attractive effect of sexual pheromone and light captured higher levels of Tuta absoluta adults than the traditional ones, with pheromone bait only. However, these traps were unable to capture females of T. absoluta (about 1. 1 % of the captured adults were females), an expected event due to the light effect. Although capturing higher number of males of T. absoluta, the lack of female captures makes it hard to justify the use of these traps, considering its high cost compared with conventional pheromone <b>water</b> <b>traps...</b>|$|R

50|$|Fuel {{contaminants}} such as {{dirt and}} water {{are often more}} problematic in diesel engines than in petrol engines. Water can cause serious damage, due to corrosion, to the injection pump and injectors; and dirt, even very fine particulate matter, can damage the injection pumps due to the close tolerances that the pumps are machined to. All diesel engines will have a fuel filter (usually much finer than a filter on a petrol engine), and a <b>water</b> <b>trap.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>trap</b> (which is sometimes part of the fuel filter) often has a float connected to a warning light, which warns when {{there is too much}} water in the trap, and must be drained before damage to the engine can result. The fuel filter must be replaced much more often on a diesel engine than on a petrol engine, changing the fuel filter every 2-4 oil changes is not uncommon for some vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Another kind of trap is a <b>water</b> <b>trap.</b> Water traps use {{fresh meat}} as bait. In these traps, {{the meat is}} {{suspended}} with string above a pan of water.

50|$|The {{original}} {{mild steel}} chassis fitted by Lotus supported {{was accompanied by}} a strip of felt which fitted between body and the steel crossmember of the chassis. In damp climates, the felt became a <b>water</b> <b>trap</b> and caused structural corrosion, resulting in a crumbling rear chassis. Chassis replacement was initially not cost effective on the Eclat and Elite, and in consequence resale values suffered hugely. Series 2 cars were fitted with a galvanised chassis as standard and a large number of Series 1 vehicles have had replacements fitted, which are usually galvanised.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{filtration}}: First seen commercially in the 1920s in {{the form}} of the Newcombe Separator (later to become the Rexair Rainbow), a water filtration vacuum cleaner uses a water bath as a filter. It forces the dirt-laden intake air to pass through water before it is exhausted, so that wet dust cannot become airborne. The <b>water</b> <b>trap</b> filtration and low speed may also allow the user to use the machine as a stand-alone air purifier and humidifier unit. The dirty water must be dumped out and the appliance must be cleaned after each use, to avoid growth of bacteria and mold, causing unpleasant odors.|$|E
50|$|Structure B1-2 {{dates to}} the Late Classic. It is located to the {{southwest}} of the main pyramid B1-1. It is a west-facing pyramid with three stepped levels standing upon a low basal platform. It was built using the talud-tablero style of architecture; the pyramid measures 25 by 25 m and stands approximately 6.8 m tall. In October 2004 {{the south side of}} the pyramid collapsed; this is believed to have been caused by a combination of damage caused by the roots of nearby trees and water damage. The restoration of the pyramid with cement in the 1950s had converted the structure into a <b>water</b> <b>trap,</b> while cedar roots had penetrated the building to a height of 6 m causing significant cracking.|$|E

50|$|The dietary {{preference}} {{of the eastern}} budworm for balsam fir over white spruce {{has the potential to}} alter the structure and composition of the spruce-fir forest (Bichon 1995). Similarly, late instar larvae that disperse to the understorey and feed on regeneration will influence the next stand. Bichon sampled spruce budworm populations by collecting 45 cm branches from the upper mid-crowns of the nearest dominant or co-dominant balsam fir and white spruce at 20 randomly selected points within each of 4, 10-ha study plots in the Black Sturgeon Lake area near Thunder Bay, Ontario. The number of late-instar larvae captured in water traps located on the ground at the drip line of each sampled tree was recorded throughout the dispersal period. The data combined from all plots surprisingly indicated that white spruce canopies contained more spruce budworm than balsam fir canopies. The mean number of budworm per branch on white spruce was 2 to 3 times greater than that on balsam fir on all sample dates, and a similar pattern was found in the number of late-instar larvae dispersing to the understorey. Water traps under white spruce trees captured more than 3 times as many larvae as did those under balsam fir trees for most of the dispersal period. One <b>water</b> <b>trap</b> (with a surface area of only 1250 cm2) under a white spruce collected 73 larvae in 2 days.|$|E
5000|$|In Justice League Unlimited, two {{characters}} called Downpour and Shifter {{appear in the}} episode [...] "Ultimatum" [...] where they were both voiced by Grey DeLisle. They {{are members of the}} Ultimen, a group of superheroes created by the government and Project Cadmus with Maxwell Lord as their sponsor. The group is a pastiche of the heroes that were created for Super Friends, with Downpour and Shifter specifically a pastiche of the Wonder Twins. Downpour and his twin sister Shifter have albino white skin, pink eyes and pointy ears. Downpour would say the name of a liquid in order to turn into that liquid (like water and tidal wave) while Shifter would say the name of a creature (like a sea serpent, a lion, a rhinoceros, a cape buffalo, and a Tyrannosaurus) in order to become that creature. Later on in the episode, Downpour and Shifter were with the Ultimen when they learned on their own that the Ultimen were clones created by Project Cadmus. After Wind Dragon had used his wind attacks to bring Maxwell Lord to the roof that they were on, Downpour became water that entrapped Maxwell Lord while Shifter became a lion asking which is worse: drowning in water or being eaten by a lion. Maxwell Lord convinced them to let him explain over the fact that Project Cadmus had created them in order to be better heroes with the clones having implanted images and interact with actors that portrayed their parents. When it came to attacking the building they lived in while hunting for Maxwell Lord's boss Amanda Waller, Downpour and Shifter fought Aquaman and were defeated. Clones of the characters later appear in the episode [...] "Panic in the Sky" [...] where they join the other Ultimatum clones into attacking the Watchtower. Some clones of Downpour formed a <b>water</b> <b>trap</b> around Fire until she managed to heat herself to the point of breaking free.|$|E
