In an interview with MTV Cudi commented, [...] "that's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about. He just kind of told me {{what he was trying to}} say, I threw out some words, we rearranged words, and we came out with a bunch of different options before <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the hook." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Wilcox and story editor Ethan Gross, and was directed by frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson. Around the time the episode aired, executive producer and showrunner J.H. Wyman said of Anderson, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> this great concept and say, 'That's going to be tricky to shoot,' we know he's going to transcend it because he just has that {{way of looking at}} film as a feature director where anything's possible." [...] Wyman and fellow executive producer and showrunner Jeff Pinkner planned the Fauxlivia pregnancy storyline since they conceived her character; according to them, they departed from the typical television pregnancy trope by [...] "Fringe-if it" [...] and adding a science fiction element.|$|E
500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I said I would address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go back and look at what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to be on it until <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the songwriting process, Rabin recalled the group used Abbey Road (1969) by The Beatles as a model and influence for the music on Big Generator. He explained: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> an idea, why pressure ourselves into making it a song? Just have it there. If you can't come up with a chorus, don't throw it out because it's not a complete song and don't put a bad chorus around it". Such an approach led to the album having tracks longer than common pop songs of the time, peaking at seven minutes in length. Rabin described Kaye's role as a greater one than he had on 90125, but continual clashes between Kaye and Horn resulted in his keyboard parts recorded in another studio away from Horn.|$|E

30|$|Pattern matching: Phrase {{that matches}} with “should”, “could”, “include”, “could have” or some with similar intent phrases are {{indicators}} of suggestions. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{a list of}} phrases, a thesaurus as shown in Table  2 through empirically observing students’ comments, similar to Brun and Hagege (2013).|$|R
6000|$|We {{made all}} the haste we could down stairs, but we were not quick enough either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him,-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{difficult}} to say," [...] answered Westly. [...] "I earnestly hope not; indeed I think not, for Tom has had a good start; but the search is well organised, and there are bloodthirsty, indignant, and persevering men among the various parties, who won't be easily baffled. Still Tom is a splendid runner. We may depend on having a long chase before <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him." ...|$|E

50|$|Darol Anger, Todd Phillips, Alison Brown and {{ourselves}} were casually playing tunes {{in the studio}} when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> this selection.

50|$|I wrote many drafts {{to try and}} put it in {{the present}} day and keep all the great {{execution}} that was there from the first one.

Orders {{have been sent to}} all the Arab tribes to hasten to oppose the march of the enemy, and from all parts they are riding hither. Doubtless my brother, who is the great sheik of the tribe of which we are a branch, is already on his way to join him. We will at once ride and bring back all our {{fighting}} men. The caravan can proceed without guard. Even a hostile tribe would respect it at the present time, when all are engaged with the enemy. We shall speedily overtake them. They would not have started for an hour after we mounted, and cannot have gone many miles before <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> them." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “We {{originally}} had a working title of ‘Nearing The Completion Stage'. But, {{it was the}} backbeat, that mean groove, which hit us as a strong recurring element of the album.

All of the bands on this tour compliment [...] the others -- musically, theatrically and passionately." ...|$|R
5000|$|Trophy Wife {{describes}} {{their music}} as [...] "ambitionless office disco". They clarified this genre to There Goes the Fear further: [...] "Most descriptions of bands are often misplaced or too generic. We wanted to connect ourselves {{to something that}} is specific to us so <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> our own term to describe our music. <b>We</b> also <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> commuter pop and pentatonic disco." [...] Paul Lester of The Guardian described their debut single [...] "Microlite" [...] like this: It exudes melancholy even as the beat fires up; it's our old friend, sad disco, something to dance to even as you ponder the vapidity and meaninglessness of frivolous self-expression.|$|R
50|$|It {{is useful}} to compare the {{situation}} {{to that of the}} ubiquity of transcendental numbers on the real line. Both on the real line and the set of smooth functions, the examples <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> at first thought (algebraic/rational numbers and analytic functions) are far better behaved than the majority of cases: the transcendental numbers and nowhere analytic functions have full measure (their complements are meagre).|$|E
5000|$|The {{band was}} formed {{while most of}} the members were still {{attending}} high school.

5000|$|In July 2016, Steven Zaillian commented {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a second season: [...] "We're thinking about it and if <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> something we all feel is worthy of doing, we'll do it. This was designed as a stand-alone piece. That being said, there are ways of certainly kind of taking what it feels like and what it's about and doing another season on another subject." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a radio interview, {{director}} Ryan Davies said: [...] "The idea <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> {{was that}} of this guy who's completely mental playing the piano until his fingers bleed and attacking random people on the street.
