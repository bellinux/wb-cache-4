40|$|Ailanthus altissima {{is one of}} the top {{invasive}} weed {{trees in}} North America. Native and indigenous biocontrols consisting of insects and fungi were found in a unique series of interactions in Maryland and Pennsylvania. The insects are Aculops ailanthii, an eriophyoid mite and Atteva punctella, the Ailanthus <b>web</b> <b>worm.</b> Mimosa wilt, Fusarium oxysporum, isolated from a mimosa tree, Albizia julibrissin, was successful in the laboratory through two generations testing Koch's postulates on Ailanthus seedlings. Atteva punctella selectively feeds on male trees. Fusarium lateritium and/or Fusarium solani may be sterilizing female trees through necrotic lesions, allowing herbivory on the sterilized female trees by Atteva punctella. The carriers appear to be Atteva punctella and Ambrosia beetles (Schall, 2007). Aculops ailanthii was found in the field and brought back into the lab for a successful test of Koch's postulates on seedlings. Using partial biocontrol, control of Ailanthus appears to be possible...|$|E

40|$|While {{conventional}} keyword indexes {{maintained by}} web search engines such as Yahoo, Lycos, and World Wide <b>Web</b> <b>Worm</b> {{work well for}} most simple keyword searches, they are inadequate when more complex and structured queries involving the underlying hypertext structure of the World Wide Web are desired. Building from a database perspective, existing work to support such queries focuses on constructing SQL-like query languages for the WWW that assumes a relational abstraction of the WWW. Nonetheless, the WWW is a directed graph and imposing a relational abstraction filters out its inherent topological structure. In this paper, we propose a data model for the WWW that retains its topological structure and construct a web algebra to manipulate objects in this model. The web algebra establishes a formal foundation from which different web query languages can be designed. 1 Introduction From a user's perspective, the World Wide Web is a broadcast medium where {{a wide range of}} up-to-date informati [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This essay aims {{to answer}} two related questions; {{why are people}} able to accept actions of fictional {{characters}} that deviate from normal morality, and why works of fiction which invite such a response can be valuable. The first parts of the essay is a general discussion of the criticism and defense of violent fiction; here we establish why it is problematic and why it is valuable, discussing the possible cathartic and educational aspects of fiction. I {{then move on to}} a case study of the <b>web</b> serial <b>Worm.</b> This works as the primary explanation of why a reader is able to accept such actions, as the series’ protagonist is both cruel and ruthless, while still being portrayed heroically. But it also serves to illustrate how the different parts of the story, which appear to glorify both violence and an ideology which condones it, can actually benefit the reader. In this analysis, I look at both elements of the story and narrative, especially relevant is Wayne Booth’s concept of an ‘implied reader’, as we discuss the reader’s reaction to the text...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} security {{framework is}} proposed for detecting enterprise-wide network attacks. The proposed framework defines {{three types of}} components, namely, sensor, analysis and response. Sensor components gather evidence about security attacks. Analysis components correlate and combine pieces of attack evidence gathered by sensors, in order to detect attacks perceived on the network. Response components execute recommended responses and can be configured to assist humans in executing security countermeasures. Both schematic and formal descriptions of the framework and its components are provided and discussed. General and specific requirements of each component are outlined. To integrate components of the framework together, a lightweight signalling mechanism referred to as "security spaces" is proposed. A security space {{is a type of}} "tuple space" that allows sensor, analysis and response components to connect, contribute and communicate security related information. Its application to distributed sensor, and federated sensor environments is described. The detection of enterprise-wide attacks targeting computer networks is accomplished by distributing sensors across the network to collate evidence of perceived attacks, which are communicated to the analysis component for further investigation. In the analysis, a novel approach in data fusion is applied. This approach is underpinned by the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence that is utilised to collectively combine pieces of attack evidence gathered by the sensors. The fusion of sensor evidence assists to provide accurate detection of attacks perceived on the entire network. Further, to assist security administrators to visualise and mitigate perceived attacks, graph theory and graph matching algorithms are employed in the analysis. Hence, a graph model - pattern activity graph - is proposed and investigated in representing security attacks perceived on the network. Both graph isomorphism and subgraph iso-morphism are used to compare attack graph templates to data graphs obtained from security events. To validate the objectives of this research, a series of experiments were conducted on a testbed network, where live network traffic was monitored. A dataset comprising background data and attack data was gathered. Background data is normal data obtained by monitoring the testbed network. Attack data was generated through the attacks conducted on the monitored testbed LAN. The attacks were primarily network scans, network <b>worms,</b> <b>web</b> attacks, policy violations, and stealthy network scans attacks...|$|R
