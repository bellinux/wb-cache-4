5000|$|The {{first line}} begs the {{question}} [...] "why hit the orioles' perch"? After all it is a happy sign of spring. The second line answers to stop the singing. But that raises another question, why? Most people like the orioles' singing. The third line tells of the interrupted dream, but <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>important?</b> The last line gives the final answer, {{she was going to}} see her husband in her now lost dream. Yet that final answer raises larger questions. What kind of quest sends her man so far away to Liaoxi, beginning of the Silk Road? what of the Emperor who sets such a quest? and what is the ultimate meaning of such a quest? The reader is left such questions to ponder.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, the {{everyday}} issues of students failing at mathematics in the Open Program {{would require a}} more complex set of issues and community of individuals. Moses, the parent-as-organizer in the program, instinctively applied the lesson he had learned in Mississippi, transforming {{the everyday}} issues into a broader political question for the Open Program community to consider: What is algebra for? Why do we want children to study it? What {{do we need to}} include in the mathematics education of every middle school student, to provide each of them with access to the college preparatory mathematics curriculum in high school? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>important</b> to gain such access? Within these questions, a context for understanding the problems of mathematics education emerged, and a possible solution and effort at community organizing represented by the Algebra Project began to take shape.|$|E
50|$|Prewriting usually {{begins with}} {{motivation}} and audience awareness: {{what is the}} student or writer trying to communicate, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>important</b> to communicate it well and who is the audience for this communication. It helps you put your thought out onto the paper on {{what you want to}} write about. Writers usually begin with a clear idea of audience, content and the importance of their communication; sometimes, one of these needs to be clarified for the best communication. Student writers find motivation especially difficult because they are writing for a teacher or for a grade, instead of a real audience. Often teachers try to find a real audience for students by asking them to read to younger classes or to parents, by posting writing for others to read, by writing a blog, or by writing on real topics, such as {{a letter to the editor}} of a local newspaper.|$|E
50|$|The right-to-know is one’s {{right to}} receive {{information}} about the annual releases of toxic chemicals by industrial facilities across the United States. The Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act is enforced in the U.S. through legislation {{in order to protect}} citizens against industrial toxic pollution. This information is available in order to keep track of increasing toxin releases and identify high toxic-releasing companies. Once these records are publicly released, individuals have the freedom to respond to that information however they please. If a shareholder of a specific facility is discouraged by the facility’s amount of toxin releases, that person may choose to remove themselves as a shareholder. This is <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>important</b> to minimize underreporting or overreporting of toxic emissions. Although this information is available to the public, New York seems to continue to struggle with keeping carbon emissions low. According to the NYC Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, New York City generates 14 million tons of waste and recyclables annually at a cost of $300 million for residential waste alone.|$|E

50|$|Process FMEA can be {{challenging}} for participants who have not completed many PFMEAS, often confusing FAILURE MODES with EFFECTS and CAUSES. To clarify, a Process FMEA shows how the process can go wrong. Using a detailed Process Map will aid the person filling in the worksheet to correctly list {{the steps of the}} process being reviewed. The FAILURE MODE is then simply how that step can go wrong. Example, Process Step 1. Pick Up right handed part. Can they pick up the wrong part? (some manufacturing centers have left and right handed parts etc.) FAILURE MODE put left hand part in, EFFECT could be wrecked CNC machine and scrapped part, or hole drilled in wrong location. The cause, keeping inventory of similar parts at the job. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>important</b> to do a PFMEA with regard to the process? When a process is examined or if we ask what can go wrong with the process unknown issues are uncovered, solving problems before they occur and tackling root cause issues or at least 2 Y's deep on a 5 Y. Here the manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke the tooling to prevent a left handed part in the fixture when running the right handed parts or program a touch off probe in the CNC programming - all before ever making the mistake the first time. If a PFMEA is set up where the FAILURE MODE relates to the feature on the print, example FAILURE MODE drilled hole too big - no further understanding of what caused the problem is gained. Numerous PFMEA's have been examined and show that little to no value is gained when reviewing features off of a print as FAILURE MODES - little understanding of the cause is gained. New PFMEA practitioners often try to relate the PFMEA FAILURE MODE to the FEATURE, numerous authors list this as trying to inspect in quality rather than listing the process step determining how it can go wrong and building in quality through root cause evaluation.|$|E
