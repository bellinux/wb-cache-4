5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water.

The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E
