50|$|A <b>weld</b> <b>neck</b> flange (also {{known as}} a high-hub flange and tapered hub flange) {{is a type of}} flange. There are two designs. The regular type is used with pipes. The long type is {{unsuitable}} for pipes and is used in process plant. A <b>weld</b> <b>neck</b> flange consists of a circular fitting with a protruding rim around the circumference. Generally machined from a forging, these flanges are typically butt welded to a pipe. The rim has a series of drilled holes that permit the flange to be affixed to another flange with bolts.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{transmission}} {{steel tower}} {{has been increasing}} and <b>welded</b> <b>Neck</b> Flange joint has been applied steel tower for post joint. However, welding process has a somewhat undesirable effect of adversely affecting the toughness of the weld bond at welded joints. In order to secure the safety of steel tower, therefor, the study on fracture toughness <b>welded</b> <b>Neck</b> Flange joint is one of important problems. In this experiment, the authors carried out COD bend test with weld test specimens of SM 4 IB and STK 55 steels which were welded using CO 2 arc process. From {{the results of these}} tests, the characteristics of fracture toughness were evaluated on the <b>welded</b> <b>Neck</b> Flange joint...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of gasket load drop caused by internal pressure at flange joints. The method published here makes possible {{to take into consideration}} the stiffness effect of the integrated part of the flange ring. The equations published refer to large size <b>welding</b> <b>neck</b> flanges but the method itself can be applied at any other types of flange joint, too. During the determination of the flange rotational stiffness the model shaped up by MURRAY and STUART [4] for calculating stress-state of <b>welding</b> <b>neck</b> flanges should have been made more precise. The preciseness of this method, as well as the convergence of trial-and-error calculations used were proved by results of calculations carried out on flange joint...|$|R
50|$|B16.36- Orifice Flanges. This Standard covers flanges (similar {{to those}} covered in ASME B16.5) that have orifice {{pressure}} differential connections. Coverage {{is limited to}} the following: (a) <b>welding</b> <b>neck</b> flanges Classes 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500 (b) slip-on and threaded Class 300.|$|R
50|$|Slip-on flanges are slipped {{over the}} pipe and welded to provide {{strength}} and prevent leakage. This flange is {{less expensive than}} a <b>weld</b> <b>neck</b> and requires less accuracy when cutting pipe to length. Blind flanges are used to shut off a piping system or opening, while still allowing easy access for inspection.|$|E
50|$|A <b>weld</b> <b>neck</b> flange {{is joined}} to a piping system by butt welding. Although its long neck (or hub) makes it expensive, it reduces {{mechanical}} stress on piping by distributing stress between {{the base of}} the flange and the wall at the weld. Turbulence and erosion are reduced due to the matching size of the pipe and flange.|$|E
50|$|Flanges {{are rated}} at 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500 lbs or 10, 15, 25, 40, 64, 100 and 150 bars of pressure. Various types of flanges are available, {{depending}} on construction. Flanges used in piping (orifice, threaded, slip-on, blind, <b>weld</b> <b>neck,</b> socket, lap-joint, and reducing) {{are available with}} a variety of facings, such as raised, flat, and ring-joint.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nuzzles on fatigue or high {{pressure}} container are all combined with saddle pad, the joint between the shell and the nozzle is <b>welding</b> <b>neck,</b> {{which is better}} than any other kind joint, but the interface of nozzle and the shell is a 3 D face, which is impossible to be formed by ordinary machine tools. In this paper, established mathematics model, analyzed the relation of mathematics, compiled NC program, and realized the numerical controlled processing on machining center, the error of process are also considered...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} insure the {{accuracy}} of steam turbine thermal test in power plant, the flowrate measurement accuracy of condensate water should be insured. In this paper, the portable and integrated type flow measuring device for condensate water of 300 MW steam turbine flow is designed, {{which is based on}} the condensate water parameters and the specific pipeline conditions at the exit of the No. 5 low pressure heater for 300 MW unit. A integration of non standard differential pressure orifice flow meter is designed in this paper Through calibration in standard experimental system, the reason of the large error is that the flow field is disturbed by the origin plate type downward welding connecting flanges. Then the <b>welding</b> <b>neck</b> flanges is designed for the connecting flanges. The distribution of connecting flanges of flow field is weaken, and the measurement accuracy can meet the demand of steam turbine thermal test...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{forming process}} involving hot forming and cold-die quenching, {{also known as}} HFQ®, has been employed to form AA 6082 tailor welded blanks (TWBs). The HFQ® process combines both forming and heat treatment in a single operation, whereby upon heating the TWB, it is stamped and held between cold tools to quench the component to room temperature. The material therefore undergoes temperature, strain rate or strain path changes during the operation. In this paper, a finite element model (FEM) was developed to investigate the formability and deformation characteristics of the TWBs under HFQ® conditions. Experimental results, i. e. strain distribution, were used to compare and validate the simulation results. A good agreement between the experiment and simulation has been achieved. The developed temperature, strain rate and strain path dependent forming limit prediction model has been implemented into FE simulation to capture the complicated failure features of the HFQ® formed TWBs. It is found from both experiment and simulation that the forming speed has important effects on the occurrence of failure position, where the failure mode for the 1. 5 - 2 mm TWBs may change from localised circumferential <b>necking</b> to parallel <b>weld</b> <b>necking.</b> HFQ® is a registered trademark of Impression Technologies Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} 10 - 15 years, flange joints {{designed}} for metal-to-metal face contact with self seating and pressure activated seal rings {{have been used}} extensively in high-pressure applications in industrial piping, pressure vessels, pipelines, risers and associated equipment. These flange joints are generally much smaller and lighter, with smaller bolts, than equally rated standard gasketed flange joints, and are often called compact flange joints. This paper provides all necessary information to design compact flange joints for pressure and external loads and made from any suitable material. The paper includes design methods for design of the seal ring, flange and bolts in addition to assembly guidelines. <b>Weld</b> <b>neck</b> flanges, where the hub is of uniform thickness are discussed in detail. Similar method as presented {{has been applied to}} design compact flange joints with great success for many years...|$|E
40|$|The 1 st {{generation}} acoustic monitoring {{package was}} designed to detect and analyze weak acoustic signals inside natural gas transmission lines. Besides a microphone it housed a three-inch diameter aerodynamic acoustic signal amplifier to maximize sensitivity to leak induced {Delta}p type signals. The theory and test results of this aerodynamic signal amplifier was described in the master's degree thesis of our Research Assistant Deepak Mehra {{who is about to}} graduate. To house such a large three-inch diameter sensor required the use of a steel 300 -psi rated 4 inch <b>weld</b> <b>neck</b> flange, which itself weighed already 29 pounds. The completed 1 st generation Acoustic Monitoring Package weighed almost 100 pounds. This was too cumbersome to mount in the field, on an access port at a pipeline shut-off valve. Therefore a 2 nd generation and truly Portable Acoustic Monitor was built. It incorporated a fully self-contained {Delta}p type signal sensor, rated for line pressures up to 1000 psi with a base weight of only 6 pounds. This is the Rosemont Inc. Model 3051 CD-Range 0, software driven sensor, which is believed to have industries best total performance. Its most sensitive unit was purchased with a {Delta}p range from 0 to 3 inch water. This resulted in the herein described 2 nd generation: Portable Acoustic Monitoring Package (PAMP) for pipelines up to 1000 psi. Its 32 -pound total weight includes an 18 -volt battery. Together with a 3 pound laptop with its 4 -channel data acquisition card, completes the equipment needed for field acoustic monitoring of natural gas transmission pipelines...|$|E

50|$|Robert Bettinardi {{started his}} work in the putting {{industry}} in December 1991 when he walked into a golf shop and saw an advertisement from Callaway for a putter that was milled on a Bridgeport milling machine. At the time, Bettinardi owned his own manufacturing facility with CNC (computer numerical control) machines that did work for hydraulic companies and the communications industries. Bettinardi called Callaway who put him in touch with their designer at the time. Bettinardi was able to pick up work from this particular designer and make all of his putters from 1991-1993. At the time, putting technology entailed milling the head and the neck of the putter separately, then <b>welding</b> the <b>neck</b> on to the head. It was during this time that Bettinardi created the first ever one-piece milled putter out of a solid block of steel.|$|R
40|$|Friction Pull Plug Welding (FPPW) is a {{solid state}} repair process for defects up to one inch in length, only {{requiring}} single sided tooling (OSL) for usage on flight hardware. Early attempts with FPPW followed the matching plug/plate geometry precedence of the successful Friction Push Plug Welding program, however no defect free welds were achieved due to substantial plug necking and plug rotational stalling. The dual chamfered hole has eliminated plug rotational stalling, both upon initial plug/plate contact and during <b>welding.</b> Also, the <b>necking</b> of the heated plug metal under a tensile heating/forging load has been eliminated through the usage of the dual chamfered plate hole...|$|R
60|$|The {{other type}} of drinker has imagination, vision. Even when most pleasantly jingled, he walks {{straight}} and naturally, never staggers nor falls, and knows just where he {{is and what he}} is doing. It is not his body but his brain that is drunken. He may bubble with wit, or expand with good fellowship. Or he may see intellectual spectres and phantoms that are cosmic and logical and that take the forms of syllogisms. It is when in this condition that he strips away the husks of life's healthiest illusions and gravely considers the iron collar of necessity <b>welded</b> about the <b>neck</b> of his soul. This is the hour of John Barleycorn's subtlest power. It is easy for any man to roll in the gutter. But it is a terrible ordeal for a man to stand upright on his two legs unswaying, and decide that in all the universe he finds for himself but one freedom--namely, the anticipating of the day of his death. With this man this is the hour of the white logic (of which more anon), when he knows that he may know only the laws of things--the meaning of things never. This is his danger hour. His feet are taking hold of the pathway that leads down into the grave.|$|R
