5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if this could work.|$|E

500|$|The inquiry panel {{into the}} {{accident}} consisted of Vice Admiral John B. Nathman and Rear Admirals Paul F. Sullivan and David M. Stone. [...] At Fargo's invitation the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) sent Rear Admiral Isamu Ozawa {{to participate in}} the inquiry as a non-voting adviser. [...] The three named [...] "affected" [...] parties of the inquiry were Waddle, Pfeifer, and Coen, who were present in the hearing room throughout the inquiry. Commander Mark Patton, a classmate of Waddle's at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. 20 years ago, was quoted as saying [...] "The general opinion on the waterfront was that it was important that he stand up and take responsibility. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that happen. It was important for the public to see that happen. And he did that very well." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 28 August, Lieberman invited Egyptian President Morsi {{to visit}} Israel, after being {{encouraged}} by Morsi'is statements in late August that the Israel-Egypt peace treaty was secure. Lieberman said, [...] "We certainly hope <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Morsi hosting official Israeli representatives soon; <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him giving interviews <b>to</b> Israeli media; <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him in Jerusalem as President (Shimon) Peres' guest." ...|$|R

500|$|Tal's {{return for}} the seventh season was {{announced}} at the 2011 Comic-Con. On the choice to bring Jo back for [...] "Defending Your Life", writer and co-executive producer Adam Glass explained, [...] "Knowing the history there, knowing the emotion that Dean would feel for her, we knew it'd be great. Jo's a favorite, too, so <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{her back on the}} show." [...] Tal was happy to return to the show, saying, [...] "I didn't care that it took me over a season to come back. Just to be back at all was a blessing." [...] Feeling that she herself had grown as a person since her appearance in the fifth season, Tal tried to mirror that in her performance. She noted, however, [...] "Obviously, [...] died. So there’s been some issues." [...] Singer called her work in the episode [...] "terrific." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this assessment, {{the end of}} the show's {{fourth season}} saw Hahn grow closer to {{orthopedic}} surgeon Callie Torres, in a relationship dubbed [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes has stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." [...] She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. [...] <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what would happen if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Grey and Shepherd's fight was {{described}} by Buchman as having [...] "no more taboos", {{compared to the other}} story lines developed in the episode: [...] "Even though it was a minor fight, it's very revealing for Meredith. This is probably the longest relationship she's every been in, and the first with someone she feels a genuine connection with. We might know Derek will come back, but she doesn't." [...] The last scene of them in the episode has been deemed [...] "a milestone of sorts for Meredith", with the goal to determine her to admit how new to this romantic development in her personal life she actually is, after years of being known as the woman with habitual excessive drinking and sexual relationships with inappropriate men. Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: [...] "What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems like such a waste of chemistry. When they went into that closet, the last thing <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them do is pour water on their fire", stated Buchman, noting how the scene was written to be [...] "frustrating, shocking, and therefore unexpected" [...] for the audience.|$|E

[...] Outreach events have included food and clothing drives, packaging meals at Feed My Starving Children, hosting community 5Ks for various causes, and many others.|$|R
500|$|She {{explained}} that {{in developing the}} relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what would happen if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss {{at the end of the}} season four finale, with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. You could tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry." ...|$|E
500|$|Another deleted scene {{involved}} Bruce {{waking up}} after being {{shot in the}} head by Two-Face, temporarily forgetting his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the Batmobile was, and Alfred says, [...] "Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave." [...] The platform then rotates downward to another level where the sonar-modification equipment is kept, from the special Batsuit to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the giant bat that inspired him to become Batman. Inside he finds his father's red diary which he had dropped when he first fell into the Batcave after his parents death. He reads the entry about him insisting his parents take him to the theater to see a show the same night they were killed. He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written 'even though Bruce insists, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week'. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by Rick Baker, {{who was in charge of}} the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.|$|E
500|$|The article {{revealed}} that early scripts {{for the movie}} were {{going to focus on}} series heroine Samus Aran and her origin. Tiger Hill wanted to explore Samus prior to her becoming the lone bounty hunter featured in the series. According to Foxhoven, the movie version of Samus Aran was [...] "to be an exceptionally talented, but also flawed character who was looking for redemption," [...] and elaborating that, [...] "We wanted to see her struggle, to be humbled, and to be forced to rise up against crazy odds. And of course <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the cool weapons in all of their glory." [...] The major problem that the writers faced was attempting to build-out Samus's back-story, Nintendo had [...] "creative" [...] and [...] "licensing" [...] walls that the writers ran into. Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: [...] "What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?" [...] and further stated that [...] "Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers" [...] and at the end, Nintendo [...] "felt uncomfortable with our team [...] being the ones to propose those answers" [...] which basically caused the Metroid movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees Metroid becoming a movie, stating {{at the end of the}} IGN interview that [...] "for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point" [...] and he {{revealed that}} [...] "there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing Metroid, and who would be willing to take the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Gough, {{they had}} a {{specific}} intention for {{the ending of the}} second season: [...] "Season one ended with the height of heroism, with Clark running into a tornado to save Lana.

[...] Gough likens the finale to the ending of The Empire Strikes Back, in that Clark leaves Smallville and everyone he loves because he is scared. According to Gough, in order to do [...] "the character justice", you have to take his journey through the darkness, with him failing along the way.|$|E

We did more than that. The Armory Show affected the entire culture of America. Business caught on immediately, even if the artists did not at once do so. The outer appearance of industry absorbed the lesson like a sponge. Drabness, awkwardness began to disappear from American life, and color and grace stepped in. Industry certainly took notice. The decorative elements of Matisse and the Cubists were immediately taken on as models for the creation of a brighter, more lively America. (Walt Kuhn) ...|$|E
