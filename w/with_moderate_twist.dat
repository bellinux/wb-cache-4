40|$|The {{somewhat}} controversial {{question of}} which elastic blade modes are essential in the flight mechanics of hingeless rotorcraft is studied {{on the basis}} of quasi-steady linear aerodynamics including reversed flow effects and uniform inflow. The modes are for the rotating blade, and intermode aerodynamic coupling terms are retained. The criteria for judging elastic mode effects include 19 hub moment and force derivatives, rotor trim data, rotor stability charts for lagged hub moment feedback, step gust and random gust responses. Fixed hub and constant chord blades with widely differing elasticity and inertia and <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> <b>twist</b> are assumed...|$|E

Pinnae have silver/grey scales below and tend to be semi-pendulous in the apical 1/3. They lack ramenta on the midrib below. The infiorescence, branched to 3 orders, usually holds the branches erect though they become pendulous in fruit; it is usually wider than long and remains green with maturation of the fruit. Flowers are white/cream. Staminate flower has 13-19 stamens. Fruit is red/brick-red at maturity, 17-25 mm long. Fibres in the mesocarp are in two distinct layers, the outer with thin straight fibres, the inner with thick, fiat to 0.3 mm wide, usually held tight in the dried state.|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{photometric}} {{data have}} been obtained for three early-type galaxies by using the Cerro Tololo 1. 5 -m telescope and an SEC television camera. The aim of this photometry is to gain further accurate information on the occurrence of twists in such galaxies; i. e., on any variations with radius of the position angle of the major axes of the isophotes. The results of the photometry are: (1) the finding of no detectable twist within the bulge of the S 0 galaxy NGC 5102; (2) confirmation of a substantial twist (about 10 deg) in the inner portion of the E 3 galaxy IC 1459; and (3) determination of a <b>moderate</b> <b>twist</b> (about 5 deg) within the E 4 galaxy NGC 4697, possibly too small to have been previously detected. If such <b>moderate</b> <b>twists</b> should {{turn out to be}} common in elliptical galaxies, the suspicion of triaxiality for most such galaxies would be enhanced...|$|R
40|$|About {{half the}} total volume of sawlogs end up as sawn timber. The rest is lostdue to drying {{shrinkage}} or is turned into byproducts like wood chips, sawdustand shavings. As the raw material is a large expense for a sawmill, {{it is important to}} fully utilize the logs. The inherent properties of timber are such that warp, such as bow, cup, spring and twist, is inevitable, and extensive knowledge of whether and to what extent warp will appear is therefore important for managing the production. It is also important to develop strategies to handle warped timber, for example in the planing process. This thesis focuses on how twisted timber is affected by the planing process with regard to twist reduction, cross-sectional shape, planer misses and cutting depth. This was studied in three practical tests on sawn timber with differentapproaches. In one test, sawn pine timber with a large variation of twist withinthe group was planed with standard settings, and five evenly spaced crosssections {{along the length of the}} sawn timber were subjected to more detailed studies. In the second test, the main yield from spruce logs was planed. One sample board from each log was planed with the normal pressure settings of the planing mill, while the second sample was planed with a pressure either higher or lower than the normal settings. In this study, seven cross-sections were studied in more detail, three close to the top end, three close to the butt end, and one in the middle of the sawn timber. In the third test, sawn pine timber <b>with</b> a more <b>moderate</b> <b>twist</b> was planed <b>with</b> standard settings in another similar planer.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} a multidimensional symptom profile {{in patients with}} stable {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and determine whether symptom experience differed between patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> or severe airflow limitations. BACKGROUND: Patients with severe airflow limitation experience numerous symptoms, but little is known regarding patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> airflow limitation. METHODS: A multidimensional symptom profile (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale) was assessed in 42 outpatients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> and 49 <b>with</b> severe airflow limitations. RESULTS: The mean number of symptoms in the total sample was 7. 9 (± 4. 3) with no difference between patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> and severe airflow limitations. The most prevalent symptoms with the highest MSAS symptom burden scores were shortness of breath, dry mouth, cough, sleep problems, and lack of energy in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> or severe airflow limitations experience multiple symptoms with high severity and distress. An assessment of their multidimensional symptom profile might contribute to better symptom management...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{hypothesized}} that regurgitation severity, {{as determined by}} using the regurgitant volume index, would better delineate differential cardiac dysfunction in asymptomatic patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> to severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and mitral regurgitation (MR). BackgroundFrequent surveillance echocardiography is considered appropriate in asymptomatic patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> to severe AR and MR. However, the evidence to support this practice and to define the appropriate frequency is limited. MethodsThis was an observational cohort study of consecutive patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> to severe asymptomatic AR or MR who underwent exercise echocardiography. Our cohort included 130 patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> to severe asymptomatic MR and 130 patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> to severe asymptomatic AR who were matched according to age and regurgitant volume index. All patients underwent yearly echocardiographic follow-up studies. Regurgitation severity was determined according to regurgitant volume index, with a level ≥ 30 ml/m 2 considered a marker of severe regurgitation. ResultsDuring follow-up, regardless of etiology, patients with severe regurgitation demonstrated increasing left ventricular volume indexes (4. 2 ± 1. 5 ml/m 2 per year; p = 0. 01) and decreasing left ventricular ejection fractions (1. 3 ± 0. 4 % per year; p = 0. 002). In patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> regurgitation, left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions did not significantly change. In addition, patients with severe regurgitation experienced a similar drop in contractility (end-systolic pressure/end-systolic volume ratio and single-beat pre-load recruitable stroke work) during follow-up independent of regurgitation etiology. Contractility parameters did not change in patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> regurgitation. ConclusionsThese asymptomatic patients <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> AR or MR had stable cardiac function during 3 years of follow-up; thus, frequent echocardiography without a change in clinical status may not be necessary. In the setting of severe regurgitation, further cardiac deterioration occurred at a similar rate and manner irrespective of whether the dysfunction was related to AR or MR...|$|R

This review discusses long-term consequences for general cognitive functioning, educational achievement, neuropsychological functioning and behavior. In all areas reviewed, the outcome of children with mild NE is consistently positive and the outcome of children with severe NE consistently negative. However, children <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> NE form a more heterogeneous group with respect to outcome. On average, intelligence scores are below those of children with mild NE and age-matched peers, but within the normal range. With respect to educational achievement, difficulties {{have been found in}} the domains reading, spelling and arithmetic/mathematics. So far, studies of neuropsychological functioning have yielded ambiguous results in children <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> NE. A few studies suggest elevated rates of hyperactivity in children <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> NE and autism in children <b>with</b> <b>moderate</b> and severe NE. Conclusion: Behavioral monitoring is required for all children with NE.
