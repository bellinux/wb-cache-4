The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found.

By {{the end of the}} 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} design methodologies {{in order}} to develop voice-enabled interfaces for tour-guide robots to be deployed at the Robotics Exposition of the Swiss National Exhibition (Expo. 02). Human-robot voice communication presents new challenges for design of fully autonomous mobile robots, in that interactivity must be robot-initiated in conversation and within a dynamic adverse environment. We approached these general problems for a voice enabled interface, tailored to limited computational resources of one on-board processor, when integrating smart speech signal acquisition, automatic speech recognition and synthesis, as well as dialogue system into the multi-modal, multisensor interface for the expo tour-guide robot. We also focus on particular issues {{that need to be addressed}} in voice-based interaction when planning specific tasks and research experiments for Expo. 02 where tour-guide robots will interact <b>with</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> visitors during six months, seven days a week, ten hours per day. 1...|$|R
40|$|Sequence to {{structure}} alignment {{is an important}} step in homology modeling of protein structures. Incorporation of features such as secondary structure, solvent accessibility, or evolutionary information improve sequence {{to structure}} alignment accuracy, but conventional generative estimation techniques for alignment models impose independence assumptions that make these features difficult to include in a principled way. In this paper, we overcome this problem using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) method that provides a well-founded way of estimating complex alignment models <b>with</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> parameters. Furthermore, we show that the method can be trained using a variety of loss functions. In a rigorous empirical evaluation, the SVM algorithm outperforms the generative alignment method SSALN, a highly accurate generative alignment model that incorporates structural information.

5|$|The {{action at}} Plaman Mapu {{was also a}} key factor in turning the tide of {{political}} opinion against the increasingly beleaguered Sukarno. Defeat in what was intended to be a highly publicised victory helped to break the fracturing patience of the army generals on the right and unite them against what they now saw to be the destructive force of Sukarno and the Communist Party. Tensions between the army and the Communists, already high, peaked on 30 September, when elements of the army, likely Communist, kidnapped and murdered six high-ranking army generals whom they accused of planning a CIA-sponsored coup against the President. Army Reserve Commander Suharto at Sukarno's behest took control of the army and crushed the revolt, but the damage had been done. The army blamed the revolt on the Communists, and excited an anti-leftist fervour among the populace that contributed to the subsequent anti-Communist Purge, where high-ranking members were executed along <b>with</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of suspected collaborators with millions imprisoned.

40|$|Bayesian {{tools for}} inverse {{modeling}} {{are based on}} asymptotic approximations and Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSA). Such tools require a number of moderate to large number of system re-analyses. For large-order numerical models of engineering systems, the computational requirements in Bayesian tools can be excessive. Using the Transitional MCMC algorithm, this study proposes efficient techniques for reducing the computational demands to manageable levels. Adaptive surrogate models are used {{to reduce the number}} of full system runs by an order of magnitude and parallel computing algorithms are employed to efficiently distribute the Transitional MCMC computations in multi-core CPUs. Applications in structural dynamics are emphasized in this work. Recently developed fast and accurate component mode synthesis techniques, consistent with the finite element parameterization, are implemented to achieve drastic reductions in the system order, resulting in additional substantial computational savings.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{estimating}} and maintaining {{over time the}} pose of a single Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera (PTZ). This is achieved firstly by building offline a keypoints database of the scene; then, in the online step, a coarse localization is obtained from camera odometry and finally refined by visual landmarks matching. A mainte-nance step is also performed at runtime to keep updated the geometry and appearance of the map. At the present state-of-the-art, there are no methods ad-dressing the problem of being operative {{for a long period}} of time.

Conventional algorithms {{are based on}} word-by-word models which require bilingual data <b>with</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousand</b> sentences for training. By using a word-based approach, less frequent words or words with diverse translations generally do not have statistically significant evidence for confident alignment. Consequently, incomplete or incorrect alignments occur. Our algorithm attempts to handle the problem using classbased rules which are automatic acquired from bilingual materials such as a bilingual corpus or machine readable dictionary. The procedures for acquiring these rules is also described. We found that the algorithm can align over 80 % of word pairs while maintaining a comparably high precision rate, even when a small corpus was used in. training. The algorithm also poses the advantage of producing a tagged corpus for word sense disambiguation. 1...|$|R
