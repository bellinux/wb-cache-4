25|$|These {{first two}} records were {{produced}} by John Simon, who was practically a group member: he aided in arrangements and played occasional instruments (piano or tuba). Simon {{reported that he}} was often asked about the distinctive horn sections featured so effectively {{on the first two}} albums: people <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively utilizing their limited technique.|$|E

The defense also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much money they had been paid from the filming. Ison's lawyer used his closing statement to speak more about the intrusiveness of reporters than his client's actions. Nevertheless, the only legal issue was Ison's sanity. A psychiatrist testifying for the defense identified Ison as a paranoid schizophrenic, but a prosecution psychiatrist contradicted this.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Reno tasked the Justice Department with {{compiling}} {{a report on}} DNA exoneration. The science was still new {{at that point in}} time. Reno commissioned the report after reading about the exoneration of a death row inmate. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many cases existed like the one she read about and what the Department of Justice could learn from it. The resulting report concluded there was a strong possibility that many more wrongful convictions which could be cleared with DNA evidence existed.

25|$|Bryant's {{motivation}} for the massacre remains a closely guarded secret, known only to his lawyer, who is bound not to reveal confidences without his client's consent. The lawyer later released a book outlining that Bryant was motivated largely by the media reports of the then-recent Dunblane school massacre. From the moment he was captured, he continually <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed {{to listen to music}} on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.|$|E

It was released on September 23, 2016 for Windows on Steam, and was available in English before its Japanese release on December 29, 2016 at Comiket 91. Although {{only a limited number of}} copies were sold at Comiket, Harmonia was released for general sale on May 26, 2017 in Japan. According to VisualArt's president Takahiro Baba, Harmonia was first released in English because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the game would be received worldwide before its release in Japan.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, {{based on the}} concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it feels to be an ornament. I had nothing to do in the film except look good". Kajol's next three releases that year—Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj—failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn.|$|E
500|$|What {{became of}} the {{document}} between 1776 and the mid-19th century is uncertain, but it eventually came into the possession of Mr. Patrick Anderson McEwen (a descendant of Governor Benedict Arnold) of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, from whom it passed to Isaac N. Arnold, president of the Chicago Historical Society. [...] A copy was then made by Edwin Hubbard in 1878, and ultimately published under his name the following year. [...] (It turns out that Isaac N. Arnold was descended from Thomas Arnold of Watertown, and thus not from William Arnold of Pawtuxet.) [...] As with any historical document, genealogists and historians <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> reliable it was. [...] Once the original parish registers were discovered by a researcher in 1902, it was demonstrated that every entry in Arnold's original document that could be corroborated with these parish records in England was correct and precise to the minutest detail.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Hammond Organ Company hired American {{musician}} and engineer Don Lewis {{to demonstrate its}} products, including an electronic organ with a built-in drum machine designed by the Japanese company Ace Tone. At the time, drum machines were most often used to accompany home organs; users could not program their own rhythms and had to use preset patterns such as bossa nova. Lewis was known for performances using electronic instruments he had modified himself, decades before the popularization of instrument [...] "hacking" [...] via circuit bending. He made extensive modifications to the Ace Tone drum machine, creating his own rhythms and wiring the device through his organ's expression pedal to accent the percussion.Lewis was approached by Ace Tone president and founder Ikutaro Kakehashi, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> he had achieved the sounds from the machine Kakehashi had designed. In 1972, Kakehashi formed the Roland Corporation, and hired Lewis to help design drum machines. By the late 1970s, microprocessors were appearing in instruments such as the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer sequencer, and Kakehashi realized they {{could be used to}} program drum machine rhythms. In 1978, Roland released the CompuRhythm CR-78, the first drum machine with which users could write, save, and replay their own patterns.|$|E
500|$|In {{the lead}} up to Churchill's next meeting with Eisenhower in June 1954, the President's {{assistant}} for atomic energy, Major General Howard G. Bunker, discussed carriage of American atomic bombs in British aircraft with the BJSM. A detailed list of the equipment and technical data required was drawn up, and the USAF undertook to provide training and technical assistance. It would also establish facilities to store, assemble and assist with loading the bombs. The McMahon act was amended in August 1954, and while it did not go nearly {{as far as the}} British government wanted—the transfer of information regarding the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons was still prohibited—it did now allow for the interchange of information on their use. This {{paved the way for the}} Agreement for Cooperation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes with Britain, which was signed on 12 June 1955. A colonel and two majors from the USAF and the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project were given briefings on RAF aircraft [...] to determine which American bombs could be carried. The Americans then <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many bombs would be required. The Minister of Defence, Harold Macmillan, determined that the V-bomber force would reach a strength of 240 aircraft during 1958.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture and Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment. Deller said, [...] "The Summer Bay cop may {{have lots of}} storylines, but the LC community don't really approve – mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops. It's like our hatred for Michelle Connor (Coronation Street) all over again, only this time with added scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity!" [...] In July 2009, Deller said, [...] "It {{would be easy to}} spend every month slagging off Charlie, because there's so much to dislike". Deller also added that Charlie's daughter is [...] "everything Charlie isn't". Stephen wondered if Charlie is going through an early menopause as she always appears [...] "to be in a sweat onscreen." [...] During a storyline, which saw Charlie decide she needs a counsellor to find her self-identity, Stephen complained that it was all she seemed to mention since her [...] "foray into lesbianism." [...] Stephen did, however, agree that Charlie needed a counsellor. She also stated she could help by telling her; [...] "Charlie: you're a mess." [...] Stephen was critical of Charlie's relationship with Angelo, which she described as a [...] "rocky road". She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much the show could [...] "wring out of their on/off romance" [...] and asked if somebody could send them out to sea in a sinking boat. Following Charlie and Angelo's 2011 break up, Stephen stated that the show needs to [...] "change the record!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{traveller}} {{explains in}} [...] "Part III" [...] {{how he is}} the son of an Oxford mathematics professor. When young, he loved to read outdoors and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the world worked. He became an architect and travelled throughout Europe. Eventually he married a lovely woman with whom he had a son, Henry. One day the couple left their son with his nurse during an outing and she fell asleep. When they returned, their son was gone, and he could not be found. The traveller spent years searching the countryside for his son; one day he met the woman, Dame Smithson, who had stolen his son. To please her sailor husband who wanted a child, she lied to him and said she was pregnant. Before his return, she needed a child, so she stole the traveller's. Unused to the harsh life of a peasant, the child suffered and became sickly. As a result, the woman's husband disliked him and beat him, believing him to be worthless. Hearing this story, Maurice reveals himself to be the traveller's son; he had changed his name to avoid the person he believed to be his cruel father. Overjoyed to be reunited with his son, the traveller buys the cottage for him and they return every once in a while. Maurice is educated, grows up, and travels widely. He returns to see that the cottage has disintegrated; he builds a new one for another poor fisherman's family, beside the lot of the old one.|$|E

If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take...
