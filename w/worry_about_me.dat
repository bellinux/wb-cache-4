25|$|No {{one will}} have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> keep having to push me through the things which {{would be best for}} me.|$|E
25|$|As I {{think about}} it, it {{is none of}} these things. They are not {{the reasons for this}} incident, there's a much later point to it all. Happiness. Yes happiness. If I am out of the way, all the family can get down to their own lives. Mother will not have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> making my grades, and Daddy will not have to put out more money on me, which would do no more good than it did in high school.|$|E
5000|$|Masami Nagasawa, {{who played}} {{opposite}} Nishikido as Michiru, stated that [...] "his type of acting {{is more difficult}} than mine. He also <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> being hit accidentally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{and tell}} her I think of her all the time, and worship her. Why--you are crying again. Don't be so <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> dear; I think {{there is nothing to}} fear, yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] cried Dorothy, in {{an anxious}} voice, [...] "I'm sure Uncle Henry isn't getting any better, and it's {{because he is}} <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Ozma, dear, I must go to him at once!" ...|$|R
500|$|... British Film Institute. 24 February 2010– A question-and-answer {{session with}} Morrissey and actress Helen Elizabeth about Don't <b>Worry</b> <b>About</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 2007, Morrissey {{was given}} an Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University for {{contributions}} to performing arts. In the same year, he made his feature debut directing Don't <b>Worry</b> <b>About</b> <b>Me,</b> a film about a London boy {{falling in love with}} a Liverpool girl. The film was shot on a budget of £100,000 on location in Liverpool in September and October 2007 and had its world premiere at the 2009 London Film Festival. Joseph Galliano wrote in The Times that Don't <b>Worry</b> <b>About</b> <b>Me</b> is [...] "a very understated film and feels more like European Art Cinema." [...] The film was broadcast on BBC Two on 7 March 2010 and released on DVD the next day.|$|E
2500|$|Along with [...] "The Returns," [...] {{perhaps the}} album's {{simplest}} song musically, here Jones appears jealous of Waits' apparent ease {{to get on}} with life {{at the end of the}} relationship ("he's a lucky guy/he doesn't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> when I'm gone.") ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I, myself, have a wife," [...] quoth little Maurie, with smug assurance, [...] "but {{she is not}} <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> {{wherever}} she may be; nor do I feel especial anxiety for Clarette. A woman takes what comes--especially if she is obliged to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] I said gently, [...] "that I have misled you a little. You are <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> and it isn't half so {{necessary}} as you imagine. You thought me mad {{to listen to}} my father's offer, and a coward to give up those papers to Ray. Isn't that so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better go and see my mother presently. Of course she won't be <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> for she knows I am {{able to take care}} of myself; but at the same time it will give her some {{satisfaction}} to know what I am doing. You could find my mother?" ...|$|R
2500|$|It is said that, {{on meeting}} the officer {{assigned}} to arrest him, he said: [...] "Do not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Better {{worry about your}} own self; no-one must see you leaving by the large courtyard", and {{led him to a}} side exit before galloping away on his horse.|$|E
2500|$|You {{mention in}} your letter about what I would like or need most ... However, I'm not {{complaining}} or asking for anything so don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> A good stout {{pair of gloves}} for handling barbed wire or fur gloves (lined) would be acceptable. (Lt. Cecil Louis' letter to his wife, 1916) ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith was {{sleeping}} {{in the back seat}} and was thrown forward. His injuries seemed minor initially and Smith even told Sobers, in reference to Dewdney, [...] "Don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Look after the big fellow." [...] But his spine was injured badly and he soon went into a coma. He died without regaining consciousness three days later. His body was taken to Jamaica where 60,000 people attended the funeral. His tombstone in Jamaica's May Pen Cemetery is engraved: [...] "Keen Cricketer, Unselfish Friend, Worthy Hero, Loyal Disciple, Happy Warrior." [...] Sobers and Dewdney were not seriously injured, suffering lacerations and bruises.|$|E
5000|$|After {{summers in}} Provincetown, Jack, along with Tom, his brother {{who was also}} an artist were sent to Philadelphia {{so that he could}} attend the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art for, as he explains, [...] "My parents were <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> They knew I loved to draw but could not imagine what on earth I could do to earn a living with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know your}} motive. Freddie told me. Don't you <b>worry</b> {{yourself}} <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> dear, because I am all right. I {{am going to}} be married." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{were a lot}} {{of nerves}} that third night, a lot of nerves. I didn’t sleep well. John came and got me. We went to A & W. He said I was a real basket case. He was almost <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> before the fourth day. I was so nervous the third night I called home and talked to friends for hours, but I guess once I got up and got started then things eased up. Once I started {{shooting}} and got into the rhythm of things, I knew I was ok." ...|$|R
2500|$|Subsequently, in {{a message}} to his {{subjects}} the King conveyed, [...] "Do not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> he will release me soon, without any need for payment- Tong Seal {{does not seem to}} be wealthy either." [...] When Pu Tong Seal found out about La King's attitude, he secretly collected all the wealth under his province such as silver, beads, bells, (zaam) a traditional musical instrument made of copper, other house utensils, and stored them in a large house to impress La King. One evening, Pu Tong Seal revealed his treasury to La King, and said, [...] "If you do not want to meet my demand it is fine with me, I do not need your wealth, because I am already a very wealthy man- but in that case, you will never be released to see your kingdom and your family." [...] His determination to keep the Burman king alive but never to release him was very obvious in his stern voice. This sent a chill down La King's spine. La King then immediately sent another message to his Kingdom; this time, the King ordered them to fetch him at once with all the demanded ransom. The King also added in the message, [...] "Tong Seal isn't poor at all, as I first thought, he is actually a very wealthy man".|$|E
60|$|No, dear. I shall {{get out of}} {{the mess}} somehow. I always do. You really need not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> Arnold," [...] she begged. [...] "You go away. By {{the time}} you come back, I--I shall have found a home somewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘How shall I tell Jack?’ said Edwin, ruminating. If he {{had been}} less {{occupied}} with the thought, he must have seen her singular emotion. ‘I never thought of Jack. It must be broken to him, before the town-crier knows it. I dine with the dear fellow to-morrow and next day—Christmas Eve and Christmas Day—but it would never do to spoil his feast-days. He always <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> and moddley-coddleys in the merest trifles. The news is sure to overset him. How on earth shall this be broken to Jack?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad I found ye, anyhow," [...] he said. [...] "Ye see, arter you left, I saw ye {{turn off}} the trail and make for the burning woods instead o' goin' round. I sez to myself, 'That fellow is making {{straight}} for Skinner's. He's sorter <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> and that empty pork bar'l,'--I hadn't oughter spoke that away afore you boys, anyhow,--'and he's takin' risks to help me.' So I reckoned I'd throw my leg over Jenny here, and look arter ye--and go over to Skinner's myself--and vote." ...|$|R
50|$|Aznar: The {{only thing}} that <b>worries</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> you is your optimism.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE. I {{told you}} not to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> and George. I ran away from him once--I guess I won't have to do it again.|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. You needn't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> I {{should be}} bored if I went in, and I don't {{want to be}} bored more than is necessary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> mother; I'll {{take care}} of myself and you too," [...] remarked Toady, with the cheery belief in impossibilities which makes youth so charming.|$|E
6000|$|The {{penitent}} boys poured forth apologies, {{in which}} fire, remorse, and breakfast were oddly mixed. Bobby forgave {{them like a}} gentleman, only saying, with a laugh and a shiver, [...] "Guess I'd better go home, ma'll be <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> If I'd known being out all night and getting wet {{was part of the}} business, I'd 'a' left word and brought a blanket. Be I a Round Table now? Shall I have a sword, and train with the rest? I didn't holler once, and wasn't much scared, for all the bells, and the dark, and the rain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{bought some}} buns and milk with my ten cents, and then I {{walked around the}} streets of Chicago for a time and {{afterward}} slept {{on a bench in}} one of the parks. In the morning I tried to get the umbrella to give me a magic breakfast, but it won't do anything but fly. I went to a house and asked a woman for something to eat, and she gave me all I wanted and advised me to go straight home before my mother <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> She didn't know I lived in Philadelphia. That was this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Rilla's {{imagination}} {{began to}} torment her. Suppose, she thought, I was a tiny, helpless creature only five months old, {{with my father}} somewhere in France and my poor little mother, who had been so <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> in the graveyard. Suppose I was lying in a basket in a big, black room, without one speck of light, and nobody within miles of me, for all I could see or know. Suppose there wasn't a human being anywhere who loved me--for a father who had never seen me couldn't love me very much, especially when he had never written a word to or <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Wouldn't I cry, too? Wouldn't I feel just so lonely and forsaken and frightened that I'd have to cry? ...|$|R
6000|$|You needn't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> now, dear. I am feeling {{twice the}} [...] man I was a month ago, and I shall {{stick it out}} now quite easily.|$|E
6000|$|She smiled, but {{her voice}} was tremulous. [...] "Don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> I'm all right again--at least I am better. I shall be happy if only you are successful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And mine’s a good one," [...] {{said the}} Third, [...] "registered A1 at Lloyd’s, but she don’t <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> going away. Your wife’s thirty {{years younger than}} you, isn’t she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} cowboy. [...] "Bill, old friend, I'm an {{outsider}} here. There's no call for Miss Hammond and--and {{her brother and}} Florence to be <b>worried</b> further <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> Their happy day has already been spoiled on my account. I {{want to get out}} quick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{leave me}} alone," [...] it has replied; [...] "I know where I'm going to. Don't you <b>worry</b> {{yourself}} <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> You {{mind your own}} business, all of you. I don't want {{a lot of old}} fools telling me what to do. I know what I'm about." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Welcome to the Family" [...] {{features}} {{a recording of}} Andrew Wade's heart beat {{towards the end of}} the track. The title track, [...] "Homesick", was written as one piece, before being split into two songs, which the band thought didn't work well and changed it back to one song. McKinnon said he was [...] "proud" [...] of the track: [...] "My parents were really happy when they first heard it: My dad is always <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>me</b> and my mom really did ask me to write her some soft songs. I finally did." [...] "Holdin' It Down for the Underground" [...] came about after McKinnon lost two family members and writing the song helped him relieve the pain.|$|R
