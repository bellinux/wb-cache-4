50|$|The {{position}} {{and length of}} oars is critical to rowboat performance. Generally, short boats have short oars. A 8 ft dinghy uses oars about 6+1/2 ft. A short oar makes quick but short strokes possible. A short oar is easier to use in a narrow creek or a crowded anchorage. This is important in a small tender which may be heavily laden with passengers, limiting the swing of the oars. A short, quick stroke prevents the bow being driven under in choppy waters while heavily laden. Longer oars {{can be used to}} produce longer, slower strokes, which are easier to maintain over long distances. Designers may match oar length to the amount of space provided for oar storage in the boat. Wooden oars are generally made of a light, strong wood, such as fir or ash. The blades can either be flat for general use, or spooned for faster propulsion.Utility oars are often unbalanced. Rowers looking for performance and ease of use over long distances often use balanced oars, where the inboard (handle) end uses either heavy shoulders(button/collar) or lead weights inside the handle. Generally the oar is weighted so it is balanced about 11 in outboard of the rowlock in a 7 ft oar so the oar is slightly blade heavy. Most designers position rowlocks about 12 in aft of the rowing thwart and about 6 in above the thwart. Short rowers—5 ft and under—can shorten these distances by 1 in and taller rowers—6 ft plus—can extend the distance 1 - 2 in. In a short rowing boat the distance is often shortened to 9 in and 4 in. The height of the rowlock plate is adjusted by the height of the <b>wooden</b> <b>spacer</b> block. Rowboat used as tenders should have U shaped rowlocks so oars can quickly be unshipped when coming alongside.|$|E

50|$|The Super-Sonic has two humbuckers. These pickups were {{produced}} in South Korea, and had <b>wooden</b> <b>spacers,</b> and ceramic magnets. The guitar had no tone control, but instead utilized two volume controls with pickup switching {{controlled by a}} 3-way toggle switch. The volume controls were wired reverse, with the volume control closest to the bridge controlling the bridge pickup, and the volume control closest to the input jack working the rhythm pickup.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of {{the first}} S-6 was started in August of 1911. The three bay biplane was powered by an Argus 4-cylinder {{water-cooled}} engine producing [...] Initial flight tests in late November were disappointing, revealing a long take-off run and poor climb performance. Sikorsky disassembled the aircraft and took it home where substantial modifications were undertaken, including lengthening the wingspan and reducing aerodynamic drag by enclosing the fuselage with wood veneer. Ailerons on the lower wing were removed and strut bracing wires were arranged in pairs with <b>wooden</b> <b>spacers</b> between them, further reducing drag.|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} cores, each {{consisting of}} a number of single or composite perforated plates separated by <b>wooden</b> <b>spacers</b> to form parallel flow channels, were tested in a subsonic wind tunnel. Three distinct types of augmentation in the heat transfer and friction loss performance have been identified: the transition-turbulent flow enhancement, the "second" laminar flow enhancement and the laminar flow enhancement. The first kind is observed to occur in the transition and turbulent flow regimes on low porosity surfaces [1]. The second type is detected in the "second" laminar flow regime on high porosity surfaces [2]. The present study has revealed the existence of the third pattern which occurs over the entire laminar flow region on low-porosity composite surfaces {{consisting of a}} short upstream section for producing vortices and a main section for heat transfer. An attempt is made to explain the enhancement mechanisms...|$|R
