500|$|Shortly {{after its}} release, Slay Tracks became a collector's item. According to an April 1990 Drag City press release, copies were {{typically}} sold for $500–$600. Malkmus and Kannberg each kept 100 {{copies of the}} EP, and Malkmus said [...] "I used to sell them for fifty dollars. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> money I'd go in and sell a couple {{to the store and}} they'd sell for a hundred dollars each. I rarely meet anyone who bought it when it originally came out." [...] Malkmus also said that the pair [...] "probably gave away about one-hundred to friends and bands we later toured with." [...] The songs on Slay Tracks found airplay on several college radio stations, including University of Virginia's WTJU and University of California, Berkeley's KALX.

500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E
500|$|Later reviews were {{generally}} positive. In a retrospective review, Christgau gave Janet an [...] "A–" [...] {{and said that}} although the costly production by Jam & Lewis makes the music sound [...] "more pornographic than obscene", [...] "this achievement is Janet's, period ... Better nose than Michael, better navel than Madonna, better sex than either." [...] Laura Sinagra wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that with janet, Jackson [...] "took more risks" [...] lyrically than on her previous albums. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine notes that the album [...] "was {{at the forefront of}} the increasingly popular sampling trend in the '90s, with one song even employing three different samples as its foundation. Some make perfect sense on a thematic as well as sonic level, like Kool & the Gang's [...] "Kool It (Here Comes the Fuzz)" [...] and Stevie Wonder's [...] "Superwoman, Where Were You <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Needed</b> You" [...] on [...] "New Agenda," [...] or the orchestral flourish from Diana Ross & the Supremes' [...] "Someday We'll Be Together" [...] on [...] "If," [...] which seems to exist for the sole purpose of providing the impetus behind one of the greatest dance-break routines in music video history." [...] Commenting on the album's broad range, he states: [...] "The mother of eclectic, genre-hopping records by Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, janet. incorporates new jack swing, house, pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz, and even opera, but the album's range of styles isn't jarring in the least... Janet has never been one thing and janet. is a feminist statement, to be sure." [...] Alex Henderson of AllMusic offered a positive review, saying [...] "nyone who expected Jackson to top Rhythm Nation—her crowning achievement and an incredibly tough act to follow—was being unrealistic. But with janet., she delivered a respectable offering that, although not as strong as either Control or Nation, has many strong points." ...|$|E
