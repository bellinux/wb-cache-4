5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and forma 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. Lampas {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri people believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> out of respect.|$|E
5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a <b>wide</b> <b>berth,</b> and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E

25|$|For 17 months, {{the fort}} {{was able to}} harass French {{shipping}} trying to enter Fort-de-France. The guns on the rock completely dominated the channel {{between it and the}} main island, and because of their elevation, were able to fire far out to sea and forced vessels to give it a <b>wide</b> <b>berth,</b> with the result that the currents and strong winds would make it impossible for them to fetch in Port Royal. During this time the French troops on Martinique made several unsuccessful attempts to retake the rock.|$|E
25|$|Cougars {{generally}} {{give the}} bears a <b>wide</b> <b>berth.</b> Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually {{gives way to}} the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills. There have been several accounts, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears killing each other in fights to the death.|$|E
25|$|Watford {{remained}} an agricultural community with some cottage industry for many centuries. The Industrial Revolution brought the Grand Junction Canal (now Grand Union Canal) from 1798 and the London and Birmingham Railway from 1837, both located {{here for the}} same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting steam trains drove them to ensure the railway gave a <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under Leavesden {{to the north of the}} town.|$|E

If you are not, you need but ask the police about it to learn that in all Paris there is no street to which you should give a <b>wider</b> <b>berth</b> after dark.|$|R
25|$|In episode 1, Kat, Alfie and Tommy {{arrive in}} the Irish town of Redwater, where Kat is almost {{immediately}} convinced that Andrew Kelly (Peter Campion) is her son, while Andrew's grandmother, Agnes Byrne (Fionnula Flanagan) is suspicious of her. Alfie warns Kat {{to wait for the}} right time and make friends first, but Kat confides in Agnes's husband, Lance Byrne (Ian McElhinney), that her son was taken away from her in 1983 and she believes he is in Redwater. Lance tells Agnes this, and Agnes immediately says Kat should not be told the truth as it would unravel everything they have built. Kat visits the Byrnes' farm and talks to Andrew about his life, but then Lance warns him to give the Moons a <b>wide</b> <b>berth.</b> Kat then admits to Alfie that she is scared of seeing how disappointed her son would be in her. Lance tells the local priest, Dermott Dolan (Oisín Stack), that Kat is his real mother. It is revealed that Iris Dolan (Orla Hannon) lost a baby in London and brought Dermott back as her own, and her husband, Peter Dolan (Stanley Townsend) does not know the truth. The next day, Dermott murders Lance by drowning him.|$|E
25|$|Bengal tigers {{occasionally}} prey on sloth bears. Tigers usually give sloth bears a <b>wide</b> <b>berth,</b> {{though some}} specimens may become habitual bear killers {{and it is}} not uncommon to find sloth bear fur in tiger scats. Tigers typically hunt sloth bears by waiting for them near termite mounds, then creeping behind them and seizing them by the back of their necks and forcing them to the ground with their weight. One tiger was reported to simply break its victim's back with its paw, then wait for the paralysed bear to exhaust itself trying to escape before going in for the kill. When confronted by tigers face to face, sloth bears charge at them, crying loudly. A young or already sated tiger usually retreats from an assertive sloth bear, as the bear's claws can inflict serious wounds, and most tigers end the hunt if the bears become aware of the tiger's presence before the pounce. A female bear with cubs was observed to stand her ground and prevail in a confrontation against two tigers (one female, one male) in rapid succession. Sloth bears may scavenge on tiger kills. As tigers are known to mimic the calls of sambar deer to attract them, sloth bears react fearfully even to the sounds made by deer themselves. Indian leopards can also be a threat, as they are able to follow sloth bears up trees. Sloth bears occasionally chase leopards from their kills.|$|E
500|$|A {{new team}} led by David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston {{finished}} twenty-six more for broadcast as a separate series named The New Jonny Quest. Time Warner's acquisition of Turner negated this plan, leading to the episodes' release as the second season of Real Adventures. Fred Seibert touted Quest as the [...] "Home Alone of adventure", with [...] "high-tech, multicultural themes" [...] that would appeal to contemporary youth. Promoters promised the new Quest would avoid [...] "mindless violence, chauvinism, xenophobia and insensitivity", addressing historical criticisms of the classic series. Turner also claimed that Quest would appeal to any gender, stating, [...] "Traditionally, action adventure animation may be stronger with boys, but in this case, storylines are being developed to draw girls in ... we're really hoping for a <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> of viewership." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Bickle {{decides to}} assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his {{hair into a}} Mohawk. This detail was {{suggested}} by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese's who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: [...] "Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the jungle. They cut their hair in a certain way; looked like a Mohawk ... and you knew that was a special situation, a commando kind of situation, and people gave them <b>wide</b> <b>berths</b> ... {{we thought it was}} a good idea." ...|$|R
60|$|The precipice {{was still}} in view, and before it several huge columns of rock appeared, {{detached}} from the mass behind. Two of these were particularly noticeable in the grey air--one vertical, stout and square; the other slender and tapering. They were individualized {{as husband and wife}} by the coast men. The waves leapt up their sides like a pack of hounds; this, however, though fearful in its boisterousness, was nothing to the terrible games that sometimes went on round the knees of those giants in stone. Yet it was sufficient to cause the course of the frail steamboat to be altered yet a little more--from south-west-by-south to south-by-west--to give the breakers a still <b>wider</b> <b>berth.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Despite criticisms that Gibson {{deliberately}} added {{additional material}} to the historical accounts of first-century Judea and biblical accounts of Christ's crucifixion, some scholars defend the film as not being primarily concerned with historical accuracy. Biblical scholar Mark Goodacre protested {{that he could not}} find one documented example of Gibson explicitly claiming the film to be historically accurate. Gibson has been quoted as saying: [...] "I think that my first duty is to be as faithful as possible in telling the story so that it doesn't contradict the Scriptures. Now, so long as it didn't do that, I felt that I had a pretty <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> for artistic interpretation, and to fill in some of the spaces with logic, with imagination, with various other readings." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Army of Northern Virginia {{was faced}} with a serious threat by the Army of the Potomac and its new {{commanding}} general, Major General Joseph Hooker. General Lee decided to employ a risky tactic to take the initiative and offensive away from Hooker's new southern thrust – he decided to divide his forces. Jackson and his entire corps went on an aggressive flanking maneuver {{to the right of the}} Union lines: this flanking movement would be one of the most successful and dramatic of the war. While riding with his infantry in a <b>wide</b> <b>berth</b> well south and west of the Federal line of battle, Jackson employed Maj. Gen.

The men were eating and playing games in carefree fashion, completely unaware that an entire Confederate corps was less than a mile away.

40|$|The {{spatial scale}} at which organisms respond to human {{activity}} can affect both ecological function and conservation planning. Yet {{little is known}} regarding the spatial scale at which distinct behaviors related to reproduction and survival are impacted by human interference. Here we provide a novel approach to estimating the spatial scale at which a top predator, the puma (Puma concolor), responds to human development when it is moving, feeding, communicating, and denning. We find that reproductive behaviors (communication and denning) require at least a 4 × larger buffer from human development than non-reproductive behaviors (movement and feeding). In addition, pumas give a <b>wider</b> <b>berth</b> to types of human development that provide a more consistent source of human interference (neighborhoods) than they do to those in which human presence is more intermittent (arterial roads with speeds > 35 mph). Neighborhoods were a deterrent to pumas regardless of behavior, while arterial roads only deterred pumas when they were communicating and denning. Female pumas were less deterred by human development than males, but they showed larger variation in their responses overall. Our behaviorally explicit approach to modeling animal response to human activity {{can be used as}} a novel tool to assess habitat quality, identify wildlife corridors, and mitigate human-wildlife conflict...|$|R

40|$|As Aristotle {{recognized}} in The Politics, the household is an indispensable building block of social, economic, and political life. A liberal society grants its citizens far <b>wider</b> <b>berth</b> to arrange their households than {{to choose their}} familial and marital relationships. Legal commentators, however, have devoted far {{more attention to the}} family and to marriage than to the household as such. To unpack the household, this Article applies transaction cost economics and sociological theory to interactions among household participants. It explores questions such as the structure of ownership of dwelling units, the scope of household production, and the governance of activities around the hearth. Drawing {{on a wide variety of}} historical and statistical sources, the Article contrasts conventional family-based households with arrangements in, among others, medieval English castles, Benedictine monasteries, and Israeli kibbutzim. A household is likely to involve several participants and as many as three distinct relationships—that among occupants, that among owners, and that between these two groups (the landlord-tenant relationship). Individuals, when structuring these home relationships, typically pursue a strategy of consorting with intimates. This facilitates informal coordination and greatly reduces the transaction costs of domestic interactions. Utopian critics, however, have sought to enlarge the scale of households, and some legal advocates have urged household members to write formal contracts and take disputes into court. These commentators fail to appreciate the great advantages, in the home setting, of informally associating with a few trustworthy intimates...|$|R
