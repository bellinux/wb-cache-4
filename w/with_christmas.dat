5|$|A Team D.A.D.D.Y. {{directed}} {{music video}} {{was made to}} accompany the track's release as a single. The video features a spoilt child being showered <b>with</b> <b>Christmas</b> presents while poorer children are shown in tears due to their lack of gifts. Two different endings for the video were produced - in one Santa Claus is shown crucified on a cross while another sees Santa laid {{on the floor with}} an arrow through his head.|$|E
5|$|Cookie {{cutting and}} decorating reached its {{cultural}} zenith during the boomer years <b>with</b> <b>Christmas</b> cookie cutouts of reindeer, trees, stars, and bells providing sustenance {{for kids and}} dads.

Red plastic cutters replaced tin cutters {{during the war years}} when metal was scarce and can be found today at garage sales and flea markets.|$|E

5|$|Once reliant upon Germany for its ornaments, toys, {{and even}} its Christmas customs, America became {{self-sufficient}} in the post-War years <b>with</b> <b>Christmas</b> ornaments and toys being {{manufactured in the}} United States that were considerably less expensive than their German counterparts. American Christmas customs and traditions such as visits to department store Santas and letter writing to Santa at the North Pole remained intact during America's post-War years, but the era generated contributions that have endured to become traditions.|$|E
5|$|The GWR began {{experimenting with}} the {{electric}} lighting in 1880, leading to Paddington being decorated <b>with</b> <b>Christmas</b> lights that year. Although {{the system was}} unreliable, it spurred the GWR on to a more ambitious lighting scheme in 1886, in which a 145V AC supply could light the terminus, office, goods yard and Royal Oak and Westbourne Park stations. It was praised for its scale and showing that electricity could compete with gas lighting on the same scale.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, after {{wrapping}} up the production and recording of their debut album, Into the Rush, Aly & AJ began recording their first Christmas album. Antonina Armato and Tim James {{who worked on the}} duo's debut album and several other Disney-related acts, were recruited to executive produce the effort. They anticipated finishing the album {{by the end of the}} summer, in order for it to be released for the holiday season. Aly & AJ thought it ironic that they were prepping a Christmas album during the hottest days of the year. Alyson Michalka told the Saginaw News that producers Armato and James filled the studio <b>with</b> <b>Christmas</b> decorations, Christmas cookies, and a tree with gifts to open after they were done, in order for them to get in the Christmas spirit.|$|E
5|$|Paul's second children's {{book was}} {{published}} - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem The Night the Lights Went Out on Christmas, the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the whimsical yet heartwarming story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another <b>with</b> <b>Christmas</b> lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file with the book.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{about making}} her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012, {{a month after}} {{releasing}} her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One. Having found {{the opportunity to do}} so, Clarkson commissioned producer and multi-instrumentalist Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums Stronger and Greatest Hits – Chapter One, to solely produce the whole album. Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith and unfamiliar <b>with</b> <b>Christmas</b> songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007). It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from {{being a member of the}} musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah (the first three being Lily Allen's It's Not Me, It's You in 2009, Sia's We Are Born in 2010, and The Shins' Port of Morrow in 2012).|$|E

5|$|The novel then {{switches}} {{to the second}} plot strand, the story of Lucas Burch/Joe Brown's partner Joe Christmas. The surly, psychopathic Christmas {{has been on the}} run for years, ever since presumably killing his strict Methodist adopted father. Although he has light skin, Christmas suspects that he is of African American ancestry. Consumed with rage, he is a bitter outcast who wanders between black and white society, constantly provoking fights with blacks and whites alike. Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where Byron, and later Joe Brown, works. The job at the mill is a cover for Christmas's bootlegging operation, which is illegal under Prohibition. He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden, an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers. Though their relationship is passionate at first, Joanna begins menopause and turns to religion, which frustrates and angers Christmas. At the end of her relationship <b>with</b> <b>Christmas,</b> Joanna tries to force him, at gunpoint, to kneel and pray. Joanna is murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles also {{received}} digital enhancement. For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight <b>with</b> <b>Christmas</b> had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E

25|$|Christians {{celebrate}} {{the conception of}} Jesus on 25 March (Lady Day) and his birth at Christmas (25 December) or Epiphany (6 January).

25|$|Although the {{tradition}} is imported from Sweden, it differs somewhat {{in that the}} church celebration has always been strongly centered on Christianity {{and it is a}} yearly local event in most churches in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>Christmas.</b> Schools and kindergartens also use the occasion to mark the event as a special day for children on one of the final days before the Christmas holidays, but it does not have much impact anywhere else in society.|$|E
