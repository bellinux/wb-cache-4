25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close and listen to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is {{struck by the fact}} that even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gallilee {{turned to}} her niece, and {{proceeded}} quietly with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|R
60|$|Guy {{was still}} awake, and able <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{tell him about}} Philip.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave her}} {{a little time to}} compose herself; and then asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|R
6000|$|... "If Mrs. Vimpany can put <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to us into few words," [...] Fanny replied, [...] "we shall {{hear from}} her to-morrow by telegraph." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he told himself, [...] "I don't think I {{can blame}} her, after all, and with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{it would hurt}} if I kept her waiting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't b'lieve Eureka {{would do}} such a dreadful thing!" [...] cried Dorothy, much distressed. [...] "Go and get my kitten, please, Jellia, and we'll hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it." ...|$|E
60|$|There, Lucy {{found herself}} {{at a loss}} how <b>to</b> express <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say next--and took refuge in silence.|$|R
60|$|Everyone looked rather {{blank and}} amazed, except the Story Girl. <b>She</b> knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, and <b>she</b> did it.|$|R
60|$|She locked {{her door}} and opened her writing-desk. Knowing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>she</b> tried to collect herself and do it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How can I, with my face swollen {{as it is}} now? Besides, {{what would}} be the good? What can I say to her? I know well enough <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to me, without {{listening}} to it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't say a {{thing about}} it until some time when Granny scolds me for being careless," [...] muttered Reddy, with a sly grin. [...] "Then I'll see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I guess she won't scold me so much after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll go to Hope anyway, {{and if she}} isn't there I'll {{leave my}} card, so she'll know I called. Then I'll see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about matters," [...] he told himself; and setting his teeth {{somewhat}} grimly he started up the automobile and continued his trip.|$|E
60|$|Anne rose. At a {{sign from}} Geoffrey, the servant and the lad {{waited in the}} room <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, but {{she wishes}} you would <b>have</b> heard <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{say about the}} supposing Ida <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gone in that direction.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Horace dissented widely {{from his}} friend's opinion. [...] "It's {{an insult to}} Grace," [...] he broke out, warmly, [...] "to hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The two persons {{addressed}} {{waited in}} silence to hear more. Carmina's head drooped: she looked down. Miss Minerva attentively observed Mrs. Gallilee. [...] "Why am I invited to hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about her son?" [...] {{was the question}} which occurred to the governess. [...] "Is she afraid that Carmina might tell me about it, if I was not let into the family secrets?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] Falkenberg replied pleasantly, [...] "my {{wife will}} be here herself in a few moments. You shall hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> from her own lips. You must {{remember}} that I have paid a price. I have given up the guardianship of my son. You yourself," [...] he continued, looking steadfastly at Julien, [...] "may know if any other cause exists likely to have influenced my wife in granting my request." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{gaze at the}} {{purchase}} with the amazement expected of me, and the chair itself crinkles and shudders to hear what it went for (or is it merely chuckling at her?). ‘And the man said it cost himself five shillings,’ my mother continues exultantly. You would have thought her the hardest person had not {{a knock on the}} wall summoned us about this time to my sister’s side. Though in bed she has been listening, and this is <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> in a voice that makes my mother very indignant, ‘You drive a bargain! [...] I’m thinking ten shillings was nearer what you paid.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Mountjoy {{replied that}} he was ready <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say. <b>She</b> at once stepped up to him, and {{addressed}} him in these words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have put}} your case admirably," [...] I remarked. [...] "If Madame is sincere, I {{should at least}} like <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
60|$|I then {{showed her}} a small plan of Harmer Place, which I had drawn from my {{recollection}} of it, and Sarah understood perfectly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
60|$|You will {{at first}} think her figure ungainly and stiff. It is so, partly, the dress being more {{coarsely}} repainted {{than in any}} other of the series. But she is meant to be both stout and strong. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is indeed to persuade you, if possible; but assuredly to overpower you. And she has not the Florentine girdle, for she does not want to move. She has her girdle broad at the waist--of all the sciences, you would at first have thought, the one that most needed breath! No, says Simon Memmi. You want breath to run, or dance, or fight with. But to speak!--If you know how, you can do your work with few words; very little of this pure Florentine air will be enough, if you shape it rightly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you, David, I {{can prove}} what I say. Just listen to this. My father has {{never even seen}} Minna's mother; he blindly {{believes}} the scandals afloat about her--he denies that any woman can be generally disliked and distrusted among her neighbors without some good reason for it. I assure you, on my honor, he has no better excuse for forbidding me to marry Minna than that. Is it just, is it reasonable, to condemn a woman without first hearing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in her own defense? Ah, now indeed I feel {{the loss of my}} own dear mother! If she had been alive she would have exerted her influence, and have made my father ashamed of his own narrow prejudices. My position is maddening; my head whirls when I think of it. If I go to Wurzburg, my father will never speak to me again. If I stay here, I shall cut my throat." ...|$|E
5000|$|She is romantically {{attracted}} to the narrator, who she also greatly respects because he takes the {{time to listen to}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She also thinks very highly of Miruka, and is also romantically {{attracted to}} her, what with her being bisexual ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] she laughed; [...] "I have no superstitions. I {{will go in}} {{and hear}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say." [...] And leaving him, she entered the tent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!--she understands <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do,--nobody better," [...] rejoined Leah significantly; [...] "and it is {{not every}} one could fill her shoes--not for all the money she gets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{she said}} firmly, [...] "Klara {{shall not be}} silent, Andor. Let go her arm and let her speak. I want <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
50|$|Marla {{goes to her}} screen {{test with}} a {{director}} (Patrick Fischler) who is more concerned about seeing Marla in a bikini than hearing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Later, Hughes' longtime friend Noah Dietrich (Martin Sheen) informs Hughes that he should see a doctor, as he is beginning to behave strangely. Hughes finds out that {{in order not to}} be committed to a hospital, he must be married.|$|E
50|$|When {{handsome}} motorcycle {{police officer}} Freddy pursues Betty, she accidentally breaks the speed limit. Freddy {{is forced to}} arrest her and take her to traffic court. Betty pleads her case in song, but the judge and jury {{are more interested in}} her body than <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> After the jury finds her not guilty, Betty starts celebrating as do the jury and Freddy having been kissed by Betty.|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{must have}} {{climbed into the}} cart when I left the town," [...] he said; [...] "but waken her, wife, and we will hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite {{disgusted with}} her, papa,' said Fanny. 'I really don't see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{do with my}} marriage. Let her keep to her own matrimonial projects--if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> any.' ...|$|R
60|$|Janey said no more, {{and fell}} <b>to</b> {{thinking}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer Daisy; for both took {{great pride in}} the pretty girl, who was the queen among her young friends.|$|R
