5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>between</b> the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>between</b> Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E

5|$|Dixon is {{accepted}} into the lacrosse team after trying out, but gets into a fight with team member George Evans (Kellan Lutz). Annie tells Dixon of her invitation to Naomi's party, and how she saw Ethan cheating on Naomi. The next day at school, Annie finds out that Silver made a video blog about her, depicting her as a bitchy farmer. Annie confronts Silver, who felt insulted by Annie's decision {{to hang out with}} Naomi. When Silver is reprimanded by her half-sister, Kelly, she realizes that she shouldn't reprimand Annie for <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>between</b> her and Naomi in the past. Elsewhere, Ethan is forced by his team members to lie that Dixon started the fight during, and he is subsequently kicked off the team.

Afterward, when Annie confronts Naomi, she apologizes by giving Annie an $800 dress. Annie decides to watch the school play rehearsals, and Silver apologizes for the video by asking the drama teacher to let Annie sing with the chorus for the play.

Dixon tells Annie that he feels horrible, as he sent a text message to Naomi telling her that Ethan is cheating on her.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the police}} likely {{questioned}} Page, no written {{account of her}} statement has been found.

25|$|And finally {{when looking}} at the three most {{primitive}} insects with aquatic nymphs (called naiads: Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Plecoptera), each order has its own kind of tracheal gills that are so different from one another that they must have separate origins.

Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see him for what he really was. Husk breaks down in tears.|$|E
25|$|Pieter van den Broecke, {{who visited}} Batavia from June {{until the end}} of December 1629 {{published}} a bird eye's view of Batavia in late 1629. The picture showed the completed sea-side wall of Batavia Castle but the entrance has only some wood scaffolding with no neoclassic stone decoration. It is not clear <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>between</b> 1629 and the 1630s {{because of the lack of}} documents, however in later etching of the Castle in mid 1630s, the Waterpoort had already complete with the gate decoration. The shape of this decoration is similar to that found on the wrecked VOC ship the Batavia. The Batavia fleet was supposed to carry the stone ornaments for the gates of Batavia Castle. Batavia, which departed from Texel on October 29, 1628, was shipwrecked on the Houtman Abrolhos, Western Australia, on June 4, 1629. On July 7, 1692, Pelsaert arrived at Batavia to report the shipwreck, so on July 15 the Sardam departed from Batavia to rescue the Batavia fleet and salvage the goods which include material for the decorative gates. Sardam arrived at the wreck-site on September 17, 1629 and stayed there until November 15. It arrived back at Batavia on December 5, 1629. Apparently not all of the salvages were discovered, as another gateway stone ornaments were discovered in 1963 and was now kept in the Maritime Museum in Fremantle, Australia. It has been assumed that the stone gateway ornaments discovered in the 1960s were the one destined for the Waterpoort of Batavia Castle. Evidence for this assumption is a gold pendant, dated 25 November 1632, which was made to commemorate the Chinese contribution to the defeat of the army of Mataram. It clearly shows the completed Watergate.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention.

He says he was optimistic, and then asks <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>between</b> them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the {{newspaper}} and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
