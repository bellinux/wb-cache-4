5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to study at the University of London, in the early 1960s Notosusanto– by then a lecturer– <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> by General Abdul Haris Nasution and tasked with writing {{a history of the}} {{revolution}} and Madiun Affair.

5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce sound for film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and acoustics. Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best sound on film had to be developed by hard work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E

5|$|As {{dozens of}} newly {{unemployed}} professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their {{colleagues in the}} United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> by representatives of two educational institutions, Bryn Mawr College in the United States and Somerville College at the University of Oxford in England.

5|$|Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 when he <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had {{recently}} begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology {{when he came}} upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E
5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged.

Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.|$|E

5|$|Denning became {{best known}} {{as a result of his}} report into the Profumo Affair. John Profumo was the Secretary of State for War with the British government. At a party in 1961 Profumo was {{introduced}} to Christine Keeler, a showgirl, and began having an affair with her. At the same time she was in a relationship with Yevgeni Ivanov, a naval attaché at the embassy of the Soviet Union. On 26 January 1963 Keeler <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> by police on an unrelated matter and voluntarily gave them information about her relationship with Profumo.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Sing <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> by the World Wrestling Federation to {{help their}} ailing women's division.

Because of her background, Reyes considered that these believers may have simply formed a cult, but did not rule out the possibility of alien intervention. She stayed with the case until after Mulder was returned by his abductors, but returned to her field office soon after.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010, the BBC {{announced}} , four interactive episodes available free-to-download on the BBC Doctor Who website {{featuring the}} Doctor and Amy voiced by Smith and Gillan. Piers Wenger {{referred to them}} as four extra episodes in the series and everything included {{was part of the}} Doctor Who universe. The game was developed by Charles Cecil and Sheffield-based game company Sumo, while the games were written by Phil Ford and James Moran and overseen by Moffat and the producers of the show. Cecil <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> by BBC Wales Editor of Interactive Iain Tweedale, who asked him about developing a Doctor Who game.

5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt {{to compare the}} manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the letters {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.|$|E
5|$|In {{the face}} of {{neighbourhood}} gossip about the death rate in the home, Catherine, Margaret, and Thomas moved their household to 105 Latimer Street and then again to 27 Ascot street. In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet {{another member of the}} household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died after two days of illness. Days later, the same doctor <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> and asked to provide a death certificate. He did so, attributing the death to dysentery.|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{clinical trial}} {{in which the}} serum anti-phenolic glycolipid (anti-PGL- 1) antibodies were analysed in household contacts (HHC) of patients with leprosy as an adjunct early leprosy diagnostic marker was conducted. The families of 83 patients underwent clinical examination and serum anti-PGL 1 measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 320 HHC, 98 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of lepromatous leprosy (LL), 80 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline lepromatous (BL), 28 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline (BB) leprosy, 54 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of borderline tuberculoid (BT), 40 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of tuberculoid (TT) and 20 <b>were</b> <b>contacts</b> of indeterminate (I) leprosy. Consanguinity with the patients was determined for 232 (72. 5 %) HHC. Of those 232 contacts, 183 had linear consanguinity. Forty-nine HHC had collateral consanguinity. Fifty-eight contacts (18. 1 %) tested positive for anti-PGL 1 antibodies. The number of seropositive contacts based on the clinical forms of the index case was 17 (29. 3 %) for LL, 15 (25. 9 %) for BL, one (1. 7 %) for BB, 14 (24. 1 %) for BT, three (5. 2 %) for TT and eight (13. 7 %) for I. At the one year follow-up, two (3. 4 %) of these seropositive contacts had developed BT leprosy. The {{results of the present}} study indicate that the serum anti-PGL- 1 IgM antibody may be useful for evaluating antigen exposure and as a tool for an early leprosy diagnosis in HHC.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} first chat with Manning, Lamo {{discussed}} the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group ProjectVIGILANT, which researches cybercrime, and with Timothy Webster, {{a friend who had}} worked in Army counterintelligence. Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo <b>was</b> <b>contacted</b> by CID agents shortly thereafter. He told them he believed Manning was endangering lives. He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. Nicks argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.|$|E
