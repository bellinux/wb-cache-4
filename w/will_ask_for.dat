5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{watches the}} aftermath of the explosion on the news, knowing that the group <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> his assistance with the case. Dees is among the rescuers seen on the broadcast. Black travels to DC and meets up with fellow group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups. Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone keypad.|$|E
25|$|It {{is typical}} {{for only one}} timpano to be struck at a time, but {{occasionally}} composers <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> two notes. This is called a double stop, a term borrowed from the string instrument vocabulary. Ludwig van Beethoven uses this effect in the slow third movement of his Ninth Symphony, as do Johannes Brahms in the second movement of his German Requiem and Aaron Copland in El Salón México. Some modern composers occasionally require more than two notes. In this case, a timpanist can hold two sticks in one hand much like a marimba player, or more than one timpanist can be employed. In his Overture to Benvenuto Cellini, for example, Hector Berlioz realizes fully voiced chords from the timpani by requiring three timpanists and assigning one drum to each. He goes as far as ten timpanists playing three- and four-part chords on sixteen drums in his Requiem, although {{with the introduction of}} pedal tuning, this number can be reduced.|$|E

2500|$|An Islamic Front {{sharia court}} judge in Aleppo, Mohamed Najeeb Bannan, stated: [...] "The legal {{reference}} is the Islamic Sharia. The cases are different, from robberies to drug use, to moral crimes. It's {{our duty to}} look at any crime that comes to us[...] [...] After the regime has fallen, {{we believe that the}} Muslim majority in Syria <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> an Islamic state. Of course, it's very {{important to point out that}} some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." [...] In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, [...] "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen , they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate. This goes against the beliefs of religious scholars around the world. This is what [...] did wrong. This is going to cause a lot of trouble. Anyone who opposes [...] will be considered against Sharia and will be severely punished." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, Lewis {{studied at}} the Southwest Bible Institute in Waxahachie, Texas, before being thrown out for daring to play a boogie-woogie version of [...] "My God Is Real", and that early {{incident}} foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing [...] "the devil's music." [...] Lewis had a recorded argument with Sam Phillips during the recording session for [...] "Great Balls of Fire", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous ("How can...How can the devil save souls? [...] What are you talkin' about?" [...] he asks Phillips during one heated exchange). During the famous Million Dollar Quartet jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer Rick Bragg explains {{that part of the}} reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because [...] "only Elvis and Jerry Lee [...] raised in the Assembly of God", and Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words … they was Baptists', [...] said, and therefore deprived." [...] He often talked to his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart, about the condition of his soul. Evangelist Swaggart and Lewis would pray together, but Lewis found it hard to alter his lifestyle. Evangelist Swaggart still often speaks with love of his cousin in his sermons, of their childhood together, and their continuing relationship. He <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> prayers for Lewis if he is suffering illness.|$|E
2500|$|Phishing on AOL {{was closely}} {{associated}} with the warez community that exchanged unlicensed software and the black hat hacking scene that perpetrated credit card fraud and other online crimes. AOL enforcement would detect words used in AOL chat rooms to suspend the accounts individuals involved in counterfeiting software and trading stolen accounts. The term was used because '<><' is the single most common tag of HTML that was found in all chat transcripts naturally, and as such could not be detected or filtered by AOL staff. The symbol <>< was replaced for any wording that referred to stolen credit cards, accounts, or illegal activity. Since the symbol looked like a fish, and due to the popularity of phreaking it was adapted as 'Phishing'. AOHell, released in early 1995, was a program designed to hack AOL users by allowing the attacker to pose as an AOL staff member, and send an instant message to a potential victim, asking him to reveal his password. In order to lure the victim into giving up sensitive information, the message might include imperatives such as [...] "verify your account" [...] or [...] "confirm billing information". Once the victim had revealed the password, the attacker could access and use the victim's account for fraudulent purposes. Both phishing and warezing on AOL generally required custom-written programs, such as AOHell. Phishing became so prevalent on AOL that they added a line on all instant messages stating: [...] "no one working at AOL <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> your password or billing information". A user using both an AIM account and an AOL account from an ISP simultaneously could phish AOL members with relative impunity as internet AIM accounts could be used by non-AOL internet members and could not be actioned (i.e., reported to AOL TOS department for disciplinary action).. In late 1995, AOL crackers resorted to phishing for legitimate accounts after AOL brought in measures in late 1995 to prevent using fake, algorithmically generated credit card numbers to open accounts. Eventually, AOL's policy enforcement forced copyright infringement off AOL servers, and AOL promptly deactivate accounts involved in phishing, often before the victims could respond. The shutting down of the warez scene on AOL caused most phishers to leave the service.|$|E
