5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would {{find it hard to}} maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E
5|$|Life in Nelson <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the colonists. The {{company had}} limited {{finances}} and tightened its expenditure which affected {{the salaries of}} its employees. In 1844, it had to halt its operations for a time. Although Nelson had 300 landowners, nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in the town. Brunner lived at Riwaka, a nearby village, and, in addition to carrying out survey work along the Motueka River, helped {{in the design and}} building of houses in the area. He ended his service with the company in August 1844.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the {{transition}} to the postwar economy <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. Unlike {{in the rest of the}} state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.|$|E

5|$|The local batsmen {{were unable}} to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his {{opponent}} had missed the ball and been bowled. Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9. It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at Nos. 7, 8 and 9.N- However, he was often effective when he did get an opportunity.|$|E

25|$|Lucrecia was {{originally}} a fairly minor character in VII. It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> {{the staff to}} recreate her for Dirge of Cerberus as they needed to rely on low-detail concept art and in-game models. To create the new model of Lucrecia, the concept team used Sephiroth's appearance as a base, deciding that the latter would have a maternal rather than paternal resemblance. Lucrecia is voiced by April Stewart in English and Rio Natsuki in Japanese.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, however, homeowner's discriminatory {{covenant}} {{practices were}} killed in state courts. The increasingly large black population in Chicago (40,000 in 1910, and 278,000 in 1940) faced {{some of the same}} discrimination in Chicago as they had in the South. It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> many blacks to find jobs and find decent places to live because of the competition for housing among different groups of people {{at a time when the}} city was expanding in population so dramatically. At the same time that blacks moved from the South in the Great Migration, Chicago was still receiving thousands of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The groups competed with each other for working-class wages.|$|E
25|$|The Koppenberg {{has been}} dropped some years {{because it was}} deemed too {{difficult}} and too dangerous. Particularly when wet weather had made the cobbles slippery, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> riders to take the steep slopes all the way riding. One rider falling could bring many others down and, in turn, halt those behind, who often had to shoulder their bikes and run up {{the remainder of the}} hill. In 1984 only two riders– Phil Anderson and Jan Raas– got to the top on their bikes. In 1987 Danish rider Jesper Skibby slipped and fell on the slick cobbles, before being run over by an official's car who tried to pass him. The climb was subsequently banned from the Tour of Flanders for the next 15 years.|$|E
25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a natural {{experiment}} {{in history to}} show that different institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant that it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In places where it was easier for colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, as {{we have seen in the}} colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years ago has determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E

25|$|He {{lived with}} his mother in Mecca for three years until she took him to Yathrib to visit some {{relatives}} (uncles from the mother side), and she died on the way back. Now orphaned, Muhammad, aged 6, was passed into the custody of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, who was eighty years old. According to traditional accounts, Muhammad was very close to his grandfather, as had been his father before him. However, two years later, his grandfather died. Muhammad then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. In 6th-century Arabia, there was general disdain for guardians who took care of the weaker members of the tribes in Mecca. Although Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not starve to death, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> them to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time.|$|E
25|$|Sunny soon {{left the}} team and Droz, then known as Puke (Darren Drozdov, a former {{defensive}} end for the Denver Broncos who earned the name Puke when caught vomiting on Monday Night Football), started to accompany them to the ring. At the same time, Paul Ellering returned, but sided with the Disciples of Apocalypse (DOA), whom LOD were feuding with at the time; Ellering and Animal explained on the DVD it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> them to rip on each other on promos. For {{the second time in}} the history of the Road Warriors they participated in a storyline where tension arose between the members, teasing a break up. In this storyline, Hawk was seen by his partner Animal as unfit to wrestle and Puke was tapped to take Hawk's place in the tag team as an official member. The angle played off Hegstrand’s real life alcohol and drug issues, going so far as to faking a suicide jump off the top of the TitanTron. After the angle bombed and both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis voiced their objections to it, the angle was dropped. The Legion of Doom made a very brief return, first on the March 22, 1999 Raw is War by attacking Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco in a backstage skit after the two impersonated LOD in a handicap match against Shane McMahon, on the March 15, 1999 Raw is War. Both LOD entered the pre-WrestleMania battle royal with the last two participants getting a tag team title shot later at WrestleMania XV but both came up short. They would make one final appearance on the March 29, 1999 Raw challenging Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett for the tag team titles but failed them; they left the WWF afterwards.|$|E
