After moving to Far Rockaway, Queens, he transferred to Far Rockaway High School in the early 1940s, a school that also produced fellow laureates Burton Richter and Richard Feynman. Blumberg served as a U.S. Navy deck officer during World War II. He then attended Union College in Schenectady, New York and graduated from there with honors in 1946.|$|R

50|$|Elim (1629, {{published}} by Menasseh ben Israel, Amsterdam) is <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>Hebrew,</b> <b>in</b> response <b>to</b> 12 general and 70 specific religious and scientific questions sent to Delmedigo by a Karaite Jew, Zerach ben Natan from Troki (Lithuania). The {{format of the}} book is taken from the number of fountains and palm trees at Elim in the Sinai Peninsula, as given in Numbers, xxxiii, 9: since there are 12 fountains and 70 palm trees at Elim, Delmedigo divided his book into twelve major problems and seventy minor problems. The book, however, was heavily censored, so only four of the original twelve major problems appeared in the published work. The subjects discussed include astronomy, physics, mathematics, medicine, and music theory. In the area of music, Delmedigo discusses the physics of music including string resonance, intervals and their proportions, consonance and dissonance. Delmedigo argued that the Jews did not take part in the Scientific Revolution because of Ashkenazi exclusive intellectual interest in the Talmud, whereas the Sepharadim and the Karaites were more interested in natural philosophy and philosophy in general. He called the Jews to reclaim their prominence in philosophy and to incorporate into the non-Jewish surrounding via the exploration of natural sciences.|$|R

Now, as that period in the history of scrolls scholarship draws to a close, more and more attention has turned to the contents of the texts from the eleven caves in the vicinity of Khirbet Qumran as a collection. Several things may be said about this collection. First, the majority of the texts are <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>Hebrew,</b> thus pointing <b>to</b> <b>Hebrew</b> as a living language (at least in literature) in the Second Temple Period. Second, {{a large percentage of the}} texts found in the caves (about 25 percent) are copies of books later considered part of the canon of the Hebrew Bible; there are also copies of books that were later grouped into the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. Third, of the 2 ̆ 2 previously unknown 2 ̆ 2 works unearthed from the caves, the vast majority of them bear some relationship to the books that later became known as the Hebrew Bible. It is with classifying and understanding these manuscripts, both individually and in relation to one another, that scholarship is now occupied...|$|R
50|$|His Risalah, {{a letter}} <b>in</b> Arabic but <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Hebrew</b> script, <b>to</b> the {{community}} at Fes (ed. Bargès and Goldberg, Paris, 1857), is the earliest known contribution to the critical study of the Semitic languages. The work {{is divided into three}} sections, with an introduction. He warns the community not to neglect the study of the Targumim since they are important for a correct knowledge of the Bible, which contains many Aramaisms. In the first section, he compares biblical words to similar Aramaic words. In the second section, he focuses on comparing biblical words <b>to</b> later Rabbinic <b>Hebrew</b> words. He makes the comparison for 17 words even if {{they do not have a}} direct comparison. The third section is structured differently from the other two in that he does not deal with individual words. Instead, he deals with the larger relationship between the three Semitic languages. He explores ideas such as the interchange of letters or pronunciation, the presence or loss of certain weaker letters in roots like the Nun, the changes of letters used in tenses, changes in gender in names and number and additional vowels or the lack thereof. An additional section is attached to the third section in which he examines the relationship between Arabic and <b>Hebrew,</b> specifically. <b>In</b> particular, he notes the exchanges of Aleph with Ayin, Ayin with Ghain, Zayin with Dalet, Tsade with Teth, Shin with Taw, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Though many Jewish Israeli rappers {{are present}} in the country’s pop culture, fewer Palestinian hip-hop groups have surfaced, though one has gained {{widespread}} popularity. The group's name, DAM, is the Arabic verb for [...] "to last forever/eternity" [...] (دام) and the Hebrew word for [...] "blood" [...] (דם), but can also be an acronym for [...] "Da Arabian MCs." [...] DAM could be argued to be the polar opposite of Subliminal’s right-wing stance. Formed in 1998, DAM is noted as the first Arab-Israeli hip-hop group and consists of three Palestinian men who hold Israeli citizenship as well: Tamer Nafer, his brother Suhell, and a friend, Mahmoud Jreri. [...] Though the rappers mostly sing in Arabic, they do <b>write</b> songs <b>in</b> <b>Hebrew</b> and English as well, to ensure that they reach all of their intended audiences. The content of their songs is largely focused on the many conflicts existent between Israel and the Palestinians, including the issue of Palestinians feeling like second-class citizens of the country. DAM often challenges Zionism with their lyrics and accuses the Israeli government of racism and inequality. Many of their songs demand treatment equal to that offered to the Jewish citizens of Israel. According to lead rapper Nafer, “our message is one of humanity- but it’s also political- we make protest music.” DAM’s first single of 2001, “Meen Erhabe?” (or “Who’s the Terrorist?”) was not even released by an official recording label, but was still downloaded from online by over one million visitors. Their latest rap single, “Born Here,” is <b>written</b> and performed <b>in</b> <b>Hebrew</b> <b>to</b> further expand their audience. Nafar has also stated that the reasoning for the transition <b>to</b> <b>Hebrew</b> lyrics is <b>to</b> be able to transmit the messages of the injustices to the Israelis very clearly. Nafar has said that his position is to replace politicians; “Politicians don’t talk to our generation. But politics is the way of our life, so I’m bringing the way of our life in their language.” [...] In November 2006, DAM ultimately released an official album, titled “Dedication.” ...|$|R
40|$|The first {{periodical}} publications carrying news written {{by and for}} Arabs appeared during {{the first part of}} the 19 th century. The major developments in the field of non-governmental Arabic press occurred, however, only during the second half of that century. That was also the time when Jews started to take an active part in founding, editing, and writing for Arabic newspapers, periodicals, and professional journals in various parts of the Arab world. First it included newspapers and periodicals in Judeo-Arabic dialects and only later in standard Arabic language. The main centres of journalistic activity by Jews in the Arab world were Baghdad, Cairo, Beirut, Alexandria, Damascus and Tunis. Newspapers founded by Jews were mostly ephemeral, however, there were also periodicals that prospered for decades. There was a connection between the involvement of Arab Jews in canonical Arab culture and the development of the Arabic-Jewish press and journalism: wherever Jews tried to integrate politically, socially and culturally into society (Iraq, to a lesser extent in Egypt, Lebanon and Syria) there were always active Jewish owners of Arabic newspapers and periodicals as well as editors and journalists <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> standard literary Arabic. But wherever Jews showed no significant interest in the canonical Arabic cultural activities of their society (e. g. North Africa), only periodicals <b>in</b> Judeo-Arabic dialects <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>Hebrew</b> letters are <b>to</b> be found (in addition to newspapers in other languages). Jewish newspapers published in both Judeo-Arabic dialects and standard Arabic had generally one main aim in common: promoting modernisation of Jewish life in Arab societies and encouraging Jews to become acquainted with the achievements of Western civilisation. After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, there has been a sharp decline in Arabic journalism by Jews; in fact we are currently witnessing the demise of Arab-Jewish culture. A tradition that started more than fifteen hundred years ago is vanishing before our eyes. ...|$|R

40|$|The study under report {{stepped out}} of the fact that most {{students}} of the English Department of Widya Mandala University find it difficult to learn poetry regarding to its "incomprehensible" words and peculiar dictions. Among the various poetical literary works the writer has chosen a metaphysical, religious and sacred poem from the Bible. The Book of Ecclesiastes was originally <b>written</b> <b>in</b> <b>Hebrew</b> but due <b>to</b> her limited knowledge about the language, the writer had chosen its English translated standardized version : the King James Version. This Book consists of twelve chapters but considering time limitation, the writer decided to study the closing chapter (chapter twelve) which concludes the arguments of the whole Book. This study intended to answer the following research questions (1) what is the central theme of chapter twelve (the conclusion) of the Book of Ecclesiastes and (2) what particular verbal expressions are used by the author to show the theme. By finding and interpreting the particular verbal expressions used by the poet, the writer finally came to the central theme of the poem as posed by the first research question. Using three theories in her effort to analyze the work (1) Content Analysis, (2) Practical Literary Critic ism and (3) Discourse Analysis along with the parameters stated in Chapter III, the writer finally found one major theme and two. minor themes. The major central theme in the poem is the expression of regret yet thoughtful of a man that the possibilities of life experience are so sharply limited with time. The first minor theme talks about the limitation of age while the second minor theme talks about death [...] It is then finally concluded that one must live in "fear" to God the Creator, in order to face this life which is short and full of vanity. The writer also found that the poem is richly ornamented with figures of speech, especially metaphor, personification, metonymy, synechdoche, overstatement, understatement, and eight symbols. Each line of the poem is unique because they are intertwined to each other and the meanings of the verbal expressions found in each interpretation bring the writer into the central theme of the poem. The writer suggests that later researchers continue the study by working on other aspects of the poem or the whole Book of Ecclesiastes...|$|R
