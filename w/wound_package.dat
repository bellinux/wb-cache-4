40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the <b>wound</b> <b>package,</b> and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a <b>wound</b> <b>package,</b> particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random <b>wound</b> <b>package</b> and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision <b>wound</b> <b>package</b> are also presented...|$|E
40|$|An Orbital Winch {{mechanism}} enables high-load, multi-line tethers to {{be deployed}} and retracted without rotating the spool on which the tether is wound. To minimize damage to the tether and the <b>wound</b> <b>package</b> during retraction or deployment under load, it can incorporate a Tension Management Module that reduces the infeed tension {{by a factor of}} 15 {{through the use of a}} powered capstan with guide rollers. This design eliminates the need for rotating high-voltage electrical connections in tether systems that use propellantless electro-dynamic propulsion. It can also eliminate the need for rotating optical connections in applications where the tether contains optical fibers. This winch design was developed to deploy a 15 -km-long, 15 -kg high-strength Hoytether structure incorporating conductive wires as part of the MXER- 1 demonstration mission concept. Two slewing rings that orbit around the tether spool, combined with translation of one of the slewing rings back and forth along the spool axis to traverse the wind point, enables the winch to wind the tether. Variations of the traverse motion of the slewing ring can accomplish level winds and conical pirn winds. By removing the non-traversing slewing ring, and adding an actuated guide arm, the winch can manage rapid, low-drag deployment of a tether off the end of a pirn-wound spool, followed by controlled retraction and rewinding, in a manner very similar to a spin-casting reel. The winch requires at least two motor driver controller units to coordinate the action of two stepper motors to accomplish tether deployment or retraction...|$|E
50|$|The dye {{particles}} are not penetrated uniformly throughout the fibre structure due to several reasons like poor pre-treatment of yarn before dyeing, channeling of dye liquor circulation due to faulty loading of carriers with yarn <b>wound</b> <b>packages,</b> high density of packages (especially in cheese/cone dyeing) and many more.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In textile {{production}} the yarn {{is being}} withdrawn from cross-wound packages in warping and weft insertion. During unwinding there appear {{forces in the}} yarn that are approximately proportional to {{the square of the}} unwinding velocity. During unwind the yarn tension is not constant, but it oscillates within some interval. This is especially noticeable in over-end unwinding from a static cross <b>wound</b> <b>packages,</b> where the yarn is being withdrawn with a high velocity {{in the direction of the}} package axis. Even when the yarn is not strongly stressed, so that the tension does not exceed a few percent of the breaking strength, the yarn still can break sometimes. This is why we think that a cross-wound package is not an ideal form of a package and that such packages are not always made without flaws...|$|R

Although many were captured and killed, the unit still remained intact, but morale was low and sickness was setting in. Many men only had a few bullets left and no food. Bandages were being taken off {{of the dead and}} reused on the <b>wounded.</b> A <b>package</b> was reported to have been dropped in for the men to resupply, but all reports point to it falling into German territory.

50|$|The {{unprocessed}} yarn {{is provided}} on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At {{a speed of}} up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered into the heat setting process. There are two basic ways of transportation of the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a “figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special stuffer box, the so-called Twinroll-Box (TRB).The heat setting process takes place at temperatures between 110 °C and 200 °C in a steam-air-mix. After heat setting, the yarn is cooled and <b>wound</b> onto <b>packages</b> again at the winder. In general a heat setting machine consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production of up to 10.5 tons is possible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} {{observed}} {{over the years that}} yarn tension during high speed over-end unwinding from a helically <b>wound</b> stationary <b>package</b> is highly non linear (1). Each yarn element during unwinding performs a complex motion that involves a movement along the yarn axis and rotation about the package axis. Parameters that affect the yarn tension are linear yarn density, unwinding speed, package diameter, balloon profile, and specific yarn winding density of the cone or cheese. This paper analyses mathematically the influence of the above stated parameters at the guide eyelet on yarn unwinding tension. On the basis of the model it proposes a cost effective mechanical device for tension variation control where a movable guide eyelet is used. The proposed device helps to minimize tension variation during unwinding and to obtain more or less constant tension, which definitely improves the quality of the package prepared from cones or cheeses (for example a warp beam). The concept behind the proposed system is to move the guide eyelet with respect to reducing cone or cheese diameter according to the proposed mathematical model. This will invariably affect the uniform unwinding tension, which also improves the quality of subsequent processes such as warping, sizing, pirn winding and processes associated with package dyeing...|$|R
30|$|Bio-nanocomposite films-based chitosan–PVA/Na+MMT were {{developed}} by a simple solution casting technique. It {{was found that the}} biodegradable polymer was successfully intercalated into clay galleries. Drug loading efficiency of chitosan–PVA/Na+MMT films increases with increasing clay content and higher clay content exhibited higher rate of drug release. Compared with chitosan and chitosan/Na+MMT nanocomposite films which did not show clear microbial inhibition zones, chitosan–PVA/Na+MMT nanocomposite films showed distinctive microbial inhibition zones against two test microorganisms and exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The present study is useful in developing novel antimicrobial agents for applications in <b>wound</b> burns/dressing, antimicrobial <b>packaging,</b> and prevention/treatment of infections due to the control release ability. In addition, the chitosan–PVA/Na+MMT nanocomposite films are a promising material for the development of new membranes for waste water treatment.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNovel {{methods for}} the {{deposition}} of silver nanoparticles on variety of substrates have attracted attention for technological applications. Herein an in situ chemical deposition method {{has been established}} for the deposition of Silver nanoparticles (AgNP's) on different substrates. The substrates that were coated with AgNP's include flexible laboratory filter paper, nanopatterned aluminum substrate and soda glass. The approach yields uniform and well adhered coatings without agglomerations, within two minutes and such instant methods are rarely observed in literature. Presence of AgNP's has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDS for the coatings. The average size of the particles coated on the substrates range from 50 - 100 nm. The coatings are best suited for biological and analytical applications such as <b>wound</b> healing, food <b>packaging,</b> Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, etc...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial cellulose-based {{antifouling}} {{materials have}} been produced by incorporation of silver nanoparticles for broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Three variations of silver nitrate (AgNO 3) to reducing agent concentrations have been tried to vary the silver nanoparticle dimension. The formation of silver nanoparticles was also evidenced by the X-ray diffraction, and the crystallite size was found to decrease with increase in NaBH 4 concentration. AgBC composites having < 2 % (W/W) of silver exhibited 99. 9 % antimicrobial activity which was sustained up to 72 h against spoiled food derived mixed microbial culture. On the other hand, only 90 % activity was observed with colloidal AgNPs due to aggregate formation. Composites displayed superior antimicrobial activity than colloid with equivalent amount of silver. Food stuff was protected from microbial spoilage for 30 days when stored in AgBC nanocomposites, whereas spoilage was noticed within 15 days for food stuff stored in regular polythene bag. Therefore, the AgBC composite having < 2 % silver {{can be used as}} a lining of regular food packaging material to extend shelf life till 30 days. Toxicity due to high amount of silver can be prevented with these composites and can be safely used in healthcare applications such as food <b>packaging,</b> <b>wound</b> dressing, hospital bed lining and surgical apparels...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} explores the in situ {{fabrication}} of chitosan-poly(vinyl alcohol) -silver nanocomposite films {{in view of}} their increasing applications as antimicrobial <b>packaging,</b> <b>wound</b> dressing and antibacterial materials. The reduction of silver ions into silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is achieved in acidic solution of chitosan (C) and poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) using their functional groups (-OH, -COOH, -NH 2 groups). The presence of silver nanoparticles in the chito-san-PVA film is confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray Dif-fraction (XRD) analysis. The Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images illustrate the presence of embedded silver nanoparticles throughout the films. In addition, the formed silver nanoparticles have an average particle size of ~ 16. 5 nm as observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The anti-microbial and anti-fungal activity of the chitosan-PVA silver nanoparticle films have demonstrated significant effects against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Candida albicans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). To improve further their therapeutic efficacy as anti-microbial agents, curcumin encapsulated chitosan-PVA silver nanocomposite films are developed which showed enormous growth inhibition of E. coli compared to curcumin and chitosan-PVA silver nanoparticles film alone. Therefore, the present study clearly provides novel antimicrobial films which are potentially useful in preventing/treating infections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the pirn winding process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of pirns. Hence the balloon effect varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first pirn <b>wound</b> from a <b>package</b> to the last pirn wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in pirn windings. The author attempted to theoretically analyze the tension variation in the yarn path of the pirn winding machine and theoretically model the tension variation with and without deadweight placement on the tensioners. Author also verified the accuracy and the validity of the model developed through the experimental results obtained at different locations along the yarn path. ...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{properties}} of metal nanoparticles like large fraction of surface atoms, large surface energy, spatial confinement, and reduced morphology make it {{significantly different from the}} corresponding bulk materials. These unique properties of nanoparticles make them applicable in the field of catalysis, agriculture, electronics, biomedical analysis [9], and even ground water purification [10]. Gold, silver, copper, iron, zinc, and other metal nanoparticles are used in food <b>packaging,</b> <b>wound</b> dressings, catheters for drug delivery, and so on due to the broad range of antimicrobial effects. Silver nanoparticles are known to be mostly used in the field of biomedical science due to their great antimicrobial effect; zinc and titanium nanoparticles are known to be used in cosmetics. The second application area of biological nanoparticles is the formulation of biosensors for various molecules related to environmental factors and agriculture. In addition, nanoparticles are also used in gene delivery and cell labelling in plants and in medicine [11]. Other applications of metal nanoparticles are still under research and in development, such as magnetically responsive drug delivery, photoimaging, and photothermal therapy. Nowadays, due to the physicochemical properties and the application of nanoparticles in many fields of sciences, scientific community decided to make extensive efforts to develop a novel route for producing nanoparticles. Although other physicochemical approaches cause environmental pollution by discharging heavy metals during synthesis process. Thus, the synthesis of nanoparticles using green approaches has the several advantages like non-toxicity, reproducibility in production, having easy scaleup, and well-defined morphology becomes new trends in nanoparticles synthesis [12]. In recent years, plants and microbes have found as new resources with considerable synthesis of organic metal nanoparticles [13]. In this review paper, we review the methods of making nanoparticles using different plant extracts, possible mechanism of nanoparticle synthesis, and their pharmaceutical applications, and products available in the market their clinical trial status are also reviewed.|$|R
40|$|Aims and objectives: The aim of {{this project}} was to develop an {{educational}} package for undergraduate student nurses that would {{provide them with the}} theoretical knowledge and clinical judgement skills to care for a patient with a wound. Background: Internationally there is concern over the adequacy of preparation of undergraduate nurses for the clinical skill of wound care. Deficits have also been identified in the underpinning biological sciences needed for this skill. Expectations associated with wound management have altered significantly {{in the last two decades}} with decision making around wound care coming under the scope of practice of nurses. The treatment and care options for patients with wounds must be based on a sound knowledge of how wounds are formed and healed. If nurses do not have the evidence-based knowledge, it can affect wound healing adversely leading to increased patient suffering, pain and delayed healing. From an organisational perspective, delayed healing will increase the cost of care. Design: This project used constructivism learning theory to provide a framework for the development of a <b>wound</b> care educational <b>package</b> for undergraduate Irish nurses in their penultimate year of training. Methods: Collaboration was formed with key stake holders. Pertinent curriculum content was mapped. Learning strategies to suit the incoming student learning styles were incorporated into newly developed theoretical content and practical skill sessions. Conclusion: The developed educational programme will assist student nurses in their care of patients with wounds. Relevance to clinical practice: This study provides a model that can be followed to develop small units of the study to keep abreast of changes in health care delivery and the changing scope of practice of nurses. It also contributes to the debate on the teaching and learning of biosciences as it highlights the depth of biological knowledge required as a basis for good evidence-based nursing care...|$|R
