40|$|BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic {{esophagitis}} (EE) {{is often}} associated with concomitant atopic diseases. In children with EE in whom food allergens have been identified as causative factors, elemental and elimination diets result in an improvement or resolution of symptoms. Most adult EE patients are sensitized to aeroallergens, which cross-react with plant-derived food allergens, most commonly to grass pollen and cereals. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To investigate the clinical relevance of the sensitization to <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> rye, and the efficacy of an allergen-specific elimination diet in adult EE patients. METHODS: Six patients (five men, one women) with permanently active EE sensitized to grass pollen <b>and</b> the cereals <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> rye underwent a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge and were kept on an elimination diet avoiding <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> rye for 6 weeks. RESULTS: The challenge tests with <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> rye did not provoke any EE symptoms in all patients. The elimination diet failed in reducing disease activity. Although one patient noticed an improvement of symptoms, endoscopic and histopathologic findings remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In adult EE patients, sensitization to <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> rye does not seem causative for EE. Elimination diet is not a reliable and efficient therapeutic measure in EE patients sensitized to <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> rye. Low specific immunoglobulin-E levels to <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> rye may be a consequence of the underlying grass pollen allergy...|$|R
