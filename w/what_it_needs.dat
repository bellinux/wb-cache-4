500|$|Scenes were filmed {{primarily}} in Portland, Oregon. Stunt {{work was done}} mainly by the cast. The fight sequence between Gigandet and Pattinson's characters in a ballet studio, which was filmed {{during the first week}} of production, involved a substantial amount of wire work because the vampires in the story have superhuman strength and speed. Gigandet incorporated mixed martial arts fighting moves in this sequence, which involved chicken and honey as substitutes for flesh. Bella, the protagonist, is unconscious during these events, and since the novel is told from her point of view, such action sequences are illustrative and unique to the film. Pattinson noted that maintaining one's center of gravity is difficult when doing wire work [...] "because you have to really fight against it as well as letting it do <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to do."

500|$|When Ike {{returns to}} his headquarters, he is hired by the Laguz Alliance, {{consisting}} of the hawk nation of Phoenicis, the raven nation of Kilvas, and the beast nation of Gallia. Their representative, Ranulf, explains that Rafiel has revealed that the Begnion senate was responsible for assassinating the previous apostle of Begnion and framing the heron clans for it, resulting in their near annihilation. This {{has led to the}} newly formed Laguz Alliance declaring war on Begnion. The situation quickly escalates, threatening to become a world war that will awaken the god of chaos Yune, who will supposedly destroy the world if unleashed. Begnion coerces Daein into preparing to join the war on their side with the blood pact and uses another blood pact to force Kilvas to betray the Laguz Alliance. The Alliance makes major gains in the early months of the conflict, aided a great deal by the tactical ingenuity of Ike and his mercenaries. As the Alliance prepares to march south into Begnion's heartland, the Begnion central army arrives to block the way. The central army is better equipped than the previous enemies of the Alliance and is led by the highly capable General Zelgius. Zelgius and his army hold back an attempted river crossing by the Alliance, and Zelgius defeats Skirmir (the hot-headed commander of the beast laguz) in single combat, severely wounding him. While this is occurring, Begnion launches an invasion of Phoenicis and razes its capital to the ground, severely weakening the capabilities of the hawk laguz. Seeing the weakened state of the Alliance, the Begnion senate orders Daein to enter the war and crush the Laguz Alliance. Seeing no other choice, Pelleas orders Micaiah (who, along with the population of Daein, know nothing of the blood pact) to lead the Daein army south into Begnion. Micaiah attempts to trap the Alliance between her forces and the central army, but a lack of concern for her soldiers {{on the part of the}} Begnion senate deprives her of accurate information on the size of the laguz forces. Ike is able to lead the Alliance to safety. Zelgius, openly loyal to Empress Sanaki in the decades long political Senate-Empress power struggle, allows the Alliance to escape, hinting to Ike that the Empress does not support the war. In response to this, the senators have Sanaki's prime minister and father figure Sephiran arrested. The Empress flees the capital of Begnion soon afterward with her royal guard. Now in control of the country, the senate orders Zelgius (who is an ardent supporter of Sephiran) to pursue and destroy the retreating Laguz Alliance, and sends one of their number, Senator Valtome, to enforce order in the army. The Alliance falls back to the borders of Gallia, the homeland of the beast nation. Ike is able to lead the Alliance through a perilous volcanic cave network and thereby elude the central army. Undeterred, the senate decides to invade Gallia by marching through the neutral nation of Crimea. Begnion demands that Elincia provide them with supplies, but the Queen refuses due to her alliance with Gallia (signed at the end of Path of Radiance) and because the earlier rebellion destroyed much of the kingdom's crops. Valtome, infuriated by the denial, orders the central army to take <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> from the Crimeans, whom he views as subjects of Begnion. Begnion begins raiding Crimean villages for supplies, drawing the Crimean Royal Knights into a skirmish. As the Laguz Alliance and the central army prepare to fight a battle on Crimean soil, Elincia arrives and places herself in between the two opposing armies. She demands that both sides leave Crimean territory, as it is a land of peace. Zelgius leads the central army off of the field of battle, an action that enrages Valtome. He orders his soldiers to kill Elincia, an action prevented by the Royal Knights and Greil Mercenaries. Back in the central army camp, Valtome orders Zelgius to be executed for his disloyalty. This is stopped by the arrival of Empress Sanaki and her royal guard. The soldiers of the central army turn on Valtome, who flees with all of the men loyal to the senate. Soon after, the Crimeans, the Empress' men, and the Laguz Alliance members sign a treaty and make a pact to defeat the Begnion senate. Civil war breaks out across the Begnion Empire as the forces of the Empress and Senate begin to clash.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{traditionally}} monolithic kernels are now {{at least}} adding (if not actively exploiting) the module capability. The most well known of these kernels is the Linux kernel. The modular kernel essentially can have parts of it that are built into the core kernel binary or binaries that load into memory on demand. It {{is important to note}} that a code tainted module has the potential to destabilize a running kernel. Many people become confused on this point when discussing micro kernels. It is possible to write a driver for a microkernel in a completely separate memory space and test it before [...] "going" [...] live.

2500|$|Microkernel (also {{abbreviated}} μK or uK) is {{the term}} describing an approach to operating system design by which the functionality {{of the system is}} moved out of the traditional [...] "kernel", into a set of [...] "servers" [...] that communicate through a [...] "minimal" [...] kernel, leaving as little as possible in [...] "system space" [...] and as much as possible in [...] "user space". A microkernel that is designed for a specific platform or device is only ever going to have <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to operate. The microkernel approach consists of defining a simple abstraction over the hardware, with a set of primitives or system calls to implement minimal OS services such as memory management, multitasking, and inter-process communication. Other services, including those normally provided by the kernel, such as networking, are implemented in user-space programs, referred to as servers. Microkernels are easier to maintain than monolithic kernels, but the large number of system calls and context switches might slow down the system because they typically generate more overhead than plain function calls.|$|E
