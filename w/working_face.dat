500|$|Horses and ponies {{began to}} be used in Britain's mining pits in the 18th century, to haul [...] "tubs" [...] of coal and ore from the <b>working</b> <b>face</b> to the lifts, in deep mines, or to the surface in {{shallower}} mines. Many of these ponies were Shetlands, as their small size was combined with great strength. A stud farm {{for the sole purpose of}} breeding ponies for the pits was established in 1870 by colliery owner Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry, and the Shetland Pony Stud Book Society was formed in 1890 to stop the use of the best stallions in the pits. By 1984, only 55pit ponies were being used by the National Coal Board in Britain, chiefly at the modern pit in Ellington, Northumberland. A horse called [...] "Robbie", probably the last to work underground in a British coal mine, was retired from a mine at Pant y Gasseg, near Pontypool, in May 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, in the <b>working</b> <b>face,</b> the {{compacted}} waste {{is covered with}} soil or alternative materials daily. Alternative waste-cover materials include chipped wood or other [...] "green waste", ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of January 4, 41 hours after the {{incident}} began, 12 of the miners were found dead. Randal L. McCloy, Jr. was found alive, but in critical condition. The remaining miners were found at the <b>working</b> <b>face</b> of the second left portion of the mine, some [...] from the mine entrance, behind a [...] "rough barricade structure", as described by Hatfield. This is the same area where drilling had indicated high carbon monoxide levels.|$|E
40|$|Consensus on {{protective}} seam mining technology {{to solve the}} problems of coal and gas outburst has been reached. For upper {{protective seam}} mining, the effect of pressure relief and permeability in the lower protected layers is determined by the distance between the seams. If the distance is small, the effect of pressure relief and permeability on the lower protected seams is better, but there will be more relief gas flows to the <b>working</b> <b>faces</b> of the protective seam, and gas control of the <b>working</b> <b>faces</b> will be more difficult...|$|R
30|$|Local {{backfilling}} {{and limited}} height mining {{have also been}} carried out in some coal mines of Shendong mining area. The main approach is to reduce mining height properly or partially fill the areas near the open-off cuts of <b>working</b> <b>faces</b> and the recovery line.|$|R
30|$|The {{horizontal}} movement factors are basically between 0.20 and 0.30, which accorded {{with the general}} values of other ordinary fully-mechanized <b>working</b> <b>faces</b> (Wang 2014). It is safe to conclude that a significant increase doesn’t appear in the horizontal displacement due to the high-intensive mining.|$|R
2500|$|During {{landfill}} operations a scale or weighbridge may weigh {{waste collection}} vehicles on arrival and personnel may inspect loads for wastes {{that do not}} accord with the landfill's waste-acceptance criteria. Afterward, the waste collection vehicles use the existing road network {{on their way to}} the tipping face or working front, where they unload their contents. After loads are deposited, compactors or bulldozers can spread and compact the waste on the <b>working</b> <b>face.</b> Before leaving the landfill boundaries, the waste collection vehicles may pass through a wheel-cleaning facility. If necessary, they return to the weighbridge for re-weighing without their load. The weighing process can assemble statistics on the daily incoming waste tonnage, which databases can retain for record keeping. In addition to trucks, some landfills may have equipment to handle railroad containers. The use of [...] "rail-haul" [...] permits landfills to be located at more remote sites, without the problems associated with many truck trips.|$|E
6000|$|Bradley {{looked at}} the fire, with a <b>working</b> <b>face,</b> and {{was silent for a}} while. At last he said, with what seemed an {{inconsistent}} composure of voice and feature: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{spare me}} further distress, will you not, please?" [...] His hoarse reply was incoherent, but she needed {{only to see}} his <b>working</b> <b>face</b> to know his remorse and gratitude.|$|E

2500|$|The Butterley Tunnel was {{excavated}} {{by first}} sinking 33 shafts, about [...] apart {{as much as}} [...] deep to give a number of <b>working</b> <b>faces.</b> Most of the heading was through soil, with some coal measures and iron ore deposits, the final tunnel being lined through most of its length.|$|R
30|$|For {{underground}} mines, self-propelled diesel {{equipment that}} does not require power cable or constant charging batteries is preferred because <b>working</b> <b>faces</b> usually cover extensive areas where these facilities are not available. However, emission from the tailpipe and its subsequent distribution in the underground mine are of growing concerns for miners.|$|R
60|$|She ran {{ahead of}} him, intercepted him, faced {{him with her}} back against the door. He swept out a long arm as if to brush her aside. But it wavered and fell. Haggard, troubled, with <b>working</b> <b>face,</b> he stood before her.|$|E
6000|$|By {{a violent}} effort I {{controlled}} myself {{and touched her}} hand. I tried to say some word of explanation to her. She looked into my <b>working</b> <b>face</b> and winced. [...] "I must do it," [...] she said hopelessly. Then she turned from me and began walking rapidly down the gallery.|$|E
6000|$|Kurt thrilled {{in all his}} being. His poor {{father was}} being misled and robbed. A melancholy flash of comfort came to Kurt! Then at sight of Glidden's hungry eyes and <b>working</b> <b>face</b> and {{clutching}} hands Kurt pulled his hat far down, drew his revolver, and leaped forward with a yell, [...] "Hands up!" ...|$|E
50|$|The Butterley Tunnel was {{excavated}} {{by first}} sinking 33 shafts, about 75 yd apart {{as much as}} 57 yd deep to give a number of <b>working</b> <b>faces.</b> Most of the heading was through soil, with some coal measures and iron ore deposits, the final tunnel being lined through most of its length.|$|R
50|$|The Jenkins {{crew were}} {{familiar}} with hard rock mining from their native Wales, but this work was different from coal mining. To speed progress, a shaft was sunk 181 feet deep inside Hoffman Mine number 3. From the bottom, the men dug in both directions, giving four <b>working</b> <b>faces,</b> including the exit portals.|$|R

6000|$|... "...must--have--money," [...] Glidden was saying. To Kurt's eyes treachery {{gleamed in}} that <b>working</b> <b>face.</b> Neuman {{bent over to}} whisper gruffly in Dorn's ear. One of the silent men {{standing}} rubbed his hands together. Old Dorn's head was bowed. Then Glidden spoke so low and so swiftly that Kurt could not connect sentences, but with mounting blood he stood transfixed and horrified, to gather meaning from word on word, until he realized Anderson's doom, with other rich men of the Northwest, was sealed--that {{there were to be}} burnings of wheat-fields and of storehouses and of freight-trains--destruction everywhere.|$|E
60|$|One day he {{descended to}} the lower level, where the men were having trouble in the manager's absence. A number of lamps were burning and the place looked wetter than usual in the {{unsteady}} light. Water trickled down the end wall, the rows of props were dripping, and the half-naked men splashed through pools when they moved to and fro. They were feverishly busy: one group building a massive pillar, others putting up fresh props; {{only two or three}} were breaking out ore at the <b>working</b> <b>face.</b> Then Carnally came toward him, and his wet face showed tense and anxious in the light of Andrew's lamp.|$|E
60|$|They {{set to work}} on the new heading {{at sunrise}} next morning, but it was a week or two before they had made much of an opening in the rock beneath the fall. Though Nasmyth had lowered the level of the river a little, the smooth-worn stone still rose sheer from the depths of the {{whirling}} pool, and the blasting had obliterated every trace of their previous operations. They were compelled to make new approaches, and they toiled, drenched with the icy spray, on frail, slung stages, cutting sockets for the logs to hold a heavier platform for the little boring-machine Nasmyth had purchased in Victoria. When the platform was built, the <b>working</b> <b>face</b> was narrow, and the rock of a kind that yielded very slowly to the cutting-tool. They had no power but that of well-hardened muscle, and none of the workers had any particular knowledge of engineering.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} build the tunnel, twenty shafts were sunk along its route, so {{that there could be}} {{multiple}} <b>working</b> <b>faces.</b> However, there were considerable difficulties caused by the volume of water entering the shafts. Horse-powered pumps proved inadequate, and eventually steam-powered pumps were employed, but this added to the cost, and the tunnel was a large factor in the failure to complete the canal.|$|R
50|$|In 1913 {{an aerial}} tramway was {{installed}} from the mine to the Loudoun mill. Improved facilities for travelling between {{the surface and}} the <b>working</b> <b>faces</b> were installed in 1915 when the mine was down 445 metres. Production improved by 1918 to 934 tons of tin ore for a return of 26.5 tons of concentrates valued at £4,350 but no dividends were paid {{for the third year}} running.|$|R
50|$|The cave was {{discovered}} on 13 February 1954, when blasting {{at one of}} the <b>working</b> <b>faces</b> opened up a cave passage, and is now choked with sludge waste from the quarry. It was first explored by David Penrose and boys from Midsomer Norton Grammar School (now Norton Hill School) who named it in honour of Gordon Hillier who was headmaster of the school from 1926 to 1958.|$|R
60|$|Now the {{agreement}} was that when the word had been given Idernes and I, and the noble and Bes, should fight together, but if they killed one of us, or we killed one of them, the two who survived might fall together on the remaining man. Remembering this, as he told me afterwards, at the signal Bes leapt forward like a flash with <b>working</b> <b>face</b> and foam upon his lips, and before ever I could come to Idernes, how I know not, had received the blow of the Eastern lord upon his shield and without striking back, had gripped him in his long arms and wrapped him round with his bowed legs. In an instant {{they were on the}} ground, Bes uppermost, and I heard the sound of blow upon blow struck with knife or sword, I knew not which, upon the Eastern's mail, followed by a shout of victory from the Egyptians which told me that Bes had slain him.|$|E
6000|$|A machine-gun loosed a few {{shots in}} the fumbling style of her kind when they feel for an opening. A couple of rifle shots answered. They might have been {{half a mile away}} or a hundred yards below. An adorable country! We climbed up till we found once again a {{complete}} tea-garden of little sunk houses, almost invisible in the brown-pink recesses of the thick forest. Here the trenches began, and with them for the next few hours life in two dimensions--length and breadth. You could have eaten your dinner almost anywhere off the swept dry ground, for the steep slopes favoured draining, there was no lack of timber, and there was unlimited labour. It had made neat double-length dug-outs where the wounded could be laid in during their passage down the mountain side; well-tended occasional latrines properly limed; dug-outs for sleeping and eating; overhead protections and tool-sheds where needed, and, as one came nearer the <b>working</b> <b>face,</b> very clever cellars against trench-sweepers. Men passed on their business; a squad with a captured machine-gun which they tested in a sheltered dip; armourers at their benches busy with sick rifles; fatigue-parties for straw, rations, and ammunition; long processions of single blue figures turned sideways between the brown sunless walls. One understood after a while the nightmare that lays hold of trench-stale men, when the dreamer wanders for ever in those blind mazes till, after centuries of agonizing flight, he finds himself stumbling out again into the white blaze and horror of the mined front--he who thought he had almost reached home! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{scene of}} the coming {{spectacle}} of this bright new day lies spread before us, and certainly no spot could have been better chosen for dramatic effect. In front of the waggons is a large, flat, open space, backed by bold rising ground with jutting crags and dotted clumps of luxuriant vegetation. All around spreads the dense thorn-bush, allowing but of one way of approach, from the left. During the morning we could hear snatches of distant chants growing louder and louder as time wore on, and could catch glimpses of wild figures threading the thorns, warriors hastening to the meeting-place. All through the past night the farmers for miles around had been aroused by the loud insistent cries of the chief's messengers as they flitted far and wide, stopping but a moment wherever one of their tribe sojourned, and bidding him come, and bring plume and shield, for Pagadi had need of him. This day, we may be sure, the herds are left untended, the mealie-heads ungathered, for the herdsmen and the reapers have come hither to answer to the summons of their chief. Little reck they whether it be for festival or war; he needs them, and has called them, and that is enough. Higher and higher rose the fitful distant chant, {{but no one could}} be seen. Suddenly there stood before us a creature, a woman, who, save for the colour of her skin, might have been the original of any one of Macbeth's [...] "weird sisters." [...] Little, withered, and bent nearly double by age, her activity was yet past comprehension. Clad in a strange jumble of snake-skins, feathers, furs, and bones, a forked wand in her outstretched hand, she rushed to and fro before the little group of white men. Her eyes gleamed like those of a hawk through her matted hair, and the genuineness of her frantic excitement was evident by the quivering flesh and <b>working</b> <b>face,</b> and the wild, spasmodic words she spoke. The spirit at least of her rapid utterances may thus be rendered:-- ...|$|E

50|$|Small petrol {{two-stroke}} engines, such as for motorcycles, use crankcase compression {{rather than}} a separate supercharger or scavenge blower. This uses {{both sides of the}} piston as <b>working</b> <b>faces,</b> the lower side of the piston acting as a piston compressor to compress the inlet charge ready for the next stroke. The piston is still considered as single-acting, as only one of these faces produces power.|$|R

50|$|Crab {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} a winch for pulling cars out of the un-powered tracks. This approach allowed use of temporary track that was too light to carry {{the weight of the}} a cable-reel or battery locomotive. The disadvantage of a crab locomotive was that someone had to pull the haulage cable from the winch to the <b>working</b> <b>face,</b> threading it over pulleys at any sharp turns.|$|E
60|$|Steele hissed {{the last}} word. Then for him--for me--for Hoden--there {{was the truth}} in Wright's <b>working</b> passion-blackened <b>face.</b>|$|R
500|$|Two {{sighting}} towers {{were built}} {{at a cost}} of £140 for the surveyors to keep the line true, then from 20 October 1845 twenty shafts were sunk to enable tunnelling. [...] Tunnelling started after the foundation stone was laid at the bottom of No. 1 airshaft in July 1846. The separate <b>working</b> <b>faces</b> were joined into a single tunnel on 27 November 1848, and work was completed in summer 1849.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} months of 1921, Hamar Greenwood and others were declaring that the IRA was near defeat. However, it quickly became clear that the British Government {{strategy}} of combining repression with limited concessions was still not <b>working.</b> <b>Faced</b> with the choice of either waging a war of reconquest or negotiating peace, the government chose negotiation. A Truce was signed in July 1921, and the Treaty in December.|$|R
