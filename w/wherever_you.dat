5|$|In {{recording}} Revelation, Third Day {{aimed to}} produce a southern rock album while being more creative musically; the band felt the end result was their best record to date. As a whole, the album is noted as adopting a heavier and edgier rock sound than Third Day's previous adult contemporary-projects such as <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> Are (2005), while the album's lyrics reflect Christian themes. The album features guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Lacey Mosley of alternative metal band Flyleaf, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph.|$|E
5|$|Revelation was {{released}} on July 29, 2008 and debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, selling at total of 75,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was their best week to date in both sales and chart position; their previous career high was when their 2005 album <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> Are debuted and peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, selling a total of 63,000 copies. Revelation also debuted at #1 on the Christian Albums chart, their fourth career number-one album on that chart, at No. 2 on the Rock Albums chart, and at No. 6 on the Digital Albums chart. In 2011, the album peaked at No. 3 on the Top Catalog Albums chart.|$|E

We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.)

500|$|Revelation {{possesses}} a heavier, edgier rock sound {{than many of}} Third Day's previous albums, which leaned towards an adult contemporary sound; this is particularly noticeable when compared to 2005's <b>Wherever</b> <b>You</b> Are. The opening track [...] "This Is Who I Am" [...] is a southern rock song seen by reviewers as demonstrating the band's confidence and security in their musical style. Its lyrics call for God to accept people for their flaws and make them better. [...] "Slow Down" [...] is a rock song featuring backing vocals from Chris Daughtry of the rock band Daughtry and lyrics asking that God [...] "pace our lives". [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Call My Name", is a pop rock song, while [...] "Run to You" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad set in 6/8 time.|$|E
500|$|Even before Born {{had taken}} up the chair in Berlin, von Laue had changed his mind, and decided that he wanted it after all. [...] He {{arranged}} with Born and the faculties concerned for them to exchange jobs. In April 1919 Born became professor ordinarius and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics on the science faculty at the University of Frankfurt am Main. While there, he was approached by the University of Göttingen, which {{was looking for a}} replacement for Peter Debye as Director of the Physical Institute. [...] "Theoretical physics," [...] Einstein advised him, [...] "will flourish <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> happen to be; there is no other Born to be found in Germany today." [...] In negotiating for the position with the education ministry, Born arranged for another chair, of experimental physics, at Göttingen for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck.|$|E
500|$|Clay Jarvis from Stylus Magazine {{wrote that}} the song possessed [...] "a red-herring, scorched-earth intro, eerie thunderstorm-and-tom-tom-triplet {{interlude}} {{and one of the}} most recognizable riffs in metal history. It is a dynamic, explosive and fitting end to a remarkable, violent experience." [...] D. X. Ferris wrote, author of the 33⅓ book Reign In Blood (...) , that the song [...] "lunges to life with its core riff, the ten most recognizable notes in metal, a diminished-scale run down the fretboard that's the most badass guitar riff since Black Sabbath's 'Sweet Leaf'." [...] Guitarist Kerry King said that [...] "The intro is big with the two harmony and then the first beat that Dave [...] does, that double-kick thing, and it's like this backwards gallop that gets the crowd going <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> are."

500|$|Wessel became {{well-known}} {{among the}} Communists when [...] on orders from Goebbels [...] {{he led a}} number of SA incursions into the Fischerkiez, an extremely poor Berlin district where Communists mingled with underworld figures. Several of these agitations were only minor altercations, but one took place outside the tavern which the local Communist Party (KPD) used as its headquarters. As {{a result of that}} melee, five Communists were injured, four of them seriously. The Communist newspaper accused the police of letting the Nazis get away, while arresting the injured Communists, while the Nazi newspaper claimed that Wessel had been trying to give a speech when shadowy figures emerged and began the fight. Wessel was marked for death by the KPD, with his face and address featured on street posters. The slogan of the KPD and the Red Front Fighters' League became [...] "Strike the fascists <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> find them." ...|$|E
500|$|Bungie began {{development}} of ODST in March 2008. ODST {{was the first}} Bungie title completed {{in less than three}} years, as production lasted 14 months. Since the team—numbering around 70, plus a five-person core design group—had such a small window for development, they had to prioritize features; for example, rather than completely redesigning the enemies, only a small new subset of artificial intelligence behaviors were added. Because the game featured an open world different from most Halo missions, certain gameplay tweaks, such as the revamped weapons and an overhead map, were necessary. Whereas in a traditional Halo game, the designers would know from what locations players would approach groups of enemies, ODST required a different strategy. [...] "We had to make sure we had groups of Covenant patrolling the city who could react from <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> attack from and look intelligent doing it," [...] Creamer said. Though the game engine remained unchanged, graphical enhancements such as fullscreen shader system and parallax mapping added greater detail and realism.|$|E
500|$|Finally, a Bedouin story {{states that}} Allah created the Arabian horse {{from the south}} wind and exclaimed, [...] "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I {{establish}} thee {{as one of the}} Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings." [...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature out of you. Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you <b>wherever</b> <b>you</b> go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E
