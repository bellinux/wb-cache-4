50|$|Recycling {{rinse water}} from the {{semiconductor}} manufacturing process has been discouraged by many manufacturing engineers for decades {{because of the risk}} that the contamination from the chemical residue and particles may end up back in the UPW feed water and result in product defects. Modern Ultrapure Water systems are very effective at removing ionic contamination down to parts per trillion levels (ppt) whereas organic contamination of ultrapure water systems is still in the parts per billion levels (ppb). In any case recycling the process water rinses for UPW makeup has always been a great concern and until recently this was not a common practice. Increasing water and wastewater costs in parts of the US and Asia have pushed some semiconductor companies to investigate the recycling of manufacturing process rinse water in the UPW makeup system. Some companies have incorporated an approach that uses complex large scale treatment designed for worst case conditions of the combined <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> More recently new approaches have been developed to incorporate a detailed water management plan to try to minimize the treatment system cost and complexity.|$|E
5000|$|UV {{filters are}} being used {{increasingly}} due to growing concern about UV radiation and skin cancer, especially {{as a result of}} ozone depletion. The levels of certain UV-filters in sunscreens vary from 0.5 to 10%, sometimes reaching 25%. They enter the environment directly through bathing activities in oceans, rivers and lakes or through industrial <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> They are indirectly introduced through domestic water discharge during showering, bathing or urine excretion or through waste water treatment.Waste water treatment plants (WWTP) are not very effective at removing these contaminants. Several UV filters have been detected at ppb or ppt levels in surfacewater and wastewater, with maximum concentrations in summer time. They are lipophilic and tend to accumulate in the aquatic environment’s soils and sediments {{as well as in the}} food chain. Several studies have actually shown the presence of UV filters in aquatic organisms. The 4-methyl-benzylidenecamphor was detected in the muscle tissue of trout in Swiss and German waters, while traces of ethylhexylmethoxy cinnamate and octocrylene were found in shellfish in the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of France. Furthermore, eighteen organic sunscreens were found in sediments of Japanese rivers and lakes, at concentrations ranging from 2 to about 3000 ng/g. The accumulation of organic UV filters in living organisms is of major concern because some of them (and their metabolites) can act as endocrine disruptors both in vitro and in vivo [...] In addition, Goksøyr et al.(2009) reported concentrations of organic UV-filters in openwaters of the Pacific Ocean, providing evidence of the persistence and wide dispersion of these components in the marine environment.|$|E
