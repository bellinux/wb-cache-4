40|$|BACKGROUND: Arctium species (Asteraceae) are {{distributed}} worldwide {{and are used}} as food and rich sources of secondary metabolites for the pharmaceutical industry, e. g., against avian influenza virus. RNA silencing is an antiviral defense mechanism that detects and destroys virus-derived double-stranded RNA, resulting in accumulation of virus-derived small RNAs (21 - 24 nucleotides) {{that can be used}} for generic detection of viruses by small-RNA deep sequencing (SRDS). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SRDS was used to detect viruses in the biennial wild plant species Arctium tomentosum (woolly burdock; family Asteraceae) displaying virus-like symptoms of vein yellowing and leaf mosaic in southern Finland. Assembly of the small-RNA reads resulted in contigs homologous to Alstroemeria virus X (AlsVX), a positive/single-stranded RNA virus of genus Potexvirus (family Alphaflexiviridae), or related to negative/single-stranded RNA viruses of the genus Emaravirus. The coat protein gene of AlsVX was 81 % and 89 % identical to the two AlsVX isolates from Japan and Norway, respectively. The deduced, partial nucleocapsid protein amino acid sequence of the emara-like virus was only 78 % or less identical to reported emaraviruses and showed no variability among the virus isolates characterized. This virus [...] tentatively named as <b>Woolly</b> <b>burdock</b> yellow vein virus [...] was exclusively associated with yellow vein and leaf mosaic symptoms in <b>woolly</b> <b>burdock,</b> whereas AlsVX was detected in only one of the 52 plants tested. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide novel information about natural virus infections in Acrtium species and reveal <b>woolly</b> <b>burdock</b> as the first natural host of AlsVX besides Alstroemeria (family Alstroemeriaceae). Results also revealed a new virus related to the recently emerged Emaravirus genus and demonstrated applicability of SRDS to detect negative-strand RNA viruses. SRDS potentiates virus surveys of wild plants, a research area underrepresented in plant virology, and helps reveal natural reservoirs of viruses that cause yield losses in cultivated plants...|$|E
