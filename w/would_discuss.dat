5|$|Daya Shankar Pandey as Goli (seamer), the {{man with}} the largest piece of land. Pandey, who {{preferred}} the role of Kachra, was known to Aamir and Ashutosh through previous films (Pehla Nasha (1993), Baazi (1995) and Ghulam (1998)). Pandey credited Ashutosh for his acting in the film, saying that Ashutosh and he <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> the required emotions and expressions before shooting.|$|E
5|$|Despite that, the {{government}} has stated that the issue might be addressed if France were to be offered something of equal value. The Council itself has indicated privately that it <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> the Strasbourg seat only if Parliament gives them a signal to start a debate, as they would not do on their own initiative. However, few wish {{to discuss the issue}} while the current constitutional issues are still present. Although political parties have no formal position, the Greens, Liberals and Socialists are all outspoken on having Brussels as a permanent seat.|$|E

5|$|In the January 1977 {{issue of}} Starlog, Roddenberry {{said he was}} not sure when the novel would be complete, but {{confirmed}} that it <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> the meaning of God. By March 1978, the novel was said to be half-completed. Publisher Bantam Books told Roddenberry it would wait until he finished production on Phase II to resume work on the novel. When later in 1978 that production turned into The Motion Picture, Bantam gave Roddenberry an extension because the novelization was thought to be a full-time effort.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{spent the}} 1954–1955 {{academic}} {{year as a}} Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by Dennis Robertson). Friedman speculated that {{he was invited to}} the fellowship, because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people. From 1968 to 1978, he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> the days' issues for about a half-hour at a time.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E

5|$|On 12 February 2014, Channel 5 {{confirmed}} to Broadcast magazine {{that it was}} in the process of filming a similar documentary, provisionally titled Living on the Social, in which individuals and families <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> their lives on welfare. The Hull Daily Mail reported in March that Channel 5 were looking at Hull as a potential location for the series, but that the city council had urged residents not to participate. The Yorkshire Post reported a similar approach to residents in Bridlington in April. Love Productions also announced plans for Famous, Rich and Hungry, a two-part documentary for the BBC's Sport Relief that would see celebrities spending time with families experiencing food poverty in order to explore the issue.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk's {{connection}} with John of Gaunt was strong, a family connection that {{went back to}} the times of Suffolk's father. Suffolk's second wife Isabel had a daughter from a previous marriage, who was in Gaunt's wardship. This daughter, Elizabeth, who was an heiress of Lord Strange, was probably transferred to Isabel's household at her marriage to Suffolk. The two lords also maintained some of the same men as servants, or retainers. At the Good Parliament in 1376, Suffolk was elected to a committee that <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> the parliament's grievances concerning the failed fiscal and military policies of Gaunt, who was the de facto ruler of England. In spite of his association with Gaunt, the parliament trusted Suffolk's neutrality and equality in such a position. After parliament disbanded, Suffolk attended a lavish dinner given by the House of Commons, where Gaunt was conspicuously absent.|$|E
5|$|When the {{organization}} {{became aware that}} a certain person wanted to hold a reunion with Ojeda Ríos, they <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> and analize it before approving the meeting, with the Commander issuing {{a report of the}} topics discussed afterwards. According to the briefing that followed his reunion with bishop González Nieves, it was established that the religious leader tried to convince him to move away from armed conflict and to abandon clandestine activities. However, Ojeda Ríos responded by replying that, despite respecting the motives behind these suggestions, he declined. He extended an offer of his own to the bishop to join the efforts of the EPB, which was turned down as well.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Gator Bowl, Vick was asked by an NBC broadcaster if he intended to return to Virginia Tech for another year of collegiate football. He responded that he <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> matters with his family and Tech head coach Frank Beamer before making a decision. That announcement sparked a fresh round of speculation from sports pundits and fans wondering if Vick would choose to return to school or enter the 2001 NFL Draft. Virginia Tech, through its football coaching staff, began an intensive lobbying campaign in an effort to convince Vick to stay. On January 11, 2001, Vick held a press conference to announce that he would be forgoing his final two years of collegiate eligibility to enter the NFL Draft. Immediately after the announcement, he was predicted to be the No. 1 pick in the draft, a hypothesis realized on April 21, when he was selected by the Atlanta Falcons, who had traded draft picks in order {{to have the right to}} select Vick.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set the previous summer. Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} December 2008, Keenan had {{mentioned}} that he and Howerdel had passively and separately been writing new material for A Perfect Circle, although the band would officially remain in hiatus and largely out of {{the view of the}} public through mid-2010. On September 2010, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums - Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive - notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band <b>would</b> <b>discuss</b> the prospect of new material, but with uncertainty. Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and that single one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material {{was in a state of}} flux, some being accepted by Keenan as potential A Perfect Circle material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.|$|E

First-time mistakes <b>would</b> be <b>discussed,</b> and explanations given; however, if the children still persisted despite reasons and warnings, then punishment would be meted out.
