40|$|Presentation given during thesis defense {{regarding}} {{an evaluation}} of shear resistance of reinforced cob. Four specimens were created: two with the plastic silt cob mixture (one specimen containing chicken <b>wire</b> <b>reinforcement)</b> and two with the pure kaolinite cob mixture (one specimen containing chicken <b>wire</b> <b>reinforcement).</b> The samples were tested in a simple shear box. Load, deformation, and image analysis data were collected. Analysis shows {{that there is a}} trend that reinforcement has an effect on the ductility of the cob material. Cob, similar to adobe, is an earthen building material made of soil, sand, and straw. Although cob was used to build homes in England centuries ago, it has reemerged as a sustainable and relatively inexpensive, alternative building material. A possible solution for housing in impoverished nations, cob needs to be studied more in order to provide reliable strength data so that the material can be codified. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the use of chicken wire as reinforcement in a cob wall had an effect on the shear strength of the cob wall. Using two types of soil (a plastic silt and a pure kaolinite), four cob wall panels were created, with one of each soil type being reinforced with chicken wire. The wall panels were tested in a shear box to simulate earthquake loading. The results of this study indicated that the kaolinite specimens showed a trend that the reinforced cob wall panel required a greater load than the unreinforced cob panel in order to deform the same amount. Reinforcement also appeared to increase the toughness of the cob panel. Trends regarding the reinforcement of the silt cob panel were unable to be determined due to the unknown orientation of the chicken <b>wire</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and incomplete data collection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{recycled}} materials is nowadays greatly promoted and exploited in many industries, including construction and civil engineering. It is advantageous and efficient to utilize mainly those materials that cannot find {{their use in}} any other application. The steel wires from old automobile tires are a perfect example – {{they can be used}} as dispersed reinforcement for subsoil stabilization in railway engineering. In order to test the structural performance of the recycled wires as reinforcement of brittle matrix, gypsum was chosen to be the model matrix material. Such approach resulted in a relatively cheap gypsum-based composite, effectively combining gypsum as the material able to resist high levels of compression and the <b>wire</b> <b>reinforcement</b> from old automobile tires, which is able to transfer tensile stresses. The tested material was removed from molds after less than 20 minutes of hardening and immediately loaded. The paper presents the results of the compression test carried out on three different specifications – the reference sample was composed of a pure gypsum matrix, while the other two were reinforced by poorly and perfectly compacted dispersed <b>wire</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The results indicate the huge potential of the recycled tire wires for the improvement of soils and brittle materials...|$|E

The best materials and methods for repair have not been conclusively determined. Purpose. This study investigated the fracture force, deflection at fracture, and toughness of a heat-polymerized denture base material repaired with heat-polymerized resin, autopolymerized resin alone, or autopolymerized resin with glass fiber or <b>wire</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Material and methods. Eight groups were evaluated: 6 with autopolymerized resin repairs, 1 with heat-polymerized resin repairs, and a control group of intact specimens. The 6 autopolymerized resin groups included 1 group xvith no reinforcement, 1 treated with microwave irradiation after polymerization, 2 with monolayer or multilayer glass fiber reinforcement, and 2 with round or braided <b>wire</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Each group consisted of 12 specimens. The experimental specimens were cut, and a 3 -mm butt joint gap was repaired {{as indicated by the}} group assignment. A 3 -point bending test was used to determine the fracture force, deflection at fracture, and toughness of the specimens. The data were analyzed with 1 -way analysis of variance and the Tukey post-hoc test (alpha=. 05). Results. The fracture force (28. 4 to 73. 4 N), deflection (1. 6 to 3. 8 mm), and toughness (0. 02 to 0. 13 J) values for all repaired groups were significantly lower than those for the control group (82. 79 N, 4. 4 mm, and 0. 16 J, respectively), with one exception: the mean fracture force of specimens reinforced with round wire (102. 9 N). Failure mode was always adhesive, meaning that fracture occurred between the denture base and repair resin. Conclusion.

40|$|Concrete blocks {{are one of}} {{the common}} {{materials}} used in construction practice because they are quite easy to get and the price is relatively cheap. Masonry (either concrete blocks or bricks) is a structure consisting of a binding material (mortar) and a filler material (such as concrete blocks). In general, masonry is very good at resisting gravity loads, but not quite good at resisting shear loads such as loads generated by earthquakes, so it requires reinforcement in the form of plaster and additional wire mesh in the plaster of the masonry. Due to several problems of the masonry frame structure, it is necessary to conduct a research {{on the quality of the}} masonry to find out the compressive and flexural behavior of the masonry with reinforcement namely plaster and wire mesh. The method used in this study was laboratory testing by creating specimens of concrete block masonry. Variations of masonry for compressive tests in this study 3 specimens varied based on the orientation namely Type A (Horizontal), Type B (Vertical) and Type C (Diagonal), and 3 specimens varied based on the treatment: masonry without plaster (TP), masonry with plaster (DP), and masonry with <b>wire</b> mesh <b>reinforcement</b> (DPW). Variations of masonry for bending tests perpendicular to the bed joint (LA) and parallel to the bed joint (LB). Based on the results the crack patterns occurring in the specimens were relatively the same, where the initial cracks occurred predominantly in the interface area between the mortar and concrete blocks. The compressive strength of the concrete block masonry with plaster had a higher value than that of with <b>wire</b> mesh <b>reinforcement.</b> This was due to adhesion between the mortar and wire mesh and poor density so the performance of wire mesh was less effective. The concrete block masonry of Type C had the highest modulus of elasticity value. This was because the propagation of cracks that occurred in the masonry of Type C was slowed down by the position of the concrete blocks, which were installed with a slope of 45 o. Meanwhile, the propagation of cracks of Type A and Type B occurred vertically in the interface between the mortar and concrete blocks. Flexural strength values ??of specimens that were perpendicular to the bed joint (LTPA, LDPA, and LDPWA) were much higher than that of parallel to the bed joint (LTPB, LDPB and LDPWB). The addition of the <b>wire</b> mesh <b>reinforcement</b> to the compressive load did not contribute much to the stiffness of the masonry. Meanwhile in the bending tests, the addition of <b>wire</b> mesh <b>reinforcement</b> resulted in an increase in the flexural strength values of the concrete block masonry. </p...|$|R

Some BSS wires bridged the main crack and were eventually plastically deformed to failure. Also secondary matrix cracks radiated away from the main fracture surfaces, providing significant contributions to the toughness of the composites. In contrast, the bridging CSS wires were easily pulled out of the matrix without much deformation in the wire itself and surrounding cement. Therefore, they were not nearly as effective in bridging crack and improving toughness as the BSS wires. 1...|$|E
40|$|Large pullout {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on hexagonal wire mesh embedded in silty sand locally known as Ayutthaya sand to investigate the soil reinforcement interaction. PVC-coated of hexagonal wire mesh was tested with different applied normal pressures ranging from 35 to 105 kPa. The hexagonal wire mesh specimens with 80 x 100 mm cell sizes were pulled {{at a rate of}} 1 mm/min. In the conventional pullout test wherein the clamping system is outside the pullout box, the deformation and movement of hexagonal wire mesh known as necking phenomenon occurred simultaneously during the pullout process. In order to reduce this phenomenon, the large pullout test was modified to install the clamping system inside the pullout box hereinafter called “in-soil pullout test”. The total pullout resistance of hexagonal <b>wire</b> mesh <b>reinforcement</b> consists of two components, namely: friction and bearing resistance. An elastic-perfectly plastic model was used to simulate the friction resistance and relative displacement relation of hexagonal wire mesh while a hyperbolic model was applied to simulate the passive bearing resistance of the individual bearing member. The bearing resistance is approximately 4 to 6 times greater than the friction resistance. The maximum pullout resistances increased with increasing specimen lengths as well as the applied normal pressures. The in-soil pullout resistances are about 50 % greater than the corresponding results from previous conventional pullout tests. Several analytical models for predicting the pullout resistance of hexagonal <b>wire</b> mesh <b>reinforcement</b> have been proposed and modified in this paper.
