50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Albanian economy in January-February 1997 {{in the wake of the}} implosion of the Ponzi pyramid banking schemes promoted by the government, increasing insurgency in early March led to the Police and Republican Guard deserting en masse because it became clear they were unlikely to be paid, leaving their armouries unlocked, which were promptly looted by parties unknown, believed to mostly have been the local crime bodies and self-appointed militias: many of the weapons eventually surfaced in the ethnic fighting in Kosovo. The resulting anarchy led a number of nations to use military forces to evacuate citizens, culminating in the UN authorising Operation Alba ("Daybreak"), a short-term military stabilisation force led by the Italian Army, tasked with facilitating the repatriation of foreigners and laying the foundations for another International Organisation to undertake the longer-term restabilisation. The political debate eventually settled in Europe within the body responsible for the defence diplomatic coordination of the Continent, the Council of the Western European Union. In a 2-hour meeting which convened at 1400 hrs on 2 May 1997, the <b>WEU</b> <b>Council</b> decided on the immediate establishment of the Multinational Advisory Police Element, sending a pathfinder officer, a Norwegian Police Colonel, the same evening.The Italian force in Operation Alba predicated the Command structure of MAPE passing into the Italian Carabinieri, General Pietro Pistolese, previously commanding the Genoa region, bringing his team with him. Four phases followed, assessment, reconstruction, support of the Albanian Police control during the Kosovo Crisis, and finally build-down and handback in early 2001, which was somewhat accelerated ahead of the transfer of the WEU's operational responsibilities to the Council of the EU on 30 June 2001. The reconstruction principally involved the reconstruction of the Judicial system and the training of Police, but the Finance section also accommodated economic specialists acting as the principal feedback into the correction of the Judicial system. The Command Team later formed the core of the European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah from 2005 onwards.|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. Since the "Petersberg Tasks" for the "Western European Union" {{were adopted}} by the <b>WEU</b> <b>council</b> of foreign ministers in 1992, Europe has {{embarked}} on forays into the wide field of "hard security". The Petersberg decisions were a first step towards European participation in international peace support with military means, especially "tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making", as the decision read. European armed forces have been deployed in crisis contingencies, either as the improvised "Allied Rapid Reaction Force" {{to break up the}} Serbian circle of artillery fire on Sarajevo in 1995 or later under Nato command & control in Bosnia, in Macedonia, in Kosovo and since the summer of 2003 in Afghanistan. At the end of 2004 the EU was set to take over from Nato in Bosnia as parent organisation for SFOR...|$|E

It put them {{under a single}} chain of command and control (the [...] "Adriatic Military Committee", over which the NATO and <b>WEU</b> <b>Councils</b> exerted joint control), to address what their respective Councils viewed as wasteful duplication of effort. Some maintain that despite the nominal official joint command {{and control of the}} operation, in reality it was NATO staff that ran the operation.|$|R

50|$|In June 1999, the Cologne European Council {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} {{the role of the}} Western European Union within the EU, eventually shutting down the <b>WEU.</b> The Cologne <b>Council</b> also appointed Javier Solana as the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy to help progress both the CFSP and the ESDP.|$|R
40|$|Article J. 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which amends {{the treaty}} on European Union, {{establishes}} that the Western European Union shall provide the European Union {{with access to}} an operational capability for “humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks, and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacekeeping. ” Making reference to 1992 WEU Petersberg Declaration, these tasks {{are commonly known as}} Petersberg operations. This provision constitutes the integration of a part of the “WEU acquis” into the framework of the European Union, even though there is no institutional integration between the two organizations or legal interweave between their constituents treaties. The decision-making mechanism for Petersberg operations must be considered in relation to the new CFSP set of acts and it involves considerable interplay between the European Council, the Council and the <b>WEU</b> <b>Council</b> of Ministers. Several problems might arise from the different voting systems of these institutions and a specific question is posed by the more restricted composition of the WEU with respect to the EU, namely the five EU member States which are not fully-fledged WEU members. The development of an EU crisis management capability could have several positive consequences, both on an inter-European level and externally...|$|E
