By moving their ships to the Panamanian flag, owners could avoid providing these protections. Belen Quezada, the first foreign ship flagged in the Panamanian registry, was employed in running illegal alcohol between Canada and the United States during Prohibition. In addition to sidestepping the Seamen's Act, Panamanian-flagged ships in this early period paid sailors on the Japanese <b>wage</b> <b>scale,</b> which was {{much lower than}} that of western merchant powers.|$|E
25|$|Trucking {{industry}} talks {{began again}} in January 1985. Presser pushed for {{limits on the}} use of non-union subcontractors and subsidiaries, as well as wage and pension increases.

Considering that a worker was paid about two drachmas, that equals nearly 2 million Euro (on a modern west European <b>wage</b> <b>scale).</b> Since {{the overall number of}} columns required for the design was 120, even this aspect of the building would have caused costs equivalent to those of major projects today (circa 360 million Euro).|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{incentives}} {{and loss of}} control in a hierarchy model that combines and generalizes the models of Williamson, Calvo-Wellisz and Keren-Levhari. The levels of effort from managers and workers, the <b>wage</b> <b>scales,</b> the span of control, and {{the total number of}} tiers are all endogenous. The authors show that, in the optimal hierarchy, the <b>wage</b> <b>scales</b> and effort levels decrease as one moves down the hierarchy. As the hierarchy expands with no technological progress, workers exert less effort and are paid less, top managers work harder and are paid more, and the wage distribution becomes increasingly skewed.

25|$|By February 1897, {{members of}} the CCMU {{executive}} committee were admitting that they {{had run out of}} funds, and that the strike was lost. Even WFM president Ed Boyce and labor activist Eugene Debs advised the CCMU to take what terms they could get. The union membership voted overwhelmingly on 5 March to accept arbitration. The arbitration decision went against them, but the union voted on 9 March 1897 to return to work at the old <b>wage</b> <b>scale.</b> It was a complete defeat of the union.|$|E
25|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} in June 1864 that the Civil War might be coming to a close, employers attempted to cut wages. The union responded with a nationwide strike of its members, which lasted eight months. The strike ended on February 13, 1865, when the employers agreed to a <b>wage</b> <b>scale</b> based {{on the price of}} iron bars—the first time employers recognized the union, the first union contract in the iron and steel industry, and what may be the first union contract of any kind in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Berkman {{assassination}} attempt undermined {{public support for}} the union and prompted the final collapse of the strike. Hugh O'Donnell was removed as chair of the strike committee when he proposed to return to work at the lower <b>wage</b> <b>scale</b> if the unionists could get their jobs back. On August 12, the company announced that 1,700 men were working at the mill and production had resumed at full capacity. The national AFL refused to intervene, the East European workers ignored the union and it had no strategy left. The union voted {{to go back to work}} on Carnegie's terms; the strike had failed and the union had collapsed.|$|E

25|$|Typographers were educated, {{economically}} mobile, {{in every}} major urban center with newspapers, and had the unique possibility to influence publicity in favour of their cause. This led the union {{to the forefront of}} improving working conditions. ITU President W.B. Prescott led the ITU in 1897 to win a 48-hour work week and a standard <b>wage</b> <b>scale</b> for all printers. During the Great Depression, the ITU introduced the 40-hour work week across the industry at no cost to employers as a way to share the fewer jobs available. That ITU initiative spread to other unions and has since been codified across the labor sector by federal legislation in the U.S. establishing the 40-hour work week.|$|E
25|$|The slow {{economic}} decline after 1730 was relative: other countries grew faster, eroding the Dutch lead and surpassing it. Wilson identifies three causes. Holland lost its world dominance in trade as competitors emerged and copied its practices, built their own ships and ports, and traded {{on their own}} account directly without going through Dutch intermediaries. Second, there was no growth in manufacturing, due perhaps to a weaker sense of industrial entrepreneurship and to the high <b>wage</b> <b>scale.</b> Third the wealthy turned their investments to foreign loans. This helped jump-start other nations and provided the Dutch with a steady income from collecting interest, but leaving them with few domestic sectors with a potential for rapid growth.|$|E

40|$|The wage-setting for Swedish {{teachers}} {{was up and}} until 1996 characterized by centralized bargaining and <b>wage</b> <b>scales.</b> According to the <b>scales,</b> <b>wages</b> were exclusively determined by teacher type and years in the profession.

This study uses this change in bargaining structure to examine whether the scale system was a binding constraint on the wage-setting.

The agreement also eliminated cost-of-living increases and significantly lower wages for temporary workers.
