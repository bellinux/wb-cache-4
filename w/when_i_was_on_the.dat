2500|$|Bruner {{attracted}} {{support from}} Don McLeroy, a former SBOE member who spent twelve {{years on the}} board, the last two as chairman. McLeroy was known for sowing doubt about the theory of evolution—until he was ousted in 2010 by Thomas Ratliff. McLeroy said: [...] "I think she'll be a great asset. She testified all the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board." [...] Regardless, McLeroy urges Bruner to be [...] "circumspect" [...] in what she says and writes. [...] "Back <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board there were no tweets by Don McLeroy... There's so much more {{that you can find}} about people today than there was back then." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2006, Gullit had a {{talk show}} on Dutch TV, where he has interviewed, amongst others, Nelson Mandela. When Gullit was named winner of the Ballon d'Or in 1987, he {{dedicated}} the award to the then imprisoned Nelson Mandela. At the time, Gullit was signed to Milan and the Italians raised their eyebrows: [...] "Nelson who?" [...] Gullit tried to explain and they said, [...] "Oh, a footballer with political beliefs." [...] Gullit has since in interviews said that he met Mandela after he was released and that Mandela had said to him, [...] "Ruud, I have lots of friends now. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside, {{you were one of}} the few." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, Matthew Bryza, {{the deputy}} {{assistant}} secretary of State, said the contents of the recorded phone conversations (which were presented as evidence of Russian invasion on 7 August) were consistent with what Georgians believed on August 7, in the final hours before the war, when a cease-fire collapsed. [...] "During the height of all of these developments, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone with senior Georgian officials, they sure sounded completely convinced that Russian armored vehicles had entered the Roki Tunnel, and exited the Roki Tunnel, before and during the cease-fire," [...] he stated. [...] "I said, under instructions, that we urge you not to engage these Russians directly." [...] Bryza had also said earlier in August 2008, [...] "They felt they had to defend the honor of their nation and defend their villages. It was a very dangerous dynamic. That was part of an action-reaction, 'Guns of August' scenario that we tried to defuse." ...|$|E

50|$|Now it’s Almost {{just a lot}} {{different}} than it was then; it’s just a different program now than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> there. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> there it <b>was</b> me Ryan Sheckler and Torey Pudwill. Obviously none of us are there now but to me being on a skateboard company is about who you hang out with and who you vibe with and I vibe with those dudes really well, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> skating with Ryan Decenzo a lot and we travel a lot together because of the Maloof Cup and the Dew Tour. We also skate street a lot together and film with the same dudes. It was a good fit for me with Darkstar because I hang out with Decenzo and I’ve known Chet Thomas because he’s helped me with my career since the beginning, so it was a really good fit. Pierre PLG was always at all the events and I’m really good friends with Pierre so {{at the end of the}} day I hang out with those dudes more than anybody else in skateboarding, so it works.|$|R

5000|$|Early {{references}} to hypnagogia {{are to be}} found in the writings of Aristotle, Iamblichus, Cardano, Simon Forman and Swedenborg. Romanticism brought a renewed interest in the subjective experience of the edges of sleep. In more recent centuries, many authors have referred to the state; Edgar Allan Poe, for example, wrote of the [...] "fancies" [...] he experienced [...] "only <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>on</b> the brink of sleep, with the consciousness that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{episode was}} {{built around the}} Elvira {{character}}. The actress said she was very pleased with The Fall Guy script. [...] "You know, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> CHiPs, they toned my character down for network TV. That's why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so happy with the script for The Fall Guy, where they not only wrote the whole story around me, but they kept my risque humor. I think it came out really cute." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When Billie {{gave me a}} shuffle beat for Longview, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> frying <b>on</b> acid so hard. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{laying up}} against the wall with my bass lying on my lap. It just came to me. I said, [...] "Billie, check this out. Isn't this the wackiest thing you've ever heard?" [...] Later, {{it took me a long}} time to be able to play it, but it made sense <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> drugs." [...] - Mike Dirnt in Rolling Stone magazine, 1995.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} {{from the bottom of}} my heart," [...] I said; [...] "and tell me, did Mrs. Raynor know, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island, of my affection for Sylvia?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be careful," [...] pleaded Dave. [...] "I love {{to watch}} a storm--I always did, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> farm. I never thought of hiding, {{no matter how hard}} it thundered or lightened." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carol {{concentrated}} on her. [...] "My dear, you sound so! I {{know how it}} is. I used to be tired <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> job--I was a librarian. What was your college? I was Blodgett." ...|$|E
5000|$|Armstrong {{was put in}} {{jail for}} one night after {{the first day of}} filming. As she wrote in a feature article for The Guardian newspaper, she {{continued}} to live and work alongside the villagers and found this almost anthropological way of working helped her capture candid interviews; [...] "Most of the best interviews were done in the last year - <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> my own - because people really got to know and trust me".|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{wrote this}} around New Years <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> a {{houseboat}} with my friends. We sometimes go <b>on</b> what <b>are</b> essentially {{drug and alcohol}} binge trips up the Murray River but this one fell {{in the middle of}} my album so I felt like I had to get some work done. My friend came into my room <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> working <b>on</b> songs and asked to hear some. Then he basically told me he didnt really like my new music and he preferred <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more raw. That was the reason for the line, “My friend told me he didnt like my songs, blame it on the drugs, let me right my wrongs.” I wrote the whole thing while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really drunk and recorded a demo. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> woke up the next day I liked the song because it captured another side of me from usual, so we kept it." ...|$|R
50|$|It’s like, “I’m {{tired of}} waiting. I {{want to get}} a batch of songs to my fans.” I have 100 songs and I want all of them to come out. Of course, I have to pick my babies and kill my darlings and stuff. <b>I</b> really <b>am</b> looking forward to doing a full length, but I’m just putting this EP to see what happens, see what {{opportunities}} come my way. I have a whole album’s worth of material that <b>I</b> wrote <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> Epic ready to go.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{know you}} were indoors, papa,' she said with surprise. 'Surely no light was shining from the window <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lawn?' and she looked {{and saw that the}} {{shutters}} were still open.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never did}} when I was a boy, but--well--I {{did have a}} couple of fights <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cattle-boat and in England. Neither of them {{amounted}} to very much, though, I guess. I was scared stiff!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you prefer}} {{storming}} works to boarding vessels, {{there is a}} fortress of stone, Mr. Barnstable, which lies directly on our beam. I could see it through the haze, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cliffs, stationing the lookout-- and---- ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Babek" [...] is {{my whole}} life. I applied much effort into this ballet. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> working <b>on</b> this ballet, I felt myself like a gladiator. I wrote this {{composition}} {{during the course}} of 10 years.|$|R
5000|$|Gellar is {{an active}} {{advocate}} for various charities, including breast cancer research, Project Angel Food, Habitat for Humanity and CARE. Of her charitable pursuits, she says, [...] "I started because my mother taught {{me a long time}} ago that even when you have nothing, there's ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn't do a lot. I couldn't do much more than just donate money <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> Buffy because there wasn't time. And now that I have the time, it's amazing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Judith Lang Zaimont {{has also}} {{done much to}} draw {{attention}} to the challenges of female composers. Although she persistently promotes women composers, she does not like being referred to as a woman composer. [...] "I never heard the term 'adjective-composer' until 1972, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> Bob Sherman's radio show in New York, and he asked me what it was like to be a 'woman composer.' There <b>was</b> dead air <b>on</b> the tape right at that spot, because I'd never thought of myself as any kind of adjective composer. I have special observations about being labeled a woman composer, but I keep them to myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, Sir, in {{the midst}} of her {{innocent}} frolic and at the very moment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> point of snatching the kiss which she had so tantalizingly denied me, we heard the opening and closing of the front door.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{first day}} yo' came! Yo' moved the ladder <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cornice, and I walked all ever yo' head. And, like a gentleman, yo' {{never said a}} word about it. I reckon I stood on yo' head for five minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Down on the East Side? Yes, I {{went there}} once {{to get a}} story, one red-hot night in August, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> News. The Ice Company had been putting up their prices, and trouble was {{expected}} down there. I was sent to cover it." ...|$|E
500|$|Wrigley {{became a}} {{familiar}} and popular {{figure for the}} thousands of Australian airmen who passed through London during the war, and was known to take off his jacket and tend bar at Codgers, the headquarters' watering hole. An EATS graduate later remarked that [...] "under Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley we got tremendous service... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in North Africa, Italy, Sardinia, Corsica and then back in the United Kingdom. We got our mail, we got our comforts... Not only that, when some cow went and pinched 100 quid from me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> leave in London, the next day, with a shaking hand, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to sign for another 100 quid and have a good time." ...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{a pretty}} {{aggressive}} record. I said to JayHazard, Briggs’ production partner <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> working <b>on</b> stuff for the ShepLife album, [...] "If The Blacklist was the punch in the face, ShepLife <b>is</b> why <b>I</b> punched you in the face." [...] Shep Life kinda like the prequel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Jason Daggett," [...] showing {{himself more}} plainly, by {{moving out of}} the line of the main-rigging. [...] "I had the {{pleasure}} of seeing you <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> P'int, looking after my uncle's dunnage, you may remember, Captain Gar'ner. 'T was but the other day, and you are not likely to have forgotten my visit." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon {{afterward}} I {{found an}} opportunity of inquiring if Helena {{had left the}} house. She had just rung her bell; and Maria had found her, quietly reading, in her room. Hours afterward, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> watch at night, I heard Philip's door softly tried from the outside. Her dreadful purpose had not been given up, even yet.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gunnill acquiesced. [...] "I {{remember}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Peewit," [...] he said, musingly, [...] "one {{time when}} we were lying at Cardiff, there was a policeman there run one of our chaps in, and two nights afterward another of our chaps pushed the policeman down {{in the mud and}} ran off with his staff and his helmet." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "As {{a presidential}} candidate...the {{challenges}} were few. When someone challenged me regarding homeless issues, I could respond that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> homeless in Los Angeles for months. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> challenged regarding poverty issues, I {{could say that}} I lived in poverty as a child. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> challenged <b>on</b> labor issues, I spoke to them based upon my experience as a retail clerk" ...|$|R
5000|$|Clarence [...] "Sonny" [...] Kenner spent a {{lifetime}} entertaining audiences, both in Kansas City and around the world. Born into a family of entertainers, Kenner grew up only {{a block away from}} what is now the Kansas City Musicians Foundation. During his career he shared the stage with Bob Hope, Quincy Jones, Redd Foxx and Charlie Parker. [...] "I could hardly play <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> stage with 'Bird," [...] remembered Kenner. [...] "I was too busy just trying to listen to him! He was a real idol of mine." [...] Over the years Kenner became friends with Redd Foxx. [...] "We'd hang out together after shows and he would take me to all the parties. I couldn't believe all the movie stars I used to see at those things." ...|$|R
