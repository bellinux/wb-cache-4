5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 – November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the <b>workplace,</b> <b>and</b> suggested that African Americans needed to take more action in race relations.|$|E
5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced {{by women and}} minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the <b>workplace,</b> <b>and</b> has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1937, Jessie became seriously {{infected}} with boils and, {{while under the}} care of a Glanton Brethren family, became a Christian. Before the end of the year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his <b>workplace</b> <b>and</b> then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a peptic ulcer. At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress, and Jessie's ulcer was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family's lack of money. Consequently, she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home. Ann subsequently attended Hebron School in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, until she was ten years old. Once Jessie had recovered from her illness, they returned to Sydney on SS Oronsay.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} further {{the processes of}} learning arising from students' experiences in both education <b>and</b> <b>workplace</b> settings <b>and</b> proposes implications for cooperative education. It emphasises the significance of individuals' experiencing cooperative education across both <b>workplaces</b> <b>and</b> educational institutions. Using case studies of individuals' learning throughout working life and school students' engagement in reflecting on paid work, the interdependence between the personal and social contributions of this learning is elaborated. That is, how <b>workplaces</b> <b>and</b> educational institutions afford opportunities for participation and learning, and how individuals elect to engage with what is afforded them in and across these settings. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} account for the imperatives of both settings (i. e. their intentions and enactments) in seeking to integrate contributions of educational institutions <b>and</b> <b>workplaces,</b> <b>and</b> how individuals' personal histories or ontogenies shape what they experience, engage with and learn. Yet, without accounting for how individuals engage with what is afforded them in cooperative education programs, its goals for securing rich learning may remain unfulfilled.
