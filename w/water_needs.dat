5|$|Water {{is needed}} by many birds {{although}} their mode of excretion {{and lack of}} sweat glands reduces the physiological demands. Some desert birds can obtain their <b>water</b> <b>needs</b> entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting. Seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.|$|E
5|$|Different bat {{species have}} {{different}} diets including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy though flight, bats must consume {{large amounts of}} food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. Predatory bats typically hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, and minimizing contact with certain predators. They can travel large distances, up to , in search of food. Bats are not restricted to any one hunting strategy, but rather use a mix. The bite force of small bats is generated through mechanical advantage, allowing them to bite through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit. Bats get most of their <b>water</b> <b>needs</b> from the food they eat. However, numerous species may drink from water sources like lakes and streams. They may fly over the water surface and dip their tongues.|$|E
5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their <b>water</b> <b>needs</b> {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} water a {{particular}} houseplant needs is influenced by several factors. Not only is the individual plant size and species important, but also the growing conditions. Light, temperature, humidity, container type, container size, and soil type all influence the speed of growth and therefore the amount of <b>water</b> <b>needed.</b> Further, {{it is best to}} look up individual plant types for their <b>watering</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The St. Johns River {{is under}} {{consideration}} {{as an additional}} water source to meet growing public <b>water</b> <b>needs.</b> In 2008, the river's Water Management District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water withdrawals and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted {{in a series of}} four reports that assessed the impact of water withdrawal on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the Water Management District study. The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water withdrawals. However, the report noted that the District's final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in water management would increase water levels and flows that exceed the proposed surface water withdrawals, these predictions have high uncertainties.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily <b>water</b> <b>needs</b> are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} settlers in Aubrey was Mr F Rodda, who came from South Australia and purchased land in Aubrey in 1892. Water was a particular problem to the early farmers as they depended entirely on catchment by tanks. When that water ran out, <b>water</b> <b>needed</b> to be carted from a shire dam over eight kilometres away, and after the dam went dry <b>water</b> <b>needed</b> to be sourced from 14 km away.|$|R

25|$|Minto's Hut sleeps 8 porters, and is {{situated}} near Hall Tarns. There is a campsite nearby. Water is taken {{directly from the}} tarns. The tarns have no outflow and so the stagnant <b>water</b> <b>needs</b> to be filtered or boiled before use.|$|E
25|$|Water {{scarcity}} is {{the lack}} of sufficient available water resources to meet <b>water</b> <b>needs</b> within a region.

25|$|Hawaii Some 90 {{species of}} {{eucalyptus}} {{have been introduced}} to the islands, where they have displaced some native species due to their higher maximum height, fast growth and lower <b>water</b> <b>needs.</b> Particularly noticeable is the rainbow eucalyptus (Eucalyptus deglupta), native to Indonesia and the Philippines, whose bark falls off to reveal a trunk that can be green, red, orange, yellow, pink and purple.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees require {{water to}} {{maintain}} osmotic homeostasis, prepare liquid brood food, and {{to cool the}} hive through evaporation. A colony’s <b>water</b> <b>needs</b> can generally be met by nectar foraging as it has high water content.
