5|$|More acute {{threat to}} the Polish–Lithuanian state came from Sweden. The {{balance of power in}} the north had shifted in Sweden's favor, as the Baltic {{neighbor}} was led by King Gustavus Adolphus, a highly able and aggressive military leader, who greatly improved the effectiveness of the Swedish armed forces, while also taking advantage of Protestant zealotry. The Commonwealth, exhausted by the wars with Russia and the Ottoman Empire and lacking allies, was poorly prepared to face this new challenge. Continuous diplomatic maneuvering by Sigismund III made the <b>whole</b> <b>situation</b> look to szlachta like another stage in the King's Swedish dynastic affairs; in reality the Swedish power resolved to take hold of the entire Polish-controlled Baltic coast, and thereby profit from the Commonwealth's maritime trade intermediary control, endangering its basis for independent existence.|$|E

Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him.

The {{finite element model}} of drive axle housing was built by using the solid element and the shell element respectively.

By comparing {{the results of the}} vertical bend strength and stiffness of both models, we could know that both of the two models can be used to analyze the <b>whole</b> stress <b>situation</b> of drive axle housing. Because there were fewer elements of drive axle housing model based on shell element, the amount of final calculation was less.

500|$|In 1976, the Bruins offered Orr US$600,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) per season, but {{he would}} have to pass a {{physical}} examination at the start of each season's training camp.

The Bruins' general manager, Harry Sinden complained of tampering by the Black Hawks, and demanded that Chicago owner Bill Wirtz submit to a lie detector test. According to documents held by Orr, they had a valid case. Orr signed with the Black Hawks at a secret meeting in May 1976, prior to becoming a free agent.|$|E
500|$|The project caused {{division}} in Blink-182, mostly between DeLonge and Hoppus. Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it. It was this strange situation that nobody addressed," [...] DeLonge told Blender. Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I felt like I had let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{identify}} the effect of situation complexity and driving experience on performance through subjective and objective levels of tension. The main contribution of this paper to the Cognitive Ergonomics field consists {{in the identification of}} accidents’ factors of young drivers faced to a stressful event. Thirty-two drivers (16 novices vs. 16 more experienced) were randomly assigned to three levels of situation complexity (simple, moderately complex and very complex) in a driving simulator. Physiological and subjective levels of tension were respectively associated to “pedestrian crossings” events and to the <b>whole</b> <b>situations.</b> Driving performance corresponded to reaction times and to collisions’ number with the pedestrians. Results showed that novice drivers had weaker performance than the more experienced once, even though their high level of objective and subjective tension due to situation complexity improved their performance. Therefore, target driving assistance systems to deal with hazard events could reduce road accidents among young novice drivers...|$|R

Naomi continued to cause problems for Sonya and Toadie's marriage and when Sonya went away, Naomi decided to make her move.

500|$|Boston's police officers, {{acting with}} the {{sponsorship}} of the police department, had formed an association known as the Boston Social Club in 1906. In 1917, a committee of police officers representing the Social Club met with Commissioner Stephen O'Meara to ask about a raise. He was sympathetic, but advised them {{to wait for a}} better time. They pressed the issue in the summer of 1918 and, {{near the end of the}} year, Mayor Andrew Peters offered salary increases that would affect about one-fourth of the officers. O'Meara died in December 1918, and Governor Samuel McCall appointed Edwin Upton Curtis, former Mayor of Boston, as Commissioner of the Boston Police Department. After another meeting where representatives of the Social Club repeated their salary demands, Peters said: [...] "while the word 'strike' was not mentioned, the <b>whole</b> <b>situation</b> is far more serious than I realized." [...] He also made it clear to the rank and file that they were not entitled to form their own union. Curtis did not share his predecessor's or the mayor's sympathy for the police, but in February 1918 he offered a wage compromise that the police rejected. In May, Governor Coolidge announced raises, which were also rejected. When the Social Club's representatives tried to raise grievances with him, Curtis set up his own grievance committee to handle management-employee disputes, based on the election of representatives from each precinct house by secret ballot, and it met just once.|$|E
