40|$|Theories with 8 supercharges have moduli {{spaces of}} vacua which generically divide into two {{branches}} - {{the so called}} Coulomb branch and the Higgs branch. These branches are HyperKahler {{in the cases of}} Higgs branch in dimensions 3 up to 6, and Coulomb branch in 3. They become cones when one sets the FI terms and masses to zero. There is a natural SU(2) _R which acts on 3 complex structures. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> devote our <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> general aspects of HyperKahler cones and discuss quiver gauge theories where these spaces arise as moduli spaces in {{one or more of these}} branches.

40|$|In this lecture, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about the}} “PCP Theorem ” (Probabilistically Checkable Proofs Theorem). Since the {{discovery}} of NP-completeness in 1972, researchers had mulled {{over the issue of}} whether we can efficiently compute approximate solutions to NP-hard optimization problems. They failed to design such approximate algorithms for most problems. They then tried to show that computing approximate solutions is also hard, but apart from a few isolated successes this effort also stalled. Researchers slowly began to realize that the Cook-Levin-Karp-style reductions do not suffice to prove any limits on approximation algorithms [1]. The PCP Theorem states that every decision problem in the NP complexity class has probabilistically checkable proofs (proofs that can be checked by a randomized algorithm) of constant query complexity and logarithmic randomness complexity. The PCP Theorem gave a new definition of NP and provided a new starting point for reductions to show hardness of approximation [1]. We know that NP = {L | ∃ a polynomial time verifier V s. t. x ∈ L ⇐ ⇒ ∃ a proof y, |y | = poly(|x|) s. t. V (x, y) = 1 } Our question is: how much work does the polynomial time verifier needs to do?

40|$|Referring {{expressions}} with {{vague and}} ambiguous modifiers, such as "a quick visit" and "the big meeting," are difficult for computers to interpret because their meanings are defined {{in part by}} context. For the hearer {{to arrive at the}} speaker's intended meaning, he must consider the alternative decisions that the speaker was faced with in context. To address these challenges, I propose a new approach to both generating and interpreting referring expressions based on belief-state planning and plan recognition. Planning in belief space offers a way to capture referential uncertainty and the incremental nature of generating and interpretation, because each belief state represents a complete interpretation. The contributions of my thesis are as follows: (1) A computational model of reference generation and interpretation that is fast, incremental, and non-deterministic. This model includes a lexical semantics for a fragment of English noun phrases, which specifies the encoded meanings of determiners (quantifiers and articles), gradable and ambiguous modifiers. It performs in real time, even when the hypothesis space grows very large. Because it's incremental, it avoids considering possibilities that will later turn out to be irrelevant. (2) The integration of generation and interpretation into a single process. Interpretation is guided by comparison to alternatives produced by the generation module. When faced with an underspecified description, the system uses what it could have said and compares that to what the user did say. Reasoning about alternative decisions facilitates inferences of this sort: "She ate some of the tuna" means not all of it, otherwise you would have said, "She ate the tuna. " This approach has been implemented and evaluated using a computational model, AIGRE. I also created a testbed for comparing human judgments of referring expressions to those produced by our algorithm (or others). In an online user experiment with Mechanical Turk, we attained 94 % coverage of human responses in a simple geometrical domain, as well as lower, but still encouraging, coverage in a more complex, real-world domain. The model, AIGRE, demonstrates that managing the vagueness and ambiguity in natural language, while still not easy, is nevertheless possible.

40|$|In this {{supplementary}} lecture we {{prove that}} the λ-calculus is confluent. This is result is due to Alonzo Church (1903 – 1995) and J. Barkley Rosser (1907 – 1989) and {{is known as the}} Church–Rosser theorem. The proof given here takes an alternative approach to the standard proof due to Tait and Martin-Löf as given for example in Barendregt [1] (see also [2, 3]). 1 Terms as Labeled Trees In the proof of confluence, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> need <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about occurrences of subterms in a term as designated by a path from the root. Thus we need to develop notation for terms viewed as labeled trees. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> refer to this view of terms as the coalgebraic view, although the rationale for this terminology will only become clear much later in the course. 1. 1 Algebraic View of Terms A ranked alphabet is a set Σ together with an arity function arity: Σ → N. The letters f ∈ Σ are viewed as operator symbols, and arity f ∈ N denotes the arity of f, or the number of inputs of f. The symbol f is called unary, binary, ternary, or n-ary according as its arity is 1, 2, 3, or n, respectively. It is called a constant if its arity is 0. Finite terms over Σ can be defined by induction: • If t 0, [...] ., tn− 1 are terms and f ∈ Σ with arity f = n, then f t 0 [...] ., tn− 1 is a term. Note the base case n = 0 is included; the first premise is vacuous in that case. This defines terms in prefix notation...|$|R
