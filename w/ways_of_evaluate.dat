Most of the authors consider there is an impact and mostly only the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluate</b> it or report it is different from an approach to another. Moreover the literature commonly separates the discussion regarding the social responsibility from the environmental approach.

30|$|Within {{the theory}} of action, {{cultural}} patterns constitute the basic forms that shape the meaning of action in terms of motivation and decision making. The modes of motivational orientation can be classified as cognitive, cathectic (or expressive, emotional bonding between actors or between actors and norms), and evaluative orientations. Evaluative orientations are {{a combination of the}} first and the second type of motivational orientation. Cognitive orientations are organised in systems of ideas or beliefs. Cathectic orientations are organised in systems of expressive (emotional) symbols, and evaluative orientations consist of systems of value-orientations. It is the evaluative dimension which introduces reflections about consequences of actions and invokes value standards. Systems of cognitive symbols (beliefs) organise <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> cognising, systems of expressive symbols organise <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> cathecting, and systems of value symbols organise <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluating.</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluating</b> are necessary in order to resolve conflicts between divergent beliefs (cognitions) or divergent wants (cathexes) of individuals in a concrete situation.|$|R
