40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the production of flavor compounds from olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> by microbial fermentation of Rhizopus oryzae and Candida tropicalis. Olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> fermentations were performed in shake and bioreactor cultures. Production of flavor compounds from olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> was followed by Gas Chromatography–Mass spectrometry, Gas chromatography- olfactometry and Spectrum Sensory Analysis®. As a result, 1. 73 -log and 3. 23 -log cfu/mL increases were observed in the microbial populations of R. oryzae and C. tropicalis during shake cultures, respectively. C. tropicalis can produce a higher concentration of d-limonene from olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> than R. oryzae in shake cultures. The concentration of d-limonene was determined as 185. 56 and 249. 54 μg/kg in the fermented olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> by R. oryzae and C. tropicalis in shake cultures respectively. In contrast, R. oryzae can produce a higher concentration of d-limonene (87. 73 μg/kg) d-limonene than C. tropicalis (11. 95 μg/kg) in bioreactor cultures. Based on sensory analysis, unripe olive, wet towel, sweet aromatic, fermented aromas were determined at high intensity in olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> fermented with R. oryzae meanwhile olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> fermented with C. tropicalis had only a high intensity of unripe olive and oily aroma...|$|R

40|$|Olive <b>mill</b> <b>wastes</b> (OMWs) are {{high-strength}} organic effluents, which upon disposal can degrade {{soil and}} water quality, negatively affecting aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The main purpose of this review paper is to provide an up-to-date knowledge concerning the microbial communities identified over the past 20 years in olive <b>mill</b> <b>wastes</b> using both culture-dependent and independent approaches. A database survey of 16 S rRNA gene sequences (585 records in total) obtained from olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> environments revealed the dominance of members of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Independent studies confirmed that OMW microbial communities’ structure is cultivar dependant. On the other hand, the detection of fecal bacteria and other potential human pathogens in OMWs is of major concern and deserves further examination. Despite {{the fact that the}} degradation and detoxification of the olive <b>mill</b> <b>wastes</b> have been mostly investigated through the application of known bacterial and fungal species originated from other environmental sources, the biotechnological potential of indigenous microbiota should be further exploited in respect to olive <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> bioremediation and inactivation of plant and human pathogens.

40|$|Today's {{society is}} facing major challenges. In {{order to reduce}} the climate impact fossil fuels should be {{replaced}} with fuels that do not contribute to the greenhouse effect. The growing population generates organic waste originating from industry and households so called organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Through anaerobic digestion, waste can be utilized to produce energy-rich methane gas. In this way, waste can be a resource instead of a burden on society. The purpose of this project is to investigate the methane yield of source-sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SS-OFMSW) pretreated with screw crush technology and methane yield at the co-digestion of food waste and biosludge from paper mills. SS-OFMSW which is either pre-treated in a screw crusher or a Food <b>Waste</b> <b>Mill</b> and a mixture of SS-OFMSW and biosludge from paper mills digested in a semi - continuous wet process under mesophilic conditions with a retention time of 20 days. Screw crush technique gave a slurry with a methane yield of about 440 - 490 mL / g VS, which was slightly higher than the yield of 300 - 350 mL / g VS from the slurry pretreated with Food <b>Waste</b> <b>Mill.</b> The methane concentration was slightly higher for slurry pretreated with Food <b>Waste</b> <b>Mill,</b> 74 % in average compared with 68 % for slurry pretreated with screw crush. Biosludge from paper mills is an organic waste that can be digested in order to produce biogas. The sludge is poor in nutrients and methane yield at individual anaerobic digestion of paper mill sludge is relatively low. In this study, biosludge was co-digested with SS-OFMSW. The mixture with the proportions 1 : 1 by g VS gave a methane yield of about 420 - 480 mL / g VS which is higher than the constituent substrates digested separately. Co-digestion gave a methane concentration at 80 % which is also higher than at the individual anaerobic digestion of substrates...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the response of}} pineapple <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> to anaerobic digestion, a simulated <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> with a COD value equal to actual <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> was made from commercial pineapple juice for this study. Ammonium hydroxide {{was used as a}} pH control and a nitrogen supplement. The study utilized batch-anaerobic digesters in initial stages to find optimum conditions for long-term studies which were conducted in 9 -liter bottles with periodic removal of digested waste and addition of fresh waste. Seed was composed of digested domestic sewage sludge, bottom sediment from a canal used for disposal of pineapple <b>mill</b> <b>waste,</b> and fermented pineapples and pineapple juice. Principal studies involved three digesters maintained at ambient temperature as controls, two digesters with 75 mg/l of phosphorus added, two digesters heated to 90 °F, and one digester whose contents were mixed by recirculation of digester gases. The digesters were operated for sixty days. Analytical parameters were COD, sugar, pH, ORP, volatile acids, gas production, gas composition, alkalinity, and total bacteria by the Breed Counting Method. The results of the study showed that pineapple <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> undergoes a rapid initial decomposition. A reduction in COD occurred along with a rapid drop in sugar concentration and subsequent formation of volatile acids. Following initial activity, there is a period of inactivity after which recovery from the acid stage occurs and a steady reduction of waste material begins. The test data collected indicated that raw pineapple waste liquor is unsuitable for anaerobic digestion unless it is heated, stirred, or treated with phosphate. After sixty days of operation, digesters at ambient temperature, those with added phosphorus, and those that were stirred produced a COD reduction of 40, 51, and 53 percent, respectively. There was strong evidence that pineapple <b>mill</b> <b>waste</b> may be satisfactorily treated anaerobically if it is heated and optimum conditions exist. Digesters operated at 90 °F effected 66 percent reduction in COD with a steady production of gas containing at least 75 percent CH 4. U. S.
