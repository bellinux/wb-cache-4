40|$|AbstractIt is {{proved that}} a real cubic unit u, whose other two conjugates are also real, is almost always a {{fundamental}} unit of the order Z[u]. The exceptions are shown to consist of a single infinite family together with one sporadic case. This is an analogue of Nagell's theorem for the negative discriminant case i. e. the case <b>where</b> <b>u</b> <b>does</b> not have any real conjugate...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} naturally occurring, uncountable transformation semigroups S {{and investigate}} {{the following three}} questions. (i) Is every countable subset F of S also a subset of a ﬁnitely generated subsemigroup of S? If so, what is the least number n such that for every countable subset F of S there exist n elements of S that generate a subsemigroup of S containing F as a subset. (ii) Given a subset U of S, what is the least cardinality of a subset A of S such that the union of A and U is a generating set for S? (iii) Deﬁne a preorder relation ≤ on the subsets of S as follows. For subsets V and W of S write V ≤ W if there exists a countable subset C of S such that V is contained in the semigroup generated by the union of W and C. Given a subset <b>U</b> of S, <b>where</b> <b>does</b> <b>U</b> lie in the preorder ≤ on subsets of S? Semigroups S for which we answer question (i) include: the semigroups of the injec- tive functions and the surjective functions on a countably inﬁnite set; the semigroups of the increasing functions, the Lebesgue measurable functions, and the differentiable functions on the closed unit interval [0, 1]; and the endomorphism semigroup of the random graph. We investigate questions (ii) and (iii) in the case where S is the semigroup Ω[superscript Ω] of all functions on a countably inﬁnite set Ω. Subsets U of Ω[superscript Ω] under consideration are semigroups of Lipschitz functions on Ω with respect to discrete metrics on Ω and semigroups of endomorphisms of binary relations on Ω such as graphs or preorders.

40|$|Quantitative {{extensions}} of temporal logics have recently attracted significant attention. In this work, we study frequency LTL (fLTL), {{an extension of}} LTL which allows to speak about frequencies of events along an execution. Such an extension is particularly useful for probabilistic systems that often cannot fulfil strict qualitative guarantees on the behaviour. It has been recently shown that controller synthesis for Markov decision processes and fLTL is decidable when all the bounds on frequencies are 1. As a step towards a complete quantitative solution, we show {{that the problem is}} decidable for the fragment fLTL∖GU, <b>where</b> <b>U</b> <b>does</b> not occur in the scope of G (but still F can). Our solution is based on a novel translation of such quantitative formulae into equivalent deterministic automata. Comment: Extended version of a paper presented at LPAR 201...|$|R
