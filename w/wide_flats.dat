[...] {{answered}} Lancelot, with a groan; [...] "O King!"--and when he paused, methought I spied [...] A dying fire {{of madness}} in his eyes-- [...] "O King, my friend, if friend of thine I be, [...] Happier {{are those that}} welter in their sin, [...] Swine in the mud, that cannot see for slime, [...] Slime of the ditch: but in me lived a sin [...] So strange, of such a kind, that all of pure, [...] Noble, and knightly in me twined and clung [...] Round that one sin, until the wholesome flower [...] And poisonous grew together, each as each, [...] Not to be plucked asunder; and when thy knights [...] Sware, I sware with them only in the hope [...] That could I touch or see the Holy Grail [...] They might be plucked asunder. Then I spake [...] To one most holy saint, who wept and said, [...] That save they could be plucked asunder, all [...] My quest were but in vain; to whom I vowed [...] That I would work according as he willed. [...] And forth I went, and while I yearned and strove [...] To tear the twain asunder in my heart, [...] My madness came upon me as of old, [...] And whipt me into waste fields far away; [...] There was I beaten down by little men, [...] Mean knights, to whom the moving of my sword [...] And shadow of my spear had been enow [...] To scare them from me once; and then I came [...] All in my folly to the naked shore, [...] <b>Wide</b> <b>flats,</b> where nothing but coarse grasses grew; [...] But such a blast, my King, began to blow, [...] So loud a blast along the shore and sea, [...] Ye could not hear the waters for the blast, [...] Though heapt in mounds and ridges all the sea [...] Drove like a cataract, and all the sand [...] Swept like a river, and the clouded heavens [...] Were shaken with the motion and the sound. [...] And blackening in the sea-foam swayed a boat, [...] Half-swallowed in it, anchored with a chain; [...] And in my madness to myself I said, [...] 'I will embark and I will lose myself, [...] And in the great sea wash away my sin.' [...] I burst the chain, I sprang into the boat. [...] Seven days I drove along the dreary deep, [...] And with me drove the moon and all the stars; [...] And the wind fell, and on the seventh night [...] I heard the shingle grinding in the surge, [...] And felt the boat shock earth, and looking up, [...] Behold, the enchanted towers of Carbonek, [...] A castle like a rock upon a rock, [...] With chasm-like portals open to the sea, [...] And steps that met the breaker! there was none [...] Stood near it but a lion on each side [...] That kept the entry, and the moon was full. [...] Then from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs. [...] There drew my sword. With sudden-flaring manes [...] Those two great beasts rose upright like a man, [...] Each gript a shoulder, and I stood between; [...] And, when I would have smitten them, heard a voice, [...] 'Doubt not, go forward; if thou doubt, the beasts [...] Will tear thee piecemeal.' Then with violence [...] The sword was dashed from out my hand, and fell. [...] And up into the sounding hall I past; [...] But nothing in the sounding hall I saw, [...] No bench nor table, painting on the wall [...] Or shield of knight; only the rounded moon [...] Through the tall oriel on the rolling sea. [...] But always in the quiet house I heard, [...] Clear as a lark, high o'er me as a lark, [...] A sweet voice singing in the topmost tower [...] To the eastward: up I climbed a thousand steps [...] With pain: as in a dream I seemed to climb [...] For ever: at the last I reached a door, [...] A light was in the crannies, and I heard, [...] 'Glory and joy and honour to our Lord [...] And to the Holy Vessel of the Grail.' [...] Then in my madness I essayed the door; [...] It gave; and through a stormy glare, a heat [...] As from a seventimes-heated furnace, I, [...] Blasted and burnt, and blinded as I was, [...] With such a fierceness that I swooned away-- [...] O, yet methought I saw the Holy Grail, [...] All palled in crimson samite, and around [...] Great angels, awful shapes, and wings and eyes. [...] And but for all my madness and my sin, [...] And then my swooning, I had sworn I saw [...] That which I saw; but what I saw was veiled [...] And covered; and this Quest was not for me." ...|$|E

5000|$|On Kasaan Peninsula, {{there are}} many flat areas, some of them {{containing}} small lakes, and the mountain slopes themselves are interrupted by benches or terraces, which occur at different elevations and at rather regular intervals above sea level. These benches represent levels of erosion. The lowest bench level is indicated {{by a series of}} flats or forelands at a height of about [...] above sea level. Forelands at this height are especially prominent at the head of Kasaan Bay and on the adjacent islands. Along the northern shore of the peninsula and in Tolstoi Bay, a higher level of erosion, which seems persistent at [...] on many parts of the peninsula, is marked by <b>wide</b> <b>flats</b> in the valleys, some of which are occupied by small lakes. Such flats occur just north of Grindall Point; on the hills just north of Kasaan; northeast of the Haida mine, where the flat is covered by a lake; on both the east and west slopes of Tolstoi Bay; and southwest of Thorne Bay, where there are two large lakes. Still higher, at an elevation of , a level of erosion is represented by a flat, occupied by a lake, at the head of Poor Mans Creek, on the divide toward Tolstoi Bay; by flats north of the Alarm claim, on which there are several lakes; and by several areas occupied by lakes northeast of the Haida mine. The surface of the lake just east of Lake Three, at the head of Kasaan Bay, and that of the lake below the Goodro mine are also at this elevation.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of feeding}} habitat by eastern curlews in Moreton Bay was {{examined}} {{by means of}} quantitative density assessment at 26 sites from 13 locations. The sites were chosen to encompass variation in width (area) of tidal flat, seagrass density, and substratum type. Each site was visited four times: during each of a neap and a spring low tide, in January and February 1992. The total curlew count per site was strongly positively correlated with {{the width of the}} tidal flat, and had little or no relationship with seagrass density, substratum type or tidal phase. <b>Wide</b> <b>flats</b> also showed more variation than narrow flats in total curlew numbers. Curlew density, measured by the number of birds within 100 m of each side of the water's edge, was also greater on wide tidal flats, showed little relationship to seagrass density or substratum type, but was higher during neap low tides than spring lows. The data suggest that curlews choose soft-sediment intertidal feeding sites on the basis of potential foraging area, and may be particularly sensitive to the lower and infra-littoral areas. A better understanding of foraging site selection by the eastern curlew requires information on site fidelity, feeding success in relation to tidal zonation, diet and the influence of social interactions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There is a {{high-rise}} building whose main structure is framework- core tube. In {{order to meet}} the requirements for architectural features, the distance between the outer frame and the exterior wall of core tube is relatively small, therefore the floor structure program adopts a thick plate and <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> beam floor system, and part floors of the upper structure adopt a thick plate and dark beam system. As <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> beams (dark beams) have a small height and cannot form effective support for the floor, special analysis has been made on floors from the security point of view without considering the role of <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> beams (dark beams).
