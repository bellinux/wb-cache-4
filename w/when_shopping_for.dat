However, each apparel product has its own characteristics, and consumers’ responses to price discounts may vary <b>when</b> consumers <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> different types of apparel products. In future studies, researchers may examine different types of apparel items, such as dresses or suits, or products offered to different market categories, such as luxury or fast fashion products, to determine whether product type influences the effect of price discounts.|$|R

40|$|<b>Shopping</b> <b>for</b> {{second-hand}} apparel {{is rapidly}} growing {{and has become}} a notable segment of the retail market. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine what influences consumers <b>when</b> <b>shopping</b> second-hand <b>for</b> apparel products in-store and online. According to the existing literature, a number of key factors play significant roles <b>for</b> second-hand apparel <b>shopping</b> consumer decisions. They include: social, costs, trends and environmental influencers. Past research has not concentrated in-depth on the hedonistic and social influences of second-hand apparel shopping, financial factors, and time spent <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> second-hand apparel. This study has observed the socio-demographic profile of second-hand shoppers, what location is preferred <b>for</b> <b>shopping,</b> and what influences them in their purchase decision-making. Quantitative research methods were used to observe consumer behavior, shopping attitudes both in-store and online, and socio-demographics. Surveys were conducted with 157 participants, in-person and online. The results of the study show the key factors which influence second-hand apparel shopping are social, economic, and environmental. The majority of <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> second-hand apparel is in-store, more women are shopping than men and, perceived value and social influence are the key to what drives consumers to shop and purchase while income is not a key indicator. The findings of this study further our understanding of consumers of second-hand apparel, where they shop, and what influences them. This provides needed information to second-hand retailers to better tailor shopping environments...|$|R

The 2004 Travel Consumer Survey published by Jupiter Research reported that [...] "nearly two in five online travel consumers say they believe that no one site has the lowest rates or fares."

40|$|This study {{serves as}} an initial attempt to {{demonstrate}} empirically how online consumers react to the offline channel extensions (i. e., opening physical stores) of e-tailers. Specifically, we examine how the attributes of offline channels influence consumer intentions to switch to offline channels and how they also lead to incremental demands on online channels. We investigate how these effects vary across highly complex utilitarian and hedonic products. The {{results of the study}} indicate that although store openings encourage online consumers to <b>shop</b> there <b>when</b> purchasing highly complex utilitarian products, the addition of offline stores results counterintuitively in incremental patronage of the online channels <b>when</b> consumers <b>shop</b> <b>for</b> highly complex hedonic products. This study validates the guiding role of product characteristics in designing offline channels for e-tailers and suggests that incorporating product type and complexity into the design is likely to {{contribute to the development of}} stores tailored to specific consumer segments...|$|R

50|$|The rise {{of social}} media {{networks}} {{has increased the}} opportunities for opinion leaders {{to play a role}} in brand awareness. In theory, anyone can be an opinion leader e.g. celebrities, journalists or public figures, but the rise of the digital environment has changed our understanding of who is a potentially useful influencer. Indeed, the digital environment has created more opportunities for bloggers to become important influencers because they are seen as accessible, authentic and tend to have loyal followings. Bloggers have become key influencers in important consumer goods and services including fashion, consumer electronics, food and beverage, cooking, restaurant dining and bars. For example, a recent survey by Collective Bias, showed that when it comes to product endorsements digital influencers are more popular than celebrities. Findings showed that only 3% of participants said they would consider buying a celebrity-endorsed item, in comparison to 60% who said they had been influenced by a blog review or social media post <b>when</b> <b>shopping.</b> <b>For</b> marketers, the digital landscape has made it somewhat easier to identify social influencers.|$|E
