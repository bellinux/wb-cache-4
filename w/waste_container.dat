500|$|Writings on more {{permanent}} media {{have also been}} lost in several ways. Stones with inscriptions were frequently re-used as building materials, and ceramic ostraca require a dry environment to ensure {{the preservation of the}} ink on their surfaces. Whereas papyrus rolls and packets were usually stored in boxes for safekeeping, ostraca were routinely discarded in waste pits; one such pit was discovered by chance at the Ramesside-era village of Deir el-Medina, and has yielded the majority of known private letters on ostraca. Documents found at this site include letters, hymns, fictional narratives, recipes, business receipts, and wills and testaments. Penelope Wilson describes this archaeological find as the equivalent of sifting through a modern landfill or <b>waste</b> <b>container.</b> She notes that the inhabitants of Deir el-Medina were incredibly literate by ancient Egyptian standards, and cautions that such finds only come [...] "...in rarefied circumstances and in particular conditions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under U.S. law, {{transuranic}} {{waste is}} further categorized into [...] "contact-handled" [...] (CH) and [...] "remote-handled" [...] (RH) {{on the basis}} of the radiation dose rate measured at the surface of the <b>waste</b> <b>container.</b> CH TRUW has a surface dose rate not greater than 200 mrem per hour (2mSv/h), whereas RH TRUW has a surface dose rate of 200mrem/h (2mSv/h) or greater. CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000 mrem/h (10,000mSv/h). The U.S. currently disposes of TRUW generated from military facilities at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in a deep salt formation in New Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Radioactive {{waste from}} the nuclear {{industry}} and hazardous products from chemical industries need to be effectively isolated from the biosphere {{for a very long}} time. Highly radioactive waste gives off heat and requires disposal at depth in special repositories while low-level radioactive waste, pesticides and mercury and arsenic, can be stored in deep mines. The multiple barrier principle implies that the rock and engineered barriers combine to provide isolation but assessment of the constitution and performance of crystalline rock reduces its role to provide “mechanical support” to <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> rather than true isolation of them. Smectitic clay is required for achieving this but its isolating capacity is limited over time, and long-lasting <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> are needed as well. The waste isolation effect of clay and containers can allow for constructing repositories in rock of rather poor quality, represented by abandoned mines, and <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> of 100 % copper further reduce the need for very well planned and constructed repositories.

40|$|The Flammability Assessment Methodology Program (FAMP) was {{established}} to investigate the flammability of gas mixtures found in transuranic (TRU) <b>waste</b> <b>containers.</b> The FAMP results {{provide a basis for}} increasing the permissible concentrations of flammable volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in TRU <b>waste</b> <b>containers.</b> The FAMP results will be used to modify the ''Safety Analysis Report for the TRUPACT-II Shipping Package'' (TRUPACT-II SARP) upon acceptance of the methodology by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Implementation of the methodology would substantially increase the number of drums that can be shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) without repackaging or treatment. Central to the program was experimental testing and modeling to predict the gas mixture lower explosive limit (MLEL) of gases observed in TRU <b>waste</b> <b>containers.</b> The experimental data supported selection of an MLEL model that was used in constructing screening limits for flammable VOC and flammable gas concentrations. The MLEL values predicted by the model for individual drums will be utilized to assess flammability for drums that do not meet the screening criteria. Finally, the predicted MLEL values will be used to derive acceptable gas generation rates, decay heat limits, and aspiration time requirements for drums that do not pass the screening limits. The results of the program demonstrate that an increased number of <b>waste</b> <b>containers</b> can be shipped to WIPP within the flammability safety envelope established in the TRUPACT-II SARP...|$|R

Aiming at {{the problem}} of {{effectively}} recycling <b>waste</b> beverage <b>containers,</b> an automatic green recycling technique based on the optical image inspection is proposed.

The problem of <b>waste</b> beverage <b>containers</b> automatic recycling is solved, the cost of retailers is reduced and the <b>waste</b> beverage <b>containers</b> are recycled effectively.
