2500|$|She {{returned}} to North Dakota for a tonsillectomy and was noticed by hotel owner Frank Bering {{while working at}} the Doll House in Palm Springs, California. It was here that she developed her trademark sultry purr – having decided {{to compete with the}} noisy crowd with subtlety rather than volume. Beringin offered her a gig at The Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel East in Chicago. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee, [...] "Benny's then-fiancée, Lady Alice Duckworth, came into The Buttery, and she was very impressed. So the next evening she brought Benny in, because {{they were looking for a}} replacement for Helen Forrest. And although I didn't know, I was it. He <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> strangely, I thought, but it was just his preoccupied way of looking. I thought that he didn't like me at first, but it just was that he was preoccupied with what he was hearing." [...] She joined his band in 1941 and stayed for two years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped and turned to look back. She had stopped too and <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E
2500|$|Kerouac was {{demoralized}} by {{criticism of}} Dharma Bums from such respected {{figures in the}} American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers Ruth Fuller Sasaki and Alan Watts. [...] He wrote to Snyder, referring to a meeting with D. T. Suzuki, that [...] "even Suzuki <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through slitted eyes as though I was a monstrous imposter." [...] He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to Philip Whalen, [...] "I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit. [...] I'm not a Buddhist any more." [...] In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's cafe recitation, Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul: [...] "A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light." [...] Many consider that this clearly indicated Kerouac's journey on an emotional roller coaster of unprecedented adulation and spiritual demoralization.|$|E

2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Xuānzong had, {{while an}} {{imperial}} prince, disliked Li Deyu's hold on power. After the ceremony {{in which he}} ascended to the throne and in which Li Deyu submitted the formal congratulatory report from the imperial officials {{on behalf of all}} of them, Emperor Xuānzong commented to his servants, [...] "Was not the person who was closest to me during the ceremony the Taiwei ? [...] When he <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> all my hairs were raised!" [...] Just seven days after taking the throne, Emperor Xuānzong, to the surprise of the entire imperial administration, sent Li Deyu out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Jingnan Circuit, and also exiled Li Deyu's associates Xue Yuanshang (薛元賞) and Xue Yuanxhang's brother Xue Yuangui (薛元龜). Soon after, Emperor Xuānzong issued an edict permitting the five former Niu Faction chancellors exiled by Emperor Wuzong—Niu Sengru, Li Zongmin, Cui Gong, Yang Sifu, and Li Jue—to be promoted to positions closer to Chang'an, although Li Zongmin died before he could be moved. Emperor Xuānzong also made Li Deyu the defender of Luoyang and removed the honorary chancellor title that he continued to carry as the military governor of Jingnan from him, further showing disapproval.|$|E
