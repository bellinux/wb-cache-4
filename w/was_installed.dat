In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet <b>was</b> <b>installed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the light}} had a fifth-order Fresnel lens, but a fourth-order Fresnel lens <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> in May 1902, {{just three months}} into its operation.

The light continues {{to serve as an}} active aid to navigation. In 1987, a FA-251 <b>was</b> <b>installed</b> before the current lens, a VRB-25 <b>was</b> <b>installed.</b> The current light characteristic is an alternating white and red flash every 24 seconds.
