The Edmonton Journal has stated, [...] "Living and playing in Seattle might have got them the grunge tag, but they've always pretty much been a classic metal band to the core." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Great Southern Journey", as Frank Wild called it, {{began on}} 29 October 1908. On 9 January 1909, Shackleton and three companions (Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams) reached a new Farthest South {{latitude}} of 88°23'S, a point only [...] from the Pole. En route the South Pole party discovered the Beardmore Glacier (named after Shackleton's patron) [...] {{and became the}} first persons to see and travel on the South Polar Plateau. Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race against starvation, on half-rations for much of the way. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: [...] "All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> me". They arrived at Hut Point just in time to catch the ship.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jack helps Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) manage his money [...] because his {{spending}} has gotten out of control. Jack recommends a [...] "post-nup" [...] agreement for Tracy and his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), as Tracy fears that Angie might leave him if she ever were to have enough money to live on. Angie agrees to sign the agreement but promises Tracy that she <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> his side, which moves Tracy and he stops her from signing the agreement. Later, Jack feels a lump in one of his testicles, and believing he has testicular cancer, he begins to look at life differently. He admits to Liz that he has fallen in love with Elisa after they spent some time together. When he gets his tests results, which come back negative, he has second thoughts about Elisa. In the end, however, Jack comes home to Elisa, and the two share a kiss.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{mentions}} all [...] "the evils {{out to get}} Rapunzel" [...] and is essentially about manipulating ones' daughter. Featuring [...] "Mommie Dearest-style passive-aggressive putdowns,"|date = January 27, 2011|accessdate = February 24, 2015|website = The Scotsman|last = |first = }} the song begins with Murphy speaking, [...] "You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel!", and features the lyric [...] "skip the drama, stay with mama," [...] one of the song's most memorable, according to Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times. As Gothel, Murphy lists several things for Rapunzel to fear, such as ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand, cannibals, snakes and the plague, {{in an attempt to}} deter her from leaving. Teena Elizabeth of BookMyShow also observed that at one point the song contradicts itself, with its lyrics first implying that Rapunzel that can leave [...] "soon, but not yet", only to eventually conclude, [...] "Rapunzel <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> the tower ever." [...] Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed cited [...] "don't ever ask to leave this tower again" [...] as the song's [...] "most villainous lyric." [...] John Roebuck of ReelGood observed that the song's lyrics are essentially [...] "Snide remarks on [...] stolen daughter's appearance and abilities ... disguised as a mothers concern." [...] Writing for Slant Magazine, Christian Blauvelt felt that the song's lyrics were similar to those of [...] "Out There" [...] from Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), specifically Judge Claude Frollo's verse. Both [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] and [...] "Out There", in fact, were composed by Menken. Also comparing the song to Menken's previous work, AllMusic's James Christopher Monger wrote that [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] is [...] "cut from the same pop cloth as all of the late 20th/early 21st century Disney offerings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Steve Coll {{criticized the}} early claims for [...] "journalism" [...] {{with the use}} of {{composite}} characters.

Coll said the facts about him were different from what was portrayed in the film, which suggests the detainee <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> the black site. Al-Baluchi was transferred to Guantanamo in 2006 for a military tribunal. Coll writes: He has been an active, defiant participant in Guantánamo court proceedings and his lawyers have sought permission from military judges to introduce evidence in his defense that he was tortured while in CIA custody, and to pursue information about the identities of the agency officers who interrogated him.|$|E

2500|$|As with nationality, The Mystery of the Sea often {{addresses}} gendered {{conceptions of}} identity, and presents an ambivalent {{view on the}} roles of women. David Glover asserts that Stoker's [...] "writings can certainly be placed within the antifeminist backlash of the [...] period", while Lisa Hopkins recognizes the tensions in Stoker's work regarding the New Woman and notes how Archibald Hunter must confront [...] "menacing and insubordinate females". Marjory, the female protagonist, is a crossing point between the ideal mid-nineteenth-century woman {{and the idea of}} the New Woman, which had taken shape {{at the end of the}} century. She is brave, independent, and defiant, as exemplified by her purchase of a warship, her evasion of the diplomats who try to protect her, and constant assertions that she has a fighting spirit. Mrs. Jack, her companion, represents more traditional views of womanhood, as shown when she lectures Marjory on her duties to her husband. Marjory eventually listens to Mrs. Jack's advice, and her somewhat exceptional behavior ultimately does not interfere with her [...] "feminine" [...] weaknesses. Marjory is deeply in love with her husband and ends the novel saying she <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> his side. She occasionally betrays fear and even expresses longing for some of the more traditional feminine characteristics apparently typical of non-American women. Archibald loves her and is enamored with her fierce spirit, and admires her [...] "coolness of head" [...] but this does not stop him from noting that she possesses [...] "the little morsel of hysterics which goes to make up the sum total of every woman". Hopkins observes that Archibald feels that he ultimately has the advantage by being a man, and notes that gender is [...] "the one arena in which Stoker's men… can always win". Despite the apparent power of Marjory's [...] "new" [...] brand of femininity, it is ultimately flawed in Stoker's representations. The strongest example of this contradiction between the strength of the New Woman and more traditional feminine weakness is Archibald's assertion that [...] "my Marjory, though a strong and brave one, was but a woman after all". Throughout The Mystery of the Sea, women are shown to be intelligent and generally more useful than passive; however, this does not stop the narrator from characterizing women as best suited to being subservient, pleasing companions to men.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Phineas Taylor (P.T.) Barnum {{introduces}} his circus acts as he stands in front of a tent, proclaiming [...] "There Is a Sucker Born Ev'ry Minute". He loves spectacle and excitement, using hype and [...] "humbug" [...] to promote his exhibits. His wife Charity disagrees with his use of [...] "humbug" [...] but loves him and aims to keep him grounded. Barnum then introduces the oldest woman alive, Joice Heth, and thanks to some Barnum humbug she becomes a success ("Thank God I'm Old"). His wife Charity ("Chairy") urges him to get a job in a factory, but Barnum refuses ("The Colors of My Life [...] ") and Charity wryly admits and accepts the disparity between their views ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum enlists clowns to help in building a museum to house his attractions (with expected comical results) and it's up to Charity to encourage him to keep going ("One Brick at a Time"), with the result that [...] "everything about [...] museum was spectacular" [...] ("Museum Song"); however, the museum burns down accidentally. Barnum finds two new star attractions, Tom Thumb, who appears to advise that [...] "Bigger Isn't Better", and Jumbo the elephant. Barnum then becomes manager of the famous Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All"). Barnum becomes enamored of her and sees the attraction of going on tour with her ("Out There"). He accompanies Jenny on tour, leaving Charity behind, as a marching band greets them ("Come Follow the Band"). Although all seems to be going well for Barnum, he finds that without Charity in his life he is miserable, and he decides to break ties with Jenny and return home to the woman he loves ("Love Makes Such Fools of Us All [...] "). Upon his return to Charity, he promises to live the more sedate life she desires for him, in [...] "Black and White." [...] After a failed stint running a clockworks factory and a failed attempt to build his own city, he turns to politics; when his campaign looks doomed to fail due to lack of interest, Charity realizes how important his talents and passion are in his life and allows him to inject color and life into his campaign. He is elected Mayor of Bridgeport, {{and the two of them}} recognize the value in each other's approach to life and how they complement one another ("The Colors of My Life [...] "). Barnum is prepared to run for President, but his beloved Charity dies suddenly, leaving Barnum bereft and alone. When Barnum finds himself cheated of the Presidential nomination by his political party, he laments his position, realizes that his talent for Humbug <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> him and wishes to [...] "make it right, shoot a rocket, shine a light" [...] ("Prince of Humbug"). James Anthony Bailey arrives and offers him the chance to [...] "Join the Circus". Initially resisting, he relents (thanks in part to Charity's two-headed coin, which she has used to humbug him throughout the show) and joins Bailey, and they form the famous circus Barnum and Bailey.|$|E
