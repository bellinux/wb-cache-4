5|$|Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, Gabriel Belmont. The combat involves a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlockable combos with it. The commands consist of direct attacks for dealing damage to single enemies, and <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee skills can be combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense and aggression, respectively. The whip is upgradeable and {{can also be used}} to guard against an opponent's attack.|$|E
5|$|On October8, a <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of low {{pressure}} developed within a monsoon trough over the extreme {{eastern edge of}} the Pacific basin. Environmental conditions ahead of the system were forecast to become gradually favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. Situated near Costa Rica, scattered convection accompanied the well-defined system. This low became less defined over the following days while remaining in the same general area. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system for long-term cyclogenesis on October13, at which time the low was situated 150mi (240km) south of Guatemala. Organization was prolonged and slow; however, the convergence of a Kelvin wave and a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event on October15 spurred a significant increase in convection.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on August 14, moved westward as a disorganized system, and passed through the Cape Verde islands on August 15. On August 17, a <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure developed in the system about 750miles (1,200km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Convection increased over the western portion of the wave axis, and the system began to become better organized on August 18 while located about 1,250miles (2,000km) east of the Lesser Antilles. However, convection around the system diminished on August 19, and later that day it began {{to move through the}} Lesser Antilles. Despite favorable upper-level winds and falling atmospheric pressures, there were initially no signs of a circulation at the surface. Convection again increased early on August 20, and it gradually became better organized. Based on a ship's wind report of the system, it is estimated the wave developed into Tropical Depression Nine on August 21 while located about 260miles (415km) south of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kyle {{began as}} a <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of low {{pressure}} associated with a tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September12. The system tracked in a general westward direction with little convective development and tracked over the Leeward Islands on September18. An upper-level trough situated over the eastern Caribbean Sea interacted with the wave, resulting in an increase in shower and thunderstorm activity. The following day, a larger surface circulation developed as the low moved towards the northwest. The wave later became separated from the low, with the wave continuing towards the west and the low tracking to the northwest. The National Hurricane Center (NHC), at this time, were not anticipating significant development of the low as strong wind shear inhibited deep convection from forming. Around 1400UTC on September21, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the system as convection developed around the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|On March25, 2014, a <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of low {{pressure}} accompanied by broad, flaring convection became increasingly organized over Mozambique. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, featuring low wind shear, vorticity became more enhanced and symmetrical. A compact system, the low steadily organized as it emerged over the Mozambique Channel on March26. Though continued land interaction initially hindered development, enhanced outflow supported convective development as it straddled the Mozambique–Tanzania border. With high sea surface {{temperatures in the}} storm's track, the JTWC anticipated further organization and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 2000UTC on March26. Once further offshore on March27, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Météo-France in La Réunion classified the system as Disturbance 14. Drifting slowly east, a prominent feeder band developed along the system's eastern side; however, this band disrupted low-level inflow of warm, moist air and suppressed convection over the circulation center.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Helen was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to bring gale-force winds to Darwin, Australia since 1985. The fourth named storm of the 2007–08 Australian region cyclone season, Helen developed out of a <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure in late December over the Top End region of Australia. Generally tracking westward, the system eventually intensified into a tropical cyclone and was given the name Helen on 2January. By this time, it was situated over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf and was beginning to retrograde eastward. Late on 4January, the storm made landfall near Channel Point with winds of 95km/h (60mph) though rapidly weakened to a tropical low within 12hours. Gradually accelerating, the remnants of Helen moved over the Gulf of Carpentaria before striking land again on 6January. The system was last noted over the Cape York Peninsula on 7January.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of deliberate practice, defined as practice specifically aimed at learners’ <b>weak</b> <b>areas</b> and only their <b>weak</b> <b>areas,</b> on 8 th graders performance in geometry. A control group had a choice over practice problems and their sequencing. Experiment 1 indicated a disordinal practice schedule by knowledge interaction. Simple effects tests indicated that the interaction was primarily caused by less knowledgeable learners benefiting more from a self-selected practice schedule than deliberate practice. Two subsequent experiments explored the cognitive mechanisms behind this effect by using learners with different levels of prior knowledge. Whereas the relatively more knowledgeable learners in Experiment 2 benefited by concentrating only on their <b>weak</b> <b>areas</b> during practice, the less knowledgeable learners in Experiment 3 improved their skills when they practiced on problem sets combining some of their weak {{and some of their}} strong areas or by concentrating on {{only a limited number of}} <b>weak</b> <b>areas</b> for a given problem area. These findings have important implications for the design of curriculum materials and implementation of deliberate practice techniques in secondary classrooms. Prior to attaining a sufficient level of familiarity with the subject matter, learners should be encouraged to continue practicing in areas in which they have some degree of competence. Only after competence is attained in several related areas should an exclusive emphasis be placed on practice in <b>weak</b> <b>areas</b> only. 12 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Tropical Storm Delia {{originated}} from a tropical wave that formed over the central Caribbean Sea in late August 1973. Tracking towards the west-northwest, convective activity increased {{and the overall}} structure of the system improved. By August31, a <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure formed over the Gulf of Honduras. This system tracked northward and further organized into a tropical depression just off the southeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on September1. Gradually intensifying, the depression became a tropical storm on September3 as it turned towards the west. In accordance with its upgrade, it was given the name Delia. This upgrade followed a reconnaissance mission into the system that found sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h). A complex steering pattern formed later that day, resulting in a more hostile environment for the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Faye {{originated}} from a westward-moving <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of disturbed weather {{located within the}} Philippine Sea {{in the middle of}} August. On August16, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the disturbance for possible development. Initially, little development was expected due to its close proximity to land and Typhoon Ellis. The disturbance was poorly organized and the atmospheric circulation was exposed from the deep convection despite being located near an anticyclone, which tends to favor tropical cyclogenesis. On August20, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the disturbance. Later that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm, assigning it with the local name Norming. After emerging into the South China Sea, the storm began to intensify. Later on the morning of August20, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance. At 0000 UTC on August21, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Six hours later, the agency determined that the depression attained tropical storm status, naming it Faye.|$|E

The system remained nearly stationary for two days as it became increasingly organized. On July1, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as they anticipated the low to develop into a significant tropical cyclone within 24hours. Around 0600UTC the following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring {{the system as a}} tropical depression. At the same time, the JTWC also classified the system as Tropical Depression 05W and six hours later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on the same system, classifying it as Tropical Depression Ditang.|$|E
30|$|As for NLOS {{severe and}} <b>weak</b> <b>areas,</b> the {{segmentation}} {{can be done}} for ΣCI = 16. This is justified because the value 16 corresponds to 1 R 0 D, in other words, paths reflected only once and not diffracted. This is the predominant component {{in the absence of}} the direct path, as suggested in the studies [11, 13]. As a result, all sample points with ΣCI< 16 are in NLOS severe areas, while others (16 ≤ ΣCI< 32) are in NLOS <b>weak</b> <b>areas.</b> Hence, using the proposed ΣCI method, the signal can be segmented in three states in a deterministic manner.|$|R

40|$|Deliberate {{practice}} {{defined as}} individualized training regimen with feedback {{is considered to}} be one of the most important factors in acquisition of expertise. However, there were a few attempts to explain cognitive mechanisms underlying deliberate practice. Experimental manipulations of the practice formats targeted at introducing deliberate practice activities in realistic learning environments are also rare. The five experiments, reported in this thesis, are aimed at describing cognitive mechanisms behind the deliberate practice phenomenon and at detailing conditions under which deliberate practice is effective (in cognitively rich domains). Based on expertise and sports psychology literature, deliberate practice was hypothesised to enhance learners performance in cognitively rich domains over a free-choice practice. The results showed that deliberate practice aimed at learners <b>weak</b> <b>areas</b> was proven to be an effective practice method for advanced learners at the latest stages of their expertise acquisition. Conversely, less knowledgeable learners were overwhelmed by the practice format targeting all of their <b>weak</b> <b>areas.</b> Although they were not complete novices in the practiced material their working memory limitations prevented them from successfully refining all their <b>weak</b> <b>areas</b> during the practice. Less knowledgeable learners delivered better final results when they concentrated on one or two of their <b>weak</b> <b>areas</b> at the time. The results reported in this thesis provide evidence that an expertise reversal observed in instructional conditions equally occurs in practice conditions, and that the success of deliberate practice depends on the level of the learners prior knowledge. Experiments 1, 2 and 5 demonstrated that deliberate practice format differentially influences more and less knowledgeable learners, and this effect holds for different practice materials (conventional problems and worked examples). Experiment 3 showed that deliberate practice is advantageous for more knowledgeable learners and Experiment 4 established that practice formats allowing learners to concentrate on one or two of their <b>weak</b> <b>areas</b> are more beneficial for less knowledgeable learners than a deliberate practice format. The results have a broad application for effective sequencing of practice strategies and implementation of deliberate practice in schools. However, more evidence might be needed for a working memory limitations explanation of deliberate practice effects with less knowledgeable learners...|$|R
5|$|In late October 2010, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{began to}} monitor a <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of disorganized weather along the {{southern}} periphery of a frontal system, associated with a broad surface trough east-northeast of Puerto Rico. Supported by an upper-level low retrograding to its southwest, the system generated clusters of scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms, otherwise known as convection. The activity gradually enhanced as environmental conditions within its encounter became more favorable over time. Around 1200UTC October28, satellite imagery showed {{what appeared to be}} the formation of a surface low within the trough. Shower and thunderstorm activity accordingly intensified, and the NHC assessed a high chance for tropical or subtropical development. At the time, the center of circulation remained poor; however, it became better defined later that day, with a stable amount of corresponding convection. Although the upper low had remained adjacent, it was located well to the southwest of the system's small wind radius, an atypical structure for a subtropical cyclone. The system was therefore operationally designated as Tropical Storm Shary at 0000UTC October 29, though post-season analysis revealed a tropical depression had formed by 1800 UTC October 28, about 520mi (830km) south-southeast of Bermuda. At the time of classification, the agency noted that Shary would be a relatively short-lived tropical cyclone due to a merge with a cold front forecast to occur within the following 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from the Ozarks into the Northeastern United States, acting to strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the risk area. At the surface, a <b>weak</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April9 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an arching warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest surface heating ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values to reach 1,000–1,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s °F across the Enhanced risk area. Winds at 850 mb (4,781ft) strengthened at or above 45mph (75km/h) below winds of 70mph (110km/h) at 700 mb (9,882ft), creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds {{was expected to be}} less than ideal as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.|$|E

On January 3, the low pressure center showed initial signs of strengthening, prompting Météo-France to declare it a tropical disturbance, the lowest of seven distinct intensity categories used by the agency. The surrounding environment became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, with increased upper-level divergence, and consequently, the system further matured; it was upgraded to a depression early on January 5, and to a moderate tropical storm 12 hours later.
