5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s <b>was</b> <b>sweet,</b> kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E

25|$|The Winter {{solstice}} {{was thought}} to occur on 25 December. January 1 was new year day: the day was consecrated to Janus since {{it was the first}} of the new year and of the month (kalends) of Janus: the feria had an augural character as Romans believed the beginning of anything was an omen for the whole. Thus on that day it was customary to exchange cheerful words of good wishes. For the same reason everybody devoted a short time to his usual business, exchanged dates, figs and honey as a token of well wishing and made gifts of coins called strenae. Cakes made of spelt (far) and salt were offered to the god and burnt on the altar. Ovid states that in most ancient times there were no animal sacrifices and gods were propitiated with offerings of spelt and pure salt. This libum was named ianual and it was probably correspondent to the summanal offered the day before the Summer solstice to god Summanus, which however <b>was</b> <b>sweet</b> being made with flour, honey and milk.|$|E

Margarita said about it: [...] "It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn't seem right any more, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing." [...] An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>sweet</b> and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though not like him, but they seemed made for each other." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} of pre-modern agriculture on the leeward slopes of Kohala. From 1400 to 1800, the principal crop grown at Kohala <b>was</b> <b>sweet</b> potato (Ipomoea batatas), although {{there is also evidence}} of yams (Dioscorea sp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), bananas (Musa hybrids), sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), and gourds of the family Cucurbitaceae. The optimal rainfall level for the sweet potato lies between [...] per year. A combination of factors makes the rainfall at Kohala variable both from location to location and from year to year. In addition, Kohala is buffeted by strong winds, which are directly correlated to soil erosion; ancient farmers utilized a series of earthen embarkments and stone walls to protect their crops. This technique has been shown to reduce wind by at least 2030 percent.|$|E

She's no Julie Andrews, but she'll do." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented: [...] "Seeing Emma sing [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] <b>was</b> <b>sweet,</b> though was it just me (or my TV), or was the volume on her vocals a bit unusually loud?

500|$|Becky's storyline was {{acclaimed}} by most reviewers. Canning {{called it}} [...] "exceptional" [...] and [...] "the most emotional and satisfying of the episode". Poniewozik also praised it, and wrote, [...] "Artie and Becky's arc, {{on the other}} hand, really worked: it <b>was</b> <b>sweet,</b> uncomfortable and messy {{in the way that}} Glee does well." [...] He continued, [...] "it played out as it did not just because of Artie and Becky's condition but because of what they’re like as people". VanDerWerff said the story was [...] "handled with just the right level of pathos", and Slezak praised the writers for turning Becky [...] "into a fully realized character, while confronting head-on the dashed hopes and disappointments that can be a reality for a person with Down Syndrome". Sullivan wrote, [...] "The plot touched on a universal experience, unrequited love, from a very Glee perspective, the treatment of handicapped people as people. It ended on an appropriate down note and reaffirmed Sue and Becky's touching dynamic." [...] Bell liked Sue in this episode, as she was helping the plot, which in turn made her one-liners [...] "added treats rather than overdone cliches". The use of Helen Mirren to voice Becky's thoughts was highly praised. Poniewozik called it [...] "the kind of ridiculous-but-weirdly-logical move I love from Glee", and Lynch said it [...] "was one of the most charming treats this show has offered in a while". Sullivan wrote that [...] "both actresses turned in great performances that elevated the episode significantly". Not all reviewers agreed, however: Futterman called Mirren's vocal cameo [...] "bizarre", and although Kubicek thought Mirren was [...] "pretty darn hilarious", he said the [...] "Becky having a crush on Artie" [...] story arc made him feel [...] "as uncomfortable" [...] as the members of New Directions, and stated, [...] "It's easy to say that everyone should just treat her like they treat everyone else, but actually doing it is somewhat problematic." ...|$|E
