500|$|The {{crowds at}} the Melbourne and Sydney Tests gave Hill three cheers {{when he arrived}} at the wicket. When Hill reached the batting crease in his last Test at Sydney, the umpire Bob Crockett said [...] "there <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> in his eyes". An in camera {{investigation}} into the fracas took place; the Board's only comment on the meeting was to report that it had been [...] "satisfactorily settled". Hill was then offered an invitation to take part in the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England. Hill declined the invitation, along with Warwick Armstrong, Trumper, Carter, Noble and Vernon Ransford, who collectively became known as the [...] "Big Six". He never played Test cricket again.|$|E
500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> in his eyes as he shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
500|$|When the 2000 Republican National Convention {{began in}} Philadelphia {{at the end}} of July, McCain took his Straight Talk Express to meet with his delegates and {{supporters}} before formally releasing them to Bush. [...] There <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> from McCain, his wife Cindy, and some of the campaign staff and delegates. [...] Many of McCain's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush, and the Times wrote that, [...] "Politics as usual with its compromises, cruelties and emotional costs â€” caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend." [...] McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention, not his antagonist Governor Hull. [...] On August 1, the second night of the convention, McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush, in particular trying to solidify Bush's national security and foreign policy credentials. In it, McCain connected his family to Bush's, making reference to former President George H. W. Bush's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., McCain's grandfather. [...] He said directly of the nominee, [...] "I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him." [...] The Almanac of American Politics called it [...] "a moving, elegiac speech that ended as if in a minor key." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schembechler did {{not include}} Wangler in {{his plans for the}} 1980 season, but Wangler spent the summer in Ann Arbor working with {{offensive}} guard Kurt Becker to rehabilitate the knee. [...] Becker recalled that Wangler's recuperation was difficult: [...] "There was so much pain involved that there <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> in his eyes." [...] Wangler described his rehabilitation as follows:"Maybe I was naive, but I never had a doubt I'd play again. [...] I wasn't ready to end my career. [...] I'd do anything to play. [...] The cast came off March 1st and by August 1st I knew I'd be able to play. [...] I worked out four to five hours every day with weights, running, bicycling and swimming." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gloria Foster died on September 29, 2001, at age 67. The {{cause of}} her death was diabetes. Though {{she was no longer}} married, her ex-husband, Clarence Williams III, was the one to {{announce}} her death. [...] A memorial was held at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn on October 15, 2001. Many of her close friends and actors and actresses who had performed with her came to attend the funeral. [...] Judith Rutherford James, a well-known producer and good friend who worked with Foster on In White America and Having Our Say played a huge part in the memorial service and helped to oversee that it ran smoothly. [...] Many of the speeches given at the service showed and spoke about how Gloria Foster not only played her part, but also embodied the character, both emotionally and physically. [...] Martin Duberman, the author of In White America, told the audience that, [...] "she embodied it. [...] At the end of the scene each night, there <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> streaming down her face, her body was trembling, but her dignity was intact...Foster had to be covered with blankets in order to calm her shaking".|$|E
2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There <b>were</b> <b>tears</b> in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} types of tears: basal tears, {{reflexive}} tears, and psychic <b>tears.</b> Basal <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> produced {{at a rate of}} about 1 to 2 microliters a minute, and are made in order to keep the eye lubricated and smooth out irregularities in the cornea. Reflexive <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> <b>tears</b> that <b>are</b> made in response to irritants to the eye, such as when chopping onions or getting poked in the eye. Psychic <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> produced by the lacrimal system and <b>are</b> the <b>tears</b> expelled during emotional states.|$|R
