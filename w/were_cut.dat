40|$|Abstract. The {{corrosion}} {{behaviors of}} {{304 stainless steel}} (304 SS) which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> in two different solutions were investigated using polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The results show that 304 SS which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> have the similar corrosion voltage in two different solutions. However, the corrosion velocity of 304 SS which has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> more than 304 SS which has not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> both in the two solutions and the corrosion behaviors of two 304 SS in the water solution are better than in the water which has little oil...|$|R

5|$|According to Johnson, filming did {{not begin}} until April 1965, one year after {{approval}} of the script, with J. Hoberman reporting a slightly earlier date of September 1964 {{for the start of}} filming in his film essay for the Criterion collection release of the film. The initial budget was 1.6million Rubles, but it was cut several times to one million Rubles (In comparison, Sergei Bondarchuk's War and Peace had a budget of eight and half million Rubles). As a result of the budget restrictions several scenes from the script <b>were</b> <b>cut,</b> including an opening scene showing the Battle of Kulikovo. Other scenes that <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> from the script are a hunting scene, where the younger brother of the Grand Prince hunts swans, and a scene showing peasants helping Durochka giving birth to her Russian-Tatar child. In the end the film cost 1.3million Rubles, with the cost overrun due to heavy snowfall, which disrupted shooting from November 1965 until April 1966. The film was shot on location, on the Nerl River and the historical places of Vladimir/Suzdal, Pskov, Izborsk and Pechory.|$|E

The date '1937' <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> above the horse, however, it appears this number was never later scoured and thus the date is no longer visible. The horse was {{floodlit}} in coronation week and the effect was described as [...] "very good" [...] except for thick fog on two nights.

By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E

5|$|Most Tales {{games have}} skits, side conversations between {{different}} characters {{that can be}} both dramatic and comedic in nature. They are commonly portrayed as character portraits or profiles, with text {{along the bottom of}} the screen.

In the original English GameCube release of Symphonia, the voice track for the skits was removed, but for its HD re-release, the Japanese voice track, and consequently the skit voice tracks, were included. The first English release to include fully voiced skits was Vesperia: they had been planned for Abyss, but <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> due to space issues. Another recurring feature is the Cooking system, where characters learn and prepare dishes to restore health and forms of experience points.|$|E
