According to his later account, it was at this point that he attained a strong belief in justice; he began to divide his lunch in two to share with a poorer boy who could not afford food. On another occasion, he got into a physical fight with an older classmate; this greatly upset his mother, who held pacifist beliefs. According to his later account, at one point he rebelled <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> tried to punish him for disobedience; rather than permitting himself to be beaten with a rod, he marched out of the school and into the wooded mountains. He remained there for three days, until being discovered by a family member and brought home.|$|E

A {{study found}} {{a correlation between}} how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating {{as a way of}} getting back at the teacher. Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is using a grade curve, are more likely to cheat.|$|E

As stated by Martin and Baldwin (1993), three teachers’ classroom management styles can be distinguished: interventionist, non-interventionist and interactionist. The {{purpose of the study}} is to examine the relations between teachers’ classroom management styles, satisfaction with classroom climate and students’ school achievement. Data analysis shows that both teachers and students are the most satisfied with the classroom climate which is created by teacher-interactionist. Students’ achievements were at its highest <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> practiced interactionist style, and at its lowest <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> were interventionists...|$|R

500|$|In 1965, the {{benefits}} of the National College of Education partnership were less evident and the Administrative Board purchased Avery Coonley from the NCE. Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners were ready to read, ACS launched an early reading program in the early 1960s. Malach's stance was that [...] "we don't believe a child should be taught because he or she is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works individually with the child at his or her own pace." [...] By this time, however, the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become [...] "conventional wisdom" [...] and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public schools. As part of Malach's [...] "bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery Coonley School had played during its early years", ACS joined the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) in 1961. ISACS was founded in 1908 to promote best practices in independent schools, and instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office was dissolved in 2000.|$|E

He commented that the scandal was largely owed to the victim's father having made use of his political connections with the Ion Brătianu cabinet, and protested <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> assigned a provincial post as a punitive measure.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{describe}} and analyze what modes of discourse for reading comprehension were prominent among six teachers in two different schools in Stockholm, Sweden. Based on a teacher perspective on how to describe, teach and assess reading comprehension, the investigation concentrated on teacher discourses and their alignment with influential theories of reading. The study was based on transcriptions of six tape-recorded teacher interviews and classroom observations. The method for analyzing the material was a discourse analysis based on Rosalind Ivanic’s (2004) six writing discourses that were adapted to the context of reading comprehension. The results show that teachers in both schools tended to utilise several modes of discourse at the same time. There was overall {{a significant difference between the}} discourse styles that were used <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> were defining <b>the</b> purpose of reading comprehension and <b>the</b> styles used <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> were assessing reading comprehension. <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> mainly used a creativity discourse and a social-practice discourse <b>when</b> explaining <b>the</b> purpose of reading comprehension. In describing assessment of reading comprehension however a skills discourse was more prominent among <b>the</b> <b>teachers.</b> Hence a discrepancy could be seen between how <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> view <b>the</b> purpose of reading comprehension and how they assess it...|$|R
