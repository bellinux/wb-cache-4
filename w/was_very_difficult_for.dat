25|$|The {{verbatim}} of {{the speeches}} {{at the conference}} were presented in full in Neues Deutschland, the central organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, whilst the more critical aspects were censored out in the reports in the Soviet newspaper Pravda. In particular the speech of Carrillo <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Soviets to digest. Pravda sought to portray the conference as a victory for proletarian internationalism and communist unity, downplaying the divisions that had appeared at the meeting. Other Socialist Bloc newspapers also censored the speeches from the conference.|$|E
25|$|World War I <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> White {{because of}} his Socialist values. War of any kind was {{abhorrent}} to his beliefs, and he struggled during this period about how to respond when {{so much of the}} country was engaged in supporting the war. His family life faced a crisis when his sons Maynard and Lewis enlisted in the Army. Lewis was quickly discharged due to a heart defect, but Maynard remained in the service {{until the end of the}} war. In addition, his colleague Karl Struss had been sent to a detention camp {{because of his}} German heritage.|$|E

25|$|When he was two-and-a-half, Brian's {{mother died}} and his {{maternal}} grandparents, Alfred and Gertrude Talbot, took over {{responsibility for his}} upbringing. At age eight, Cleeve was sent as a boarder to Selwyn House in Kent, followed at age 12 by three years at St. Edward's School in Oxford. He was by nature a free-thinker and he rejected the assumptions and prejudices that were then {{part and parcel of}} upper-middle class English life. His unwillingness to conform meant that school life <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him, and, in the late summer of 1938, Cleeve decided not to return to St. Edward's for his final year. Instead, he ran away to sea.|$|E
25|$|The Quaid Post {{was located}} at an {{altitude}} of 22,153 feet. It was extremely difficult to attack, as it was surrounded by 457 m high ice walls. It had an inclination of 80° to 85° on three sides, and a little less on the fourth side. It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the attackers to climb up the peak without getting noticed by the Pakistani soldiers stationed at the top. The scarcity of oxygen made walking long distances difficult, as the troops had to halt every few meters to regain their breath. There were also frequent blizzards, and taking advantage of poor visibility at night was difficult due to the wind chill factor. The minimum temperatures in the area were as low as -50°C at that time.|$|E
25|$|In 1672, however, he {{was forced}} to take action. He entered into an {{alliance}} for the defence of the United Provinces during the Franco-Dutch War; then, after this league had collapsed owing to the defection of the elector of Brandenburg, the more durable Quadruple Alliance was formed for the same purpose, including, besides the emperor, the king of Spain and several German princes, and the war was renewed. At this time, twenty-five years after the Peace of Westphalia, the Empire was virtually a confederation of independent princes, and it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> its head to conduct any war with vigor and success, some of its members being in alliance with the enemy and others being only lukewarm in their support of the imperial interests. Thus this struggle, which lasted until the end of 1678, was on the whole unfavourable to Germany, and the advantages of the Treaty of Nijmegen were mostly with France. It can however be argued that the imperial intervention saved the Netherlands from a complete French invasion.|$|E

25|$|There were {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} the operation of the contracts and the management of the men. During the period 1870–1875, power gradually transferred from the Provinces to the central government, partly because of the railway question. The Bill to abolish the Provinces was carried in October 1875 and implemented a year later. However, in the interim it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Brogdens to get clear prompt decisions. Brogdens got less work than they had hoped and it became available more slowly than expected. Communications between UK and New Zealand were obviously slow so it was difficult to know how many men to send at any given time. Sometimes Brogdens could not find work for the men when they arrived. Men reneged on their promissory notes. There were disputes over working hours, wages and whether they should be paid when the weather stopped the work. Gradually the men drifted away. By August 1873, 2172 English immigrants had been brought out. They included 1299 working-age men who were contracted to work for Brogdens for two years but only 287 of them were still working for them. Most of the men were agricultural labourers, rather than true navvies and they found local agricultural labour and working conditions more attractive than navvy work.|$|E
25|$|Many {{enterprises}} {{were taken}} over by the state or failed, small trade and production shops had to join cooperatives, but only a small proportion of peasant agriculture was made collective (over ten percent of the arable area) by {{the start of the war}} with Germany. Among the industrial installations dismantled and sent east were most of the Białystok textile industry factories. The results of the Soviet economic policies soon resulted in serious difficulties, as shops lacked goods, food was scarce and people were threatened by famine. Nevertheless, the conditions were better under the Soviets than in the German-run General Government. Industry was developed in Lviv and elsewhere and unemployment was officially eliminated by the spring of 1940. The living standards, following the initial collapse, kept gradually improving, many services were free or inexpensive and the poor and people with technical education fared better than under the Polish rule. The cities, of which Lviv and Białystok were particularly well-maintained by the Soviet authorities, were in much better shape than the countryside. The situation <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Polish retirees, deprived of their pensions, and for the tens of thousands of war refugees who fled German-occupied Poland and settled in the eastern cities.|$|E

500|$|Secord's {{criticism}} {{may have}} been a little extreme. The Department of Defense had created the 7th/13 Air Force at Udon in November 1965 {{for the express purpose of}} conducting the air war in Laos. According to historian Timothy Castle, Sullivan relegated the Air Force commander and his staff [...] "to the status of clerks hired to carry out his airpower decisions." [...] The unconventional arrangement bred frustration and the 7th/13th constantly harped about the use of its air assets in northern Laos. There was constant criticism over the use of air power [...] "serving targets" [...] or utilizing modern fighter-bombers as [...] "long-range artillery." [...] It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Air Force to grasp that a guerrilla force did not fight like a conventional army.|$|E

In October 2012, in an interview with Allure, Conrad stated that while [...] "the story told wasn't a dishonest one, the way [...] did it sometimes was". She elaborated that scenes would be reenacted if cameras were not present for a significant occurrence between cast members, and commented that her relationship with Jenner was [...] "pretty brief" [...] and [...] "definitely [...] to drag it out". In July 2013, when discussing the filming of several alternate finale endings, MTV acknowledged that [...] "maybe the term 'reality TV' didn't perfectly apply to The Hills".|$|E
500|$|In late 1943, the Arawe Peninsula {{was covered}} by coconut trees which formed part of the Amalut Plantation; the terrain inland from the {{peninsula}} and on its offshore islands was swampy. Most of the shoreline in the area has limestone cliffs. There was a small unused airfield [...] east of {{the neck of the}} Arawe Peninsula, and a coastal trail leading east from Cape Merkus to the Pulie River where it split into tracks running inland and along the coast. The terrain {{to the west of the}} peninsula was a trackless region of swamp and jungle, which <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> troops to move through. Several of the beaches in the Arawe area were suitable for landing craft; the best were House Fireman on the peninsula's west coast and near the village of Umtingalu to the east of the peninsula's base.|$|E

[...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right?

500|$|O'Reilly {{was one of}} {{the best}} spin bowlers ever to play cricket. He {{delivered}} the ball from a two-fingered grip at close to medium pace with great accuracy, and could produce leg breaks, googlies, and top spinners, with no discernible change in his action. A tall man for a spinner (around 188cm, 6ft 2in), he whirled his arms to an unusual extent and had a low point of delivery that meant it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O'Reilly died, Sir Donald Bradman said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, Wisden wrote of him: [...] "O'Reilly {{was one of the}} best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a 'hostile' bowler." [...] In 1939, Wisden reflected on Bill O'Reilly's successful 1938 Ashes tour of England: [...] "He is emphatically one of the greatest bowlers of all time." ...|$|E

Their headlining {{set at the}} 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Garfunkel, who was experiencing serious vocal problems. [...] "I was terrible, and crazy nervous. I leaned on Paul Simon and the affection of the crowd," [...] he told Rolling Stone several years later. Garfunkel was diagnosed with vocal cord paresis, and the remaining tour dates were postponed indefinitely. His manager, John Scher, informed Simon's camp that Garfunkel would be ready within a year, which did not happen, leading to poor relations between the two. Despite tensions, Simon continued to publicly wish his old friend Artie better health and gave him praises for his then angelic voice. Garfunkel regained his vocal strength {{over the course of}} the next four years, performing shows in a Harlem theater and to underground audiences.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} two months of 1986, Megadeth {{commenced}} a brief tour of the East Coast of the United States. At the shows, which were practically a continuation of the Killing for a Living tour, the band performed a number of songs from its upcoming album. Following the conclusion of the tour, the band intended to start making the record at the Music Grinder studio on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. Mustaine lifted the title from an article in Reader's Digest, which was titled [...] "Peace Would Sell But No One Would Buy It". Their label at the time, Combat Records, provided a recording budget of $25,000, which allowed the band to hire a freelance producer, Randy Burns. The recording of the album <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the band, because Mustaine and Ellefson were homeless at the time. Furthermore, guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson would not show up for hours because of their heroin addiction. Shortly after the band finished the final recordings of the album for Combat, they were approached by Tim Carr, an A representative of Capitol Records. After securing a contract with the group, Capitol hired producer Paul Lani to remix the original mixes done by Randy Burns, the previous producer.|$|E
500|$|The alien costume {{featured}} in Night of the Blood Beast {{was the same}} as the one used in another Roger Corman film, Teenage Caveman (1958). [...] This was done to save money, as the Cormans often tried to incorporate existing sets, costumes and other elements from previous films into new ones for financial savings. Varno said the Corman brothers were so conscious of their spending that [...] "'cheap' was the main word in their vocabulary". The monster costume scenes in Teenage Caveman and Night of the Blood Beast were shot within about two weeks of each other. The costume was modified slightly for Blood Beast; Varno claimed somebody on the set said [...] "the nose looks too Jewish", so it was cut down slightly to more resemble a beak. Ross Sturlin wore the costume for the scenes in both Teenage Caveman and Night of the Blood Beast. Filming <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Sturlin because it grew extremely hot inside the costume during the exterior shots. John Mathew Nickolaus, Jr. was director of photography for the film, and Jack Bohrer was the production manager. Daniel Haller, who {{went on to become a}} film director himself, worked as art director on Night of the Blood Beast. Haller did much of the manual construction work on the set himself, and brought a trailer in to the sound stage so he could sleep there and between work sessions. Among the props he built was the rocket-ship, the frame of which was made of plywood that had been cut into circles, then covered with a plastic sheet and spray-painted to look metallic. Haller also created blood cells that the characters looked at under a microscope, and the baby aliens (which resembled seahorses) they looked at under a fluoroscope. Alexander Laszlo composed the music for the film. Almost the entire crew went on to work on Attack of the Giant Leeches with the Corman brothers and Kowalski.|$|E
2500|$|Author Annette Atkins theorizes that Chester Alan Arthur II {{may have}} {{developed}} a [...] "rosebud gathering", or live for the moment attitude about life due to his mother's early death {{at the age of}} 42.
