5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how <b>will</b> <b>these</b> regional powers interact with one another.|$|E
25|$|District heating {{requires}} a long-term financial commitment that fits poorly {{with a focus}} on short-term returns on investment. Benefits to the community include avoided costs of energy through the use of surplus and wasted heat energy, and reduced investment in individual household or building heating equipment. District heating networks, heat-only boiler stations, and cogeneration plants require high initial capital expenditure and financing. Only if considered as long-term investments <b>will</b> <b>these</b> translate into profitable operations for the owners of district heating systems, or combined heat and power plant operators. District heating is less attractive for areas with low population densities, as the investment per household is considerably higher. Also it is less attractive in areas of many small buildings; e.g. detached houses than in areas with a fewer larger buildings; e.g. blocks of flats, because each connection to a single-family house is quite expensive.|$|E

2500|$|Killer {{whales in}} the wild, however, {{are much less}} likely to attack people than are their captive counterparts, who have been known to attack either their {{handlers}} or intruders.

Telephone boxes were introduced in 1925 and pillar type telephone boxes (soon to go nationwide) which could be used by the public in emergencies. These were used in Halifax until 1967. An article headed Police Signals. records that" [...] Lt. Col. Sir Hugh Turnbill, Commissioner of the London City Police, is making full use of electrical devices in connection with his force. He is experimenting with a signaling system in connection with the present ambulance alarm posts. The Journal remarks: Halifax was one of the first towns to introduce this system. When <b>will</b> <b>these</b> who follow the doings of Halifax, as we have wondered before, give Halifax and its Chief Constable the credit that is due in them, and acknowledge Halifax as the very first town to adopt these street signals for the purpose of communicating from headquarters with men on the various beats. There are 24 such lights in operation in Halifax now and the system has been in use for over 20years. It has been a great boon. For instance, before it was introduced, if headquarters wished to pass any kind of information on to the man on duty in the streets it could only be done by messenger, a waste of time and a very cumbrous method compared with that in existence today."

2500|$|VC {{confidence}} {{also showed}} {{in a number}} of attacks against American installations and troops, from assaults against places where US soldiers and advisers gathered, to sinking of an American aviation transport ship, the USS Card at a Saigon berth in 1964. Viet Cong forces also struck hard at American air assets, destroying or damaging large numbers of US aircraft during daring raids at the Bien Hoa in 1964, and Pleiku in 1965. Viet Cong Main Force units were not the only communist forces on the offensive in the early 1960s. In areas near the North Vietnamese border, NVA regulars joined in the assault against South Vietnam with strong conventional units, including divisions like the NVA 304th and 325th, and inflicted severe losses on the ARVN. The communist strategy was to kill as many ARVN effectives as possible, paving the way for a collapse of the South Vietnamese regime before the Americans could arrive in force. In other areas, NVA regulars operated in disguise as [...] "local farmers" [...] - adopting peasant garb like black pajamas and straw hats, and removing manufacturing marks from weapons made in Soviet Bloc countries and shipped to Vietnam. The NVA also positioned numerous base camps near in South Vietnam's borders from which they sallied out to strike at <b>will.</b> <b>These</b> border zone strike forces were soon to clash with the Americans in one of the war's fiercest battles- at a place called the Ia Drang Valley. Total VC/NVA fighting strength is controversially estimated by the American Military Assistance Command- Vietnam (MACV) at around 180,000 men in 1964. Opposing them during the war's early phases were (on paper by various estimates) over 300,000 ARVN troops and a US troop level that stood at around 16,000 in 1964, This was to increase rapidly in later years.|$|E
