25|$|The {{difference}} between the texts <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> from these rival disciples is mainly in their scope, not in essence. While Somananda's Sivadristi has a philosophical bent, Bhatta Kallata's Spanda Karika is more practical and shorter in length.|$|E
25|$|Finance {{should also}} be {{providing}} the information, analysis and advice to enable the organizations’ service managers to operate effectively. This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, how much do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E
25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to all of us here who are their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left,</b> as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Although {{alternative}} {{options to}} {{doing business with}} China are few for the business sector, many companies large and small, including within the important financial sector, are uneasy about the changing political climate. The head of the one business association in Hong Kong said: [...] "The middle-class, the professionals, even the accountants: people are just freaked out {{about what is going}} on... The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> is our legal system, but people fear that this may be under attack too". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: [...] "The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [...] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong".|$|E
500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E
2500|$|All: Most merciful God, we {{confess that}} we are by nature sinful and unclean. We have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed, by {{what we have done}} and by what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> undone. [...] We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We justly deserve Your present and eternal punishment. For the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your ways to the glory of your Holy Name. Amen.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the play which has {{provoked}} critical disagreement is the character of Montague. He is introduced in Act 1, Scene 1 as a Yorkist supporter who fought at the Battle of St Albans (dramatised {{at the end of}} 2 Henry VI), and he accompanies York, Richard, Edward, Warwick and Norfolk from the battlefield to London in pursuit of Henry, Margaret and Clifford. In Act 1, Scene 2, upon realising that Margaret is set to attack, York sends Montague to London to get Warwick; [...] "My brother Montague shall post to London./Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest/Whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> protectors of the King,/With powerful policy strengthen themselves" [...] (ll.55–58). Montague duly leaves, and when Warwick returns in Act 2, Scene 1, he is accompanied by a character called Montague, but who he introduces as an apparently new character; [...] "...Therefore Warwick came to seek you out,/And therefore comes my brother Montague." [...] (ll.166–167).|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with GameSpot in April, Kopiński stated [...] "the time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> until release will be spent perfecting players' experience of the wildest West ever created." [...] He explained Techland didn't initially plan on making a game that dealt with the American Civil War. It was only when they counted back from Billy's story in the original game that they realized a prequel would coincide with that period of history. Once they made that realization, they embraced it, with Kopiński pointing out [...] "war and its aftermath bring out the worst in people, pushing them to their limits and pitting individuals against a new, transformed reality. War serves as a catalyst and an excuse for the McCall brothers. It sets in motion {{a chain of events}} that leads Thomas and Ray across America in their quest." [...] He also said the time period of the game allowed the developers to use specific groups of real life people in an historically accurate manner, such as the Apache, the Comanche, the Navajo and the Pinkertons. However, he confessed that in some areas, the game did take liberties with historical actuality; ...|$|E
