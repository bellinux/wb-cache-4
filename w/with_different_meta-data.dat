40|$|Background: Protein-protein {{interaction}} (PPI) network {{analyses are}} highly valuable in deciphering {{and understanding the}} intricate organisation of cellular functions. Nevertheless, the majority of available protein-protein interaction networks are context-less, i. e. without any reference to the spatial, temporal or physiological conditions in which the interactions may occur. In this work, we are proposing a protocol to infer the most likely protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in human macrophages. Results: We integrated the PPI dataset from the Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer (APID) <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>meta-data</b> to infer a contextualized macrophage-specific interactome {{using a combination of}} statistical methods. The obtained interactome is enriched in experimentally verified interactions and in proteins involved in macrophage-related biological processes (i. e. immune response activation, regulation of apoptosis). As a case study, we used the contextualized interactome to highlight the cellular processes induced upon Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: Our work confirms that contextualizing interactomes improves the biological significance of bioinformatic analyses. More specifically, studying such inferred network rather than focusing at the gene expression level only, is informative on the processes involved in the host response. Indeed, important immune features such as apoptosis are solely highlighted when the spotlight is on the protein interaction level...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Efficient {{retrieval}} of multi-media content {{depends on the}} availability of adequate meta-data to indicate the nature of the content. Such meta-data often contains useful hierarchical categorisation but is frequently not consistent between different sources. We outline a method to identify equivalent instances which are described by <b>different</b> <b>meta-data</b> schemata, and to find correspondences between hierarchies, which may be used to improve instance matching. Some successful initial tests of the method on large movie databases are reported. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{performing}} data analysis is steadily rising. As a consequence, {{people of different}} profiles (i. e., non-experienced users) have started to analyze their data. However, this is challenging for them. A key step that poses difficulties and determines {{the success of the}} analysis is data mining (model/algorithm selection problem). Meta-learning is a technique used for assisting non-expert users in this step. The effectiveness of meta-learning is, however, largely dependent on the description/characterization of datasets (i. e., meta-features used for meta-learning). There is a need for improving the effectiveness of meta-learning by identifying and designing more predictive meta-features. In this work, we use a method from exploratory factor analysis to study the predictive power of different meta-features collected in OpenML, which is a collaborative machine learning platform that is designed to store and organize meta-data about datasets, data mining algorithms, models and their evaluations. We first use the method to extract latent features, which are abstract concepts that group together meta-features with common characteristics. Then, we study and visualize the relationship of the latent features <b>with</b> three <b>different</b> performance measures of four classification algorithms on hundreds of datasets available in OpenML, and we select the latent features with the highest predictive power. Finally, we use the selected latent features to perform meta-learning and we show that our method improves the meta-learning process. Furthermore, we design an easy to use application for retrieving <b>different</b> <b>meta-data</b> from OpenML as the biggest source of data in this domain.
