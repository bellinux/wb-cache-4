5|$|The political, {{social, and}} {{economic}} crises also touched {{the issue of}} who would succeed Houphouët-Boigny as head of state. After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe Yacé in 1980, who, {{as president of the}} National Assembly, was entitled to exercise the full functions of President of the Republic if the Head of State was incapacitated or absent, Houphouët-Boigny delayed {{as much as he could}} in officially designating a successor. The president's health became increasingly fragile, with Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> was hospitalised in France. There was a struggle for power, which ended when Houphouët-Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan Bédié, the President of the National Assembly. In December 1993, Houphouët-Boigny, terminally ill with prostate cancer, was urgently flown back to Côte d'Ivoire so he could die there. He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined. After his family consented, Houphouët-Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6:35am GMT on 7 December. At the time of his death, Houphouët-Boigny was the longest-serving leader in Africa and the third in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea.|$|E

25|$|The Singapore {{system of}} government, as {{with those of}} a number of other Commonwealth jurisdictions, {{exhibits}} a partial separation of powers. The Cabinet is a parliamentary executive as the Prime Minister and other ministers are drawn from the Members of Parliament (MPs).

5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a <b>President</b> (<b>the</b> Council <b>President)</b> and Prime Minister (<b>the</b> Commission <b>President).</b> However, unlike <b>the</b> French model, <b>the</b> Council <b>President</b> does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence <b>while</b> <b>the</b> Council <b>President</b> may have prestige, it would lack power and <b>while</b> <b>the</b> Commission <b>President</b> would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|R
