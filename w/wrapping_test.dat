In this study, we evaluated {{the performance of}} five different grades of Kimguard One-Step sterilisation wrap after prion sterilisation cycle (134 °C for 18 minutes) using the final pack test method. Kimguard One-Step grades KC 100, KC 200, KC 300, KC 400 and KC 500 were used to wrap a 1 / 1 DIN steel wire instrument tray (internal volume of 7. 2 L) and each <b>wrapped</b> <b>test</b> pack was challenged with 100, 000 1 μm latex particles delivered at an air flow rate of 250 mL/min during a 25 -minute test period. For each grade of wrap, particle filtration efficiency measurements were carried out sixfold after sterilisation and repeated after test pack storage for three months. At both time points, particle counts within the <b>wrapped</b> <b>test</b> packs were negligible and yielded mean particle retention rates for all five grades of sterilisation wrap of ≥ 99. 99 %. From these results, we conclude that the microbial barrier effectiveness of Kimguard One-Step sterilisation wraps KC 100, KC 200, KC 300, KC 400 and KC 500 remains unaffected by prevacuum steam sterilisation at 134 °C for 18 minutes, or by subsequent storage for three months with regular movement of packs during storage...|$|R

A new test scheduling algorithm, which facilitates a concurrent test of both unwrapped logic blocks and IEEE 1500 -wrapped cores, is proposed, and experiments show that it outperforms a previous approach when the available number of tester channels and/or the number of unwrapped logic blocks are small.

40|$|The use {{of steel}} {{reinforcement}} in concrete construction {{has proven to}} be very effective due to the excellent properties that the reinforcing steel has that compliment the concrete properties, for example increase in tensile strength and ductility. However, one of the drawbacks of steel is its long-term behaviour especially in areas where the humidity is high. In such areas, the steel usually suffers from rust and oxidation which eventually lead to the deterioration of the concrete structure. One method to reduce this effect is to protect the reinforcing bars, for example wrapping or using cathodic protection. This paper investigates the behaviour of reinforced concrete columns reinforced with FRP both in the vertical and horizontal directions. As most columns are subject to a combination of axial forces and bending moments, the experimental programme presented in this paper is for columns that are eccentrically loaded. A total of twelve specimens were cast and tested. This paper experimentally investigates the performance of high strength concrete (HSC) columns confined with vertically and horizontally oriented carbon fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) <b>wrapping,</b> <b>tested</b> under eccentric loads. Previous studies have proven that HSC columns confined by FRPs have had positive effects under concentric and eccentric loading, however little is known about vertically oriented FRPs. The effectiveness of wrapping concrete elements, for example beams and columns have been proven by several researchers. Several studies have reported on testing reinforced concrete columns wrapped with different types of FRP. With the exception of few studies, (for example [1 - 5]) most of the studies are based on testing columns under concentric loads. It is clear {{that there is a need}} to investigate the behaviour of columns under eccentric loads as most of the columns in buildings, especially at the edge and corner of buildings are subject to eccentric uniaxial or biaxial loading. The aim of this paper is to investigate the behaviour of concrete columns reinforced with vertical FRP straps and wrapped with FRP under the application of an eccentric axial load...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on the use of crumb rubber to replace aggregates in producing concrete (i. e. rubber concrete).

This paper presents results from a series of axial compression tests on FRP-confined rubber concrete, of which 50 % of the fine aggregates was replaced with crumb rubber. The main test variable was the thickness of the FRP <b>wrap.</b> The <b>test</b> results show that: (1) the concrete strength loss caused by the use of crumb rubber can be compensated by the use of FRP confinement; and (2) the effect of FRP thickness on the behavior of rubber concrete is similar to that on natural aggregate concrete...|$|R

40|$|Alkali {{aggregate}} reaction (AAR) is {{a chemical}} reaction between alkali in the pore solution of cement paste and reactive forms of silica in the aggregate, which {{can reduce the}} durability and mechanical strength of concrete.

40|$|The Aharonov-Bohm {{effect has}} been invoked {{to probe the}} phase {{structure}} of a gauge theory. Yet {{in the case of}} non-Abelian gauge theories, it proves difficult to formulate a general procedure that unambiguously specifies the realization of the gauge symmetry, e. g. the unbroken subgroup. In this paper, we propose a set of order parameters that will do the job. We articulate the fact that any useful Aharonov-Bohm experiment necessarily proceeds in two stages: calibration and measurement. World sheets of virtual cosmic string loops can <b>wrap</b> around <b>test</b> charges, thus changing their states relative to other charges in the universe. Consequently, repeated flux measurements with test charges will not necessarily agree. This was the main stumbling block to previous attempts to construct order parameters for non-Abelian gauge theories. In those works, the particles that one uses for calibration and subsequent measurement are stored in separate "boxes". By storing all test particles in the same "box", we show how quantum fluctuations can be overcome. The importance of gauge fixing is also emphasized. Comment: How quantum fluctuations destroy the coherence between various strings are discussed explicitly. That linked Wilson loops are useful order parameters for a Maxwell- Chern-Simons-Higgs theory is noted. The generality of our results is emphasized.

40|$|Concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes (CFFTs) are an {{attractive}} form of hybrid compression members incorporating FRP. CFFTs have several advantages over traditional column forms, including their excellent corrosion resistance and ductility. Much {{research has been}} conducted on CFFTs over recent years, but no systematic experimental study has been concerned with the cyclic axial compressive behavior of CFFTs with a filament-wound FRP tube; such studies are needed {{for the development of a}} cyclic stress-strain model for the concrete in CFFTs. This paper therefore presents an experimental study on the behavior of circular CFFTs under cyclic axial compression. The experimental program included the strength of concrete as a key variable so that it also provides a much needed supplement to the very limited existing research on the cyclic compressive behavior of FRP-confined high-strength concrete (HSC). The test results are compared with a monotonic stress-strain model and a cyclic stress-strain model for FRP-confined concrete, both of which have been based on test databases that are limited to concrete confined with an FRP wrap and include only a small number of tests for HSC. The test results show that the cyclic axial stress-strain behavior of concrete in CFFTs is generally similar to that of concrete confined by an FRP <b>wrap.</b> The <b>test</b> results also show that the monotonic stress-strain model perform reasonably well for HSC in CFFTs, but revisions to the cyclic stress-strain model are needed before it can provide accurate predictions for HSC in cyclically loaded CFFTs.

The confining stress is {{shown to be a}} result of the composite wrap restricting the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s expansion of the core when it is placed under an applied axial load. The lateral stress is therefore found to maintain a constant ratio to the axial stress, or a constant biaxiality ratio, for an elastic core material. These specimens are subjected to both quasi-static and dynamic high strain rate loading in order to measure the change in strength of the base material {{as a function of the}} confining stress. The experimental results are used to demonstrate the potential performance and weight savings of this confinement technique over traditional mechanical or heat shrink methods. An analysis is performed to identify the role of key core and wrap parameters that determine the ultimate strength of brittle materials confined in this fashion and to identify an accurate means of estimating the confined state of stress. The Mohr-Coulomb criterion is evaluated as a possible option for modeling the observed strength but is shown to have some deficiencies in reproducing portions of the experimental data. A fracture mechanics based model is then presented which empirically relates the observed ultimate strength data to the estimated confining stress.
