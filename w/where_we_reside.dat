60|$|Tumblers, hand-organists, puppet-showmen, bagpipers, and {{all such}} vagrant mirth-makers, are very {{numerous}} {{in the streets}} of London. The other day, passing through Fleet Street, I saw a crowd filling up a narrow court, and high above their heads a tumbler, standing on his head, {{on the top of a}} pole, that reached as high as the third story of the neighboring Houses. Sliding down the pole head foremost, he disappeared out of my sight. A multitude of Punches go the mounds continually. Two have passed through Hanover Street, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>reside,</b> this morning. The first asked two shillings for his performance; so we sent him away. The second demanded, in the first place, half a crown; but finally consented to take a shilling, and gave us the show at that price, though much maimed in its proportions. Besides the spectators in our windows, he had a little crowd on the sidewalk, to whom he went round for contributions, but I did not observe that anybody gave him so much as a halfpenny. It is strange to see how many people are aiming at the small change in your pocket. In every square a beggar-woman meets you, and turns back to follow your steps with her miserable murmur. At the street-crossings there are old men or little girls with their brooms; urchins propose to brush your boots; and if you get into a cab, a man runs to open the door for you, and touches his hat for a fee, as he closes it again.|$|E
50|$|On Schoener’s 1523 and 1530 globes, AMERICA {{is shown}} {{as a part}} of Asia, as he {{explained}} in the Opusculum Geographicum:After Ptolemy, many regions to the east beyond 180 degrees were discovered by Marco Polo the Venetian, and others, but now having been discovered by the Genoese Columbus and Americo Vespucci reaching only the coastal parts of those lands from Spain across the Western Ocean, were considered by them to be an island which they called America, the fourth part of the globe. But by the most recent voyages made in the year 1519 after Christ by Magellan leading ships of the Invincible Divine Charles etc. to the Moluccas Islands, which others call Maluquas, situated in the Far East, they have found that land to be the continent of Upper India, which is a part of Asia. The globe of 1515 owes an obvious debt to the Waldseemüller map of 1507, which in turn was derived from the globe constructed in Nuremberg in 1492 by Martin Behaim. Schöner’s 1515 globe follows these in representing India Superior (eastern Asia, called India superior sive orientalis in the Luculentissima) as extending to around longitude 270° East. Westward from Spain, the discoveries of Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci and the other Spanish and Portuguese navigators are represented as a long, narrow strip of lands stretching from about latitude 50° North to about 40° South. The western coasts of these lands, America in the south and Parias in the north, are labelled Terra ultra incognita ("Land beyond unknown") and Vlterius incognita terra ("Land further beyond unknown"), indicating it was unknown how far westward they extended. The sea to the west of these lands is labelled Oceanus orientalis indianus (Eastern Indian Ocean), in accordance with the conclusion reached by Columbus after his third voyage of 1496-1498, when he encountered the South American mainland, which he called a Nuevo Mundo and identified with Marco Polo’s “greatest island in the world”, Java Major, lying south west of the India Superior province of Ciamba (Champa). Reflecting this concept, Schöner explained in another of his writings, the Opusculum Geographicum (cap.xx): “the Genoese Columbus and Americo Vespucci reaching only the coastal parts of those lands from Spain across the Western Ocean, considered them to be an island which they called America”. Or, as Nicolaus Copernicus put it in De Revolutionibus (lib.I, cap.iii): Ptolemy extended the habitable area halfway around the world, leaving beyond it unknown land, where the moderns have added Cathay and very extensive regions as far as 60 degrees of longitude, so that now a greater longitude of land is inhabited than is left for the Ocean. Moreover, to this should be added the great islands discovered in our time under the Princes of Spain and Portugal, especially America, named after the captain of the ship who discovered it and thought because of its yet hidden size to be another world, besides many other islands heretofore unknown, which we do not wonder to regard as being the Antipodes or Antichthones. Where Schöner departs most conspicuously from Waldseemüller is in his globe’s depiction of an Antarctic continent, called by him Brasilie Regio. His continent is based, however tenuously, on the report of an actual voyage: that of the Portuguese merchants Nuno Manuel and Cristóvão de Haro to the River Plate, and related in the Newe Zeytung auss Presillg Landt (“New Tidings from the Land of Brazil”) published in Augsburg in 1514. The Zeytung described the Portuguese voyagers passing through a strait between the southernmost point of America, or Brazil, and a land to the south west, referred to as vndtere Presill or Brasilia inferior. This supposed “strait” was in fact the Rio de la Plata (and/or eventually the San Matias Gulf). By “vndtere Presill”, the Zeytung meant that part of Brazil in the lower latitudes, but Schöner mistook it to mean the land on the southern side of the “strait”, in higher latitudes, and so gave to it the opposite meaning. On this slender foundation he constructed his circum-Antarctic continent to which, for reasons that he does not explain he gave an annular, or ring shape. In the Luculentissima he explained: The Portuguese, thus, sailed around this region, the Brasilie Regio, and discovered the passage very similar to that of our Europe (<b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>reside)</b> and situated laterally between east and west. From one side the land on the other is visible; and the cape of this region about 60 miles away, much as if one were sailing eastward through the Straits of Gibraltar or Seville and Barbary or Morocco in Africa, as our Globe shows toward the Antarctic Pole. Further, the distance is only moderate from this Region of Brazil to Malacca, where St. Thomas was crowned with martyrdom. On this scrap of information, united with the concept of the Antipodes inherited from Graeco-Roman antiquity, Schöner constructed his representation of the southern continent. His strait served as inspiration for Ferdinand Magellan’s expedition to reach the Moluccas by a westward route. He took Magellan’s discovery of Tierra del Fuego in 1520 as further confirmation of its existence, and on his globes of 1523 and 1533 he described it as TERRA AVSTRALIS RECENTER INVENTA SED NONDUM PLENE COGNITA(“Terra Australis, recently discovered but not yet fully known”). It was taken up by his followers, the French cosmographer Oronce Fine in his world map of 1531, and the Flemish cartographers Gerard Mercator in 1538 and Abraham Ortelius in 1570. Schöner’s concepts influenced the Dieppe maps makers, notably in their representation of Jave la Grande. Subsequent generations of map-makers and geographic theorists continued to elaborate the image of a vast and wealthy Terra Australis to tempt the cupidity of merchants and statesmen.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project explores the negative {{environmental impacts of}} anthropogenic debris by investigating these found materials within the medium of contemporary jewellery objects. Contemporary jewellery objects are a powerful artistic medium. We can wear jewellery on our bodies and carry it with us. Jewellery can sit on or through the body, {{and at the same}} time extend beyond our bodies. Jewellery objects can resonate their own space, to be watched, observed publicly or privately, inviting the wearer or voyeur to think, to enquire, to remember and to investigate. Jewellery objects arouse curiosity, can whisper, shout out or call irresistibly to be touched or held. Or these jewellery objects can speak without words in a universal language. As contemporary jewellery objects, they offer a new way in which to present the serious global issue of anthropogenic debris both marine and land-based. This selected interactive medium offers more than words, spreadsheets or diagrams on what has become an area of global scientific investigation, with current information on the quantities and distribution of anthropogenic debris across Australia limited and inconclusive. This project enables a personal collection of data from an Australian perspective that would traditionally be presented within the scientific community, to be shared with the jewellery community and wider general public as a three-dimensional {{research project}}. It allows this personal investigation to highlight how what we discard on a daily basis travels far and wide, impacting the environment, and therefore ourselves. This research is about ordinary, everyday materials presented to all who use and discard them. Through a body of work constructed entirely from discarded anthropogenic marine and land-based materials collected along Victorian, New South Wales and Western Australia coastal environs, this research aims to re-engage ourselves with the objects we use and discard on a daily basis to highlight these unsustainable ecological concerns. This project explores material and conceptual relationships between natural and built environs to form connections to and an understanding of <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>reside</b> within them, and how the influx of anthropogenic materials in the form of contemporary jewellery objects might incite references to natural places in lieu of natural materials traditionally associated with these areas as a second nature with underlying ecological concerns. This research seeks to offer conceptual contemplation within a body of work constructed entirely with anthropogenic debris as discarded materials that are subject to negative connotations, how they present themselves as a reflection of our material culture and as the heirlooms of our past, present and future, as remains to be seen, worn and heard...|$|E

40|$|In New Zealand the {{prevalence}} of stroke in children is extremely rare. Medical specialists and health care practitioners possess a knowledge, whilst their patients possess a specific knowledge acquired {{over the course of}} their illness. The patient’s voice needs to be heard without the arbitration of a medical discourse. It is essential that a discursive space is found for the vocalization of the stories bound up within the statistics, facts and figures of the medical narrative. But how? I respond to this by blending our personal stories with academic writing in order to explore an adolescent’s experience of stroke, and our lives which have been interrupted by chronic illness, and disability. I adopt collaborative autoethnography as a methodology for this research. Collaborative autoethnography offers a valuable vehicle when writing about illness as it allows for the creation of multiple spaces. As the researcher, I am the observed and observer, the narrator and narrated, I am an insider as well as an outsider, I am both believer and non- believer, doubted and doubter. I am able to occupy these and inbetween spaces. This diversity affords me the opportunity to create a discursive space to explore the problematics of representation. I am also able to develop alternative ways of storytelling so that I may capture the deeply complex, nuanced and dynamic experiences of chronic illness and disability. As a feminist engaging with autoethnography’s somewhat postmodernist flavour I have finally been able to tell my story and conceptualise my experiences. Previously I had been unable to articulate my story as I did not truly understand my story due to traditional medical knowledge not allowing a space for placing it authentically within my understanding. This research tackles how the researcher mother can capture both hers and her son’s story, whilst also reflexively revealing the experiences of chronic illness and disability. Furthermore, can this type of research be undertaken ethically? Where does my story end and his begin? How do I voice my son’s story? Is he the hero, the survivor, the disabled, the victim, the triumphant, or other? How am I positioned as the woman, the mother, and the chronically ill patient? Are we well or are we afflicted, and which spaces do we occupy? If we oscillate between the two how do I describe <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>reside?</b> Do we stay in the frightening no-man’s land or do we move between spaces with an acceptance that there are no absolutes or certainties? And if so, is this not dissimilar to the life journey that all people travel? This research tackles an array of questions; however it is also aimed at raising consciousness that within the state of chronic illness and disability alternative voices and spaces can be found. Moreover, these stories serve as both an academic tool and as a political protest performance by challenging conventional thinking and the medical paradigm which appears at times, paralysed. This work illustrates that although writing stories about chronic illness and disability is deeply nuanced and complex, viewing chronic illness and disability as a fluid concept not bound within a Cartesian dualism of socially constructed norms of illness and health, and normal and abnormal is crucial. This notion proposes an extension beyond traditional binary epistemologies, and suggests a perviousness between bodies, an interconnectedness of other, both within and with other. This idea includes the essential relationship between the embodied subject and their world, and that an individual may hold dual citizenship as they develop in the world with others...|$|E

In {{order to}} study {{whether there is}} any {{correlation}} between nuclear activities, gas content, and the environment <b>where</b> galaxies <b>reside,</b> <b>we</b> have obtained optical and millimetric spectra for a well-dened sample of intermediate Hubble type spirals in dense environments and in the eld. We found that these spirals in dense environments have on average: less molecular gas per blue luminosity, a higher atomic gas fraction, lower current star formation rate, and the same star formation eciency as eld galaxies. Although none of these results stands out as a single strong diagnostic given their statistical signicance, taken together they indicate a trend for diminished gas content and star-formation activity in galaxies in high-density environments. Our results suggest that galaxies in dense environments have either (i) consumed their molecular gas via star formation in the past or (ii) that dense environments leads to an inhibition of molecular gas from atomic phase. The similarities in star-formation eciency of the dense environments and eld galaxies suggest that the physical processes controling the formation of stars from the molecular gas are local rather than global.

Non Uniform Cache Architectures (NUCA) has been introduced {{to deal with this}} problem. This memory organization divides the whole memory space into smaller pieces or banks allowing nearer banks to have better access latencies than further banks. Moreover, an adaptive replacement policy that efficiently reduces misses in the last-level cache could boost performance, particularly if set associativity is assumed. Unfortunately, traditional replacement policies do not behave properly as they were assumed for single-processors. This paper focuses on Bank Replacement. This policy involves three key decisions when there is a miss: where to place a data within the cache set, which data to evict from the cache set and finally, where to place the evicted data. We propose a novel replacement technique that enables more intelligent replacement decisions to be taken, based on the observation that some type of data are less commonly accessed depending of the bank <b>where</b> they <b>reside.</b> <b>We</b> call this technique as LRU-PEA (Least Recently Used with a Priority Eviction Approach).

Studies claim that NM 1 and Myo 1 C are nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, respectively. Therefore, researchers thought that NM 1 translocates into nucleus via nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its N-terminal extension. However, here we show that NLS is placed within second IQ domain where calmodulin (CaM) binds in a calcium- dependent manner. Since both NM 1 and Myo 1 C have identical neck domains <b>where</b> NLS <b>resides,</b> <b>we</b> have confirmed that both myosin isoforms localize to nucleus. Based on findings indicating Myo 1 C binding to phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) via its tail domain, we tested if NM 1 and Myo 1 C can interact with PIP 2 in the nucleus. We show that both isoforms can bind to PIP 2 via their tail domains, and interactions with PIP 2 can recruit other nuclear proteins into this lipo-protein complex. PIP 2 makes complex with a subset of Pol I transcription and processing machinery proteins and modulate their functions in the nucleolus.
