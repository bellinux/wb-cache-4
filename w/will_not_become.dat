5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E

The NHLPA announced that ratification voting would start at 8 pm (EST) Thursday (January 10, 2013) and will continue for 36 hours through Saturday (January 12, 2013) at 8 am (EST). On January 12, 2013 the NHLPA announced that the union had voted to ratify the new CBA with the NHL, but the new CBA <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> official until the NHL and the NHLPA sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Later that same day both the NHL and the NHLPA announced that both sides signed the MOU reflecting the terms of the new 10-year CBA officially ending the lockout and announcing a 720-game (48 per team) regular-season schedule will begin on January 19, 2013.|$|E

Collins (1991) suggests therapy targeting attainable goals that will have {{the greatest impact on}} an individual’s daily life, such as getting reliable yes/no answers or providing the patient gestures. Individuals with global aphasia usually respond well to treatment that includes personally relevant information, which is also important to consider for therapy.|$|E

At Leeds Crown Court the same day, Mr Justice Openshaw sentenced Griffiths to life imprisonment with a whole life order, meaning he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> eligible for parole {{and is likely to}} spend the rest of his life in prison. While in prison, Griffiths has attempted suicide on several occasions. He has also been on a 2-month hunger strike, during which time he avoided contact with other people.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors of}} this study believe that the {{mentioned}} agricultural crisis will only begin to affect us after 2020, and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> critical until 2050. The oncoming peaking of global oil production (and subsequent decline of production), along with the peak of North American natural gas production will very likely precipitate this agricultural crisis much sooner than expected. Geologist Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before.|$|E

If they ever wish to reside permanently in the Commonwealth, they may do so, but are sterilized so they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> have a next generation.

He spends some quality time with her, and convinces her to join the group. Unfortunately, the friendship is short-lived when Asami becomes trapped while attempting to save a boy in the parking lot. She shouts for Kohta {{to make it so}} that she <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> a zombie and cause pain to others around her. Kohta kills her and later finds himself in shock, but he is set straight by Shizuka, who uses a psychology trick of ordering him around like a sergeant.|$|E
25|$|Religious persons acquire {{religious}} {{ideas and}} practices through social exposure. The {{child of a}} Zen Buddhist <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> an evangelical Christian or a Zulu warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a Roman Catholic but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required – this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says cognitive science can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations {{and in so doing}} enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{first public}} {{election}} debate between {{the leaders of}} the seven largest parties was held on 29 October 2006, on public radio. Mark Rutte, whose VVD is junior partner in the third Balkenende cabinet of CDA prime-minister Jan Peter Balkenende, was worried that the CDA will choose for a coalition with the PvdA after the elections, as this, {{at the time of the}} debate, was the only two-party coalition possible according to polls. Balkenende, however, kept his options open, and did not rule out a coalition with the PvdA. The PvdA's Wouter Bos stated that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> a deputy prime-minister in case Balkenende leads a CDA-PvdA coalition. He will then remain as chairman of the parliamentary party.|$|E

To convert the working class to Marxism, Lenin insists that Marxists should form a political party, or [...] "vanguard", of dedicated revolutionaries to spread Marxist political ideas among the workers. The pamphlet precipitated in part the split of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) between Lenin's Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.|$|R

In other words, it is the response of a reasonable person to a foreseeable risk. The {{standard of}} care naturally varies over time, and is effected by circumstantial factors. Thus, when a {{standard of care}} is established in one case, it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> automatically <b>become</b> a precedent for another - each case is judged on its own facts.|$|R
5000|$|The Vice Chancellor <b>will</b> <b>not</b> {{automatically}} <b>become</b> Chancellor for {{the rest}} of the term if the Chancellor dies or becomes unable to fulfill his or her duties in any other way. It is the [...] President who asks a minister (normally the minister who is Vice Chancellor) to fulfill the Chancellor's duties until the Bundestag elects a new Chancellor. This has happened only once: Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel was acting Chancellor for a few days in May 1974 between Chancellor Willy Brandt’s resignation and Helmut Schmidt’s election.|$|R
25|$|Mostly, {{a year is}} a {{leap year}} if it is evenly {{divisible}} by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that a year divisible by four is a leap year. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this leap year problem including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998. For information on why century years are treated differently, see Gregorian calendar.|$|E
