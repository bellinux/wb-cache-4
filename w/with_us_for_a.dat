2500|$|Composite {{sketches}} {{of these individuals}} were created by the Los Angeles Police Department from descriptions created {{with the cooperation of}} a witness from Montreal who had known Jurvetson prior to her departure to California. This individual reiterated to investigators the fact Reet had met [...] "Jean" [...] while she had worked in Toronto, and also stated she had specifically traveled to California to meet with this individual after his own previous departure from Montreal. This witness has also stated this individual had been a medical student who had closely resembled Doors singer and songwriter Jim Morrison. Furthermore, witnesses recall this man had a slight French accent. The second individual considered [...] "of interest" [...] to the Los Angeles Police Department in their investigation into Reet Jurvetson's murder is the first suspect's likely roommate: a man with a Beatles-style haircut, possibly also named [...] "Jean", who is known to have informed a close friend of Reet in the spring of 1970 that he and the first suspect had lived with Reet in Los Angeles the previous year. This individual had claimed Reet had left the two men of her own volition; he had also made brief attempts to assure Reet's close friend she (Reet) had not been in any form of danger when she had left the two men, making a statement to the effect of: [...] "Oh yeah, she was <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of weeks and then she left on her own and everything's fine. She was happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, {{which at the time}} we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 15 November 2010. In addition, Egan fully expressed what he felt on during recording Gravity: [...] "It’s hard to believe this is our 11th album but performing is our passion and it would seem like throwing it all away if we stopped."“Both us and Take That go for epic pop songs but them taking Robbie back hasn’t made us think about Brian McFadden returning. It would feel odd to have a fifth person back on stage with us". In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} him for a long time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he said yes to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals. On 22 October 2010, Shanks stated that they have finished the Westlife record, all approved by Cowell. Shanks stated that the album ended up with two covers in it. On 27 October 2010, the album main release date was changed to 22 November 2010. On 25 October 2010, Feehily unveiled the final track listing on his official Twitter page as follows: On 1 November 2010, Mark confirmed the two cover songs on the album are, [...] "Chances" [...] by Athlete and [...] "The Reason" [...] by Hoobastank. In the November 2010 issue of Hello Magazine they told them about their competition with Take That and Walsh and Cowell's involvement in the album, [...] "You need competition to keep you on your toes".|$|E
