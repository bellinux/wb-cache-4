5|$|In June the {{subcommittee}} met {{to mark up}} the bill. Bordallo's amendment tightening the language prohibiting vessel transport of fins <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> voice vote. A week later the full committee, after adding an amendment by Faleomavaega requiring that fins {{be attached to the}} carcasses, sent the bill to the full House. In July it <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> voice vote and referred to the Senate, where it was sponsored by John Kerry of Massachusetts. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. No further action was taken before the 110th Congress adjourned, and the bill died.|$|E

50|$|Put another way, a {{carefully}} written test program can report on whether parameters <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> value or reference, and if used, {{what sort of}} copy-in and copy-out scheme. However, variation is endless: simple parameters might <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> copy whereas large aggregates such as arrays might <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> reference; simple constants such as zero might be generated by special machine codes (such as Clear, or LoadZ) while more complex constants might be stored in memory tagged as read-only with any attempt at modifying it resulting in immediate program termination, etc.|$|R

5|$|On lap167, {{the thirteenth}} caution {{was caused by}} Keselowski colliding into the wall. The {{accident}} also involved Smith and Logano. At the lap170 restart, Hamlin was the leader, but on the following lap he <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Earnhardt, Jr.|$|E
5|$|On the 368th lap, Hornish, spun on the backstraightway, {{prompting}} the ninth and final caution of the race. During the caution, {{some of the}} leaders made pit stops. Johnson maintained the lead on the lap 373. Four laps later, Newman passed Mears for eighth, as Edwards <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Stewart for twelfth. On the 383rd lap, Kahne, Allemndinger and Stewart passed Newman for seventh, eighth and ninth respectively. On the next lap, Kenseth <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Martin for second position. On the 391st lap, Kahne <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Allmendinger for the second position. Two laps later, Johnson's lead had increased to 2.2 seconds and held it to win the race. Martin finished second, ahead of Kenseth in third, Montoya fourth, and Kurt Busch fifth. Gordon, Allmendinger, Kahne, Stewart and Newman rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E
5000|$|... {{has named}} {{parameters}} called keywords which <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> reference.|$|R
5000|$|Parameter modes are {{a form of}} denotational semantics, {{stating the}} programmer's intent and {{allowing}} compilers to catch errors and apply optimizations - they do not necessarily imply operational semantics (how the parameter passing actually occurs). Notably, while input parameters can be implemented by call by value, and output and input/output parameters by call by reference - {{and this is a}} straightforward way to implement these modes in languages without built-in support - this is not always how they are implemented. This distinction is discussed in detail in the Ada '83 Rationale, which emphasizes that the parameter mode is abstracted from which parameter <b>passing</b> mechanism (<b>by</b> reference or by copy) is actually implemented. For instance, while in C# input parameters (default, no keyword) <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> value, and output and input/output parameters ( [...] and [...] ) <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> reference, in PL/SQL input parameters (...) <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> reference, and output and input/output parameters ( [...] and [...] ) <b>are</b> <b>by</b> default <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> value and the result copied back, but can <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> reference by using the [...] compiler hint.|$|R

5|$|On the {{following}} lap, Earnhardt, Jr. overtook Bowyer {{for the first}} position. On lap82, McMurray reclaimed the first position, as Smith made a pit stop. After leading one lap, McMurray <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Ryan Newman and Logano. On the 86th lap, Martin Truex, Jr., with assistance from Carl Edwards, became the leader before Bowyer and Burton passed them on lap87. Five laps later, Kurt Busch reclaimed the first position as Smith moved into second. On lap94, Burton's engine failed, but no caution was given. Two laps later, Robby Gordon became the leader, after having assistance from Bayne. On the 100th lap, McMurray reclaimed the first position. On {{the following}} lap, Newman became the leader, but after four laps, Gordon passed him for the position. On lap107, the eighth caution was given after Montoya spun following a bump from teammate McMurray. During the caution all the drivers made pit stops, with Gordon reclaiming the lead afterward. On lap110, Kurt Busch moved to the first position, but after four laps, he <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Bowyer. Bowyer <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Truex two laps later on lap116, but Truex, Jr. himself <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Busch on the next lap.|$|E
5|$|Two {{counties}} were {{proposed in}} Florida's state legislature, but neither actually became counties.

5|$|Bordallo reintroduced it, as amended, at the {{beginning}} of the next Congress. It gained 30 cosponsors, bypassed the committee stage and <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> voice vote in March 2009. Kerry reintroduced it in the Senate a month later; it eventually gained 33 cosponsors there. The Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard held hearings on the bill in June.|$|E

5|$|In 1897, {{an amateur}} American {{mathematician}} attempted {{to persuade the}} Indiana legislature to pass the Indiana Pi Bill, which described a method to square the circle and contained text that implied various incorrect values for , including 3.2. The bill is notorious {{as an attempt to}} establish a value of scientific constant by legislative fiat. The bill <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> the Indiana House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate, meaning it did not become a law.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, NPVIC {{legislation}} {{was introduced in}} 42 states.

5|$|In March 2007, a {{proposal}} to establish a station at Valby, where the Carlsberg Group is planning an urban redevelopment, was scrapped. The proposal would have increased construction costs by DKK900million and was deemed not economical. The increased cost was, in part, due to an extra TBM being needed to complete the project on time. The City Circle Line <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> parliament on 1 June 2007, with only the Red–Green Alliance voting in disfavor.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch won {{the pole}} {{position}}, which he held for 20 laps until he <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Edwards. He held the lead {{until the first}} green-flag pit stops and regained the position after the stops ended. Busch retook the lead on lap 81 and held it until he <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Matt Kenseth. Jeff Gordon took over the lead on lap 163, before Earnhardt became the leader on the 181st lap and maintained this position until Edwards regained it 14 laps later. The race was stopped for 17 minutes when Gordon crashed on lap 262, and car parts were strewn {{into the path of}} other drivers, requiring officials to clean the track. Edwards maintained the lead at the restart and held it to win the race. There were eleven cautions and 19 lead changes by nine different drivers during the race.|$|E
5|$|Mohorič <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> Alexey Tsatevich (Katusha) and Primož Roglič (LottoNL–Jumbo), {{who went}} on to contest a two-man sprint. Tsatevich won the sprint, despite an early celebration that nearly allowed Roglič to come past him. The peloton {{finished}} together, 14 seconds behind, with Jarlinson Pantano (IAM) winning the sprint for third place. Quintana therefore sealed his overall victory, with Contador second and Martin third.|$|E
