5|$|The Free State was intended, above all, to be {{profitable}} for its investors and Leopold in particular. Its finances were frequently precarious. Early reliance on ivory exports {{did not make}} {{as much money as}} hoped and the colonial administration was frequently in debt, nearly defaulting on a number of occasions. A boom in demand for natural rubber in the 1890s, however, ended these problems as the colonial state was able to force Congolese males to work as forced labour collecting <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> which could then be exported to Europe and North America. The rubber boom transformed what had been an unexceptional colonial system before 1890 and led to significant profits. Exports rose from 580 to 3,740 tons between 1895 and 1900.|$|E

A handful of villainous half-breeds dominated the country, armed such Indians as would support them, and turned the rest into slaves, terrorizing them with the most inhuman tortures in order to force them to gather the india-rubber, which was then floated down the river to Para. Lord John Roxton expostulated on behalf of the wretched victims, and received nothing but threats and insults for his pains. He then formally declared war against Pedro Lopez, the leader of the slave-drivers, enrolled a band of runaway slaves in his service, armed them, and conducted a campaign, which ended by his killing with his own hands the notorious half-breed and breaking down the system which he represented.|$|E

50|$|During the Partition of Africa in the 1880's, Belgium, Germany and France each competed {{against each}} other in order to control {{territory}} north of the Ubangi River. In 1903, France named its new colony 'Ubangi-Shari' and in 1910, France incorporated the territory along with four other colonies (French Congo, Gabon, Chad and French Cameroon) into one colonial federation known as the French Equatorial Africa. Initially, the French government leased large parts of land for European companies and forced the local population to gather <b>wild</b> <b>rubber,</b> hunt for ivory and animal skins, and work on plantations. Due to forced exploitation by the French colonial empire, Central African locals began to rebel in the early 20th century which led to the Kongo-Wara rebellion (1928-1931).

Some of the migrants settled in the vicinity, which they called Bung-Ngwang ("bathing area in the Nyong River"). When Europeans arrived in the 19th century, this name was changed to Abong-Mbang. Some migrants continued westward in search of salt; they became the Kwassio and Bakola of Cameroon's coast. German colonisers moved into {{the area in the}} late 19th century. They used the Nyong River as a means to reach the <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> growing farther inland. The Germans built a fort and other military and administrative buildings in the town. The fort is today a prefectural prison, and the other buildings serve similar administrative functions. The French took over in 1919 following Germany's defeat in World War I.|$|E
50|$|Because of a {{temporary}} rise in rubber prices {{due to the}} World War (1914-18), Córdova {{was able to find}} work locating <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> trees for tapping.

Eventually he entered into contract with an agent of pharmaceutical companies to act as an herbalist, to find plants of the Amazon region noted for their curative properties. In the meantime, he and his wife acquired 'squatter rights' on a river 'island' and Córdova started farming the land, growing corn and raising livestock. He hunted to supplement their diet. It was a few decades afterwards, when he and his maturing family lived in the Amazon city of Iquitos, that he served as guide for a timber company, e.g., in a region near the Andes called the eyebrows of the mountain las cejas de la montaña. An arboreal survey was being created, with information about river access. There began his work with an American forester, Bruce Lamb, who would become his lifelong friend and colleague.

5000|$|During this period, Brazil did {{not have}} a {{significantly}} integrated national economy. Rather, Brazil had a grouping of regional economies that exported their own specialty products to European and North American markets. The absence of a big internal market with overland transportation, except for the mule trains, impeded internal economic integration, political cohesion and military efficiency. The regions, [...] "the [...] " [...] as the British called them, moved to their own rhythms. The Northeast exported its surplus cheap labor and saw its political influence decline as its sugar lost foreign markets to Caribbean producers. The <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> boom in Amazônia lost its world primacy to efficient Southeast Asian colonial plantations after 1912. The national-oriented market economies of the South were not dramatic, but their growth was steady and by the 1920s allowed Rio Grande do Sul to exercise considerable political leverage. Real power resided in the coffee-growing states of the Southeast—São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro—which produced the most export revenue. Those three and Rio Grande do Sul harvested 60% of Brazil's crops, turned out 75% of its industrial and meat products, and held 80% of its banking resources.|$|E

40|$|Survey of {{the open}} {{pollination}} by isozymes in a <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> trees (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.) seeds orchard. The Côte dʼIvoire has a <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> tree population for which an improvement in a seeds orchard is suggested by open pollination. The isozymes markers (5 loci) were applied to study the open pollination in a rubber tree seed orchard in 1998 and 1999. The results confirmed the allogamic character of the rubber tree. On {{the period of the}} survey (1998 and 1999), the outcrossing rate estimated to 0. 97 and 0. 96 varies weakly between the two years. The high level of the outcrossing rate show that pollinations are realized between trees of different genotypes. The fixation index (FIS) decrease from the parental population to the descendantʼs one where it is not significantly different from zero. So crossings are panmictics, and the fertilizations between the related trees are practically inexistent. The rate of self-fertilization is mostly due to the real self-fertilizations between the ovuls and the pollen coming from the same origin. Thus, considering the results, the pollination in the seeds orchard would be favorable to the realization of substantial genetic progress in the <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> trees population...|$|E

It is a case study of a rubber tappers’ cooperative that aims to improve the livelihoods of the residents of an extractive reserve through the promotion of <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> production in the northern state of Pará. By looking at the difficulties the cooperative was facing the challenges for the sustainability of the extractive reserves and <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> production in general are explored. The objective is to know what are the possibilities of <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> extraction as a livelihood strategy. The research topic is explored from a historical perspective, taking into account the political and market dynamics that have affected the social logics of the groups in question. The theoretical framework is multidisciplinary, mainly drawing from the tradition of peasant economics. The research {{is based on}} the fieldwork conducted in the extractive reserve of Tapajós-Arapiuns and the city of Santarém, consisting of participant observation, interviews, and acquiring documents about the cooperative and the extractive reserve. On the basis of my study I argue that the model of the extractive reserve should take into consideration the varying realities of the different parts of Amazonia. <b>Wild</b> <b>rubber</b> production has income-generating potential as the global market prices are rising, although <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> suffers from a disadvantaged market position typical to extractive economies. In order for a cooperative to be able to strengthen the livelihoods of the members, it {{has to be able to}} function as a business. Increasing production is a political process, challenged by the fact that the producer price is not considered sufficient by the rubber tappers. Rubber production has a special history in the region and is not attributed with such cultural or social values as manioc, another cash crop, also the staple of the diet. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|The {{rubber tree}} (Hevea brasiliensis) is an {{important}} economic crop, particularly in Thailand. As the plantations extend to new and drier areas, iriformation on physiological parameters such as water use efficiency (WUE) is required to help breeding for adapted genotypes. Carbon isotope composition of bulk leaf (~ 13 C) {{can be used as}} an indicator of intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE) of plants. A prerequisite step is to analyse the genetic variability of o 13 C. We compared the carbon isotope composition of bulk rubber tree leaf (~ 13 C) in rainy and dry seasons in a collection of 49 wild genotypes of rubber in Northern Thailand. There were large ~ 13 C variations among the genotypes at all seasons. ~ 13 C ranged between - 33. 3 % 0 to - 30. 0 % 0 in rainy season and - 33. 1 % 0 to - 29. 9 % 0 in dry season. ~ 13 C was rather stable with a good correlation between rainy and dry season. In rainy season, there was a positive significant correlation between ~ 13 C, leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen per area (N). The average ~ 13 C was significantly different between two genetic clusters previously identified in this population. The large genetic variability of ~ 13 C in <b>wild</b> <b>rubber</b> population is promisingfor breeding genotypes using less water. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
