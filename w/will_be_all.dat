Even though Mimi was described as domineering, Ono later compared herself to her when describing her own relationship with Lennon. She later admitted that Ono was a good wife and mother. After Lennon's death, Ono and Sean Lennon visited Mimi in Liverpool, where she was staying at her sister Anne's house because of a heart condition.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} Waugh's intention {{to attempt a}} novel appears in a letter dated May 1924, to his schoolfriend Dudley Carew. Waugh writes: [...] "Quite soon I am {{going to write a}} little book. It is going to be called The Temple at Thatch and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> about magic and madness". This writing project may have been a reaction to Waugh's immediate circumstances; he was in the last weeks of his Oxford career, contemplating failure in his examinations and irritated by {{the fact that most of}} his contemporaries appeared to be on the verge of brilliant careers. On [...] 22 June 1924 he spent time working out the plot, a continuation of the supernatural theme explored in [...] "Unacademic Exercise". The basic premise was an undergraduate inheriting a country house of which nothing was left except an 18th-century folly, where he set up house and practised black magic.|$|E

Series producers claimed post-production work was necessary on the show because of the number of microphones used during filming: [...] "The judges make their decisions at the auditions stage based on what they hear on the day, live in the arena. The footage and sound is then edited and dubbed into a finished programme, to deliver the most entertaining experience possible for viewers. When it gets to the live shows, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> live." [...] It was reported on 26 August that Cowell had ordered a ban on pitch correction in future episodes, asking for them to be re-edited. In October 2010, Ofcom ruled that viewers had not been [...] "materially misled" [...] as pitch correction was only used during auditions and not when viewers were paying to vote for the contestants.|$|E

Probably 75% of it will be old material and 25% will be new, but it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> connected by a general theme. It will be a cool show, I promise you.

[...] It is intended that the 44-date Us + Them Tour would visit the United States and Canada, showcase Waters' highlights, start on 26 May 2017 in Kansas City, MO and end on 29 October 2017 in Vancouver, BC. The tour title is derived from the track [...] "Us and Them," [...] from the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} praised for its {{political}} satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a [...] "biting political satire {{in the guise}} of a children's oratory contest", that [...] "signifies that this season of the series <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> over the map, both emotionally and logically." [...] Gibron added: [...] "Everything, from the Reader's Digest rants to the formulaic speeches of the youths, has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal reaming as well." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it [...] "bitch slapped the Bush administration" [...] that would later badmouth The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it [...] "has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with Reading Digest. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall." ...|$|E

(The record stood until major league seasons were {{lengthened}} to 162 games, {{and it has}} been surpassed twice since then.) Lemon was named Cleveland's starter for game one of the 1954 World Series. After nine innings, the Indians and Giants were tied 2–2. Lemon stayed in the game to pitch the tenth and final inning, but he surrendered a three-run home run to pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes and the Indians lost, 5–2. Indians manager Al López went with Lemon again in the fourth game after only two days rest. [...] "He hasn't worked that close together all year because we had a good bunch of other pitchers, but a year ago, he and Wynn and Garcia pitched every third day for practically a month. Bob <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right", Lopez said. Lemon and the Indians lost the game, 7–4, as the Giants swept the Series four games to none. In his two appearances, he went 0–2 with a 6.75ERA, allowed eight walks and recorded 11 strikeouts.|$|E
500|$|To {{the wider}} public, who knew little of his legal work, Hand was by then a folk hero. Social {{scientist}} Marvin Schick {{has pointed out}} that this mythic status is a paradox. Because Hand never served on the Supreme Court, the majority of his cases were routine and his judgments rooted in precedent. On Hand's retirement in 1951, Felix Frankfurter predicted that his [...] "actual decisions <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> deader than the Dodo before long, as at least many of them are already". Working for a lower court, however, saved Hand from the taint of political influence that often hung over the Supreme Court. Hand's eloquence as a writer played a larger part in the spread of his influence than the substance of his decisions; and Schick believes that the Hand myth brushes over contradictions in his legal philosophy. Hand's reputation as a libertarian obscures {{the fact that he was}} cautious as a judge. Though a liberal, he argued for judicial restraint in interpreting the Constitution, and regarded the advancement of civil liberties as a task for the legislature, not the courts. In his 1958 Holmes Lectures, for example, he voiced doubts about the constitutionality of the Warren Court's civil rights rulings. This philosophy of judicial restraint failed to influence the decisions of the Supreme Court during Hand's lifetime and afterwards.|$|E
