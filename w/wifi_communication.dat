30|$|Real-time data {{transmission}} is desirable for several reasons. Because {{of the high}} probability of telescope damage due to the aggressive environment (heavy rain, wind, volcanic acid gases, local landslides,...) it is preferable to remotely collect the data to eliminate {{the risk of losing}} several weeks of data records. Also, real-time acquisition of the information provided by the environmental sensors is necessary to check that the telescope is operating normally. We use 5 GHz <b>WiFi</b> <b>communication</b> systems for both their bandwidth capacity and their transmission capabilities over a distance of 10 – 20 km, a sufficient range in most cases. For instance, the distance between La Soufrière and the volcanological observatory in Guadeloupe is about 9 km. The rough topography around the volcano often necessitates using relay WiFi stations because the observatory is not in the line of sight of the telescope. This problem is particularly true for muon radiography where the telescopes must be placed at low-altitude points around the volcano.|$|E

Currently, WiFi networks are the most widespread signal exchanging mode for Internet access and local area connection networks, such as an in-home WiFi network involving both mobile and stationary devices [14]. As long as the wireless transmitting has its most profound impact on the outdoor fields, the highly developed wireless technology provides opportunities to exploit the WiFi-based sensor networks [15]. In contrast to the traditional wireless sensor network based on Zigbee modules, WiFi transmission reaches a 300 Mbps data transfer rate, which is more efficient and less delay [16]. On the other hand, since WiFi network has already been deployed and applied in indoor environment, significant hardware cost will be saved by expanding the system on the existing WiFi network resources. In addition, each <b>WiFi</b> <b>communication</b> node can easily support 100 wireless connections [17].|$|E

The computation of defining drivable area and control algorithm is operated in a control center which connects the vehicle via <b>WiFi</b> wireless <b>communication</b> system.

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] Due to fast {{development}} of technology, future communication and transmission are totally depends upon wireless network. Wireless networks are generally less efficient and irregular compared to wired networks, which make {{quality of service}} (QoS) provision a bigger challenge for wireless communications. The wireless medium has limited bandwidth, higher packet error rate, and higher packet overheads that in total to limit {{the capacity of the}} network to offer guaranteed QoS. In response to the increasing QoS challenge in wireless networks, researchers have made significant modifications in Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) in the legacy IEEE 802. 11 standards to make possible QoS to end users. The design constraints at several layers of the IEEE 802. 11 restrict its capacity to deliver guaranteed QoS. Recently, the IEEE 802. 16 standard, also known as worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), has emerged as the strongest contender for broadband wireless technology with promises to give guaranteed QoS to wireless application end users over wifi wireless technology.
