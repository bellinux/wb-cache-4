5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), because of the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as {{a reference to the}} Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the metronome whilst playing at Milan, for the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> influenced games by controlling the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E
5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} admired and loved for his {{generosity}} and kindness {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward {{was the president of}} the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jan, {{now living}} with Michael, forces costly changes in Michael's life. This causes Michael {{to worry about}} his {{financial}} situation. To remedy the problem, Michael leaves work early for a late night job as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. When Ryan finds out, he forces Michael to quit, who then fears {{that there is no}} <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> can support Jan and himself. He hops a train to run away, but Jan meets him and tells him that they can work together {{to find a way to}} live. Meanwhile, Dwight pines over Angela, who is later asked out by Andy. After a pep-talk by Jim, Dwight returns as his normal annoying self, to Jim's pleasure. Pam and Jim visit Dwight's family farm, which he has fashioned into a bed and breakfast.|$|E

5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} {{has been}} shaped {{to a large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{authors of}} earlier works {{published}} by Balai Pustaka, Pane {{does not use}} old Malay proverbs; he instead uses similes. Another <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> writes differently from earlier writers is by limiting {{his use of the}} Dutch language; earlier writers such as Abdul Muis and Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana had used Dutch words– representative of the dominant colonial power– to illustrate the intellectualism of the main characters. Instead, in Belenggu Pane relies on the Indonesianised loanwords, with a glossary of difficult or uncommon words provided with early editions of the novel. Siregar wrote that Pane's language reflected the actual use of Indonesian well.|$|E
5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the Beast composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar to the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E

5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći. The dying zduhać disclosed the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a man {{who did not want to}} be a zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1130s England began to descend into {{a period of}} civil war known as the Anarchy, during which the {{supporters}} of King Stephen fought {{with those of the}} Empress Matilda for control of the kingdom. William de Mohun's eldest son, also called William, was a noted supporter of Matilda, and Dunster was considered one of her faction's strongest castles in the south-west. In 1138 forces loyal to Stephen besieged the castle; a siege castle was built nearby, but all trace of it has been lost. William successfully held the castle and was made the Earl of Somerset by the grateful Empress. Chroniclers subsequently complained of the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> subsequently raided and controlled the region by force during the war, causing much destruction. In the aftermath of the conflict, William's son, another William, inherited the castle after a short period of royal ownership under Henry II. William appears to have insisted that his tenants agree to help repair and maintain the castle walls as part of their feudal service.|$|E

25|$|Pringle Stokes was {{objective}} in the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> described the Fuegians whom {{he first met}} in 1827, unusually for a European of his time. He blamed their primitive condition on {{the rigors of the}} climate.|$|E
25|$|Boulainvilliers's {{study of}} Spinoza, as {{captured}} in the collected treatises published by Renée Simon (1973), shows an exceptional development from a basic criticism to an enlightened understanding marked by the incredibly generous <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> let his opponent use his own voice.|$|E
25|$|In February 1696, Elihu Yale {{petitioned the}} Court of Directors once again over the unjust <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> had been tried by the Council of Fort St George. Higginson responded by {{replying}} to the Board of Directors refuting Yale's allegations of injustice.|$|E

25|$|In {{almost all}} his works, be it verse or prose, {{the way in}} which Chilkamarti narrated the {{incident}} instantaneously captured the reader's mind. The imageries he presented in detail, the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> unfolded the story with a special technique of narration, the diction he employed with familiar expression intelligible even to the average reader, above all, the sincerity of purpose with which he wrote went a long way for the success and popularity of his works.|$|E
25|$|Despite his anti-communism, {{the first}} major {{translations}} of Kipling into Russian took place during Lenin's rule in the early 1920s, and during the interwar period, Kipling was very popular with Russian readers. Many of the younger Russian poets and writers such as Konstantin Simonov were influenced by Kipling. Kipling's clarity of style, his use of colloquial language and the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> used rhythm and rhyme {{were considered to be}} major innovations in poetry that appealed to many of the younger Russian poets.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Jennings takes Elinor and Marianne to {{the country}} to visit her second daughter. In her misery over Willoughby's marriage, Marianne goes walking {{in the rain and}} becomes dangerously ill. Willoughby arrives to repent and reveals to Elinor that his love for Marianne was genuine. He elicits Elinor's pity because his choice has made him unhappy, but she is disgusted by the callous <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> talks of Miss Williams and of his own wife. He also reveals that his aunt forgave him after his marriage, meaning that if he had married Marianne he would have had both money and love.|$|E

50|$|In 1872 Puschmann {{published}} Richard Wagner: eine psychiatrische Studie, {{which set}} out the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> believed the composer was suffering from mental illness, including persecution mania and sexual depravity.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1920 Hopkinson {{was already}} making a {{reputation}} for being one of the best speakers and most independent minds in the House, although he was still officially sitting as a Coalition Liberal. He became increasingly involved in industrial topics in which he was critical of the trades unions (regarding them as having devoured the liberty of the workers) and of socialism to the level of distrusting the motives of those advocating socialist policies. He was a strong supporter of free trade. Hopkinson was much in demand as a speaker because of his unorthodox views and the frank and clear <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> expressed them.|$|E
25|$|Barnet Burns soon {{published}} a booklet {{about his experiences}} in Australia and New Zealand. Copyright for the booklet was obtained at the Worshipful Company of Stationers’ Hall at Ludgate Hill, London on 1 September 1835. Burns' publication had the lengthy title: A Brief Narrative of the Remarkable History of Barnet Burns, an English sailor; who has lately been exhibiting at the Surrey Zoological Gardens and other Places of Amusement. With a faithful account of the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> became a chief {{of one of the}} tribes of the New Zealanders: together with a few remarks on the manners and customs of the people, and other interesting matter.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{introduction}} of Augustinians and Premonstratensians into Galloway may {{have been part of}} a process of revitalising the newly reformed diocese. The construction of ecclesiastical buildings, much like castles, was often a means by which mediaeval rulers displayed their pre-eminent status, which in turn could explain Fergus' ecclesiastical activities. In effect, his religious foundations may evince attempts to assert his authority in the region. While the foundation of an episcopal see {{seems to have been a}} means by which Fergus sought to reinforce his independence from the Scots, his remarkable support of reformed religious orders may have been a <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> attempted to legitimise his regal aspirations.|$|E
