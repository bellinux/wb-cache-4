25|$|Artist {{development}} {{was a major}} part of Motown's operations instituted by Berry Gordy. The acts on the Motown label were fastidiously groomed, dressed and choreographed for live performances. Motown artists were advised that their breakthrough into the white popular music market made them ambassadors for other African-American artists seeking broad market acceptance, and that they should think, act, <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> like royalty, so as to alter the less-than-dignified image commonly held of black musicians by white Americans in that era. Given that many of the talented young artists had been raised in housing projects and lacked the necessary social and dress experience, this Motown department was not only necessary, it created an elegant style of presentation long associated with the label. The artist development department specialized primarily in working with younger, less experienced acts; experienced performers such as Jr. Walker and Marvin Gaye were exempt from artist development classes.|$|E
25|$|Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) {{is a rare}} genetic {{disorder}} {{of the brain that}} occurs only in males. The fatal condition destroys the nervous system, often leaving the victim unable to <b>walk,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> normally. For many years ALD took the lives of many and continues to do so today. In 1987, Augusto and Michaela Odone, parents of a child affected by ALD, invented Lorenzo’s oil as a treatment for the disease. Their story was in the 1992 Universal Studios motion picture, Lorenzo's Oil, starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon. Dr. Hugo Moser, a renowned scientist at Kennedy Krieger Institute, joined forces with the Odone's, ultimately proving that their treatment, Lorenzo's oil, can prevent the onset of ALD if begun before neurological symptoms appear. Moser and colleagues also created the first diagnostic test for ALD, as well as a newborn screening test that can detect the disease from birth. On January 20, 2007 Dr. Hugo Moser died of complications from surgery to treat pancreatic cancer. Today, Dr. Moser's wife Ann B. Moser, continues this important work at Kennedy Krieger. In 2008, she helped to launch a pilot study to screen for ALD in 5000 newborns born in local Baltimore hospitals, the results of which will be used to advocate for nationwide newborn screening for this devastating disorder.|$|E

500|$|The entire {{series was}} shot on sound stages. Production {{designers}} Greg Loewen and Graemay Murray designed the medical facility as a [...] "circular hub with offices and rooms radiating outward", and included a second floor in which DeMilla could oversee the entire hospital's operations. Director Joe Napolitano praised the sets while filming the episode [...] "Last Resort", calling the show [...] "a good candy store for a director" [...] {{due to the}} functionality {{and size of the}} hospital. He explained that the set enabled him to direct long takes and <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> sequences without much difficulty. The series required extensive prosthetic work for Dr. Batung and the non-human patients. The application of Lund's prosthetic makeup required several hours each day that he was filmed. Napolitano said that he found this to be a challenge to the production schedule, explaining that there would be discussions about the amount of prosthetics necessary for Batung depending on the scene. Batung's prosthetic work included a tail that wrapped around his neck and shoulders; Lund was pushed around the set on a sled to mimic the character's movements as a slug. Napolitano also specified that the patients required a similar amount of time and work for their prosthetic makeup, such as a man who has gills under his chin.|$|E
500|$|Willis {{described}} the production {{for the film}} as [...] "relatively easy." [...] He shot in varying styles; [...] "hot golden light for California, grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for... dream sequences," [...] {{most of which were}} cut. It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual split screen method. He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: [...] "Few viewers probably notice how much of Annie Hall consists of people talking, simply talking. They <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship." [...] He cites a study that calculated the average shot length of Annie Hall to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4–7 seconds. Peter Cowie suggests that [...] "Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces, so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained." [...] Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation {{in the use of the}} split screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.|$|E

2500|$|Most young {{children}} with 1p36 deletion syndrome have delayed development. They sit up, <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> later than typical children. Speech is severely affected, with many patients learning only a few words. It was originally thought {{that the degree of}} the delay and the ability to acquire complex speech was somewhat dependent on deletion size. Reports of a milder learning disability in children with smaller deletions have suggested {{that there may be a}} correlation between deletion size and mental ability; however, this requires further investigation and research. [...] Recent research by Dr Lisa Shaffer has shown however that there is no correlation between deletion size and degree of developmental delay. [...] This suggests that the most genetically potent area of the 1P36 chromosome occurs at the terminal end of the chromosome.|$|E
