5|$|After {{the success}} of Diva: Platinum Edition, Ivy Queen began {{recording}} her fourth studio album in March 2004; it <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> September at Marroneo Studios in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. The album was mastered and arranged by Esteban Piñero; Dennis Nieves did the mixing and served as engineer.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} early August 2015, during the wet season, in the Idukki {{district}} of Kerala. Major {{portions of the}} film were shot in Thopramkudy, near Kattappana. In September, while filming in Cheruthoni, Faasil sustained a leg injury while performing a stunt with co-star Sujith Shanker. Although a two-day rest was advised, he decided to press on because of the tight shooting schedule. The filming in Idukki, which took 45 days, was <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> late October.|$|E

5|$|Post-production {{phase was}} {{scheduled}} to be <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 50 days. On 19 May 2014, a puja commemorated the beginning of the film's dubbing at Hyderabad. The supporting cast of the film completed dubbing for their parts in late August 2014, and Mahesh began dubbing for his role after returning from Europe. The dubbing was completed on 10 September 2014. Aagadu was passed with an 'U/A' certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification in mid September 2014. All the remaining post-production activities, including the final mixing, were wrapped up by 16 September 2014.|$|E
5|$|Ward hired {{several of}} his {{recently}} graduated CalArts friends {{to work on the}} short with him. Neil Graf was tasked with coloring, Julian Narino was the background designer, and Adam Muto drew the props. Graf and Narino later got jobs with other series and studios—King of the Hill and Laika studio, respectively—but Muto continued working with Ward and eventually became Adventure Times co-executive producer and showrunner. The finished short ran for seven minutes, and production <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the spring of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on 7 November 2014 at Pune, and Haasan {{joined the}} {{set on the}} next day. The two leads were mobbed by local people during the film's shoot at an IT hub in Pune. The next segment took place in Hyderabad at a private studio where a song was filmed with Mahesh and Haasan. The song that accompanies Mahesh's first appearance in the film was filmed at Ramoji Film City starting on 11December 2014. The third filming segment commenced on 28December 2014 at Hyderabad. Around the end of January 2015, {{it was estimated that}} the film's shooting would be <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a month.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, {{the project}} was {{projected}} to cost $13.5 billion and <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 2020. In April 2011, Amtrak asked that $1.3 billion in USDOT funding for NEC rail corridor improvements be allocated to Gateway and related projects. In November 2011, Congress allocated $15 million for engineering work.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea for}} split {{screening}} came to Nalluri after visiting a pub {{one night after}} filming <b>wrapped</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> the audio commentary for the episode, Nalluri stated he was not inspired by the American series 24, which also uses split screen, as he was not yet aware of the show. The news report covering Mary and Paul Kane's past activities were snippets of real-life news from the United States, which were edited together. The music was composed by Jennie Muskett, who spent just {{two to three hours}} putting several pieces of background music together. One part of the episode centred on Zoe posing as target Diane Sullivan. Some publicity shots of Keeley Hawes in the series were shots of her with long brunette hair, though in fact she has short blonde hair.|$|E
5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E
25|$|On September 4, 2012, police {{announced}} that Giskegjerde Schjetne's {{body had been}} found in Sofiemyr (Kolbotn), about 20 minutes from the place where she had disappeared. The body {{was in a state of}} decomposition, <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> several layers of plastic and clothing, partly concealed in a wooded, hilly terrain, and adjacent to an industrial area with many derelict buildings. The post mortem, and subsequent forensic report revealed that she had suffered massive head trauma, but ruled out sexual assault or molestation.|$|E

25|$|Queen Meenakshi {{required}} him to swear on the Koran that he would adhere faithfully to his engagement, and he accordingly took an oath on a brick <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the spledid covering usually reserved for that holy book. He was admitted into the Trichinopoly fort and Vangaru Thirumala – apparently with the good will of the queen, who, strangely enough, {{does not seem to}} have wished him any harm – went off to Madurai, to rule over that country and Tirunelveli.|$|E
25|$|In essence, Hark-1 {{superseded}} Operation Hardnose. New CIA trainers were {{forwarded to}} the old Hardnose camps in early 1967. The Hark-1 trainer who appeared in February found a troubled situation; the Thais were <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their Operation Star {{to the neglect of}} the CIA's road watch program. A Thai Special Forces Team was promptly dedicated solely to training road watchers, and training facilities for them were expanded. After losing a Continental Air Services, Inc pilot in a fatal crash on 12 March 1967, the Hark-1 program had Air America take over the duty of supplying the airborne radio link to the Hark-1s.|$|E
25|$|After the {{stressful}} {{sessions for}} The Beatles (aka, The White Album) <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> October 1968, McCartney {{concluded that the}} group needed {{to return to their}} roots for their next project. The plan was to give a live performance featuring new songs, broadcast as a television special and recorded for release as an album. (At one point McCartney considered launching a tour; however, the idea was quickly shot down by the other members.) Unlike their recent albums, their new material would be designed to work well in concert, without the benefit of overdubs or other recording tricks.|$|E

25|$|In March 2011, auditions {{were held}} for 4 O'Clock Club, {{and the show}} was {{publicly}} announced the next month. In January 2012, the first episode aired, with the series <b>wrapping</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> March of the same year.|$|R
25|$|In September 2017, Zach Adams was {{the first}} to go on trial. The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, as there was no DNA or other {{forensic}} evidence tying Zach to the murder. Jason Autry, the state's key witness, testified to a series of events that was drastically different from Dylan's confession. He testified that he himself was not involved in the abduction, but that he went to Shayne Austin's home to buy drugs where he saw Zach, Dylan, and Shayne disposing of evidence from the crime. He said Zach had a body {{in the back of his}} truck <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a multi-colored blanket and Shayne was disposing of evidence in a burn barrel.|$|E
25|$|Tsvetaeva's two half-siblings, Valeria and Andrei, {{were the}} {{children}} of Ivan's deceased first wife, Varvara Dmitrievna Ilovaiskaya, daughter of the historian Dmitry Ilovaisky. Tsvetaeva's only full sister, Anastasia, was born in 1894. The children quarrelled frequently and occasionally violently. There was considerable tension between Tsvetaeva's mother and Varvara's children, and Tsvetaeva's father maintained close contact with Varvara's family. Tsvetaeva's father was kind, but deeply <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his studies and distant from his family. He was also still deeply {{in love with his}} first wife; he would never get over her. Maria Tsvetaeva had had a love affair before her marriage, from which she never recovered. Maria Tsvetaeva disapproved of Marina's poetic inclination; she wanted her daughter to become a pianist, holding the opinion that her poetry was poor.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the Côte de Nuits is <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{the history of the}} greater Cote d'Or. The Romans were the first to {{introduce}} viticulture into the area during their settlement of Gaul sometime during the 3rd century AD. Breaking away from the typical Roman style of planting near rivers, the Romans encouraged their allies in the area, the Aedui to plant vines on the narrow strip of land that was located to the east of their settlement at Augustodunum. It was this area, known asPagus Arebrignus, that was to eventually be subdivided into the Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune. When the area was under attack from the Alamans and other Germanic tribes, the Romans sought the help of a Baltic tribe known as the Burgundians who would eventually settle into the area and give the region its name.|$|E
50|$|Kroll Show {{completed}} its {{third and final}} season in 2015. Kroll has remarked {{that the decision to}} end the show was his, and that the show's stories and characters were naturally <b>wrapping</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the third season.|$|R
50|$|Shooting {{began in}} {{beginning}} of 2011 <b>in</b> Scotland and <b>wrapping</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Mumbai. Upon release the film received mixed reviews from critics {{and was an}} average performer at the box office, despite having a stellar cast and a large cinematic release.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009 the {{building}} was acquired by the City and County of San Francisco under a rare claim of eminent domain. It was finally razed in 2015 {{to make way for}} affordable housing; construction is scheduled to <b>wrap</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> January 2017.|$|R
25|$|Albert Graham took Sharlene {{out of the}} {{building}} and drove her back to the YWCA hostel; as he left her on the doorstep he reassured the little girl that her mother was inside waiting for her. Sharlene was looked after by the hostel staff until she was placed in the care of the Social Services. Back at the UDA club, Cowan removed the bloodstained hood and saw by her appalling head wounds and badly-bruised, disfigured face that Ann Ogilby was obviously dead; the body was then <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a brown sack and carried downstairs. The killers went to have a drink with Elizabeth Douglas to whom they recounted the details of the fatal beating as she had remained on the ground floor the entire time. Afterwards, Cowan and Smith got dressed up and went out to the disco as planned.|$|E
25|$|Sound the Alarm is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Saves the Day. After signing to major label DreamWorks Records, the band {{released}} In Reverie in late 2003. However, shortly afterwards DreamWorks Records was absorbed by Interscope Records, resulting in the band being dropped from label. After completing some songs in early 2005, the band was aiming to record in May, hoping to release the album in the fall. However, a line-up change occurred with bassist Eben D'Amico being replaced by Glassjaw member Manuel Carrero. Pre-production took place in early August with recording taking place at the band's own studio, Electric Ladybug Studios. While self-funding the sessions, the band worked with Steve Evetts. After recording <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> October, the band immediately undertook a 47-date US tour. Sound the Alarm, along with the later records Under the Boards (2007) and Daybreak (2011) form a trilogy whose theme is self-discovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{work was}} ready for {{publication}} {{by the end of}} 1894, but no funds were available to have it printed. Each year Nevill urged the Natal government in his annual Report of the Government Astronomer to provide funds for publication, but to no avail. In his report for 1898 he wrote despairingly: The investigations of the errors in the lunar tables have been <b>wrapped</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> brown paper, tied up with red tape, and put away on a shelf until such time as a vote can be obtained to publish it… The next year disaster struck when the manuscript was damaged during a rainstorm owing to a leak in the observatory's roof. In subsequent years similar work was done by others, notably E.W. Brown in the United States, M. Radau in France, and P.H. Cowell in Britain, who received the credit. In 1907 Nevill related this sad history in his presidential address to Section A of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science.|$|E
