40|$|As he {{explains}} {{in the first}} note, Miller wrote {{the first version of}} his contribution {{on the basis of the}} version of my paper “Beauty, a road to the truth(?) ”, as it was in July 2000. The final version (Kuipers 2002) 1, is not only revised to some extent in the light of Miller’s comments but it is also substantially enlarged, in particular Section 2 (“Aesthetic induction and exposure effects”). This explains why Miller in his final version does not touch upon this specimen of “naturalized philosophy, ” based on results in experimental psychology. My reply will deal <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> disagreements regarding the nature and role of empirical and aesthetic criteria in the evaluation of scientific theories. But I would first like to express my appreciation for his exposition of four theories of truth approximation in his Section 1. Tables 0 and 1 are of course attractive from my point of view. They suggest that my approach is a kind of improvement not only of Popper’s original approach but also of the two parallel improvements of that approach by Harris and Miller. Technically, they represent a very informative structuring of the possibilities for “content theories ” of verisimilitude, as Zwart (1998 / 2001) calls them. However, although Miller apparently can appreciate my approach to truth approximation in general, he is rather reserved in two respects: the role I assign to empirical successes and my analysis of aesthetic considerations...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Associate Professor Frank Mueller). Processor speeds have increased dramatically in the recent past, but improvement in memory access latencies has not kept pace. As a result, programs that do not make efficient use of the processor caches tend to become increasing memory-bound and do not experience speedups with increasing processor frequency. In this thesis, we present tools to characterize and optimize the memory access patterns of software programs. Our tools use the program’s memory access trace as a primary input for analysis. Our efforts encompass two broad areas — performance analysis and performance optimization. <b>With</b> performance analysis, <b>our</b> focus is on automating the analysis process {{as far as possible}} and on presenting the user with a rich set of metrics, both for single-threaded and multi-threaded programs. With performance optimization, we go one step further and perform automatic transformations based on observed program behavior. We make the following contributions in this thesis. First, we explore different tracing strategies — software tracing with dynamic binary instrumentation, hardware-based tracing exploiting support found in contemporary microprocessors and a hybrid scheme that leverages hardware support with certain software modifications. Second, we present a range of performance analysis and optimization tools based on these trace inputs and additional auxiliary instrumentation. Our first tool, METRIC, characterizes the memory performance of single-threaded programs. Our second tool, ccSIM extends METRIC to characterize the coherence behavior of multithreaded OpenMP benchmarks. Our third tool extends ccSIM to work with hardware-generated and hybrid trace inputs. These three tools represent our performance analysis efforts. We also explore automated performance optimization <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> tools. <b>Our</b> fourth tool uses hardware-generated traces for automatic page placement in cache coherent non-uniform memory architectures (ccNUMA). Finally, our fifth tool explores a novel trace-driven instruction-level software data prefetching strategy. Overall, we demonstrate that memory traces represent a rich source of information about a program’s behavior and can be effectively used {{for a wide range of}} performance analysis and optimization strategies...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : Comparison of {{conventional}} toon shading (leftmost image) <b>with</b> <b>our</b> result (<b>remaining</b> images). Edits {{were made at}} the three key frames indicated: (left) added shaded area below left eye for expressive impact, (middle) deleted dark area around right eye, and (right) added shaded area below nose to emphasize three-dimensionality. These local edits integrate seamlessly with the global lighting, animate smoothly, and require no modification to the external lighting setup. Recent progress in non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) has led to many stylized shading techniques that efficiently convey visual information about the objects depicted. Another crucial goal of NPR ideas born of their imaginations. In particular, the ability to add intentional, but often unrealistic, shading effects is indispensable for many applications. We propose a set of simple stylized shading algorithms that allow the user to freely add localized light and shade to a model {{in a manner that}} is consistent and seamlessly integrated with conventional lighting techniques. The algorithms provide an intuitive, direct manipulation method based on a paint-brush metaphor, to control and edit the light and shade locally as desired. Our prototype system demonstrates how our method can enhance both the quality and range of applicability {{of conventional}} stylized shading for offline animation and interactive applications...|$|R

Hit engine room, steamer disappeared in smoke and dust.” [...] He wrote that the Leukos had not sunk! “Later it was recognised that the steamer had not sunk as presumed before. Decided not to attack again”. [...] He also wrote that some other trawlers were unaware of the incident “others seemed not to have noticed the gunfire.”It is not known why the U-38 sank a neutral Irish trawler, leaving the five British trawlers unmolested. Nor is it known why he waited an hour. In 1988 an effort was made to ask Kapitän Liebe. He declined to speak. He died in July 1997.|$|R

40|$|Titan is {{the only}} moon with a {{substantial}} atmosphere, the only other thick N_ 2 atmosphere besides Earth's, the site of extraordinarily complex atmospheric chemistry that far surpasses any other solar system atmosphere, and the only other solar system body with stable liquid currently on its surface. The connection between Titan's surface and atmosphere is also unique in our Solar system; atmospheric chemistry produces materials that are deposited {{on the surface and}} subsequently altered by surface-atmosphere interactions such as aeolian and fluvial processes resulting in the formation of extensive dune fields and expansive lakes and seas. Titan's atmosphere is favorable for organic haze formation, which combined with the presence of some oxygen bearing molecules indicates that Titan's atmosphere may produce molecules of prebiotic interest. The combination of organics and liquid, in the form of water in a subsurface ocean and methane/ethane in the surface lakes and seas, means that Titan may be the ideal place in the solar system to test ideas about habitability, prebiotic chemistry, and the ubiquity and diversity of life in the Universe. The Cassini-Huygens mission to the Saturn system has provided a wealth of new information allowing for study of Titan as a complex system. Here I review our current understanding of Titan's atmosphere and climate forged from the powerful combination of Earth-based observations, remote sensing and in situ spacecraft measurements, laboratory experiments, and models. I conclude <b>with</b> some of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> unanswered questions as the incredible era of exploration with Cassini-Huygens comes to an end.
