25|$|Also {{throughout}} 1992, Yeltsin <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet (the standing legislature) and the Russian Congress of People's Deputies (the country's highest legislative body, {{from which}} the Supreme Soviet members were drawn) for control over government and government policy.

25|$|Following the Operation Torch landings, (from early November 1942), the Germans and Italians {{initiated}} {{a buildup of}} troops in Tunisia to fill the vacuum left by Vichy troops which had withdrawn. During this period of weakness, the Allies decided against a rapid advance into Tunisia while they <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Vichy authorities. Many of the Allied soldiers were tied up in garrison duties because of the uncertain status and intentions of the Vichy forces.|$|E
25|$|Over the centuries, many Christian {{scholars}} <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{conflict between}} the belief in free will and its implied randomness, {{and the idea that}} God knows everything that happens. Saints Augustine and Aquinas tried to reach an accommodation between foreknowledge and free will, but Martin Luther argued against randomness and took the position that God's omniscience renders human actions unavoidable and determined. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas viewed randomness not {{as the result of a}} single cause, but of several causes coming together by chance. While he believed in the existence of randomness, he rejected it as an explanation of the end-directedness of nature, for he saw too many patterns in nature to have been obtained by chance.|$|E

25|$|The son of Constantine was T'oros I, {{who succeeded}} him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and {{expanded}} the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, {{he took the}} castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge {{the death of the}} last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were {{the closest thing to a}} ruling dynasty, and <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines for power over the region.|$|E
25|$|At the {{television}} tower, Wells {{learned that the}} device was real. He <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> men (presumably Barnes and William A. Rothstein) and tried to flee, {{but one of them}} fired a gun, causing Wells to stop. It was at this time that the collar bomb is assumed to have been attached. The culprits gave him a sophisticated home-made shotgun, which had the appearance of an unusually-shaped cane, and told him to use it if he encountered resistance at the bank. Wells then entered a bank with the shotgun and demanded $250,000. When police intervened, Wells claimed that three unnamed people had placed a bomb around his neck, provided him with the shotgun, and told him that he had to commit the robbery and several other tasks, lest they kill him.|$|E
25|$|Born in Hendersonville, Tennessee, Jarrett became {{involved}} with basketball {{when he was in}} high school, but he worked for his father Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) as a referee in March 1986 and trained as a wrestler under his father and Tojo Yamamoto. Jarrett made his in-ring debut at the age of 18 in April 1986 when jobber Tony Falk attempted to end his lengthy losing streak by challenging Jarrett, then a referee, to a match. Jarrett accepted the challenge, wrestling Falk to a 10-minute draw. Jarrett is a third-generation wrestler: his father wrestled, as did his maternal grandfather, Eddie Marlin, while his paternal grandmother, Christine, was employed by Nashville-based wrestling promotion Gulas/Welch Promotions. He also <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} five scripts were written as Romero <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film's {{concepts}} and the budgetary constraints. The first draft was over 200 pages, which he later condensed to 122 pages. This {{is the true}} original script, and to date no copies of it have come to light. This version was likely rejected because UFDC felt it was too expensive for them to produce even with an R rating. Romero subsequently scaled down {{the scope of this}} script into a 165-page draft (often erroneously referred to as the original version), then condensed it again to a 104-page draft labeled the 'second version, second draft' in an unsuccessful final attempt to get the story within budget parameters. When this failed, he drastically altered the original story concept and ultimately produced a shooting draft that numbered only 88 pages.|$|E
25|$|Also {{throughout}} 1992, Yeltsin <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet of Russia and the Congress of People's Deputies {{for control}} over government, government policy, government banking and property. In {{the course of}} 1992, {{the speaker of the}} Russian Supreme Soviet, Ruslan Khasbulatov, came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals. In December 1992, the 7th Congress of People's Deputies succeeded in turning down the Yeltsin-backed candidacy of Yegor Gaidar for the position of Russian prime minister. An agreement was brokered by Valery Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court, which included the following provisions: a national referendum on the new constitution; parliament and Yeltsin would choose a new head of government, to be confirmed by the Supreme Soviet; and the parliament was to cease making constitutional amendments that change the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. Eventually, on 14 December, Viktor Chernomyrdin, widely seen as a compromise figure, was confirmed in the office.|$|E
25|$|Several {{cases have}} <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> concept of initial {{interest}} confusion. In Brookfield Commc'ns v. West Coast Ent'mt {{the court found}} initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms {{were used in the}} HTML metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In Playboy v. Netscape, the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.|$|E

500|$|During {{the court}} {{proceedings}} Davidson continued to officiate at Stiffkey and Morston, although his erratic attendance meant that substitutes {{often had to}} be arranged. On 12 June 1932 the Reverend R.H. Cattell arrived to officiate at the evening service in Stiffkey. He had just begun when Davidson entered the church and attempted to seize the Bible. The two priests <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> book for some seconds before Cattell yielded, telling the congregation: [...] "As nothing short of force will prevent Mr Davidson from taking part, I can see nothing left to do but to withdraw." [...] The crowds of reporters and sightseers at weekends led the Archdeacon of Lynn to issue a statement deploring the [...] "media circus" [...] and asking that [...] "the full spirit of worship" [...] be restored to Sunday services.|$|E
500|$|The Battle of Verrières Ridge—although {{given no}} {{particular}} prominence in German military history—has earned {{the distinction of}} being one of the First Canadian Army's most scrutinised actions. The matter was first brought to public attention by historian C.P. Stacey, who <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> question of how to present the battle to the public in the Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War and was required to make minor changes to the narrative of the battle by Simonds. At the time Stacey was writing the history, as senior historian of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Simonds was the Chief of the General Staff of the Canadian Army, or in essence, his boss. The report on Operation Spring by Simonds was released after the war and blamed its failure on [...] "11th hour reinforcement" [...] of German lines and [...] "strategically unsound execution on the part of Major Phillip Griffin and the Black Watch".|$|E
2500|$|An FHWA {{sponsored}} study <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> moral {{dilemma of}} rumble strips keeping [...] "unsafe drivers" [...] (which includes impaired drivers) on the highway.

Unfortunately, as noted above, an examination of downstream crashes could not be conducted." ...|$|E

2500|$|Paradise Lost is, {{among other}} things, {{a poem about}} civil war. Satan raises 'impious war in Heav'n' (i 43) by leading {{a third of the}} angels in revolt against God. The term 'impious war' implies that civil war is impious. But Milton applauded the English people for having the courage to depose and execute King Charles I. In his poem, however, he takes the side of 'Heav'n's awful Monarch' (iv 960). Critics have long <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} of why an antimonarchist and defender of regicide should have chosen a subject that obliged him to defend monarchical authority ...|$|E
2500|$|Twain was a Presbyterian. He was {{critical}} of organized religion and certain elements of Christianity through his later life. He wrote, for example, [...] "Faith is believing what you know ain't so", and [...] "If Christ were here now {{there is one thing}} he would not be– a Christian". With anti-Catholic sentiment rampant in 19th century America, Twain noted he was “educated to enmity toward everything that is Catholic”. As an adult, he engaged in religious discussions and attended services, his theology developing as he <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deaths of loved ones and with his own mortality.|$|E
2500|$|Koepp <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{voice-over}} {{throughout the}} writing process. Initially the voice-over {{was to take}} place in the hospital, but De Palma suggested the train station platform. [...] The hospital scenes were written 25 to 30 times because the actors had trouble with the sequence, with Pacino even thinking that Carlito would not go to the hospital. With one final re-write Koepp managed to make the scene work to Pacino's satisfaction. In the novels Kleinfeld does not die, but De Palma has a huge sense of justice and retribution. He could not have Carlito killed off and have Kleinfeld live.|$|E

2500|$|Nyrop {{writes that}} the most common example is the [...] "intense feeling which knits parents to their offspring", but he adds that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between {{other members of the}} same family, which can include those outside the {{immediate}} family circle, [...] "everywhere where deep affection unites people." [...] The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and when Moses went to meet his father-in-law, he [...] "did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent" [...] (Exodus 18:7); and when Jacob had <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Lord he met Esau, ran towards him, fell on his neck and kissed him. The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early Greeks, as when Odysseus, on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{gradually}} introduced Transcendentalist {{ideas into}} his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. “I preach abundant heresies,” {{he wrote to}} a friend, “and they all go down—for the listeners {{do not know how}} heretical they are.” For years he had <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing “some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.’” He was hardly alone. “‘What shall we do with the Old Testament?’ asked James Walker in 1838. ‘That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt to answer it, or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome." [...] Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based higher criticism, formed the basis of liberal Christianity as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Turning to the {{constitutional}} question, Brennan <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that [...] "...in Railway Employees v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956), [...] that because the RLA pre-empts all state laws banning union-security agreements, the negotiation and enforcement of such provisions in railroad industry contracts involves 'governmental action' and is therefore subject to constitutional limitations." [...] The question before the Court in Beck, then, was whether such governmental action extended to the acts of unions {{in the private sector}} where there was no such federal pre-emption. CWA argued that because Section 14(b) of the NLRA permits each state make its own choice in this regard, there could be no federal pre-emption and thus no governmental action. Brennan concluded for the majority that the Supreme Court need not decide the issue: The Court's doctrine was to rule narrowly on grounds of statutory construction where possible, and that issue had already been decided on statutory grounds in the workers' favor.|$|E
