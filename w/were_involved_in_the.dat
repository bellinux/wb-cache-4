40|$|Our {{work has}} {{suggested}} that a high-frequency event <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation phase of malignant transformation in vitro; a later, mutationlike event appears to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later stages of transformation. There may be no specific "target gene" which directly interacts with carcinogens. It is hypothesized that nonspecific types of DNA damage <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> induction of an ongoing process we know as carcinogenesis. Several genes could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> maintaining this process. Our recent results suggest that c-myc and c-fos could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stages of carcinogenesis, as they are affected by anticarcinogenic protease inhibitors {{in a manner that}} corresponds to <b>the</b> way <b>in</b> which protease inhibitors suppress malignant transformation...|$|R
