5|$|The {{blue whale}} is usually {{classified}} {{as one of}} eight species in the genus Balaenoptera; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, Sibbaldus, {{but this is not}} accepted elsewhere. DNA sequencing analysis indicates that the blue whale is phylogenetically closer to the sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei) than to other Balaenoptera species, and closer to the humpback whale (Megaptera) and the gray whale (Eschrichtius) than to the minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata and Balaenoptera bonaerensis). If further research confirms these relationships, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> reclassify the rorquals.|$|E

The flats demolished for the extension would be replaced by significant building work above. The underground station would be rebuilt and connected to Euston Square tube station. As part of the extension beyond Birmingham, the Mayor of London's office believed it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> build the proposed Crossrail 2 line via Euston to relieve 10,000 extra passengers forecast to arrive during an average day.|$|E
5|$|A {{tenth of}} the city's {{workforce}} is employed at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, which is directly linked to the city's biggest industry, defence, with the headquarters of BAE Systems Surface Ships located in the city. BAE's Portsmouth shipyard has been awarded {{a share of the}} construction work on the two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, with both aircraft carriers set to enter Portsmouth Harbour upon completion. A £100 million contract was signed to develop the facilities at Portsmouth that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> support the vessels. There is also a major ferry port that handles both passengers and cargo, and the city has a dedicated fishing fleet consisting of 20 to 30 boats that operate out of the camber docks in Camber Quay, Old Portsmouth. They land fresh fish and shellfish daily, most of which is sold at the quayside fish market.|$|E
50|$|Having {{grown from}} a Reformed Church academy, Marshall College opened in 1836 in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania.

5|$|Kepler-10c is an {{exoplanet}} {{orbiting the}} G-type star Kepler-10, located around 568 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by Kepler in May 2011, {{although it had}} {{been seen as a}} planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called Blender that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method that led to the discovery of Kepler-10c as what <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.|$|E
5|$|Wartime proved hard on {{the film}} business. On September 23, 1915, Famous Players {{informed}} McKernan that “On account of the boat Hesperian having been torpedoed by a German submarine, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> skip two Weeklies (short films), these having come forward to ourselves from our London representative via this boat. Regretting this occurrence, and trusting you will appreciate our position on this...”. McKernan’s supply of new films was decreased as the war dragged on, and McKernan advertised less and less frequently. Further complicating things, parts for the theatre’s Edison and Simplex projectors were difficult to come by {{at the best of}} times, and the complex machines proved difficult to maintain. McKernan did not live to see business pick up. He contracted Spanish Influenza and pneumonia in rapid succession, and died on February 18, 1919.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water quality and hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water quality and hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E

25|$|The {{sputtering}} rate {{of tungsten}} by the plasma fuel ions is {{orders of magnitude}} smaller than that of carbon, and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten, making this a more attractive choice. On the other hand, tungsten impurities in a plasma are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering of tungsten can be high, so it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the plasma {{in contact with the}} tungsten is not too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the reserve}} covers {{a large portion}} of Honduras, very little is {{recorded}} about the biological diversity within it. While previous management plans have proven successful, a continued investigation into ongoing management plans and future conservation issues <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> keep this valuable reserve safe. Currently there are threats to the conservation of the reserve which include illegal hunting, logging and clearing of land to graze cattle. Recent rafting expeditions from the Rio Plátano headwaters through all three zones of the reserve (cultural, buffer and core) have documented cattle grazing in the core zone, commercial fishing and hunting camps along the river and clear cutting of forest near Las Marias.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to influencing the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine {{it has been}} reported that antipsychotic drugs could achieve glutamanergic effects. This mechanism involves direct effects on antipsychotic drugs on glutamate receptors. By using the technique of functional neurochemical assay chlorpromazine and phenothiazine derivatives have been shown to have inhibitory effects on NMDA receptors that appeared to be mediated by action at the Zn site. It was found that there is an increase of NMDA activity at low concentrations and suppression at high concentrations of the drug. No significant difference in glutamate and glycine activity from the effects of chlorpromazine were reported. Further work <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> determine if the influence in NMDA receptors by antipsychotic drugs contributes to their effectiveness.|$|E

India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrollment levels of developed nations, a challenge that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.|$|E
25|$|Gang wars: Battles with enemy gangs are {{prompted}} {{whenever the}} player ventures into enemy territory and kills {{at least three}} gang members. If the player then survives three waves of enemies, the territory will be won and fellow gang members will begin wandering the streets of these areas.

Occasionally, the player's territory will come under attack from enemy gangs and defeating them <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> retain these areas.

25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk {{of this approach is}} that the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible to}} a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads. Some analysis <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of the loads will be.|$|E
