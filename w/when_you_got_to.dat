2500|$|His {{successor}} at the Marinepersonalamt , described Lütjens as {{a dedicated}} naval officer who put his {{service to the}} nation ahead of the ruling party. He also described him as a difficult man to know. Austere, rather forbidding, he said little and when he did, confined his remarks to the essentials. Patzig said of him [...] "one of the ablest officers in the service, very logical and shrewd, incorruptible in his opinions and an engaging personality <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know him." [...] Few did. Lütjens's dedication to his officer principles meant he did not marry until he was 40—adhering to a code that an officer should wed only when he could support a wife.|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--It {{must have}} been some {{argument}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> throwing chairs. [She turns on CHRIS.] Why don't you say something? What was it about? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{taken to}} you," [...] replied the rider, seriously. [...] "I've {{heard of the}} like, but not so quick. Was he in a bad fix <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> him yesterday?" ...|$|E
60|$|LEE TAI. No better a {{one than}} yours, Daisy. It was a clever trick <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> {{try to put}} your husband {{out of the way}} so that you should be free for George Conway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hol' your tongue, sar! What {{you go on}} jabberin' so <b>to</b> me <b>when</b> <b>you's</b> <b>got</b> work <b>to</b> do, sar!" [...] said Peter fiercely, with a {{threatening}} motion of his fist. [...] "Go to work at once, you white slabe!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{came down}} and told Jessie and {{me that she was}} afraid you'd have more trouble, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> school. As if you haven't had {{troubles}} enough already!" [...] And Laura looked affectionately at her brother, and then at his chums.|$|R
60|$|I don't think I've {{ever been}} so bucked by {{a bit of}} news. I felt I had misjudged Rollo. Evidently, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know him better, {{he had a lot}} of {{intelligence}} in him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, o' man, I got a cheque. And it's {{got to go}} into a {{bank for}} you, against <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go to school. See? So's you'll grow up knowing your way about a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} {{failed to get}} there. It is hardly {{possible}} {{that you should have}} done so, in the time. I suppose, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Gakdul, you learned that the Dervishes were at Abu Klea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{not quite}} big enough to use, yet," [...] whispered the eldest Rover. [...] "But {{we hope to have}} it big enough by to-morrow. It's slow work, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be on your guard all the while." ...|$|R
60|$|Henery {{appeared}} in a drab kerseymere great-coat, buttoned over his smock-frock, the white skirts of the latter being visible to the distance of about a foot below the coat-tails, which, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> the style of dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental--it certainly was comfortable.|$|R
60|$|And {{my advice}} to all people is, Don't stay at home {{any more than you}} can help; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>GOT</b> <b>to</b> stay at home a while, buy a package of those {{insurance}} tickets and sit up nights. You cannot be too cautious.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I mean--suppose {{you were}} popping in any case. Suppose you had {{happened}} to buy a ticket for New York on to-morrow's boat, wouldn't {{you try to get}} in touch with this girl <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> America, and see if you couldn't--er--fix up something?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you see, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{talking about}} the funeral, I just got all full {{of the idea of}} our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum." ...|$|E
60|$|Mike had {{not been}} greatly fascinated by the stranger's looks; but, after all, the most supercilious person on earth {{has a right to}} his own property. Besides, he might have been quite a nice fellow <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know him. Anyhow, the bag had better be {{returned}} at once. The trainwas already moving quite fast, and Mike's compartment was nearing the end of the platform.|$|E
5000|$|Plan B quotes {{the motto}} {{at the end}} of his song [...] "Sick 2 def". The name of the whole album Who Needs Actions <b>When</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> Words seems <b>to</b> be related to the same theme.|$|R
60|$|She dug {{away at the}} red plush {{with the}} hatpin, picking out little bits and {{dropping}} them over the edge. I {{could see she was}} bracing herself to put me wise to the whole trouble. There's a time comes when things aren't going right, and you've had all <b>you</b> can stand, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> tell somebody about it, no matter who it is.|$|R
6000|$|... "And mostly I'd {{take them}} from you. But hang it, Seattle {{is just a}} day away, and you'll forget me. Wish I could kidnap you. Have half a mind to. Take you way up into the mountains, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> {{roughing}} it in sure-enough wilderness--say you'd helped me haul timber for a flume--then we'd be real pals.

6000|$|... "It war {{a longer}} tramp nor we had looked vor, and though we sometoimes got a lift i' a cart we was all pretty footsore {{when we got}} to the end of our journey. The village as we was bound for stood oop on t' top of a flattish hill, one side of which seemed to ha' been cut away by a knife, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the edge there you were a-standing at the end o' the world.

6000|$|... "Yes, you! At the {{commencement}} of your madness you tended me and cared for me {{as if you had}} been my mother. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> lose all `method in your madness' I was well enough to take care of myself and you too. Secondly, I found this wooden leg in the carpenter's berth, and gladly availed myself of its services, though it is three inches too short, and causes me to hobble in a most undignified manner. Thirdly, we are here alone because there is no one else with us. You took good care of that by cutting the ropes before any of our crew could get aboard--so you told me just before you went mad." ...|$|E
60|$|The widow {{she cried}} over me, {{and called me}} a poor lost lamb, and she called {{me a lot of}} other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing {{commenced}} again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{hang the}} fat, Bullen; {{it would not}} matter one way or another, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do {{yourself}} up in uniform, and make tremendous marches, and so on. I should not want to walk, at all; I should have chambers somewhere close to the club, and could always charter a hansom, when I wanted to go anywhere. Besides, fat is eminently respectable, in an elderly man." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy {{looked at}} the speaker with admiration. After all, there was a breezy {{delirium}} about Spike's methods of thought that was rather stimulating <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> it. The worst {{of it was that}} it did not fit in with practical, everyday life. Under different conditions--say, during convivial evenings at Bloomingdale--he could imagine the Bowery boy being a charming companion. How pleasantly, for instance, such remarks as that last would while away the monotony of a padded cell! ...|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not seem}} {{offended}} at this. [...] "Yes, I suppose so. And I've gone on being fonder and fonder of you every minute since that day. I wanted to call <b>you</b> back <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had <b>got</b> half-way <b>to</b> Eastport." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, but say, {{any of you}} fellows ever stay at the Rippleton, in Chicago? I don't want to knock--I {{believe in}} {{boosting}} wherever you can--but say, of all the rotten dumps that pass 'emselves off as first-class hotels, that's the worst. I'm going to get those guys, one of these days, and I told 'em so. You know how I am--well, maybe you don't know, but I'm accustomed to first-class accommodations, and I'm perfectly {{willing to pay a}} reasonable price. I got into Chicago late the other night, and the Rippleton's near the station--I'd never been there before, but I says to the taxi-driver--I always believe in taking a taxi when you get in late; may cost a little more money, but, gosh, it's worth it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be up early next morning and out selling a lot of crabs--and I said to him, 'Oh, just drive me over to the Rippleton.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Guy, on {{the other}} hand, found himself almost equally {{surprised}} in turn at the rapid way he grew really to be fond of Granville Kelmscott. Though Kelmscott knew, as he thought, the terrible secret of his half-unconscious crime--for he could feel now how completely he had acted under Montague Nevitt's compelling influence--Guy was aware before long of such a profound and deep-seated sympathy existing between them, that he became exceedingly attached in time to his friendly fellow-prisoner. In spite of the one barrier they could never break down, he spoke freely by degrees to Granville of everything else in his whole life; and Granville in return spoke to him just as freely. A good fellow, Granville, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know him. There was only a single trait in his character Guy couldn't endure; and that was his ingrained love of money-grubbing. For the way the man pounced down upon those dirty little stones, when he saw them in the mud, and hoarded them up in his belt, and seemed prepared to defend them with his very life-blood, Guy couldn't conceal from himself-the fact that he fairly despised him. Such vulgar, common-place, unredeemed love of pelf! Such mere bourgeois avarice! Of what use could those wretched pebbles be to him here in the dusty plains of far inland Africa? ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{talked about}} the {{different}} instructors, how awful they were, and how they made you cry sometimes, they were so hard on your work; but if you amounted to anything, you did not mind it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> feel what they meant; then you {{wanted them to be}} harsh. They said of one, [...] "My! You ought to see him! He can spoil your drawing for you! He just takes your charcoal, and puts thick black lines all over everything. It don't do to finish much for him." [...] They celebrated another for sitting down in front of your work, and drooping in silent despair before it for awhile, and then looking up at you in cold disgust, and asking, [...] "What made you draw it that way?" [...] as if it were inconceivable anybody should have been willing to do it so. There were other instructors who were known to have the idea of getting at the best in you by a sympathetic interest in what you had tried for, and looking for some good in it. The girls dramatized their manner of doing this; they did not hold them in greater regard than the harder masters, but they did not hold them in less, and some of them seemed to value an instructor as much for the way he squinted his eyes at your drawing as for what he said of it.|$|E
5000|$|Actually, the P-40 could engage all Messerschmitts {{on equal}} terms, {{almost to the}} end of 1943. If you take into {{consideration}} all the characteristics of the P-40, then the Tomahawk was equal to the Bf 109F and the Kittyhawk was slightly better. Its speed and vertical and horizontal manoeuvre were good and fully competitive with enemy aircraft. Acceleration rate was a bit low, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> used <b>to</b> the engine, it was OK. We considered the P-40 a decent fighter plane. N. G.

6000|$|HAWKING. Because, sir, {{the courts}} will sustain {{the claim of}} a man--and that man the eldest son--against any woman, if they can. I warned <b>you,</b> Mrs. Dudgeon, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> draw that other will, {{that it was not}} a wise will, and that though you might make him sign it, he would never be easy until he revoked it. But you wouldn't take advice; and now Mr. Richard is cock of the walk. (He takes his hat from the floor; rises; and begins {{pocketing}} his papers and spectacles.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad of that," [...] Fergus said. [...] "I {{think it}} is very cheery and sociable when {{everyone}} smokes, but certainly when only two out of three do, it looks somehow as if the one who does not is left out in the cold. I never smoked until I came out here, two years and a half ago; but {{there is no doubt that}} at the end of a day's hard work, or <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do a long ride in the dark, it is very comforting." ...|$|R
5000|$|Architect Edwin Kado {{describes}} {{the building as}} follows: [...] "I originally designed a building that cantilevered toward the river, so {{it was like a}} pyramid upside down. It was 12 stories, and so <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the top floor, it was 120 feet toward the river. When I presented it {{to the president of the}} Money Store, he thought it was interesting, but he wanted a symmetrical building... I then suggested this shape...because that shape connotes stability, and I thought it would be a good image for the Money Store." ...|$|E
5000|$|Riding for Alien was great; like, there wasn't any bad vibes or anything. I {{really liked}} the company, I really liked {{everyone}} involved in it and I became friends with everyone. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> quit a company like that, you wanna blow your brains out, you know? I only spoke to Carter and that's probably, like, {{one of the hardest}} calls I had to make and just talked to him and he was, like, [...] "Well, fuck man, it's a bummer, but it's, like, you gotta do what you gotta do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roll 'Em Sholem" [...] {{they used}} to call him. All he would say before every scene was [...] "Roll 'Em!" [...] And then <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the end of the scene he'd say [...] "Cut!" [...] and then he'd look at the script clerk and say, [...] "Did they say all the words?", and if so that was it. When the picture was over I went to the front office at Universal and asked to be {{released}} from my contract. They thought I was crazy. But I thought, [...] "If this is my big break, then I'm not going very far.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, Mr. Quatermain. We do {{business}} with these people, also they sometimes come to be doctored by Rodd when they are sick, so this place is sacred ground to them.

6000|$|... "Well, Mary, I {{never thought}} you were a little goose, before. What {{nonsense}} you are talking! It was only natural you should have thought I was jealous; and I should have been jealous, if it had been anyone else you were praising so much. It was my fault, for not telling you at once. Concealments are always stupid; but I had thought that it would give you a pleasant surprise, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> home, <b>to</b> hear about it; but instead of causing you pleasure, I have caused you pain.

6000|$|... "It did {{not seem}} as if naked savages could stand {{infantry}} armed with breech-loaders, but you see the Zulus did. It does not seem possible these Arabs can stand for a moment against our charge; but, you see, {{we do not understand}} these fellows. One knows what regular infantry can do against cavalry, and it may be we shall find that these Arabs are not to be ridden over as easily as we think. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> reckon with men who don't care the snap of a finger whether they are killed or not, you never can count upon an easy victory however badly they may be armed, and however undisciplined they may be.|$|R
