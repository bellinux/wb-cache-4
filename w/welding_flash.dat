40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} work is to analyze the {{influence}} of external <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> on the formability of friction stir welding sheets through in-plane plane-strain formability tests. The load-extension behavior and forming limit strains are measured to quantify the formability. The influence of friction stir welding parameters on the height of <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> was also studied. The base materials used for welding trials are AA 6061 T 6 and AA 5052 H 32 alloy sheets of 2. 1 -mm thickness. It is observed that the influence of external <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> on the maximum load and total extension for all the friction stir welding conditions is negligible. The effect of <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> on the limiting major strain is also insignificant. But the presence of <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> has changed the limiting minor strain, more toward plane-strain condition, indicating the change in strain-path toward plane-strain. This {{is due to the}} strain taken by <b>weld</b> <b>flash,</b> along with the major strain, minor strain, and thickness strain in the friction stir welding sheet plane because of constancy of volume.

30|$|The {{material}} being welded experiences {{very hot}} processing conditions as the tool pin rotates {{at very high}} speeds. Therefore, excessive heat generated, thermally softens the material near the boundary of the tool-shoulder and expels large volumes of material {{in the form of}} surface flash. Excessive tool-shoulder frictional heat softening of the material is the reason for the formation of the flash, and high tool-shoulder pressure leads to the ejection of an excessive amount of flash (Bo et al. 2011). Incorrect tool pin length relative to workpiece thickness and change in penetration depth due to variation in plate thickness along the weld line or due to a bowed plate can lead to a lack of penetration. When the pin plug depth is high, the plastic material near the pin is extruded, which results in <b>weld</b> <b>flash.</b> When the pin depth is very high, extruded flash can occur at the roots of the weld, near the pin. At larger tool tilt angles, insufficient plasticised material remains to fill the cavity left in the weld nugget and <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> appears on the retreating side (Keivani et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} weight {{reduction}} in aircrafts has promoted {{the employment of}} hybrid materials such as Fiber Metal Laminates (FML) in the fuselage. Since thin aluminum foils can only be produced in limited width by the available rolling process, several layers of metal must be overlapped, forming a so-called splicing, to build large fuselage structures increasing weight and manufacturing costs due to its manual assembly. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) represents a plausible alternative for avoiding splicing by joining the aluminum foils to obtain a wider metal sheet configuration. In this study, tomographic investigations of post-mortem fatigue and in-situ tensile tests were carried out for fiber metal laminates (FML) containing 3 layers of friction stir welded AlMgSc AA 5024 alloy foil and 2 layer of {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP). The aim of these investigations is to identify the damage mechanisms and sequence of damage during quasi static and fatigue loading conditions of the FML as well as to determine microstructural features responsible for tensile and fatigue damage. The tensile tests were carried out using the stop/go technique. The specimen were loaded until a pre-determined stress level and held.

The data collected included patients’ demographic information, initial best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), clinical findings, time to AMT, duration of epithelization, additional treatments, posttreatment BCVA, {{and the results of}} psychiatric examination. RESULTS: All patients were male, with the mean age of 37. 9 ± 5. 4 y. The patients had received 0. 5 % proparacaine hydrochloride due to pain resulting from foreign bodies, such as <b>welding</b> <b>flash</b> burns and car battery explosions, for a mean of 18. 2 ± 12. 4 d. The mean initial BCVA of the patients was 0. 069 ± 0. 100. All patients had persistent epithelial defects, stromal infiltration, ring ulcer, and corneal edema. Initially, medical treatment was attempted in all cases. Because of severe pain, persistent epithelial defects and progressing stromal thinning did not improve with medical treatment, thus, the patients underwent AMT. The mean posttreatment BCVA of the patients was 0. 33 ± 0. 27. All of them, except for two patients, showed improved visual acuity. One patient underwent evisceration for corneal melting and endophthalmitis in another center, and one patient underwent evisceration for severe pain of unknown origin. All 5 patients who consented to a psychiatric examination had depression, had personality disorder, and used tobacco.

40|$|Welding is {{associated}} with several ocular and systemic hazards especially where adequate protective measures are not taken.   The purpose of this project was to study the eye protection practices and symptoms among welders in the Capricorn District of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Questionnaires designed to investigate eye protection practices and symptoms experienced were completed byone hundred and fifty (150) welders. The types of welding done were shielded metal arc (84 %), oxyacetylene gas (4 %) and silver brazing (12 %). The number of years spent in the welding industry ranged from one to 10 years {{with a mean of}} 5 ± 3. 1 years and the number of hours of welding per day ranged from one to 10 hours with a mean of 6 ± 2. 1 hours. A large percentage of the welders (89 %) reported wearing protective devices when welding and the most common protective devices used by the welders were: helmets (57 %), goggles(22 %), and face shields (15 %). Six percent used inefficient protective devices such as sunglasses.   Sixty one percent reported occasional exposure to <b>welding</b> <b>flashes</b> when not wearing any eye protection. Welding-related eye symptoms reported included foreign body sensation (18 %), persistent after-images (31 %), and watery eyes (50 %).   Al- though the majority of the welders wore protective devices while welding, a few did not always use such devices while others used sunglasses for protection.   Moreover, many of the welders were occasionally, and only a few were always, exposed to <b>welding</b> <b>flashes</b> when protective devices were not used. Therefore, we concluded that eye protectionpractices amongst the welders appeared to be inadequate to avoid hazards associated with welding.   It is recommended that an eye protection educational campaign for welders should form part of the SouthAfrican Government’s workplace safety program.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Installation of new {{pipelines}} {{is predicted}} to grow at a rapid rate over the next twenty years, {{due in part to}} the increase use worldwide of combined cycle power generation plant using natural gas a fuel. The need to construct large diameter pipelines over long distances has led to an increased demand to improve the productivity of pipeline girth welding. Many novel techniques have been tried in the past to achieve productivity gains, including laser <b>welding,</b> <b>flash</b> butt welding, homopolar welding, and radial friction welding. In spite of the failure to gain wide acceptance, there is still current development aimed at achieving their eventual implementation. Single wire mechanised gas metal arc welding (GMAW) remains the dominant pipe girth welding technique, and has been optimised in the past to produce the maximum productivity possible with this process. Continued development of GMAW with dual torch, tandem GMAW welding and novel techniques for GMAW roots is leading to further significant gains in arc welding productivity. This paper describes a new development, the CAPS project, (Cranfield Automated Pipe-welding System), where tandem GMAW in a narrow groove has been applied to pipeline girth welding with two tandem torches in a single welding head. The CAPS system offers welding productivity three to four times higher than that possible with the conventional single wire GMAW technique, while still producing a weld which is very similar to that generated by single wire welding. The development of the system is described, as well as recent successful trials under field conditions. The development of high power lasers has spurred a current high level of interest in the possibility of application to pipeline welding, and current research is described in which the feasibility of pipeline laser welding has been established...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} project the feasibility was studied of finding {{an appropriate way}} of welding rings for a continuous variable transmission push-belt made out of strip material (- 10 mm wide, 0. 4 mm thick). The focus was on having the desired dimensions after welding {{in combination with the}} desired metallurgical and mechanica! properties. The wider aim of this project was twofold; firstly to obtain a higher quality in terms of a smoother surface of the rings, and secondly to reduce the casts of the production of the rings. The way of achieving these aims was by finding an appropriate welding process that could satisfy the geometrical and metallurgical demands set to the rings for the transmission push-belt. After a literature research different welding processes were tested including laser beam welding, electron beam welding, plasma are welding, upset <b>welding,</b> <b>flash</b> welding and 'mash resistance' welding. Same of these were tested with different experimental arrangements. These experiments were evaluated using optical microscopy, white light interferometry and hardness tests. The experiments were done on three different maraging steels the trade names which are Ultrafort, Durimphy and Phytime. The Ultrafort did not show similar behaviour to Durimphy and Phytime. This material proved to be less appropriate for this study, whereas Durimphy and Phytime are applicable for the transmission pushbelt. The latter two materials did not show metallurgical difficulties during welding. From these tests four welding processes were found to be applicable for the ring welding of a transmission push-belt. The first two processes are continuous wave laser beam welding and plasma are welding using two different experimental welding arrangements; a run-on and run-off tab at the start and end of the seam and the second arrangement involved welding different rings adjacent to each other (so called multiple ring welding). The last two processes applicable are upset welding and flash butt welding. Material Science and EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E

Masking of parts of the PANI films during <b>flash</b> <b>welding</b> enabled the formation of adjacent conducting and insulating regions as the welding changes the electrical properties of the film. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the sharpness of these edges, and indicated that the interface between the <b>flash</b> <b>welded</b> and masked regions of the PANI films was typically less than 15 mu m wide. Secondly, using longpass filters, light with a wavelength less than 570 nm was found not to contribute to the welding process.

This novel approach enabled patterning of PANI films using a direct writing technique with a narrow wavelength light source...|$|R
50|$|Soldered joints {{can fail}} {{in many ways}} like {{electromigration}} and formation of brittle intermetallic layers. Some failures show only at extreme joint temperatures, hindering troubleshooting. Thermal expansion mismatch between the printed circuit board material and its packaging strains the part-to-board bonds; while leaded parts can absorb the strain by bending, leadless parts rely on the solder to absorb stresses. Thermal cycling may lead to fatigue cracking of the solder joints, especially with elastic solders; various approaches are used to mitigate such incidents. Loose particles, like bonding wire and <b>weld</b> <b>flash,</b> can form in the device cavity and migrate inside the packaging, causing often intermittent and shock-sensitive shorts. Corrosion may cause buildup of oxides and other nonconductive products on the contact surfaces. When closed, these then show unacceptably high resistance; they may also migrate and cause shorts. Tin whiskers can form on tin-coated metals like the internal side of the packagings; loose whiskers then can cause intermittent short circuits inside the packaging.

40|$|A {{combination}} of neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction {{was used to}} measure and map the full three-dimensional state of residual stress across the cross-section in coupon samples of metal-inert-gas (MIG) -welded 2024 aluminium alloy. Samples were analysed both as-welded and following a post-welding skim which served to remove the <b>weld</b> <b>flash</b> and reduce the plate thickness. The profile of the residual stress and its evolution following skimming has been accurately characterized. The longitudinal direction shows the highest residual stress, approaching 300 MPa in tension. The skimming treatment did not change the peak stress, but the overall profile of stress was altered: this is slightly unexpected as machining away stressed material would generally be expected to reduce the peak residual stress. The results are discussed in terms of the generation of stress during welding and its evolution during skimming. Finally a comparison is made with the stress generated in the as-welded and skimmed conditions of a variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA) -welded specimen of similar dimensions, to show the effects of different weld processes on the residual stress generated.

Titanium industrial powders, type PT 5 - 1 were used as original substance. Forming of blanks, whose chemical composition corresponded to BT 1 - 0 alloy, was carried out using the powder metallurgy method.

The equipment used for upset welding {{is very similar to}} that used for <b>flash</b> <b>welding.</b> It can be used only if the parts to be welded are equal in cross-sectional area. The abutting surfaces must be very carefully prepared to provide for proper heating.The difference from <b>flash</b> <b>welding</b> is that the parts are clamped in the welding machine and force is applied bringing them tightly together. High-amperage current is then passed through the joint, which heats the abutting surfaces. When they have been heated to a suitable forging temperature an upsetting force is applied and the current is stopped. The high temperature of the work at the abutting surfaces plus the high pressure causes coalescence to take place. After cooling, the force is released and the weld is completed.|$|R

Male workers had a 3. 99 higher odds ratio (OR) than females to suffer from eye injuries (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 99 - 8. 04). Most of the work-related eye injuries occurred in subjects who were 30 - 49 years old (OR, 3. 02, and 95 % CI, 1. 56 - 5. 82, when compared with those aged ≤ 29 years). The most common type of eye injury in the occupational exposure group was foreign body injury (31. 2 %), followed by blunt injuries (20. 6 %), chemical burn (19. 6 %), UV light radiation (12. 7 %), and corneal abrasions (11. 6 %). On the other hand, in the non-occupational exposure group, the most common types of eye injury were blunt injuries (43. 4 %), corneal abrasions (28. 3 %), and foreign body injury (20. 2 %). Our study found that foreign body injury and blunt injuries were the two highest priority injuries for which prevention strategies should be developed in Kaohsiung city.
