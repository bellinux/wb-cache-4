5|$|Since Juster did {{the cooking}} for the housemates, if Feiffer <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> {{he had to}} do the drawings. Feiffer quickly {{realized}} the book would require illustrations of the type and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and although a nationally-known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book to be a success and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré's drawings as an inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The dinner {{scene was}} shot in a revamped version of the Enterprise-D's {{observation}} lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard), and an unnamed Andorian ambassador. The food prepared for the scene was colored blue so it would look alien. None of the actors <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights), {{and it became a}} running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.|$|E
5|$|The redeveloped Hampden was {{the venue}} for a boxing card headlined by former world {{champion}} Mike Tyson in June 2000. Tyson knocked down Lou Savarese after just 12 {{seconds of the}} fight, which the referee stopped after 38 seconds. The fight ended in farce as the referee, who had been attempting to separate the two fighters, was also knocked down by Tyson. The disappointed crowd booed Tyson out of the ring, while former fighters Jim Watt and Barry McGuigan criticised his actions. After the fight, Tyson claimed that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the children of world champion Lennox Lewis, which also drew criticism.|$|E

5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E
25|$|Another version tells {{that two}} Sioux boys wandered {{far from their}} village when Mato the bear, a huge {{creature}} that had claws the size of tipi poles, spotted them, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them for breakfast. He was almost upon them when the boys prayed to Wakan Tanka the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato {{tried to get up}} from every side, leaving huge scratch marks as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the Black Hills at what is now Bear Butte. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist Herbert A. Collins hangs over the fireplace in the visitor's center at Devils Tower.|$|E
25|$|Uglúk was the deep-voiced {{captain of}} the Uruk-hai band that {{attacked}} the Fellowship at Amon Hen and captured Merry and Pippin. The Uruk-hai were accompanied by contingents of Orcs from Mordor and Moria, but Uglúk and his fellow Isengarders claimed credit for killing Boromir. He defended Merry and Pippin from Moria Orcs who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them, citing orders to bring the Hobbits to Saruman in good health. He also objected to accusations of cannibalism made by Grishnákh, {{the leader of the}} Mordor contingent. When Grishnákh returned with two or three dozen other Mordor Orcs, Uglúk gullibly accepted their offer of help at face value. Uglúk was usually effective at instilling discipline, although this once required beheading a few Moria dissenters. He and the combined bands were tracked by Éomer's band of Rohirrim on their way to Isengard until, near the eaves of Fangorn forest, they were surrounded and annihilated, Uglúk being slain by Éomer personally.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home at two in the morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E
2500|$|His {{vaudeville}} / baseball partner Andy Cohen recalled Hogan {{as someone}} who [...] "could {{have been one of}} the best catchers ever... but he ate himself out of the big leagues." [...] Hogan showed up for camp one year weighing [...] and would run in a rubber suit and take hot showers in an effort to lose weight, but then he'd eat more to regain his strength, and weight. Giants manager John McGraw tried to control Hogan's weight by watching his meal checks, but Hogan developed a system where he would write down foods McGraw would want him to eat, which the waitresses knew to replace with the foods Hogan <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> As Cohen recalled, [...] "He'd write down spinach, but that meant potatoes. He had a whole code of his own." ...|$|E

[...] "Dust off" [...] them, she gave one to Frank.
