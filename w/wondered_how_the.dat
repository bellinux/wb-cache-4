5|$|Before {{its release}} on 10 June 2005, one preview <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> film would fare {{at the box}} office. Citing {{comparisons}} with the 1953 version, the preview suggested that debutant director, Sarkar's inexperience in film-making, the probable inability of debutant actress, Balan to portray Lalita's character appropriately, suitable 1960s depiction by contemporary actors and musician, Shantanu Moitra's until then unimpressive soundtracks, could be impediments to a successful adaptation.|$|E
5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 {{would be hard-pressed to}} imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Star Trek franchise could ever come back from the total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E

25|$|Catecholamines are {{synthesized}} inside {{cells and}} sequestered in intracellular vesicles. This was first shown by Blaschko and Arnold Welch (1908–2003) in Oxford and by Hillarp {{and his group}} in Lund for the adrenal medulla and later for sympathetic nerves and the brain. In addition the vesicles contained adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with a molar noradrenaline:ATP ratio in sympathetic nerve vesicles of 5.2:1 as determined by Hans-Joachim Schümann (1919–1998) and Horst Grobecker (born 1934) in Peter Holtz′ group at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Blaschko and Welch <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> catecholamines got out when nervous impulses reached the cells. Exocytosis was not among the possibilities they considered. It required the analogy of the ″quantal″ release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction shown by Bernard Katz, third winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the demonstration of the co-release with catecholamines of other vesicle constituents such as ATP and dopamine β-hydroxylase; and the unquestionable electron microscopic images of vesicles fusing with the cell membrane – to establish exocytosis.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director.

500|$|The draft-day {{trade that}} sent {{franchise}} scoring leader Kent Nilsson to Minnesota, {{along with a}} third round selection, for second round draft picks in 1985 and 1987 was immediately controversial in Calgary as players and fans were divided on the merit of dealing Nilsson. While some players felt the trade was inevitable, others expressed their disappointment at the move, including co-captain Lanny McDonald, who <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> team would replace Nilsson's offensive production.|$|E

500|$|Dustin Hoffman {{says that}} the play {{was the first one}} he ever read and predated his {{interest}} in becoming an [...] actor. He noted that the play resonated with him because his father was a travelling salesman and he had an older brother. Hoffman eventually played the role in a high-school production. In 1965, Hoffman served as the assistant director in an off-Broadway revival of A View from the Bridge at the Sheridan Square Playhouse with a cast that included Robert Duvall and Jon Voight. The show's director Ulu Grosbard suggested to Miller that Hoffman had the potential to make a great Willy Loman. Miller was unimpressed and later wrote that [...] "My estimate of Grosbard all but collapsed as, observing Dustin Hoffman's awkwardness and his big nose that never seemed to get unstuffy, I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> poor fellow imagined himself a candidate for any kind of acting career." ...|$|E
500|$|Hesketh was {{influenced}} {{in the early}} planning stages by his friends, including mill owners Samuel Fielden and Benjamin Whitworth. They pointed out that mill workers would not wish to make day trips to the seaside all year round, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> people of the new town would be occupied during the winter months. They encouraged Hesketh {{to build a new}} port; because charges at Liverpool were on the rise, and there were no reasonable alternatives for Manchester mill owners, both Whitworth and Fielden agreed that they would make good use of a port on the Fylde coast. Hesketh soon found that he {{was not the only one}} thinking of extending the railway, or of building a new port. He had competition from the residents of Lytham, a village about [...] south of Rossall, at the mouth of the River Ribble. They were already planning the formation of the Preston Port Company; Hesketh acted quickly and applied to the official railway committee to have a port built on the River Wyre. The committee agreed to hear all applications.|$|E
500|$|Paris's Théâtre des Champs-Élysées {{was a new}} structure, {{which had}} opened on 2 April 1913 with a {{programme}} celebrating the works {{of many of the}} leading composers of the day. The theatre's manager, Gabriel Astruc, was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs per performance, double what he had paid the previous year. [...] The programme for 29 May 1913, as well as the Stravinsky premiere, [...] included Les Sylphides, Weber's Le Spectre de la Rose and Borodin's Polovtsian Dances. Ticket sales for the evening, ticket prices being doubled for a premiere, amounted to 35,000 francs. Final rehearsals were held on the day before the premiere, in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests. According to Stravinsky all went peacefully. However, the critic of L'Écho de Paris, Adolphe Boschot, foresaw possible trouble; he <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> public would receive the work, and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked.|$|E

500|$|Gabe Graziani of GameSpy {{praised the}} presentation, {{saying that it}} {{contained}} a [...] "stunning amount of graphical flair" [...] {{as well as a}} smooth framerate, and summarised that it updated the PSP titles Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse to HD [...] "magnificently". Jesse Costantino of Game Revolution said that Wipeout HD [...] "joins an elite class of current-gen racers" [...] due to its 1080p visuals and a nearly constant 60 frames per second. Costantino also praised the richly detailed environments of the race tracks, stating that he felt like they [...] "exist in a real world". Frédéric Goyon of Jeuxvideo.com said Wipeout HD was atypically a [...] "high flying achievement" [...] regarding its visuals, and also thought the combined colour choices made it a visually unique racing game. Ryan Davis from Giant Bomb praised the game's transition to HD, stating that he <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> Wipeout series [...] "made do" [...] without 1080p visuals prior to the release of Wipeout HD. In addition, Davis also commended the ship design and [...] "rock solid" [...] framerate. Terry Terrones of GamePro said that the game was visually stunning, but also implied that it was [...] "essentially a pig with lipstick".|$|E
500|$|Like Isler, Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Ken Tucker enjoyed Walter's transition [...] "from happy, babbling, 'I love LSD!' licorice-licking Walter to a Walter who {{yelled at}} the others when escaping", calling it [...] "one of the night's great pleasures." [...] Tucker's Entertainment Weekly colleague Jeff Jensen commented {{that he was able}} to [...] "roll" [...] with some of the less plausible plot details (such as a still existing Massive Dynamic) out of praise for guest stars Cusick and Haig, believing they [...] "worked well in this world." [...] Jensen also reserved attention for Noble's scenes, calling them variously [...] "frisky and poignant", [...] "hilarious", and [...] "touching." [...] Lastly, Jensen was happy to find more details about the Observers, but wondered at the lack of the parallel universe's mention. MTV's Alex Zalben was more critical. He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> episode fit into the rest of the season, and wrote [...] "It’s a curious step, and could likely drive even more viewers away from a show that can’t afford to lose them." [...] While disliking the [...] "clunky, explainy" [...] dialogue, Zalben still commented that, [...] "for a die hard FRINGE fan like myself, this episode was crack. Huge emotion, crazy science, and epic set pieces. The end of the episode had me dying to watch the next one, even if it isn’t a direct continuation. That’s good television right there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Adrift" [...] first {{surfaced}} on February 2007, {{before the}} airing of [...] "First Strike". By March it was confirmed {{to be the}} first of a two-part opening for the fourth season along with [...] "Lifeline" [...] and would be similar in style to [...] "Progeny" [...] and [...] "The Real World". The producers kept trying {{to find new ways to}} [...] "out-do" [...] the efforts of the previous seasons, which they described was [...] "different" [...] to them, since they introduced more of a balance between team-based and character-based episodes. After the completion of [...] "First Strike", the producers thought it was the biggest episode they have ever done, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> fourth season would top that. During the writing stages, Martin Gero wanted the episode to [...] "tee up" [...] with the last episode of the season, and hence wanted the episode to become part of a story-arc for the entire season. Gero also wanted the episode to have [...] "no down time" [...] for the characters like the previous season premieres. After Zelenka gets injured, a scene where a Puddle Jumper was originally meant to pick them both up. However, having a Jumper set nearby in an Atlantis set would not be practical enough, and was cut. He also wrote to have Sheppard in an uneased state while forced to take command of Atlantis. The scene where McKay and Zelenka converse and finish each other's sentences were parallel to the arguing between Gero and Wood while working together on set. He considered the scene between Teyla and Weir to be the cliffhanger, but was changed to the following scene, as Gero felt that would be the better cliffhanger, similar to the one for [...] "The Return, Part 1".|$|E

2500|$|Just {{after the}} first {{measurements}} on the quantum Hall effect in 1980, physicists <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> strongly localized electrons in the disordered potential were able to delocalize at their phase transitions. At that time, the field theory of Anderson localization didn't yet include a topological angle and hence it predicted that: [...] "for any given amount of disorder, all states in two dimensions are localized". A result that was irreconcilable with the observations on delocalization. Without knowing {{the solution to this}} problem, physicists resorted to a semi-classical picture of localized electrons that, given a certain energy, were able to percolate through the disorder. [...] This percolation mechanism was what assumed to delocalize the electrons ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe Morgenstern, {{film critic}} for The Wall Street Journal, opened his review by asking: [...] "Is After Earth the worst movie ever made?" [...] His answer was [...] "Maybe not; there's always Battlefield Earth {{to remind us}} how low the bar can go." [...] Like Morgenstern, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times made note of the film's use of central themes in Scientology before {{concluding}} the film {{was nothing more than}} a [...] "big-screen vanity project". Los Angeles Times reviewer Betsy Sharkey <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> elder Smith could have gone from the charismatic performance in the serious film The Pursuit of Happyness, also co-starring his son, to the performance in After Earth. She also saw compounding problems in the creative process leading to a lack of subtlety and nuance: [...] "The script has no nuance, none. And when Shyamalan moves into the director's chair, the script problems are magnified." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety opined that the film was further proof that Shyamalan had become a [...] "director-for-hire", with [...] "his disinterest palpable from first frame to last". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film one star out of five, calling it [...] "another uncompromisingly terrible film ... featuring a triple-whammy of abysmal acting, directing and story" [...] and saying that Jaden Smith [...] "plays the role throughout with a face like a smacked bum" [...] and [...] "Kitai [...] must be like his dad: show no fear.

2500|$|Dustin Hoffman {{acted as}} {{assistant}} director and stage {{manager for a}} successful 1965 production of the play Off-Broadway at the Sheridan Square Playhouse in New York City. The play's director, Ulu Grosbard, suggested to Arthur Miller that Hoffman would one day make a great Willy Loman (a role that Hoffman would later play to great acclaim).

An award-winning production in New York opened on December 14, 1997, at the Criterion Center Stage Right and subsequently transferred to the Neil Simon Theatre. It ran for 239 performances. It was directed by Michael Mayer and the cast included Anthony LaPaglia, Allison Janney, and a young Brittany Murphy. The production won the Tony Award for: Best Revival of a Play; Best Leading Actor in a Play (LaPaglia); it also won Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Revival, Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play (Janney), and Outstanding Direction of a Play.

2500|$|After Hamlet {{came to a}} {{close in}} August 1964, Burton and Taylor {{continued}} making films together. The first film after their marriage, The Sandpiper, was poorly received but still became a commercially successful venture. According to Bragg, the films they made during the mid-1960s contained a lot of innuendos that referred directly to their private lives. Burton went on to star opposite Claire Bloom and Oskar Werner in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), a Cold War espionage story about a British Intelligence agent, Alec Leamas (Burton), who is sent to East Germany on a mission to find and expose a mole working within his organisation for an East German Intelligence officer, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck). Martin Ritt, the film's director and producer, wanted Burton's character to exhibit more anonymity, which meant no display of eloquent speeches or intense emotional moments. Bragg believed this decision worried Burton, as he had generated his reputation as an actor with those exact traits, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> film's would turn out. Ritt, a non-drinker, was displeased with Burton's drinking habits as he felt it [...] "lacked a certain discipline" [...] and expected the same level of commitment from him as everyone else during filming. In spite of their differences, Alpert notes that the film transpired well. Based on the 1963 novel of the same name by John le Carré, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold garnered positive reviews, with Fernando F. Croce of Slant Magazine describing Burton's performance as more of [...] "tragic patsy than swashbuckler" [...] and believed his scenes with Werner [...] "have sharp doses of suspicion, cynicism and sadness". Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader called the film [...] "Grim, monotonous, and rather facile", he found Burton's role had [...] "some honest poignancy". Variety thought Burton fitted [...] "neatly into the role of the apparently burned out British agent". Burton also made a brief appearance the same year in Clive Donner's comedy What's New Pussycat? as a man who meets the womaniser Michael James (O'Toole) in a bar.|$|E
