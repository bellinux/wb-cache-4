5|$|Due to {{the appeal}} of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury {{commissioned}} a second line of editions in an 'adult' style. These initially used black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people, but later shifted to partial colourisation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Slytherin's locket {{on the cover of the}} final book.|$|E
5|$|Following Game4, {{after the}} Yankees took a 3–1 series lead, The Philadelphia Inquirer accidentally printed a three-quarters-page Macy's {{advertisement}} congratulating the Phillies {{for winning the}} World Series, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a Phillies championship T-shirt. The newspaper subsequently apologized for the mistake.|$|E
5|$|On August 9, 2011 the {{chairman}} of the church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Germany, Rüdiger Weida, obtained a driver's license <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> him wearing a pirate bandana. In contrast to the Austrian officials in the case of Niko Alm the German officials allowed the headgear as a religious exception.|$|E

5|$|After {{the second}} match ended, Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog {{made their way}} to the ring. Their match began as Rude {{attacked}} Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times. Subsequently, Rude climbed to the wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Cheryl Roberts on them. As a result, Jake Roberts, Cheryl Roberts' husband, ran to the ring and attacked Rude, forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} Paris Flash {{claim that}} Haddock and Castafiore are engaged, {{on the basis}} of a misinterpreted interview with Professor Calculus. This results in an avalanche of congratulations from Haddock's friends. A television crew come to Marlinspike Hall to interview Castafiore and a mysterious photographer, Gino, appears with the crew. Suddenly, Irma informs Castafiore that her jewels have been stolen, and Tintin suspects Gino who runs away during a temporary power cut. Castafiore, however, finds the jewel-case she herself had misplaced. The next day, Castafiore shows Tintin and Haddock a copy of the magazine Tempo di Roma <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Castafiore taken at Marlinspike Hall without her permission, proving that Gino was only a magazine reporter.|$|E

5|$|The {{on-screen}} feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began {{weeks before}} SummerSlam. As {{part of his}} gimmick, Rude would—after winning a match—invite a pre-selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring. On one occasion, {{one of the women}} refused to comply, later identifying herself as Robert's wife, Cheryl. As the feud intensified, Rude began wearing a pair of tights <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Cheryl stenciled on them, prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked, although the live audience saw him stripped to a G-string instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a {{cholesterol-lowering}} drug developed by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other mob bosses {{who were}} remote and {{reluctant}} to talk to outsiders, Salerno was very accessible. Mafiosi from Cleveland, Philadelphia, New England, Buffalo and other cities would visit Salerno to talk about various internal problems they wanted resolved. Salerno preferred a low-key existence and led an unpretentious life. He was never spotted at glitzy mob parties, nightclubs or other popular Mafia bistros. He even sent out Christmas cards <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> himself in pajamas on the front cover.|$|E

25|$|These are {{intended}} for measuring spatial ability in children. With this test, an experimenter presents the participant with a drawing of a maze <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> {{a man in the}} centre. While the participant watches, the experimenter uses his or her finger to trace a pathway from the opening of the maze to the drawing of the man. The participant is then expected to replicate the demonstrated pathway through the maze to the drawing of the man. Mazes vary in complexity as difficulty increases.|$|E

25|$|In higher education, {{linguistic}} profiling {{has been found}} to impede student comprehension. In a 1992 study, D. Rubin found that undergraduate university students would comprehend material more poorly if they heard a non-accented lecture presented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> an Asian female. When the same non-accented lecture was presented with a European American teaching assistant, students had a greater ability to comprehend the material. This suggests that face identification may be enough to make students believe that language performance will be accented, which corresponded with a belief that comprehension would be reduced.|$|E
25|$|I {{bought my}} first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of Pelican <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a Yorkshire miner {{on the front}} – and I still have it, bandaged up and {{exhausted}} by the years of labour. From {{the first of its}} 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E
25|$|In 1701 {{a further}} legend was recorded, {{relating}} that the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (1048–1118) presented the Church with a deed {{to the entire}} land outside the former villages of Gonia and Pyrgos Kallistis {{up to the top}} of the highest mountain of the island. According to the legend, his wife Irene Doukaina also donated a large sum of money. A decree in the form of a Chrysobull was attached to the deeds, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the church on the seal. No such deed or seal has been found to date.|$|E
