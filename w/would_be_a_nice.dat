People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|In June 2008, Spears' manager Larry Rudolph told The Sun that a {{video for}} [...] "Radar" [...] {{directed}} by Spears {{was to be}} shot in Chelsea, London. The concept would have Spears and her friends chasing a man in different clubs. However, this was scrapped along with the single’s release. The music video for [...] "Radar" [...] from Circus was filmed on May 27 and 28, 2009, at the Bacara Resort & Spa located in Santa Barbara, California. It was directed by Dave Meyers, who previously worked with Spears on her music videos for [...] "Lucky", [...] "Boys" [...] and [...] "Outrageous" [...] {{as well as the}} Curious commercials. Meyers claimed the video pays tribute to the music video of Madonna's 1994 single [...] "Take a Bow". He added, [...] " [...] {{looking for a way to}} take her into a contemporary, classy environment. I felt empowered by referencing Madonna's video. Britney hasn't done anything like that". He had a very clear idea of how he wanted the story line to work: [...] "There is a narrative going on, a romantic triangle on a weekend at this polo mansion," [...] he said. [...] "A soap-opera romance." [...] Meyers commented that working with Spears again was [...] "a great celebration of trusting one another", explaining that both wanted [...] "to do something fresh and new, seeking out an actual different technique and stylistic choices and trying to find a form to celebrate them in." [...] Since the song was not the first single from Circus, Meyers chose to experiment and not have dancing scenes, saying that [...] "the videos are a chance for her to vocalize a sense of herself. The media tends to attack her, so I thought, 'Let's show the classy side of Britney and focus on a classy experience, very European-inspired'. And she's at the point in her career where I think this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> step." [...] After the video was finished, Meyers said he was happy with the lack of dancing scenes, because the cuts and dissolves kept the pace of the song.|$|E
2500|$|Conjunctions {{are used}} to link {{together}} clauses in a sentence, for example [...] "I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day but it was raining." [...] Some common conjunctions in Lithuanian are: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Grant {{of course}} is anxious to get her brother to take back his wife. They haven't {{a great deal of}} money among them, and when Mrs. Holt dies Cecilia's fortune <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> addition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A nice milksop {{he would}} have thought me!" [...] John laughed. [...] "No, if he thought I was man enough to do him service, it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> {{thing for me to}} say that I thought I was too young.|$|R
6000|$|... "There might be, perhaps; but we'll {{always come}} {{if there is}} not. For the rest of it, I'll leave it to Bunce, and just run over once or twice in the year. It <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> place for you to live at long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, yes. Didn't {{you see him}} {{the other}} night at dinner and afterwards? Of course he knows that I can give her {{a little bit of}} money, which always goes for something, Brooke. And I do think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> such <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> thing for Dolly." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was Herman also who counseled secrecy. [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> {{thing to}} {{surprise}} him," [...] he said. [...] "We'll agree {{to keep the}} scheme from him at home, if you don't give it away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell it, Mamma. It is {{time for}} our story, and that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> one, I guess," [...] said Jack, who was as fond of stories as when {{he sat in his}} mother's lap and chuckled over the hero of the beanstalk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{perhaps that}} would be the best," [...] Madam Vipon said; [...] "but you had better write to Pierre and tell him. Otherwise when he comes home, and my husband thanks him for them, he might say he had never sent them, and there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> affair." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the campaign, Yaqoob <b>was</b> offered <b>a</b> {{choice of}} two 'safe seats' by the Labour Party, one in Birmingham {{and one in}} the Black Country. She {{declined}} both, stating, [...] "If it was just about my career it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> move, but it is not all about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is evidently {{something}} about Harry," [...] {{he said to}} himself; [...] "possibly she has taken the idea into her head that he may {{fall in love with}} Agnes. That, certainly, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> thing; but I don't suppose it is anything more than an idea of mother's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> {{match for}} them, and I dare say {{she would not}} have objected." [...] And then for some ten minutes they sat looking at the fire. Peregrine had nothing more to say about it, and the baronet was {{thinking}} how best he might encourage his grandson.|$|R
6000|$|... "The pioneers {{were the}} early {{settlers}} in this country, dear. You have read {{about them in}} your history book. They endured a great many hardships, for life was very rough for them, with no railroads or anything. I think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> game to play this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] Harry laughed. [...] "How the old gent would stare if Evan was {{to walk up}} to him and say, 'Captain Bayley, I have got a foster-brother at home who, I think, is a {{relation}} of yours.' That <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> piece of cheek, wouldn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> {{brother-in-law}} for a man," [...] said Crosbie to himself, as {{the door}} closed behind the retreating scion of the de Courcy family. And then, again, he took up his pen. The letter must be written, and therefore he threw himself upon the table, resolved that the words should come and the paper be filled.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} also {{negatively}} received by Marco Lucio Papaleo (www.Everyeye.it), {{who gave it}} an overall score of 5 out of 10: [...] "Technically Dylan Dog: Dead of Night is not bad, and sometimes even interesting. But it is not Dylan Dog. And even if all the names <b>were</b> changed, it <b>would</b> just <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> movie, but actually one already seen and useless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, really,' said Sheila, 'it {{seems very}} {{difficult}} to get at the truth sometimes. And when illness is in the house I cannot understand why there should be no one available to answer the door. You must have left it ajar, unsecured, when you went out. And pray, what if Dr Ferguson had been some common tramp? That <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> thing.' ...|$|R
60|$|Christine did {{not know}} how about that; perhaps she would and perhaps she <b>would</b> not. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> pretty little cap; what would the little {{underground}} man give her for it? that was the question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing as yet, nor perhaps will be; but Moore {{is alone}} there. He has sent all the workmen he can trust to Stilbro'; {{there are only}} two women left about the place. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> {{opportunity}} for any of his well-wishers to pay him a visit, if they knew how straight the path was made before them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Toward {{the close}} of the entertainment, I {{suggested}} to Peggy, one of the girls who had waited upon us, that a cup of tea <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> thing to take; and I would thank her for one. She replied that {{it was too late for}} tea; but she would get me a cup of [...] "swipes" [...] if I wanted it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't stand mumbling to {{yourself}} there," [...] cried Ezra, catching his father's arm and half dragging him along the beach. [...] "Don't {{you understand that}} there's a hue and cry out after you, and that we'll be hung if we are taken. Wake up and exert yourself. The gallows <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> end to all your preaching and praying, wouldn't it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Patsy's cousins {{opened their}} eyes at this, {{and began to}} regard her with more {{friendly}} glances. To have ten thousand each instead of five <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> thing, indeed, and Miss Patricia Doyle had evidently become a young lady whose friendship it would pay to cultivate. If she intended to throw away the inheritance, a portion of it might fall to their share.|$|R
5000|$|For a long time, topologists {{were trying}} to prove the {{so-called}} normal Moore space conjecture: every normal Moore space is metrizable. This {{was inspired by the}} fact that all known Moore spaces that were not metrizable were also not normal. This <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> metrization theorem. There were some nice partial results at first; namely properties 7, 8 and 9 as given in the previous section.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] croaked Mrs Monnerie, [...] "you, Miss Bowater! Guilty of that silly punctilio! She {{was merely}} humouring you, child. It will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> most {{valuable}} experience. You shall be perfectly protected. Pride, eh? Or is it jealousy? Now {{what would you}} say if I promise to try and ransom the poor creature?--buy her out? pension her off? <b>Would</b> that <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> charitable little thing to do? She might make you quite a pleasant companion." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{end of our}} talk on {{the subject}} was a {{suggestion}} I made that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> act on her part to follow Longman's lead and write a little nature poem for the next number of the magazine. This {{she said she would}} do if I on my part would promise to follow her poem with one by me, and I said I would.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{say that}} he does real harm, 'Arry," [...] Mrs. Holl replied, [...] "but I do say as at present he is too full of boyish tricks to be of any good in a place, {{and we should be}} a-having him back here a week arter he went, and that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> show of {{gratitude}} to this gentleman for his kindness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, if it must be, it must,” the {{boy said}} doggedly. “I mean, if I live, {{to be a good}} man, and now that I know that it is wrong to cheat the revenue I will have no more to do with it. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> reward for all the pains Miss Warden has spent upon me to turn round and do what she tells me is wrong.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us go to {{the theatre}} to-night," [...] said Lord Henry. [...] "There {{is sure to be}} {{something}} on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White's, but it <b>is</b> only with <b>an</b> old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement. I think that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rather <b>nice</b> excuse: it would have all the surprise of candour." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shannon Appelcline {{called the}} book [...] "a nice {{complement}} {{to the earlier}} planar manuals: Manual of the Planes (2008), The Plane Below: Secrets of the Elemental Chaos (2009), and The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea (2010), leaving only {{a book on the}} Feywild to fill out the World Axis. Within the Points of Light world, Shadowfell <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> companion to [...] "Gazetteer: The Nentir Vale", but unfortunately that book had disappeared from Wizards' schedule late in 2010." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, Egbert, I {{would not}} go a-fishing this afternoon, if I were you. I {{think it is going}} to rain. Besides, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> cool day to work in the garden, and Lucy would like to have her garden made very much. You know that she was very kind to you when you were sick--how many things she did for you; and {{preparing}} her garden for her <b>would</b> <b>be</b> such <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> way of making her <b>a</b> return.
