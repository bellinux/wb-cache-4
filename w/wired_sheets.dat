40|$|Tungsten {{deposits}} usually occur within, or near to, orogenic belts {{resulting from}} subduction related plate tectonics. All major deposit types {{are associated with}} granitic intrusions or with medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks. By far the largest producing country is China with lesser quantities mined in Russia, Canada, Bolivia and other countries. Tungsten's main uses are in hard metals, e. g. tungsten carbide, for cutting, drilling and wear-resistant parts or coatings; as an alloy with steel or other metals were heat resistance is important; as <b>wire,</b> <b>sheets</b> or rods in electrical or elecontric applications; and in chemicals. Tungsten is important for these uses because of its very high melting point, very high density, extreme strength, high wear resitance, high tensile strength, low coefficient of expansion and high thermal and electrical conductivity...|$|R
50|$|One major {{aspect of}} his sculptural work {{is the use of}} new and unusual {{materials}} along with more traditional ones. He created sculptures of bronze, wood, <b>wire,</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, ceramics, enamel on metal, concrete, electrical cable, plastic and more. His aesthetic followed much of Umberto Boccioni’s 1912 Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture when said that sculpture should use and combine whatever materials needed to realize a piece. It also emphasized the abstract over the figurative. Much of his experimentation was based on his knowledge of chemistry from his early student days and {{made him one of the}} most experimental sculptors in 20th century Mexico. Examples include concrete, electrical cable and wire pieces such as Estela II, Máscara (1948) and El Nahual. The sculpture Napoleón is done in limestone; Diálogo is done in multicolored wood.|$|R

40|$|Solar gain through {{fenestration}} has {{a significant}} impact on building peak load and annual energy consumption. Shading devices, attached to fenestration, offer a cost effective strategy in controlling solar gain. The performance of a particular shading device is dependent on solar optical and longwave radiative properties of the device. The current study considers longwave properties of three flat shading materials; drapery fabrics, insect screens and roller blinds. Each of these materials consists of a structure (i. e., yarn, <b>wire,</b> <b>sheet)</b> that is opaque with respect to longwave (infrared) radiation and each material is likely to have some openness. Material emittance and longwave transmittance measurements were taken with an infrared reflectometer using two backing surfaces. The results show emittance and longwave transmittance to be simple functions of openness, emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure. This is especially useful because openness can be determined from solar transmittance measurements while emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure was found to be constant for each category of shading material.

50|$|Rigging- wire or rod {{used to hold}} up a mast. Since the 1960s {{stainless}} steel wire has become universal in the developed world. Elsewhere galvanized wire or even rope may be used because of its availability and cheapness.3 types of {{stainless steel}} wire are commonly used. Type 1 x 19 is a non-flexible wire used for standing rigging such as stays. Type 7 x 7 is a semi flexible wire used for luff wires in sails, halyards (sometimes plastic coated) trapeze wires and light halyards. Type 7 x 19 is used for all halyards, <b>wire</b> <b>sheets,</b> vangs and strops that must run through a pulley (sheave). The common way of attaching wire is to form a small loop at the end which is fixed in place by clamping a soft metal swage over the free ends. Talurite is a common brand of swagging. The wire loop is then fastened to a rigging screw with a bow shackle to the chain plate. Kevlar rope is sometimes used in place of wire in small sailboats.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{variety of}} {{industrial}} use of brazing solders is associated {{in one way}} with plastic properties (more plastic materials are producing {{in the form of}} <b>wires,</b> <b>sheets,</b> bands, metal leafs, meshes etc, low plastic materials in the form: pig sows, bars, powders) and in another way with the kind of joining and use soldering or brazing method. Hard solders, which include analyzed solder BAg 7, have a very wide range of melting points (from 400 to 2000 ºC) and are applied in those cases when very high values of strength are required for soldered joint. The research was carried out for the silver-based solder designated as Bag 7 according to American Standard ANSI/AWSA 5. 8 - 92. This solder has a typical application for the brazing process of food handling equipment requiring low melting values and for brazing aluminium alloys. In the literature, except for chemical composition and temperature of brazing, we cannot find the details concerned with the method of plastic working of BAg 7. In the reported research work the metallographic analysis of rolling process was performed and optimal parameters of rolling process for the considered solder were determined...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} and pressures {{have made the}} {{pulp and paper industry}} move towards the recirculation of white water. These measures have led to lower volumes of water discharged by those mills recirculating water, and also to increasing problems in the mills. One of these problems is the loss of effectiveness of the PEO-cofactor retention aid systems, due to the increasing concentration of dissolved solids in the water. The results show that the presence of high surface area compounds such as fines, clay and organic compounds, like abietic acid can indeed affect the efficiency of PEO. The development of a laboratory scale twin <b>wire</b> <b>sheet</b> former has helped study the retention aid system described above under conditions which resemble those found in a mill. This apparatus has helped study the effect the retention aid system had on water drainage and fines retention. The fines retention improved as the concentration of PEO was increased but the water drainage had decreased. Bentonite was added to the system to study its effect on the fines retention and the drainage. Bentonite combined to a PEO-cofactor retention aid system was found to {{have a positive impact on}} both the retention and the drainage...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to determine the attenuating and distorting effects of an agricultural soil on an alternating magnetic field that was propagated through the soil from a buried, current-carrying wire. The direction and maximum intensity of magnetic fields generated by buried, current-carrying wires were measured about a Sharpsburg silty clay loam. The wires {{used for this study}} were buried to a depth of two feet or less. The alternating magnetic fields studied had a frequency of 20 kilocycles per second. A series of laboratory experiments was conducted as a part of this study {{to determine the effects of}} a highly conductive layer on the alternating magnetic field propagated from a current carrying <b>wire.</b> <b>Sheets</b> of aluminum alloy were placed between a current-carrying wire and the points at which the direction and maximum intensity of alternating magnetic fields were measured. A layer of highly conductive materials above a current- carrying wire causes attenuation and distortion of the magnetic field above the conducting material. The electrical conductivity of the Sharpsburg silty clay loam soil used for this study had negligible effects on the alternating magnetic fields that were propagated from wires buried beneath the surface of the soil.
