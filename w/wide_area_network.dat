5|$|In practice, {{different}} {{data collection}} mechanisms {{are used by}} different transport operators, depending {{on the nature of}} their business. The MTR equips its stations with local area networks that connect the components that deal with Octopus cards—turnstiles, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's Kowloon Bay headquarters through a frame relay <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>network,</b> and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing. Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as 7-Eleven. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses.

40|$|In this work, we have {{addressed}} the complex problem with multicasting in <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (WANs) and have proposed an improved multicasting algorithm to handle with excessive number of duplicate packets when multicasting in <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (WANs). The main feature of the proposed algorithm is Modified Pseudo diameter that reduces the extra duplicate packets generated in Effective Multicasting Protocol For <b>Wide</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> (EMWAN). Besides, the proposed algorithm also ensures better bandwidth utilization compared with few notable works in this area...|$|R

In addition to SRI and UCLA, University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Utah {{were part of the}} original four network nodes. By December 5, 1969, the entire four-node network was connected. In the 1970s, SRI developed packet-switched radio (a precursor to wireless networking), over-the-horizon radar, Deafnet, vacuum microelectronics, and software-implemented fault tolerance.|$|E

We propose a conference control protocol that uses a three-channel rotation floor control scheme to coordinate access to the shared media channels and avoid race conditions. Experimental results as well as the implementation in a research video-conferencing system for <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> show that the proposed protocol can effectively eliminate race conditions while maintaining the scalability and reliability...|$|R
