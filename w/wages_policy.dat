The employment increase, which results from a lower nominal wage increase, is smaller than under fixed exchange rates. The reason for this difference is that moderate <b>wage</b> <b>policies</b> under fixed exchange rates cause an additional expansion in the money supply, thereby increasing the employment effects of the <b>wage</b> <b>policies.</b> If expectations vis- 0 -vis price and exchange rate changes are taken into consideration, it is not impossible that a small increase in domestic wages will cause a decrease in inflation expectations {{and an increase in}} the demand for the domestic currency.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{explores the}} impact of the employer’s <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> on the <b>wage</b> {{dynamics}} of vulnerable groups of employees at large firms, including younger employees, employees on fixed-term contracts and employees who take parental leave. Design/methodology/approach – The first step of the analysis identifies the <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> models adopted by a sample of large Italian companies by means of a cluster analysis based on firm-level variables that describe the wage level, wage structure and wage dynamics. The second step estimates {{the impact of}} the employer’s <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> on the <b>wage</b> growth path of matched employees, paying particular attention to groups of vulnerable workers. Findings – The cluster analysis identifies four clusters whose characteristics reflect ideal types suggested by the literature. The 2 SLS wage regressions that examine {{the impact of the}} employer’s <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> model on a matched employee’s wage five years later confirm that the initial employer’s <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> is a significant determinant of wage dynamics. However, the observed patterns significantly differ between the whole sample and the examined groups of vulnerable employees. Originality/value – Despite consistent evidence of negative labour market outcomes for vulnerable employees, the impact of firm characteristics on segregation into disadvantaged groups is still under-researched. This paper provides new evidence of how the employer’s <b>wage</b> <b>policy</b> impacts the <b>wage</b> growth path of disadvantaged employees and highlights critical dimensions {{to reduce the risk of}} segregation into less favourable segments of the labour market...|$|R
