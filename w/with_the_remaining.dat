5|$|The Drosophila melanogaster genome {{contains}} 29 serpin encoding genes. Amino acid {{sequence analysis}} has placed 14 of these serpins in serpin clade Q and three in serpin clade K <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> twelve classified as orphan serpins not belonging to any clade. The clade classification system {{is difficult to}} use for Drosophila serpins and instead a nomenclature system has been adopted {{that is based on}} the position of serpin genes on the Drosophila chromosomes. Thirteen of the Drosophila serpins occur as isolated genes in the genome (including Serpin-27A, see below), <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> 16 organised into five gene clusters that occur at chromosome positions 28D (2 serpins), 42D (5 serpins), 43A (4 serpins), 77B (3 serpins) and 88E (2 serpins).|$|E

C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E

All defendants faced a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty. The trials were often delayed due to the defendants complaining of illness, headaches and nausea. Australia's prime minister, John Howard, said the Australian government would oppose any death sentences imposed.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must have further fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E
5|$|For his victory, the Senate awarded Titus a Roman triumph. On {{the day of}} the festivities, the Flavian family rode {{into the}} capital, preceded by a lavish parade that {{displayed}} the spoils of the war.

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E
5|$|Many Texas {{residents}} {{disagreed with}} the convention's perception.
