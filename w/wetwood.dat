50|$|Although {{the disease}} {{is caused by a}} {{relatively}} new symbiosis, it has already spread to a number of different counties, and is completely wiping out oak trees. As mentioned before, this is partially due to disease symptoms that are similar to other diseases leading to a misdiagnosis, it most resembles bacterial <b>wetwood,</b> polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB), and fusarium dieback. With the recent outbreak and growth in population of the western bark beetle, there is concern that the pathogen's range will expand. Oak trees are important for wildlife diversity and for the ecological services they provide like habitat, shelter and food.|$|E
5000|$|Coptis aspleniifolia, {{commonly}} known as fernleaf goldthread or spleenwort-leaf goldthread, {{is found in the}} northern two-thirds of British Columbia, in Alaska, and along the Cascades into Washington and is a native plant of the temperate rain forests of the region. It is often found in the understory of the herb layer of coniferous forests as part of a multilayered canopy system on gleysolic or organic soils. Also found in <b>wetwoods</b> and bogs, the fernleaf goldthread is not invasive or poisonous. The plant is considered common and widespread in its native range. [...] An evergreen perennial, the fernleaf goldthread is mostly hairless and five to 30 centimeters in height. Its leaves resemble those of ferns, are all basal, dark-green and glossy and divided into five or more segments. The fernleaf goldthread blooms in mid-spring with a pale greenish white or yellow flower. It has two or three nodding flowers per stalk, each with five to seven sepals and five to seven thin petals.

In case the <b>wetwood</b> included the defects, the specific gravity of <b>wetwood</b> increased. 3) A significant relationship was not recognized between compressionwood and wet wood. No relationship between specific gravities and compressionwood in <b>wetwood</b> containing lumber could not be established, as stated in a previous report. 4) Very little difference was recognized in ovendry specific gravity between samples with <b>wetwood</b> and without <b>wetwood.</b> However, <b>wetwood</b> with a low drying rate tended to have a higher specific gravity. 5) The low drying rate of the lumber with <b>wetwood</b> and the residual water in it after its drying seemed to be due to the existence of natural defects and their undesirable locations for drying in the lumber where they disturbed moisture movement toward the surface of lumber during the drying process. 6) The lumber with <b>wetwood,</b> however, did not have a low drying rate if it contained natural defects and were positioned near the surface of lumber. The following conclusion was obtained from the experiments: The low drying rate of <b>wetwood</b> was caused basically by the existence of knots and/or pitch streaks and their undesirable locations in lumber rather than by the difference in quality between the <b>wetwood</b> and the normal wood. If the defects are located between the surface of lumber and the wet parts. the defects worked as a barrier and did not allow the movement of the water or water vapor toward the surface, and so the water remained in the lumber. トドマツ水食い材を人工乾燥したあと，しばしば材内に異常に多い残留水分が残ることがあり木材加工上の問題となっている。乾燥後の残留水分の原因について水食い材の欠点の観察および乾燥試験を通して検討した。木材中に水食いがあれば必ず乾燥後の材内に異常に多い残留水分が存在するとも限らない。また水食いの箇所は材内の節，樹脂条（やにすじ）の位置と隣接して存在していた。これらのことから，「残留水分はトドマツの欠点，特に節と樹脂条（やにすじ）の存在と関係が深く，木材中のこれら欠点が水分の木材表面への移動，乾燥を妨げる位置に存在した場合に，これら欠点が水分移動を遮るバリアとして働き，その部分が蓄積され残留水分が多くなる」という結論が得られた...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial <b>wetwood</b> is a {{major cause}} of value loss in the red oak lumber {{industry}} in the United States. Red oak trees in Mississippi, South Carolina, and Florida were sampled and evaluated for certain chemical properties possibly associated with the <b>wetwood</b> condition. Specific variables investigated were pH and concentmtions of methane, cations (Na+. Ca++, K+, and Mg++). nonstructural carbohydrates, and organic acids (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). The degree of bacterial <b>wetwood</b> infection and development was greater in red oaks from Mississippi than from South Carolina as evidenced by increased concentrations of methane, total Na+, total K+, total Ca++, and by decreased concentrations of total sugar and reducing sugar. Of all the variables tested, methane concentration was the best indicator of <b>wetwood</b> in living red oak trees at all three locations. pH was not an indicator of <b>wetwood</b> in living trees or in green red oak lumber.

30|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{understand}} precisely the drying characteristics of <b>wetwood</b> of todomatsu (Abies sachalinensis Mast.). For this purpose, the vibrational properties of <b>wetwood</b> of todomatsu at high temperature were compared with those of normal parts that had lower green moisture content than the <b>wetwood.</b> Specimens were cut respectively from the <b>wetwood</b> and normal parts, and matched in the radial direction. The specimens and the measuring systems were placed in an electric drying oven and free-free vibration tests were conducted in the oven under absolutely dry conditions. The <b>wetwood</b> and the normal parts were tested separately. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 200 °C and then lowered to 50 °C in steps of 25 °C. The specific Young’s modulus decreased with an increase in temperature during the heating process while it increased with the decreasing temperature during the cooling process. There was no significant difference in the specific Young’s modulus between the <b>wetwood</b> and the normal part at all tested temperatures. The loss tangent took a minimum value at about 100 °C in both the heating and cooling processes. There was no significant difference in the loss tangent between the <b>wetwood</b> and the normal part. Thus, the elastic and viscoelastic behaviors of the <b>wetwood</b> appear to be similar to those of the normal part in the temperature range of an actual kiln-drying process.|$|E
40|$|Elm trees (Ulmus spp.) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} landscape plants, widely used as ornamental trees to embellish parks and streets of different countries including Iran. Elm trees cultivation is seriously limited by biotic factors such as bacterial pathogens. Recently, bacterial <b>wetwood</b> has been identified as a common disease on elm trees in Northwest Iran. In present study, in order to identify bacterial pathogens associated with elm trees, <b>wetwood</b> infected samples were collected from elm trees showing <b>wetwood</b> symptom across Tabriz city and immediately transferred to the lab. After isolation and purification of isolates, hypersensitive reaction (HR), pathogenicity, biochemical and molecular tests were used to characterize the isolates. In total of 92 isolates obtained, 32 and 10 isolates were able to induce HR and <b>wetwood</b> symptoms on tobacco leaves and young branches of elm, respectively. Based on biochemical and molecular tests, the identity of the isolates studied were determined as Brevundimonas bullata, Paracoccus alcaliphilus, P. marcusii and Luteimonas aestuarii. To the best of our knowledge, this study shows that these four bacterial species here reported are responsible for the causal agent-complex of <b>wetwood</b> disease on elm trees for the first time in the world...|$|E

40|$|<b>Wetwood</b> {{samples from}} {{standing}} trees of eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), black poplar (Populus nigra), and American elm (Ulmus americana) contained {{high numbers of}} aerobic and anaerobic pectin-degrading bacteria (104 to 106 cells per g of wood). High activity of polygalacturonate lyase (≤ 0. 5 U/ml) was also detected in the fetid liquid that spurted from <b>wetwood</b> zones in the lower trunk when the trees were bored. A prevalent pectin-degrading obligately anaerobic bacterium isolated from these wetwoods was identified as Clostridium butyricum. Pectin decomposition by C. butyricum strain 4 P 1 was associated with an inducible polygalacturonate lyase and pectin methylesterase, {{the same types of}} pectinolytic activity expressed in the <b>wetwood</b> of these trees. The pH optimum of the extracellular polygalacturonate lyase was alkaline (near pH 8. 5). In vitro tests with sapwood samples from a conifer (Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii) showed that tori in membranes of bordered pits are degraded by pure cultures of strain 4 P 1, polygalacturonate lyase enzyme preparations of strain 4 P 1, and mixed methanogenic cultures from the tree samples of <b>wetwood.</b> These results provide evidence that pectin in xylem tissue is actively degraded by C. butyricum strain 4 P 1 via polygalacturonate lyase activity.

40|$|Obligately anaerobic, mesophilic, {{cellulolytic}} bacteria {{were isolated}} from the <b>wetwood</b> of elm and maple trees. The isolation of these bacteria involved inoculation of selective enrichment cultures with increment cores taken from trees showing evidence of <b>wetwood.</b> Cellulolytic bacteria {{were present in the}} cores from seven of nine trees sampled, as indicated by the disappearance of cellulose from enrichment cultures. With two exceptions, cellulolytic activity was confined to the darker, wetter, inner section of the cores. Cellulolytic bacteria were also present in the fluid from core holes. The cellulolytic isolates were motile rods that stained gram negative. Endospores were formed by some strains. The physiology of one of the cellulolytic isolates (strain JW 2) was studied in detail. Strain JW 2 fermented cellobiose, d-glucose, glycerol, l-arabinose, d-xylose, and xylan in addition to cellulose. In a defined medium, p-aminobenzoic acid and biotin were the only exogenous growth factors required by strain JW 2 for the fermentation of cellobiose or cellulose. Acetate and ethanol were the major nongaseous end products of cellulose fermentation. The guanine-plus-cytosine content of the DNA of strain JW 2 was 33. 7 mol%.

40|$|Log sorting is {{necessary}} when processing aspen saw-dry-rip (SDR) to select optimum log diameter and to minimize number of logs with dark-colored centers. <b>Wetwood,</b> which {{is difficult to}} dry, is commonly associated with these dark centers.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 A {{decreasing}} {{rate of flow}} {{was observed}} (after sufficient air and particulate matter {{were removed from the}} wood and water) under steady-state conditions for green western hemlock sapwood. The decrease is theorized to be due to viscoelastic behavior of pit membranes. An unsteady-state procedure for determining longitudinal liquid permeability of small wood specimens (about 3 / 4 inches) was developed. It predicts that a straight line relationship exists between the inverse square of pressure in a pressure cell and time over a limited pressure range when the liquid is allowed to flow through the specimen. Specific permeability can be calculated from the slope. The unsteady-state technique was much simpler to use than the steady-state method. Permeability coefficients determined by the unsteady-state method were generally higher than those arrived at by steady-state means. The reason for this difference is now known. Sapwood is more permeable than <b>wetwood</b> which is, in turn, more permeable than heartwood. This order is independent of the method of measurement. Saturated, green <b>wetwood</b> posseses a specific permeability of the same order of magnitude as green sapwood; but has a characteristic behavior under both steady- and unsteady-state conditions that differentiates it from sapwood. This was considered to be due to occlusion of pit membranes by extractives...|$|E

This study had two objectives: (1) to show the potential of using moisture content, green and basic density, stress wave travel time, and tensile strength across the grain as indicators of bacterial infection in green lumber and (2) to evaluate the relative susceptibility of infected and uninfected lumber to checking during drying {{and the level of}} actual drying degrade. Bacterially infected and uninfected green, flat-sawn, 1 - 1 / 8 -in. -thick red oak (Quercus spp.) lumber was used in this study. The relative susceptibility of infected and uninfected wood to check during drying was examined by comparing tensile strength across the grain. Actual drying degrade was determined by kiln drying using a standard American schedule. Results show that moisture content and density levels are not good indicators for identifying bacterial infection. However, maximum stress wave travel time across the grain in green lumber appears to be a promising indicator of bacterial infection. Low tensile strength across the grain in bacterially infected red oak strongly indicates a high susceptibility for the lumber to check during drying. Because decreased tensile strength is indicated by increased stress wave travel time, stress wave analysis of green lumber can be a good indicator that drying defects will also develop...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{impact of}} precommercial {{thinning}} of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) {{on the development}} of Annosus root and butt rot (caused by Heterobasidion annosum) in coastal Washington has been followed for more than 20 years. Infection of stumps and wounds was high following thinning and there was a high probability of residual tree infection. Eleven years after precommercial thinning tree infection was high, but after 20 years levels of infection were low in both thinned and unthinned stands (averaging < 5 percent). Volume losses were even lower (< 1 percent). Host tree defense mechanisms, including <b>wetwood,</b> appear to be effective in minimizing losses due to H. annosum. Precommercial thinning did not appreciably increase the incidence of H. annosum in the current rotation but problems could occur in future rotations.

Carter (1945) stated that when fluxing is {{prolific}} or long continued, air-borne bacteria, yeasts, and fungi contaminate the oozing sap, ferment it and produce the material called slime flux. Apparently the oozing flux is toxic to the flux site and so prevents callusing by the tree. Consequently, the same tree usually can be a good collecting site for insects from year to year. My stay in Japan spanned four years, and collecting at flux sites {{was one of the most}} fruitful areas of endeavor. As soon as the vascular system of a tree became active in the spring the slime flux began to ooze out and attract insects.

30|$|Some methanogens {{can also}} {{associate}} with plants, animals {{and could be}} found in the human body. Methanobacterium arbophilicum could be isolated from a tree <b>wetwood</b> tissue and uses the H 2 resulting from pectin and cellulose degradation by Clostridium butyricum for methanogenesis (Schink et al. 1981; Zeikus and Henning 1975). From the feces of cattle, horse, sheep and goose the methanogens Methanobrevibacter thaueri, Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii, Methanobrevibacter wolinii and Methanobrevibacter woesei have been isolated, respectively (Miller and Lin 2002). In addition, different Methanobrevibacter species {{could be found in}} the intestinal tract of insects such as termites (Leadbetter and Breznak 1996). Beside the intestinal tract of herbivorous mammals also the rumen contains methanogens. One of the major species here is Methanobrevibacter ruminantium (Hook et al. 2010). Methanogenic archaea are also present in the human body. Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae as well as Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis could be detected in human feces (Dridi et al. 2009, 2012; Miller et al. 1982).

3000|$|Another {{reason the}} disease has not been well-detected {{in its early stages}} is because its cycle {{consists}} of a number of alternative and consecutive events: Firstly, there must be an injury to expose the wood. The cells around the injured area oxidize and discolour due to biochemical changes. This discolouration can develop further if the wound remains open to the many microorganisms which can land and grow on the moisture. The next most likely step is for bacteria and Ascomycetes or imperfect fungi to live on the wound, resulting in further discolouration, wetness of the area and erosion of parts of the cell wall. This is referred to as <b>wetwood,</b> redheart, or blackheart. Finally, as the wood-rotting fungi (Basidiomycetes) integrate, digestion of cell wall components begins. These microorganisms, however, are confined to the area which is already undergone the biochemical processes followed by bacterial reaction, Ascomycetes and imperfects.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the wood properties of Populus "androscoggin" (Populus trichocarpa X Populus maximowiczii) grown {{in a river}} bed plantation near Timaru. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine some general characteristics of the tree viz. diameter over bark, diameter under bark, bark thickness, eccentricity and the diameter of heartwood. (2) {{to improve the quality}} of sawn timber by drying the timber so as to reduce the effect of tension wood and growth stresses in poplar. Thirty trees were selected for this study 15 leaning trees and 15 straight trees. The study was conducted in three parts: (1) disk analysis to determine the general wood characteristics (2) determining drying characteristics based on the quality of dried flitches (3) determining the quality of dried boards after remanufacture. In the first part of the study sample disks were removed at three heights from each tree to examine the variation within the tree. The mean number of annual rings at the butt of the tree was 16 in the case of leaning trees and 17 in straight trees. The growth rate (ring width (mm)) of the leaning trees was not statistically different from the growth rate of straight thickness. It was found that thickness was positively correlated with the diameter over bark. Bark thickness also has a positive relationship with heartwood diameter and negative relationship with height. The average green moisture content of individual trees ranged from 109 % to 146 %. The moisture content decreased from the butt green to the top of the tree. A positive relationship was found between the green moisture content and the proportion of heartwood (heartwood diameter/the diameter under bark). The green density followed a similar trend to that of the distribution of green moisture content, and decreased from the butt to the top of the tree. Basic density values in the 30 trees were, - butt: 320 to 380 Kg/m³ - middle: 340 to 410 Kg/m³ - top: 360 to 430 Kg/m³. It was found that the distribution of basic density based on the "direction" in the tree was different in straight trees and leaning trees. In leaning trees the basic density of the "side" was statistically different from that of the "opposite" direction, whereas in straight trees there were no differences between directions. It was also found that the basic density of leaning trees was higher than the basic density of straight trees. Within the stem, basic density was negatively correlated with the heartwood proportion, negatively correlated with the average ring width, and positively correlated with its eccentricity. In the second part of the study, the logs from the butt and the top were converted into flitches. The flitches were then dried using six drying schedules. One of the drying options (dehumidifying) was not completed due to time limitations. Air drying schedule which was begun on 24 April 1989 finished on 30 March 1990 (11 months), with the average moisture content ranging from 17. 2 % to 25. 8 %. The other four categories of drying options were low temperature drying (40 °C), conventional drying I (60 °C), conventional drying II (80 °C) and high temperature drying (115 °C). When dried at low temperature the boards showed minor defects (warping), conventional drying I and conventional drying II decreased the drying time but the effect on defects was not significant. High temperature drying decreased the drying time and also decreased the amount on warp of the dried flitches. More boards were rejected from leaning trees than from straight trees. More boards were rejected from bottom logs than from top logs. Volumetric shrinkage was not affected by the type of tree nor the location of the board within the tree. On the other hand drying methods (temperature) had an effect on volumetric shrinkage. Below 100 °C, it was noted positively that the volumetric shrinkage was correlated with temperature, whereas at high temperatures (> 100 °C) the opposite was true. This result suggested that the allowance before sawing processes should be made in accordance with the drying methods. The higher the temperature (below 100 °C) the higher the allowance. The rejection rate showed a positive relationship with the volumetric shrinkage. In the third part of the study, 5 samples from each treatment were selected then remanufactured and the distortion measured. The result after remanufacture was different from that obtained in the second part of the study. The high temperature drying showed a high amount of bowing in remanufactured boards. This indicated that casehardening was present in these boards, and suggested that more reconditioning was needed for this schedule (up to 10 hours instead of 6 hours). Colour was darkened and there was loss of brightness at higher temperatures. The high temperature drying also produce a "caramel” like odour. This made the boards unsuitable for asparagus containers. <b>Wetwood</b> may be present in the boards used in this study, since the final moisture content varied greatly between and within the boards. Further research of this abnormal wood is needed to clarify this problem. This study also suggested that the drying methods should consider the requirement of the final product. Timber intended for manufacture of asparagus containers was suitably processed by conventional drying I or conventional drying II, whereas for other end uses (where the odour and colour were not primarily important) high temperature drying was found to be suitable used in conjunction with an increased reconditioning schedule...|$|E
