40|$|High single {{instruction}} multiple data (SIMD) {{efficiency and}} {{low power consumption}} have made graphic processing units (GPUs) an ideal platform for many complex computational applications. Thousands of threads can be created by programmers and grouped into fixed-size SIMD batches, known as <b>warps.</b> High throughput is then achieved by concurrently executing such <b>warps</b> with minimal control overhead. However, if a branch instruction occurs, which assigns different paths to different threads, this <b>warp</b> will be broken into multiple <b>warps</b> {{that have to be}} executed serially, consequently reducing the efficiency advantage of SIMD. In this thesis, the contemporary fixed-size <b>warp</b> design is abandoned and a hybrid <b>warp</b> size (HWS) mechanism is proposed. Mixed-size <b>warps</b> are generated according to HWS and are scheduled and issued flexibly. Once a branch divergence occurs, split <b>warps</b> are squeezed according to the proposed algorithm, and <b>warp</b> sizes are downscaled wherever applicable. Based on updated <b>warp</b> sizes, <b>warp</b> schedulers calculate the number of cycles the current <b>warp</b> needs and issue the next <b>warp</b> accordingly. As a result, hybrid <b>warps</b> are pushed into pipelines as soon as possible and more pipeline stages are overlapped. The simulation results show that this mechanism yields an average speedup of 1. 20 over the baseline architecture {{for a wide variety of}} general purpose GPU applications. This work also integrates HWS with dynamic <b>warp</b> formation (DWF), which is a well-known branch handling mechanism aimed at improving SIMD utilization by forming new <b>warps</b> out of split <b>warps</b> in real time. The <b>warp</b> forming policy is modified to better tolerate <b>warp</b> conflicts. Also, squeeze operations are added before a <b>warp</b> merges with other <b>warps.</b> The simulation shows that the combination of DWF and HWS generates an average speedup of 1. 27 over the DWF-only platform for the same set of GPU benchmarks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{tension of}} <b>warp</b> and weft {{run through the}} whole weaving process in knitted carpet weaving equipment. The {{performance}} of delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism and guiding weft mechanism {{in this kind of}} equipment influences the quality of carpet directly. A self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism is designed in this thesis, which is used in knitted carpet weaving equipment or other textile equipment that delivers <b>warp</b> by warp-spindle and demands even <b>warp</b> tension. The self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism consists of the device for setting and detecting <b>warp</b> tension, the device for driving warp-spindle in different speed, and the device for transmitting warp-spindle movement. The device for setting and detecting <b>warp</b> tension can determine initialization tension of <b>warp,</b> according to the technical requirements, can detect and feed back <b>warp</b> tension in real time. The device for driving warp-spindle in different speed makes the rotating speed of warp-spindle change according to the <b>warp</b> tension. The self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism realizes the function on controlling the rotating speed of warp-spindle in closed loop, and on stabilizing delivering <b>warp</b> tension...|$|R

(1) The tension of lifted <b>warp</b> is smaller than the tension of depressed <b>warp.</b> 	(2) The variety of depressed <b>warp</b> tension is more sudden than the variety of lifted <b>warp</b> tension. 	(3) The tappet whose dwell of small radius is 0 °，moves　most smoothly and keeps the most smooth variety 	to the <b>warp</b> tension. 	(4) The tappet whose dwell is small，reduce sboth the <b>warp</b> tension and the variety of <b>warp</b> tension.

(5) When the dwell of tappet is equaI in slze， the motion of heald harness which reduce its speed in 	inverse propotion to the <b>warp</b> tension bring better effect than the harmonic motion...|$|R

40|$|Spatially varying <b>warps</b> are {{increasingly}} popular for image alignment. In particular, as-projective-as-possible (APAP) <b>warps</b> {{have been proven}} effective for accurate panoramic stitching, especially in cases with significant depth parallax that defeat standard homographic <b>warps.</b> However, estimating spatially varying <b>warps</b> requires {{a sufficient number of}} feature matches.

In this paper, we propose a correspondence insertion method for APAP <b>warps,</b> with a focus on panoramic stitching. Our method automatically identifies misaligned regions, and inserts appropriate point correspondences to increase the flexibility of the <b>warp</b> and improve alignment. Unlike other <b>warp</b> varieties, the underlying projective regularization of APAP <b>warps</b> reduces overfitting and geometric distortion, despite increases to the <b>warp</b> complexity.
