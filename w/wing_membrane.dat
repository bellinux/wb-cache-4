5|$|As {{shown by}} {{cavities}} in the wing bones of larger species and soft tissue preserved {{in at least}} one specimen, some pterosaurs extended their system of respiratory air sacs (see Paleobiology section below) into the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane.</b>|$|E
5|$|The patagium is the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane.</b> The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane.</b> The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus aelleni is a small, brown Miniopterus species. The head may be {{slightly}} lighter in color than the body. Some {{hairs on the}} underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus griveaudi is similar in color, but M.manavi is darker and M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis are lighter. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, the base is narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, the sides of the tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E

40|$|Bats {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} mammalian groups, even though their foraging activities are restricted to the hours of twilight and night-time. Some studies suggested that bats became nocturnal because of overheating when flying in daylight. This is because—in contrast to feathered wings of birds—dark and naked <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> of bats efficiently absorb short-wave solar radiation. We hypothesized that bats face elevated flight costs during daylight flights, since we expected them to alter wing-beat kinematics to reduce heat load by solar radiation. To test this assumption, we measured metabolic rate and body temperature during short flights in the tropical short-tailed fruit bat Carollia perspicillata at night and during the day. Core body temperature of flying bats differed by no more than 2 °C between night and daytime flights, whereas mass-specific CO 2 production rates were higher by 15 per cent during daytime. We conclude that increased flight costs only render diurnal bat flights profitable when the relative energy gain during daytime is high and risk of predation is low. Ancestral bats possibly have evolved dark-skinned <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> to reduce nocturnal predation, but a low degree of reflectance of <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> made them also prone to overheating and elevated energy costs during daylight flights. In consequence, bats may have become trapped in the darkness of the night once dark-skinned <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> had evolved...|$|R
5|$|Miniopterus brachytragos is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with short}} and {{relatively}} thin fur. The fur of the upperparts is dark brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus mahafaliensis is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is short and has a broad base, sometimes with a crest at the side. It ends in a pointed to slightly rounded tip, which is covered with hairs that are not readily visible to the unaided eye. The short tragus easily distinguishes M.brachytragos from other Malagasy Miniopterus. The <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side. M.manavi and M.mahafaliensis also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with long}} and dense fur. The fur of the upperparts is brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray tips. Miniopterus brachytragos is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are {{partially}} haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is relatively thick, has the sides mostly parallel, and ends in a curved, rounded tip. The <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side. M.manavi and M.brachytragos also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane.</b> The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
40|$|Mature male Calopteryx japonica damselflies have dark-blue wings, due to darkly {{coloured}} <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> {{and blue}} reflecting veins. The membranes contain a high melanin concentration and the veins have a multilayer of melanin and chitin. Female and immature C. japonica damselflies have brown wings. We have determined the refractive index of melanin {{by comparing the}} differently pigmented <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> and applying Jamin-Lebedeff interference microscopy. Together with the previously measured refractive index of chitin the blue, structural colour of the male wing veins could be quantitatively explained by an optical multilayer model. The obtained melanin refractive index data will be useful in optical studies on melanized tissues, especially where melanin is concentrated in layers, thus causing iridescence. ...|$|R
50|$|Irregular {{membranes}} {{known as}} the propatagium (the membrane anterior to the humorous and radius) shape the <b>wing.</b> The plagiopatagium (<b>membrane</b> posterior to the humorous)has a greater surface than the chiropatagium (membranes between the digits), particularly the fifth, {{the position of the}} hind limb, which anchors the posterior edge of the plagiopatagium, and by the angles that the propatagium and dactylopatagium minus (membrane the second and third digits) make with the posterior parts of the <b>wing</b> <b>membranes.</b> Air pressure against the ventral surfaces of the <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> is greater than that against the dorsal surfaces; this helps to maintain a smoother camber. Macrotus californicus seems to spread its uropatagium widely only when hovering or performing other maneuvers requiring a departure form straight level flight, but the extreme maneuverability observed in Macrotus californicus is probably due to the specializations of its sensory equipment.|$|R
50|$|This {{medium-sized}} bat {{ranges from}} 10-13 cm in body length, with an 28-33 cm wingspan, and weighs between 14-16 g. The fur is moderately long and shiny brown. The <b>wing</b> <b>membranes,</b> ears, feet, and face are dark brown to blackish in color.|$|R
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane,</b> but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings are}} brown, but lighter {{than those of}} M.mystacinus. The plagiopatagium (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is {{attached}} to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1mm beyond the back margin of the uropatagium (the portion of the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> between the hindlegs). The calcar, a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip (except in one Croatian specimen). The baculum (penis bone) is about 0.5mm long. The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes M.alcathoe from M.brandtii as well as M.ikonnikovi.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} argument among paleontologists {{about whether the}} main wing membranes (brachiopatagia) attached to the hind limbs, and if so, where. Fossils of the rhamphorhynchoid Sordes, the anurognathid Jeholopterus, and a pterodactyloid from the Santana Formation seem {{to demonstrate that the}} <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> did attach to the hindlimbs, at least in some species. However, modern bats and flying squirrels show considerable variation in the extent of their wing membranes and it is possible that, like these groups, different species of pterosaur had different wing designs. Indeed, analysis of pterosaur limb proportions shows that there was considerable variation, possibly reflecting a variety of wing-plans.|$|E
50|$|They {{can also}} be {{recognized}} by their reduced thumbs, which are enclosed by the <b>wing</b> <b>membranes,</b> and their funnel-shaped ears. They have brownish to black fur, and roost in small groups, or singly. They are insectivorous and can live in {{many different kinds of}} environments.|$|R
50|$|The base of its fur, {{which is}} soft and fluffy, is light grey in colour, with dorsal side fur smoky brown and the ventral side grey, with the {{exception}} of juvenile bats which are entirely dark grey. Ears and <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> are a light greyish brown.|$|R
50|$|The long-eared myotis is a pale {{brown or}} straw-colored bat with black ears and <b>wing</b> <b>membranes.</b> The face is black in color as well. Specimens found {{along the coast}} are {{generally}} darker in coloration and {{are considered to be}} part of the subspecies Myotis evotis pacificus.|$|R
5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane.</b> The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|At the {{posterior}} {{angle of the}} wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a {{medium-sized}} species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish brown to gray. It is larger and darker than Paratriaenops auritus and P.furculus. Among living Triaenops species, it {{is smaller than}} T.persicus and T.afer, but somewhat larger than T.parvus. The extinct Triaenops goodmani, which is known only from three mandibles (lower jaws), is also larger. In the complexly shaped noseleaf (a group of fleshy structures around the nose and mouth), T.menamena has the trident structure characteristic of Triaenops and Paratriaenops: three adjacent lancets (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In T.menamena, the two outer lancets are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three lancets are more equal in Paratriaenops. The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal process and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process. The ears are small and broad and contain notches on the inner side. The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6mm long. The <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> is dark and translucent {{and the end of}} the tail usually projects from the uropatagium (tail membrane). Males average slightly larger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305mm (10.6 to 12.0in).|$|E
50|$|M. moluccarum has large {{ears and}} feet. The fur on the dorsal {{surface of the}} body is gray-brown to rust while the underparts are cinnamon-brown. The <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> are light brown. The adult has a forearm length of about 4 cm and weighs between 8 and 15 g.|$|R
5|$|While {{historically}} {{thought of}} as simple leathery structures composed of skin, research has since shown that the <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> of pterosaurs were highly complex dynamic structures suited to an active style of flight. The outer wings (from the tip to the elbow) were strengthened by closely spaced fibers called actinofibrils. The actinofibrils themselves consisted of three distinct layers in the wing, forming a crisscross pattern when superimposed on one another. The function of the actinofibrils is unknown, as is the exact material from which they were made. Depending on their exact composition (keratin, muscle, elastic structures, etc.), {{they may have been}} stiffening or strengthening agents in the outer part of the <b>wing.</b> The <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> also contained a thin layer of muscle, fibrous tissue, and a unique, complex circulatory system of looping blood vessels.|$|R
5|$|Both {{crocodilians}} {{and monitor}} lizards have developed lungs {{similar to those}} of birds, providing an unidirectional airflow and even possessing air sacs. The now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.|$|R
5|$|When at rest, {{the wings}} are held {{over the back}} in most insects, which may involve {{longitudinal}} folding of the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> and sometimes also transverse folding. Folding may sometimes occur along the flexion lines. Though fold lines may be transverse, as in the hindwings of beetles and earwigs, they are normally radial {{to the base of}} the wing, allowing adjacent sections of a wing to be folded over or under each other. The commonest fold line is the jugal fold, situated just behind the third anal vein, although, most Neoptera have a jugal fold just behind vein 3A on the forewings. It is sometimes also present on the hindwings. Where the anal area of the hindwing is large, as in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the whole of this part may be folded under the anterior part of the wing along a vannal fold a little posterior to the claval furrow. In addition, in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the anal area is folded like a fan along the veins, the anal veins being convex, at the crests of the folds, and the accessory veins concave. Whereas the claval furrow and jugal fold are probably homologous in different species, the vannal fold varies in position in different taxa. Folding is produced by a muscle arising on the pleuron and inserted into the third axillary sclerite in such a way that, when it contracts, the sclerite pivots about its points of articulation with the posterior notal process and the second axillary sclerite.|$|E

5000|$|Palaeochiropteryx ( [...] ) is an extinct genus of bat {{from the}} Middle Eocene of Europe. It {{contains}} two very similar species - Palaeochiropteryx tupaiodon and Palaeochiropteryx spiegeli, {{both from the}} famous Messel Pit of Germany.

50|$|P. sardus {{is a small}} bat with a head-and-body {{length of}} about 45 mm, ears of about 38 mm and a weight of up to 9 g. The snout is {{cone-shaped}} with a fleshy knob on the chin. The ears are oval and joined above the forehead by a fine membrane. The tragus is tapered with a blunt tip and is half {{as long as the}} ear. The <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> are attached to the rear part of the base of the fifth toe. The tail is long and extends a short way beyond the interfemoral membrane. The fur is fine, long and woolly and is greyish-brown dorsally and whitish or pale brown ventrally. The <b>wing</b> <b>membranes</b> are brown. Two features which distinguish this bat from related species are the cylindrical penis in males and the short, Y-shaped penile bone.|$|R
25|$|Most fairyflies possess wings {{with long}} {{bristles}} (marginal setae) on the fringes. The forewings usually have hypochaeta. These are small bristles (setae) which point distinctly backwards on the ventral {{surface of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>membrane.</b>|$|E
25|$|Padian {{argued that}} the <b>wing</b> <b>membrane</b> of pterosaurus {{probably}} did not attach to the hindlimb and that pterosaurs had narrow wings comparable in proportion to those of modern soaring sea birds.

50|$|The signs {{observed}} with WNS include unusual winter behavior like abnormally frequent or abnormally long arousal from torpor (temporary hibernation), flying, loss of body fat, damage and scarring of the <b>wing</b> <b>membranes,</b> and death.As early as 2011 {{it was hypothesized}} that prematurely expending the fat reserves for winter survival may be a cause for death.|$|R
50|$|Sordes had a 0.63 m (2 ft) wingspan. The wings were {{relatively}} short.
