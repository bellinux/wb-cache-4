5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a <b>washbasin</b> with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private <b>washbasin.</b> Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E
5|$|Mir {{featured}} a shower, the Bania, located in Kvant-2. It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a <b>washbasin</b> equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E
25|$|A Drawing Room is a {{relatively}} rare accommodation for three people traveling together, again with a <b>washbasin</b> and private toilet, again {{on one side of}} the car. Even rarer are larger rooms accommodating four or more; generally the needs of large parties were better served with multiple rooms, with or without the ability to combine them into a suite.|$|E

25|$|A Roomette, in the {{historically}} correct {{sense of the}} word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a folding bed, a toilet (not in a private cubicle of its own), and a <b>washbasin.</b> When a traditional Roomette is in night mode, the bed blocks access to the toilet. Like open sections, Roomettes {{are placed on both}} sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the car's floor level, in order to make slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly Spartan form of Roomette.|$|E

25|$|The {{fuselage}} of 328 {{allows for}} a comfortable three-abreast airline-style seating arrangement {{to be used as}} well as a dense four-abreast configuration to accommodate greater passenger numbers, of which it is able to carry a maximum of 27. There are a total of six cabin configurations available for passenger and cargo operations, these include a flexible combi aircraft layout with a movable wall separating passengers and cargo, and a medical evacuation arrangement equipped with bio-floors and positions for four litters and medical attendees. The 328 is pressurized, a first for Dornier-built aircraft, which was implemented to achieve a higher level of passenger comfort; the passenger cabin is designed to be more akin to those of much larger passenger aircraft. A full-sized galley, toilet and <b>washbasin</b> can also be installed.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January 1972, Fred and Rosemary wed. The {{ceremony}} {{took place}} at Gloucester Register Office, with Fred incorrectly describing himself as a bachelor upon the marriage certificate. No family or friends were invited. Several months later, with Rose pregnant with her second child, the couple moved from Midland Road to an address nearby: 25 Cromwell Street. Initially, the three-storey home was rented from the council, although Fred would later purchase the property from the council for £7,000. To facilitate the Wests' purchasing the property from the council, many of the upper floor rooms would initially be converted into bedsits, to supplement the household income. To maintain a degree of privacy for his own family, Fred installed a cooker and a <b>washbasin</b> on the first-floor landing in order that their lodgers need not enter the ground floor where the West family lived, and only {{he and his family}} were permitted access to the garden of the property. On 1 June, Rose gave birth to a second daughter. The date of her birth led Fred and Rose to name the child Mae June.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak's Superliner Economy Bedrooms (now called Superliner Roomettes, {{although}} they are structurally closer to open sections) accommodate two passengers in facing seats that fold out into a lower berth, with an upper berth that folds down from above, a small closet, and no in-room <b>washbasin</b> or toilet, {{on both sides of}} both the upper and lower levels of the car. Effectively, they are open sections with walls, a door, and a built-in access ladder for the upper berth (which doubles as a nightstand for the lower berth passenger). Superliner Deluxe Bedrooms are essentially the same as historic Compartments and Double Bedrooms, with the toilet cubicle doubling as a private shower cubicle. In addition, each Superliner sleeping car has two special lower-level accommodations, each taking up the full width of the car: the Accessible Bedroom, at the restroom/shower end of the car (below the Deluxe Bedrooms), is a fully wheelchair-accessible accommodation for two, with a roll-in cubicle for the toilet and shower; the Family Bedroom, at the Economy Bedroom end of the car, accommodates two adults and up to three small children, without private toilet or shower facilities.|$|E

He learns further details {{of the history of}} {{insanity}} in the family from Colonel Frobisher, including Hugh's grandfather who was committed to an asylum. Poirot learns that Hugh's mother died when he was ten years old in a boating accident when she was out with the Admiral, and that she was previously engaged to Frobisher before he went off to India with the British Army. When he came home he learned she had married Admiral Chandler, however this incident did nothing to lessen the ties of friendship between the two men. Poirot forces Frobisher to tell him more details of the incident with the sheep and finds out that on the night concerned, the Admiral found his son in bed with blood on his clothes and blood in the <b>washbasin</b> but Hugh remembered nothing of what he had done. Poirot questions the Admiral who has aged immensely since these incidents started and who feels that breaking the engagement is best for everyone, remarking {{that there will be no}} more Chandlers at Lyde Manor after he and his son have died.|$|E
25|$|The {{local news}} papers in Hamburg {{were full of}} praise for the modern crew accommodations: The crew of 38 had all a single cabin, except a few mess-boys who were in double berth cabins below the main deck. However, no air {{condition}} was fitted in the entire passenger and crew accommodations, but individual electric fans only, {{in addition to the}} central ventilation system. The upper deck was reserved for 12 passengers, accommodated in 10 single and in one double cabin, all with their own bath rooms. The charterers requested from the owners, that two stewardesses are employed on each ship to look after the well-being of the passengers. The forward front of the superstructure housed the dining room, smoking saloon and the bar, where the captain, chief engineer and first officer were dining with the passengers. The public rooms and the cabins were tastefully furnished with plenty of wood. The boat deck was strictly reserved for the master, the deck officers and the radio operator. The single cabins for the deck crew and the motormen were on the poop deck on two levels. These cabins had a <b>washbasin,</b> but toilettes and showers were for common use. In the deckhouse on the top was the crew bar. The mess rooms with a small pantry for the deck crew and the motormen were located in the aft mast house. Mid ships on the main deck were the engineer's and the chief engineer's cabins, the cabins of the chief steward and the cooks, the galley and the officer's mess. Even the engineers, except for the chief, had a communal shower and toilette.|$|E
500|$|The room is circular, {{with the}} window embrasures forming a {{sequence}} of arches around the outside. It is richly decorated, with love as the theme, displaying carved monkeys, nesting birds and pomegranates, images taken from 15th-century manuscripts. Lord Bute thought the monkeys inappropriately [...] "lascivious". Above the fireplace is a winged statue of Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul, carrying a heart-shaped shield which displays {{the arms of the}} Bute family. The <b>washbasin,</b> designed by John Chapple, has cisterns for hot and cold water, covered with crenellated towers. The Marchioness's scarlet and gold bed is the most notable piece of furniture in the room, modelled on a medieval original drawn by Viollet-le-Duc. Crook described the bed as being [...] "medieval to the point of acute discomfort".|$|E
2500|$|When the Viewliner {{sleeping}} {{cars were}} built, the accommodations were patterned after the Superliner accommodations, {{except that the}} Economy Bedrooms (or [...] "Viewliner Roomettes") include Roomette-style <b>washbasins</b> and toilets, as well as windows for the upper berths.|$|R

500|$|An inmate {{register}} {{reveals that}} there were 1,576 prisoners in total held at Alcatraz during its time as a Federal Penitentiary, although figures reported have varied and some have stated 1557. The prison cells, purposefully designed so that none adjoined an outside wall, typically measured [...] by [...] and [...] high. The cells were primitive with a bed, a desk and a <b>washbasin</b> and toilet on the back wall and few furnishings except a blanket. An air vent, measuring [...] by , covered by a metal grill, lay {{at the back of}} the cells which led into the utility corridors. [...] Prisoners had no privacy in going to the toilet and the toilets would emit a strong stench because they were flushed with salt water. Hot water faucets were not installed until the early 1960s, shortly before closure.|$|E
500|$|The three-story cellhouse {{included}} the main four {{blocks of the}} jail, A-block, B-block, C-block, and D-block, the warden's office, visitation room, the library, and the barber shop. [...] The prison cells typically measured [...] by [...] and [...] high. The cells were primitive and lacked privacy, with a bed, a desk and a <b>washbasin</b> and toilet on the back wall, with few furnishings except a blanket. African-Americans were segregated from the rest in cell designation due to racial abuse being prevalent. D-Block housed the worst inmates and five cells {{at the end of}} it were designated as [...] "The Hole", where badly behaving prisoners would be sent for periods of punishment, often brutally so. The dining hall and kitchen lay off the main building in an extended part where both prisoners and staff would eat three meals a day together. The Alcatraz Hospital was above the dining hall.|$|E
500|$|Each of {{the three}} Black Triptychs {{displays}} sequential views of a single figure, and each seems to be intended {{to be viewed as}} if stills from a film. The figures rendered are not drawn from any of Bacon's usual intellectual sources; they do not depict Golgotha, Handes, or Leopold Bloom. In these pictures Bacon strips Dyer from the context of both Dyer's own life and the artist's life, and presents him as a nameless, slumped, gathering of flesh, awaiting the onset of death. Describing the Black Triptychs in 1993, the art critic Juan Vicente Aliaga wrote that [...] "the horror, the abjection that oozed from the crucifixes has been transformed in his last paintings into quiet solitude. The masculine bodies entwined in a carnal embrace have given way to the solitary figure leaning over the <b>washbasin,</b> standing firm on the smooth ground, neutral, bald-headed, his convex back deformed, his testicles contracted in a fold." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Second World War the hall, its {{buildings}} and park {{were used by}} the War Office and the Admiralty, and additional buildings were erected. [...] Five parachute bombs fell near the hall, one of them blowing out all {{the windows in the}} garden front. [...] By 1960 the estate was [...] "seriously dilapidated", and it was decided to sell the hall and the surrounding land. [...] The farms went to the sitting tenants, and the chapel, which had been used as a parish church since 1947, was given to the Archdiocese of Liverpool. [...] The hall was bought by the Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus, who adapted it for use as a nursing home. [...] It was officially opened as such on 27May 1961 by the Rt Revd John Heenan, who was at that time the Archbishop of Liverpool. [...] Much work had to be done to make the building fit for its new purpose, including making it weather-proof, installing central heating, a lift, and a <b>washbasin</b> in each bedroom. [...] A new entrance was created {{at the back of the}} hall, with access for wheelchairs. [...] The former Gallery was converted into a chapel for the use of staff and residents. Henry Blundell's wing is used partly to provide services for the hall, and partly by the sisters as a convent. [...] The sisters and staff of the hall continue to provide nursing and other care for the elderly.|$|E
2500|$|The Fritzl {{property}} in Amstetten is a building dating from around 1890 and a newer building, added after 1978, when Fritzl {{applied for a}} building permit for an [...] "extension with basement". In 1983, building inspectors visited the site and verified that the new extension had been built according to the dimensions specified on the building permit. Fritzl had illegally enlarged the room by excavating space for a much larger basement, concealed by walls. Around 1981 or 1982, according to his statement, he started to turn this hidden cellar into a prison cell and installed a <b>washbasin,</b> toilet, bed, hotplate and refrigerator. In 1983, he added more space by creating a passageway to a pre-existing basement area under the old part of the property, of which only he knew.|$|E

The use of the River for the hacienda was authorized by the Spanish Colonial Government in Puerto Rico. The canal and aqueduct were finished in 1851. A series of manifolds are used for diverting the water according {{to the needs of the}} hacienda agricultural production: one gate diverts water to the water wheel and the corn mill water turbine, another gate diverts water to the fermentation tank, the ornamental <b>washbasin,</b> and the bath, and a third gate diverts water to a race which sends water back to the Canas River.|$|E
