25|$|The United States Department of Defense removed {{seventeen}} {{soldiers and}} officers from duty, and eleven soldiers {{were charged with}} dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery. Between May 2004 and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in courts-martial, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. It is reported that most inmates were innocent of the crimes they were accused of and were simply detained due to them being in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time.|$|E
25|$|The counterattack failed, as two battalions in {{the centre}} found the German {{shelling}} {{too heavy for}} them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for “funk”, after hearing the view {{of one of the}} actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and “in complete ignorance of the situation”. Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson should be asked to explain and that IV Corps, formerly “the most efficient in the army” “had much decreased in military value” and Wilson “had failed as a commander in the field”. Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were “downhearted” and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been “pulling Charteris’ leg” as he talked of “sweeping victories” within two months. Wilson was almost “degummed” (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many “unsuccessful” corps commanders, largely in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time, and that Haig’s animosity for Wilson was a factor.|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Kevin Wetmore {{noted the}} film's {{portrayal}} of {{violence as a}} reflection of its contemporary culture, writing: [...] "Death is a random act in post-9/11 horror—the result of being in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time, as the cliché goes. Unlike in eighties slasher horror, for example, where engaging in negative behavior such as drinking, doing drugs, having premarital sex are often forerunners to being killed by the killer(s); , death is random and unrelated to one's behavior." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Super Metroid {{received}} critical acclaim, Rus McLaughlin of IGN {{said that}} the Metroid series [...] "still fell down on the timing, arriving {{too late in the}} SNES lifecycle to earn big sales." [...] Robinson similarly noted that, in a series tradition, the game was released [...] "at the <b>wrong</b> <b>place,</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time." [...] He also added that it did not sell well in Japan after struggling against more commercially popular games, such as Donkey Kong Country, along with the launch of the PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. With the help of strong marketing from Nintendo, Super Metroid sold better in North America, and a year after its release, Nintendo placed it on their Player's Choice marketing label. By late 2003, the game had shipped 1.42 million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|At {{around this}} time, Sarria {{was arrested for}} {{solicitation}} in a sting operation at the St. Francis Hotel. Sarria maintained his innocence, stating that the arresting officer knew him personally. [...] "But {{they had to make}} an example of somebody... I was in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time." [...] Nonetheless, he was convicted and subjected to a large fine. Sarria, understanding that his conviction meant he could never become certified as a teacher, dropped out of college. Unsure of how to find work, he took the advice of a drag performer named Michelle and entered a drag contest at an Oakland bar called Pearl's. Sarria took second place, winning a two-week performance contract at the bar at $50 a week. [...] "I decided then to be the most notorious impersonator or homosexual or fairy or whatever you wanted to call me–and you would pay me for it." [...] Returning to San Francisco, he picked up some small singing jobs while still cocktail waiting at the Black Cat.|$|E
500|$|While Lillian and Victor Cordero {{had done}} their jobs well (before hiring them, Baird had made several {{attempts}} to employ U.S. citizens, but none had worked out), on January 22 the INS said {{it sought to}} question them and very likely deport them. [...] The couple had previously separated and {{were about to be}} divorced. [...] Lillian Cordero agreed to leave the country and return to Peru, under a 30-day [...] "voluntary departure" [...] program. [...] Victor Cordero first went into hiding, hoping to stay in the country; his lawyer said {{he had been in the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time and that, [...] "He doesn't understand why he's being singled out." [...] But by January 29, he too had voluntarily left the U.S. for Peru. [...] Neither of them ever appeared in the media. Although illegal domestics were rarely deported unless they had been involved in crimes, [...] the INS maintained that the couple were treated no differently than any other illegal aliens who were brought to their attention.|$|E

25|$|Acupuncture needles {{during this}} period were much thicker than most modern ones and often {{resulted}} in infection. Infection {{is caused by a}} lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place,</b> or <b>at</b> the <b>wrong</b> time. Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site. Nine needles were recommended in the Chen Chiu Ta Chheng from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.|$|R
500|$|The NWS {{long range}} {{forecast}} on November 9, 1975, predicted that a storm would pass {{just south of}} Lake Superior and over the Keweenaw Peninsula, extending into the Lake from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes had been following and charting the low pressure system over Oklahoma since November 8 and concluded that a major storm would track across eastern Lake Superior. He therefore chose a route that gave Sykes the most protection and took refuge in Thunder Bay, Ontario, during {{the worst of the}} storm. Based on the NWS forecast, Arthur M. Anderson and Edmund Fitzgerald instead started their trip across Lake Superior following the regular Lake Carriers Association route, which placed them {{in the path of the}} storm. The NTSB investigation concluded that the NWS failed to accurately predict wave heights on November 10. After running computer models in 2005 using actual meteorological data from November 10, 1975, Hultquist of the NWS said of Fitzgeralds position in the storm, [...] "It ended in precisely the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the absolute worst time." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files has taught us anything, it’s that if a G-Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil". However, she was critical of the episode's reliance on shock value, noting that the [...] "camera seems to take a perverse delight in death, pain, and mutilation, with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{times of}} war, natural disaster, {{societal}} collapse, {{or in the}} absence of an established system of criminal justice, there may be increased incidences of extrajudicial punishment. In such circumstances, police or military personnel may be unofficially authorised to punish severely individuals involved in looting, rioting and other violent acts, especially if caught in flagrante delicto.

5000|$|The {{second part}} of the song ("Birmingham Six"), written and sung by MacGowan, is a {{demonstration}} of support to the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four and the view that they were the victims of a miscarriage of justice and that their confessions had been extracted by torture {{at the hands of the}} West Midlands Serious Crime Squad, claiming [...] "there were six men in Birmingham, in Guildford there's four, who were picked up and tortured and framed by the law, and the filth got promotion, but they're still doing time, for being Irish in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> and <b>at</b> the <b>wrong</b> time". Although this was later proven to be the case, at the time the people involved were still convicted and imprisoned for carrying out the Birmingham pub bombings and the Guildford pub bombing during the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Marshall and {{his staff}} are fruitless in finding any {{research}} showing the Civil-War era crafters of the 14th Amendment in 1866 intended for schools to be desegregated. On the other hand, Davis and his Ivy League-educated staff find several examples of segregated schools having existed ever since {{the passage of the}} equal protection clause. Finally, the NAACP staffers discover a quote by Thaddeus Stevens delivered {{on the floor of the}} Senate during the debate over the Amendment, which directly states segregation is constitutionally and morally <b>wrong.</b> They <b>place</b> it <b>at</b> the front of their brief.

60|$|As {{is usually}} the case with people who go over houses, Mr. Guppy and his friend are dead beat before they have well begun. They straggle about in <b>wrong</b> <b>places,</b> look <b>at</b> <b>wrong</b> things, don't care for the right things, gape when more rooms are opened, exhibit {{profound}} depression of spirits, and are clearly knocked up. In each successive chamber that they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell, who is as upright as the house itself, rests apart in a window-seat or other such nook and listens with stately approval to Rosa's exposition. Her grandson is so attentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever--and prettier. Thus they pass on from room to room, raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few brief minutes as the young gardener admits the light, and reconsigning them to their graves as he shuts it out again. It appears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend {{that there is no}} end to the Dedlocks, whose family greatness seems to consist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves for seven hundred years.|$|R
2500|$|On April 15, {{several people}} who were near {{the scene of the}} blast were taken into custody and {{questioned}} about the bombing, including a Saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion; they detained him when some of his responses made them uncomfortable.

5|$|After being {{withdrawn}} back to Australia in March 1944, {{the units}} of the 7th Division received six weeks' leave before reforming on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Following this the 2/14th Battalion undertook a period of training before finally being committed to their last campaign {{of the war in}} mid-1945. This campaign saw them take part in the amphibious landings at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945. During the initial landings early on 1 July, the 2/14th came ashore <b>at</b> the <b>wrong</b> <b>place,</b> landing <b>at</b> Yellow Beach when it had been scheduled to land at Green Beach. Nevertheless, the landing was largely unopposed and after 45 minutes of reorganisation the Australians were able to establish themselves at their correct form up point and begin the advance to their first objective: the bridge over the Klandasan Besar. Advancing unopposed they crossed the bridge and at nightfall dug-in in front of the Stalkudo ridge, along the Vasey Highway. The following day, the battalion captured the Sepinggang airstrip as the 21st Brigade began the advance to the east. The 2/27th Battalion subsequently relieved the 2/14th at Sepinggang and on 3 July, the battalion began to move towards the Manggar airstrip. The 21st Brigade then came up against stronger opposition near the Batakan Ketjil River, which held them up until the evening.|$|R

2500|$|Asked why {{he never}} sought the presidency, Rayburn {{said that he}} was [...] "born in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time" [...] to {{undertake}} a national campaign. Rayburn was Speaker at a time that the greater power in the House rested with committee chairmen. He was himself readily accessible to members; historian Anthony Champagne of the University of Texas at Dallas, a Rayburn scholar, views the Speaker as a [...] "bridge between the northern and southern members" [...] of the Democratic Party. Champagne recalled a report that Rayburn so understood the House that he was [...] "married" [...] to the body and could [...] "feel the sentiment of the members" [...] by merely being in their presence. He was careful to fight his own battles, Champagne said. Rayburn was a mentor to such younger members as Richard Bolling of Missouri, Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, Carl Albert of Oklahoma, and Homer Thornberry and Jack Brooks, both of Texas. He was also readily accessible to constituents, who were invited to come to his home in Bonham and visit without prior notice.|$|E

30|$|Another {{interesting}} aspect in the Mahabharata is {{that without}} the Kurawa, the Pandawa {{would not be able}} to exist in this world. The tension and dynamism throughout the Mahabharata is based on the conflict between the Pandawa and the Kurawa. Both sides are needed to guarantee the stability and harmony of the entire cosmos. So unlike in the Ramayana, where one side is annihilated for the other side to be happy, the annihilation of the Kurawa and the creation of a peaceful world without the Kurawa cannot possibly be an appropriate correct goal. Precisely because of this, the stories of the Baratayuda war are full of tragedy and are regarded as potentially dangerous and explosive for society if they are performed in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> or <b>at</b> the <b>wrong</b> time. 12 This is true not only for the deaths of figures on the Pandawa side, such as Abimanyu and Gatotkaca, but just as true for the characters from the Kurawa side such as Karna and Suyudana. In fact, when the war is over, Yudistira, the oldest of the Pandawa brothers, is not happy but instead feels sad. Although in the end Astina 13 has been won, much of the country has been destroyed. Furthermore, although the Baratayuda war has ended, Aswatama still succeeds in killing all the descendants of the Pandawa with the exception of Parikesit, and in so doing has snatched victory from the hands of the Pandawa.|$|R
2500|$|The {{television}} series {{differs from the}} film versions in one fundamental aspect: Nikita (Peta Wilson) is innocent. She is not a killer, nor a drug user, just a homeless young woman in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time. Section One —an elite, top-secret counter-terrorism organization— sets Nikita up {{to be accused of}} murdering a police officer and {{sentenced to life in prison}} where she supposedly commits suicide and is brought into Section One. Because Nikita will be killed (or [...] "cancelled") if she fails to comply, she is forced to carry out the organization's ruthless methods of fighting terrorism, while attempting to keep her moral integrity intact. This personal struggle becomes the primary conflict of the series. A key scene in the two theatrical films involves Nikita's first assignment —to murder a VIP in a crowded restaurant. Although the Nikita of the {{television series}} eventually does become, by necessity, a ruthless killer, in the television version of this first mission she uses her ingenuity to avoid having to kill the VIP (whereas the film versions of the character complete the assignment). However, despite the machinations of others in power around her, Nikita retains her compassion and humanity.|$|E
2500|$|The fan outcry and {{subsequent}} discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers {{to sign the}} Lexa Pledge, a pledge promising to treat gay and lesbian characters in future plotlines with consideration to their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity {{and the freedom to}} develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was [...] "very sorry for not recognizing [...] as fully as [...] should have", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written {{it in a way that}} does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be in the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time. Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, [...] "I don't think that the failure here was to discuss , the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] I am grateful for the tidal wave that came down on me. The activism that goes on online is [...] important." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{longevity}} {{of the war}} has engendered a strong isolationism in the Ishgardian government which filters down into the attitude of her people. Ishgard withdrew from the first Eorzean Alliance and declined {{to participate in the}} second, being preoccupied with their own war effort. This isolationism also manifests itself in a fanatic persecution of [...] "heretics", i.e., anyone accused of consorting or sympathizing with dragons. In the lead-up to the events of the expansion, Nidhogg, who had been dormant for some time, bellows a great roar to rally the dragon horde to renew their assault on Ishgard. The player's character—an adventurer hailed as a Warrior of Light for fending off the Garlean invasion—comes into the good graces of Ser Aymeric, Lord Commander of the Temple Knights, for the defense of Ishgard during one such attack. When the player is caught at the <b>wrong</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> the wrong time during a coup attempt in Ul'dah, the hero flees to Ishgard for asylum from the charge of regicide with Alphinaud and Tataru, the only remnants of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn to escape the fiasco.

Meanwhile, Lady Iceheart grows her band of heretics and Estinien, the current Azure Dragoon, comes out of hiding in search of his archenemy, Nidhogg.|$|E
