Several optimal discharge pressure correlations for transcritical CO 2 heat pump {{have been proposed}} {{in the past few}} years, most of which are related to the ambient temperature, the evaporation temperature and the gas cooler outlet temperature. In an earlier study, the authors’ research group had presented a study on the dependency of the optimal discharge pressure on the ambient temperature and the hot <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature.</b> In this study, a revised model for optimal discharge pressure is developed based on experimental results. In order to validate the optimal discharge pressure model developed, field tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of an air-source transcritical CO 2 heat pump water heater in practical application. The system is comprised of a semi-hermetic reciprocating compressor, a counter-flow tube-in-tube gas cooler, a counter-flow internal heat exchanger, a fin-and-tube evaporator, and an electronic expansion valve (EEV) driven by electrically operated step motor. A Siemens SIMATIC S 7 - 200 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) was used to regulate the compressor discharge pressure by adjusting the EEV opening and the water flow rate by changing the frequency of the variable speed water pump. Field tests were conducted under three different operating scenarios: the nominal test condition, high water supply temperature condition and low ambient air temperature condition. The results show that the coefficient of performance (COP) can achieve 3. 76 in the nominal test condition with 15 ? water inlet temperature and 80 ? hot water supply temperature. Even when the hot water temperature is higher than 90 ?, the COP remains at 3. 21 with 20 ? dry-bulb temperature and 15 ? wet-bulb temperature. Under low ambient air temperature condition, the COP was 2. 19 with the hot-water supply temperature of 60 ?. Comparison between the field test results and the model predictions show that the maximum relative error of discharge pressure control was 5. 6 % in the low temperature condition, while the maximum relative error of system COP was only 4. 7 %.

40|$|A membrane-based water {{evaporator}} {{has been developed}} that is intended {{to serve as a}} heat-rejection device for a space suit. This evaporator would replace the current sublimator that is sensitive to contamination of its feedwater. The design of the membrane-based evaporator takes advantage of recent advances in hydrophobic micropore membranes to provide robust heat rejection with much less sensitivity to contamination. The low contamination sensitivity allows use of the heat transport loop as feedwater, eliminating the need for the separate feedwater system used for the sublimator. A cross section of the evaporator is shown in the accompanying figure. The space-suit cooling loop water flows into a distribution plenum, through a narrow annulus lined on both sides with a hydrophobic membrane, into an exit plenum, and returns to the space suit. Two perforated metal tubes encase the membranes and provide structural strength. Evaporation at the membrane inner surface dissipates the waste heat from the space suit.

A theoretical energy balance was conducted, from which the potential of recovering refrigeration condenser heat was estimated at up to 60 % of the water heating energy requirements. Preliminary tests with heat exchangers lead {{to the use of}} a tube-in-tube, counter flow, heat exchanger with fins on the refrigerant side, and cores on the water side, to improve the heat transfer characteristics. The exchanger, designed to provide 300 litres of 60 °C water from a 2. 25 kw refrigeration system cooling 2000 litres of milk per day, had an area of 0. 84 m 2, and an overall thermal conductance of 100 W. m- 2. °C- 1. This heat exchanger was inserted between the compressor and condenser of the refrigeration plant and tested with two condenser systems (air and water), four condenser pressures (6. 5 bar, 7. 5 bar, 10 bar and 12 bar), two milk inlet temperatures(23 °C and l 8 °C), and two milk final temperatures (4 °C and 7 °C). In addition, tests on receiver pressure and suction superheat were performed to determine overall system performance. Increasing condenser pressure increased cooling times from 2 hours 32 minutes to 3 hours 17 minutes, after the completion of the 1200 litre morning milking (thus failing to comply with the 3 hour cooling regulation at high condenser pressures.) Also, C. O. P. decreased from 3. 05 to 2. 35 for the water cooled condenser system (2. 70 to 2. 00 for the air cooled condenser system due to fan power consumption). Gross heat recovery rose from 4. 2 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 8. l kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for the water cooled system, giving <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 45 °C to 64 °C as condenser pressure rose. The corresponding ranges for air cooled condensers were 3. 8 kWh. day- 1. m- 3, to 6. 6 kWh. day- 1. m- 3, and 38 °C to 55 °C. Changing milk inlet and final temperatures gave a proportional change in cooling times and total heat recovery, but had no effect on C. O. P. or heat recovery rates. Suction superheating increased total heat recovery by 15 %, and <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> by 9 %. Increases in gross heat recovery with increasing condenser pressure were partially offset by additional compressor power, and yielded nett heat recoveries of 4. 0 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 6. 0 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for water cooled, and 3. 6 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 to 4. 3 kWh. day- 1. m- 3 for air cooled, condenser systems. The maximum gross and nett heat recoveries (at 12 bar condenser pressure) were applied to the energy requirements of a monitored 220 cow town supply dairy. This analysis showed that the gross heat recovery was 51 % of the water heating requirements, but the nett heat recovery dropped to 17 % of the total heating and refrigeration demand. Based on current electricity and equipment prices, it is estimated that the payback period for this level of recovery would be 16 - 17 years. Changing the electricity pricing structure, to reflect up to a 1 : 3 differential in favour of water heating power costs, results in the 6. 5 bar condenser pressure giving optimum results, but the nett returns are significantly lower than those reported.

Based on a developed transient model, theoretical analyses are carried out to investigate the performance of the geothermal-{{solar chimney power plant}} (GSCPP) with main dimensions the same as the Manzanares prototype in Spain. Three operation models, viz. the full solar model, the full geothernial model and the geothermal-solar combined model are compared in typical summer and winter days and throughout the year.

The refrigerant is R 134 a that flows inside the tubes, while water flows on the shell side. A single shell pass has been adopted for the water with one tube pass for the evaporating fluid. The test rig used for the experimental measurements consists of a primary refrigerant loop plus the condenser and the evaporator water auxiliary loops. The evaporator can be fed with two-phase mixture from the expansion valve or with saturated liquid coming from the liquid-vapor separator (in this case a variable speed recirculation pump is used). Inlet and outlet temperatures have been measured for both fluids together with the flow rate allowing the determination of the overall heat transfer coefficient. In addition, pressure drop have been measured on the refrigerant side. Tests have been performed both without overfeeding and with overfeeding at different values of recirculation ratio. The recirculation ratio is defined as the ratio between refrigerant flow rate at the evaporator and the vaporized refrigerant flow rate. Furthermore, measurements have been taken at fixed <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature</b> and varying the heat duty. In order to study the evaporator behavior, a computational procedure has been developed. Finally, the numerical model of the heat exchanger has been validated against experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design an intelligent control system for die casting processes involving cooling of a die with multiple channels. The work consists of two parks. First, a correlation between die insert temperature and cooling <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature</b> is established, {{which can be used}} to deduce local die surface temperatures without destructively inserting thermal sensors into a die from its back. Second, a new on-line thermal management scheme is proposed based on an intelligent real-time monitoring and control system (IRMCS) developed for a die insert containing multiple cooling channels. In this scheme, extra cooling water lines controlled by a pump and solenoid valves are hooked up to each established cooling channel. The system is capable of monitoring temperature signals from the die insert and flow rate signals from the cooling lines {{on the basis of its}} built-in control algorithms. Pump and solenoid valves can be actuated either automatically or manually to introduce additional cooling water to the die insert for preventing die overheating. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work is the {{experimental}} characterization of an innovative low temperature driven, dual lift, air-cooled, water ammonia absorption cycle. A prototype implementing this cycle has been characterized {{according to a new}} testing protocol currently under evaluation within the Task 48 – Quality Assurance and Support Measure for Solar Cooling, within the Solar Heating and Cooling programme of the IEA (IEA-SHC). The protocol is dedicated to the performance testing at steady state of heat driven ab-/adsorption chillers. According to the aforementioned procedure, both thermal and electrical COP of the unit are characterized in different conditions standard rating, application rating and full load. The main feature of the unit are: 3. 4 kW of cooling capacity (with chilled water at 7 - 12 °C), low temperature driving heat (85 – 95) °C, air-cooled condenser / absorber, self-adjusting refrigerant flow, COP typical of half-effect machine, very short response time during start-up and shut-down. The unit has been tested at different operating conditions: driving inlet temperatures in the range 85 to 95 °C, air temperatures from 27 to 40 °C and chiller <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> between 7 and 10 °C. The measured thermal and electrical COPs with stable operation of the unit in the investigated operating range are between 0. 22 - 0. 37 and 3. 5 - 10 respectively. Moreover, a thermodynamic model of the cycle has been developed and implemented in MATLAB. The experimental data collected during the mentioned tests have been used to validate and tune the cycle’s model. The model results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. In light of the results of this work, it is concluded that the tested unit could find application in different fields, including solar cooling and micro-trigeneration...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} widely used units in water cooling systems, the closed wet cooling towers (CWCTs) have two typical counter-flow constructions, in which the spray water flows from the top to the bottom, and the moist air and cooling water flow in the {{opposite}} direction vertically (parallel) or horizontally (cross), respectively. This study aims to present a simplified calculation method for conveniently and accurately analyzing the thermal performance of the two types of counter-flow CWCTs, viz. the parallel counter-flow CWCT (PCFCWCT) and the cross counter-flow CWCT (CCFCWCT). A simplified cooling capacity model that just includes two characteristic parameters is developed. The Levenberg–Marquardt method is employed to determine the model parameters by curve fitting of experimental data. Based on the proposed model, the predicted <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the process water are compared with the measurements of a PCFCWCT and a CCFCWCT, respectively, reported in the literature. The results indicate that the predicted values agree well with the experimental data in previous studies. The maximum absolute errors in predicting the process <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> are 0. 20 and 0. 24 °C for the PCFCWCT and CCFCWCT, respectively. These results indicate that the simplified method is reliable for performance prediction of counter-flow CWCTs. Although the flow patterns of the two towers are different, the variation trends of thermal performance are similar to each other under various operating conditions. The inlet air wet-bulb temperature, inlet cooling water temperature, air flow rate, and cooling water flow rate are crucial for determining the cooling capacity of a counter-flow CWCT, while the cooling tower effectiveness is mainly determined by the flow rates of air and cooling water. Compared with the CCFCWCT, the PCFCWCT is much more applicable in a large-scale cooling water system, and the superiority would be amplified when the scale of water distribution system increases. Without multiple iterative calculations and extensive experimental data, the simplified method could be used to effectively analyze the thermal performance of counter-flow CWCTs in operation. It is useful for optimization operation of counter-flow CWCTs such that to improve the energy efficiency of the overall cooling water system...|$|R
