50|$|Successful price {{discrimination}} requires that companies separate consumers {{according to their}} willingness to buy. Determining a customer's willingness to buy a good is difficult.

40|$|Too often, {{organizations}} that contract for software development services {{are at the}} mercy of vendors for cost and schedule estimates. Once a program office releases a request for proposal (RFP) for software development, it must somehow evaluate the validity of cost and schedule estimates that come back with the proposals.

40|$|The {{world has}} {{effectively}} exited the Industrial Age and is firmly {{planted in the}} Information Age. Global communication {{at the speed of}} light has been a great asset to both businesses and private citizens. However, there is a dark side to the age we live in, where terrorist groups are able to communicate, plan, fund, recruit, and spread their message to the world. The relative anonymity the internet provides hinders law enforcement and security agencies in not only locating would-be terrorists but also in disrupting their operations. The internet is a loosely knit group of computers and routers and is spread globally with servers hosting files, forums, chat rooms, which makes it unlikely that many are only in one country 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction. Assuming the hosting country is friendly, action can take a long time; meanwhile, the website can easily be backed up and moved to another server in another country, beginning the process over again. Legal obstacles make it very hard to seize files or listen in on communications. What if a diverse group of hackers were allowed to do what hackers do best and infiltrate not only the servers themselves but use them to spider into the terrorist 2 ̆ 7 s computers and even cell phones? What information might be uncovered? ^ Take a moment and think of the trove of information that resides on your laptop and cell phone. A quick list might include banking information, tax forms, family pictures, self-portraits, and/or picture of your new car. Banking information might be in the form of cookies stored on your computer when you visit the website. Tax forms, while not advisable, do reside on many hard drives. Pictures might seem benign but they can be used to identify someone, and modern cameras and cell phones contain metadata in their files such as GPS location of any given picture taken. This sort of data was brought to the public 2 ̆ 7 s attention in 2010 when Adam Savage, from the show Myth Busters, took a picture of his Toyota Land Cruiser with his iPhone in front of his house and posted it on Twitter stating it was time to go to work. The GPS tagging feature was enabled and not only gave away exactly where his house was but <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> he drove and when he leaves for work. In 2003 due to a bug in Photo Shop, TechTV 2 ̆ 7 s Cat Schwartz inadvertently exposed herself to the world when she posted a cropped photo of herself on her blog which contained EXIF data which held the nude photo. Metadata is not only contained in picture files but also files such as Word documents which tend to save changes made to the file using the 2 ̆ 2 auto save 2 ̆ 2 feature. These examples are of normal people living normal lives but what kind of data might be residing in a terrorist 2 ̆ 7 s computer? This leads to another question: Is cyber espionage a viable tool to combat terrorism?...|$|E
40|$|Self-regulation {{of driving}} shows promise as a {{strategy}} by which older drivers can compensate for declines in driving-related abilities and extend the time period over which they can safely drive. Self-regulation is generally described as the process of modifying one’s driving by driving less or intentionally avoiding specific driving situations considered to be challenging. Research undertaken in this thesis was intended to generate new knowledge {{about the process of}} self-regulation by older drivers at multiple levels of driver performance and decision making. Of special interest was how various individual, social, and environmental factors influence this process. Both self-report and objectively derived data on health, functioning, and driving from a sample of older drivers in the greater Melbourne area of Victoria, Australia were collected and analyzed to explore {{the nature and extent of}} self-regulation, the influence of selected factors on self-regulation, and the correspondence between self-reports of self-regulatory practices and objective driving patterns and behaviors. Three levels of driver behavior and decision making were included in the framework for examining self-regulation: tactical; strategic; and life-goal. Tactical self-regulation has to do with actual maneuvers made in traffic in response to conditions in the driving environment (e. g., reducing distractions while driving such as chatting with passengers, leaving more distance between one’s car and the car ahead). Strategic self-regulation has to do largely with pre-trip decisions about the circumstances under which to drive or not to drive (e. g., avoiding night driving or other situations considered challenging, reducing driving overall). Life-goal self-regulation has to do with drivers’ broader decisions in life that affect driving such as where to live in relation to the destinations one frequents or <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> to drive, with safety often being an important consideration in the vehicle purchase decision. Findings from the research provide valuable insights into the self-regulatory process among older adults. First, not all reported avoidance of driving or other driving modifications can be construed as self-regulation. Drivers report many reasons for modifying their driving, only some of which relate to what is commonly considered self-regulation. Reasons for reported driving avoidance or other practices were often more closely related to lifestyle or preferences than to self-regulation. Thus, to better understand self-regulation among older adults, it is important to understand the reasons that people have for avoiding driving situations or engaging in other practices. Second, self-regulation is clearly a multi-dimensional concept, and one that is tied to specific driving situations, as well as level of decision making. The research also indicated that reported strategic and tactical self-regulation are influenced by different sets of individual, social, and environmental factors. Strategic self-regulation was related to participants’ gender, self-perceived abilities and functioning, feelings of comfort and safety, whether they had family or friends available to drive them, and two clinical measures of functioning (the Rapid Pace Walk and the MVPT- 3). Factors found to be associated with tactical self-regulation were age, self-perceived abilities, and contrast sensitivity (as measured by the Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity test). Third, despite the relative infrequency of reported life-goal self-regulation, this level warrants further research because of the opportunity that life-goal decisions afford for enhancing older adult safety and mobility. For example, although the trend of aging in place is firmly entrenched among many older adults, there may be opportunities to create more livable communities with more accessible housing options to foster continued mobility. Similarly, efforts to make vehicles safer and more accessible for older adults, as well as to better educate older consumers about the safety features in vehicles, are increasingly being recognized as an important part of a multi-faceted approach to keeping older adults safely mobile. Fourth, the exploratory comparisons between objective measures of driving and drivers’ self-reports suggested that there was correspondence, although modest, between some objective driving measures and their comparable self-reported measures, but a lack of correspondence for others. There may be a role for self-reports in providing a context for understanding and helping interpret naturalistic driving data with regard to some self-regulatory driving practices. However, the discrepancies found between self-reported and objective measures of more general driving exposure raise concerns because of the critical role that accurate measures play in understanding crash risk. Continuing efforts to better understand the self-regulatory practices of older drivers at the tactical, strategic, and life-goal levels should provide additional insights into how the transition from driving to non-driving can be better managed to balance the interdependent needs of public safety and personal mobility...|$|E
