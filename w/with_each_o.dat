40|$|The {{potential}} role of intercellular {{adhesion molecule}} 1 (ICAM- 1) in {{the biology of}} human melanoma cells has stimulated interest in the characterization of its modulation. The present study {{has shown that the}} differentiating agent retinole acid (RA) up-regulates ICAM- 1 expres sion by melanoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The enhancement of ICAM- 1 cell surface expression is paralleled by an increase in ICAM- 1 mRNA. Therefore, ICAM- 1 represents an addi tional gene which may be transcriptionally regulated by RA. The five melanoma cell lines tested displayed a differential susceptibility to the modulation of ICAM- 1 expression by RA, since the cell line MeWo did not change in its ICAM- 1 expression following incubation with RA. Nevertheless, RA-insensitive as well as RA-sensitive melanoma cell lines displayed a higher increase in ICAM- 1 expression following in cubation with RA and cytokines than following incubation <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E

Because there is a cost associated <b>with</b> sending <b>each</b> <b>o</b> er, the optimal mailing strategy depends on both the bene t obtained from a purchase and how the o er a ects the buying behavior of the customers. In this paper, we describe two methods for partitioning the potential customers into groups, and show how to perform a simple cost-bene t analysis to decide which, if any, of the groups should be targeted. In particular, weconsidertwo decision-tree learning algorithms. The rst is an ø the shelf &quot; algorithm used to model the probability that groups of customers will buy the product. The second is a new algorithm that is similar to the rst, except that for each group, it explicitly models the probability of purchase under the two mailing scenarios: (1) the mail is sent tomembers of that group and (2) the mail is not sent to members of that group. Using data from a real-world advertising experiment, we compare the algorithms to each other and to a naive mail-to-all strategy. ...|$|R

Restoration of activity upon addition of Mn ions is affected in 3 ways: (1) Stimulation of the uptake of exogenous Mn into the cells—this uptake occurs in darkness, but is enhanced 5 to 10 fold by light; {{a high concentration of}} DCMU (1 × 10 − 5 m) decreases this light enhanced influx no more than 50 to 75 %; (2) Photoreactivation of the O 2 evolving centers, after excess Mn has been accumulated in the cells essentially no increase in Hill activity is observed unless the cells are illuminated. This photoreactivation is fully inhibited by 10 − 6 m DCMU and partially by benzoquinone. The Q 10 of photoreactivation proper is close to 1; (3) Photoinhibition of the activation—photoreactivation occurs most effectively in weak intensities (< one-fiftieth photosynthetic saturation in normal cells). Apparently at higher intensities an inhibitory photoprocess is overriding. This inhibition proved reversible.

These ring canals increase from 0. 5 microns in diameter at stage 2 to 10 microns in diameter at stage 11. Thin sections cut horizontally as you would cut a bagel, {{show that there is}} a layer of circumferentially oriented actin filaments attached to the plasma membrane at the periphery of each canal. By decoration with subfragment 1 of myosin we find actin filaments of mixed polarities in the ring such as found in the "contractile ring" formed during cytokinesis. In vertical sections through the canal the actin filaments appear as dense dots. At stage 2 there are 82 actin filaments in the ring, by stage 6 there are 717 and by stage 10 there are 726. Taking into account the diameter, this indicates that there is 170 microns of actin filaments/canal at stage 2 (pi x 0. 5 microns x 82), 14, 000 microns at stage 9 and approximately 23, 000 microns at stage 11 or one inch of actin filament! The density of actin filaments remains unchanged throughout development. What is particularly striking is that by stages 4 - 5, the ring of actin filaments has achieved its maximum thickness, even though the diameter has not yet increased significantly. Thereafter, the diameter increases. Throughout development, stages 2 - 11, the canal length also increases. Although the density (number of actin filaments/micron 2) through a canal remains constant from stage 5 on, the actin filaments appear as a net of interconnected bundles. Further information on this net of bundles comes from studying mutant animals that lack kelch, a protein located in the ring canal that has homology to the actin binding protein, scruin. In this mutant, the actin filaments form normally but individual bundles that comprise the fibers of the net are not bound tightly together. Some bundles enter into the ring canal lumen but do not completely occlude the lumen. all these observations lay the groundwork for our understanding of how a noncontractile ring increases in thickness, diameter, and length during development...|$|E

40|$|We present Approximation theory, an {{extension}} of Tarski's least fixpoint theory for nonmonotone operators in lattices. The key notion in our theory is that of an approximating operator A of an operator O on a lattice L. This is a monotone operator on the product lattice L^ 2 whose fixpoints approximate the fixpoints of the operator <b>O.</b> <b>With</b> <b>each</b> approximation of <b>O,</b> a unique well-founded {{and a collection of}} stable models can be associated.

We investigate the properties of this class of fixpoints.

40|$|Extensive {{calculations}} {{based on}} density functional theory {{have been carried}} out to understand the origin of magnetism in undoped ZnO thin films as found in recent experiments. The observed magnetism is confirmed to be due to Zn, instead of O, vacancy.

Moreover, the study of vacancy-vacancy interactions indicates that in the ground state, the magnetic moments induced by Zn vacancies prefer to ferromagnetically couple with the antiferromagnetic state lying 44 meV higher in energy. Since this is larger than the thermal energy at room temperature, the ferromagnetic state can be stable against thermal fluctuations. Calculations and discussions are also extended to ZnO nanowires that have larger surface to volume ratio. Here, the Zn vacancies are found to lead to the ferromagnetic state too. The present theoretical study not only demonstrates that ZnO samples can be magnetic even without transition-metal doping but also suggests that introducing Zn vacancy is a natural and an effective way to fabricate magnetic ZnO nanostructures. In addition, vacancy mediated magnetic ZnO nanostructures may have certain advantages over transition-metal doped systems in biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic CO {{oxidation}} on the RuO 2 (110) {{surface was}} studied at 300 K by {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM), high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS).

HREELS and TDS show formation of increasing amounts of H 2 O, retarded formation of O-cus atoms and incomplete removal of CO-bridge molecules during O 2 dosing, and a changing ratio of single- and double-bonded CO-bridge molecules. It is concluded that H 2 O (presumably from the residual gas) is accumulating at the Ru-cus sites thus blocking them, so that the dissociative adsorption of oxygen is prevented and the CO oxidation reaction is suppressed.

A test case for (I, O, κ) is an n-tuple (t 1, t 2, [...] ., tn) that specifies the value of each input parameter in I.
