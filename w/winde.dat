5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William <b>Winde,</b> although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, {{that it could have been}} the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that <b>Winde</b> was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by <b>Winde</b> between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which <b>Winde</b> recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E
5|$|The house {{which forms}} the {{architectural}} {{core of the}} palace was built for the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 {{to the design of}} William <b>Winde.</b> The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings. Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham's natural son, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1761 to GeorgeIII for £21,000. Sheffield's leasehold on the mulberry garden site, the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family, was due to expire in 1774.|$|E
500|$|In 1690, Sir John Brownlow {{was granted}} {{permission}} to enclose {{an area of}} 1,000acres (4km²) to transform into a park, with a grant to keep deer. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} some of this area had been a park since at least 1580. The park was laid out with avenues, including the still surviving Eastern Avenue which led east from the house. Brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted 21,400 ash trees, 9,500 oak trees, and 614 fruit trees. It is thought that William <b>Winde</b> may have advised on the layout of the gardens. Closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens, including canal ponds bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the [...] "rond-points" [...] (circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate) introduced by the landscape gardener André Le Nôtre. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, these formal parterres had been removed and the canal ponds filled in.|$|E

Romulus <b>Windes,</b> was Arizona's first Baptist minister. [...] <b>Windes</b> married Hope G. Anderson, they had a daughter, Honor, and two sons, Dudley and John. <b>Windes</b> studied law at Indiana University, graduating in 1914.|$|R

After {{taking a break}} from his law career during World War I to serve as American vice consul in Madrid, Spain, <b>Windes</b> returned to Tempe to continues {{practicing law}} until 1923, when he became a judge on the Maricopa County Superior Court, forcing him to move within the Phoenix city limits. He served as a judge until 1931, and was Special Assistant Attorney General from 1935 to 1937. <b>Windes</b> was elected to the Supreme Court in 1952. He did not seek re-election in 1958. <b>Windes</b> died in May, 1972.|$|R

500|$|The {{principal}} room is {{the large}} Marble Hall (1) at {{the centre of the}} south front; this hall {{is the beginning of a}} grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or Saloon (9) on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour (11, now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase (2), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms (8, 10). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (3, etc.) that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, [...] "now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession," [...] William <b>Winde</b> reported in 1690.|$|E
500|$|Whoever the architect, Belton follows {{closely the}} design of Clarendon House, {{completed}} in 1667. This great London town house (demolished c. 1683) {{has been one of}} the most admired buildings of its era due to [...] "its elegant symmetry and confident and common-sensical design". Sir John Summerson described Clarendon House as [...] "the most influential house of its time among those who aimed at the grand manner" [...] and Belton as [...] "much the finest surviving example of its class". John and Alice Brownlow assembled one of the finest teams of craftsmen available at the time to work on the project. This dream team was headed by the master mason William Stanton who oversaw the project. His second in command, John Thompson, had worked with Sir Christopher Wren on several of the latter's London churches, while the chief joiner John Sturges had worked at Chatsworth under William Talman. The wrought-ironworker John Warren worked under Stanton at Denham Place, Buckinghamshire, and the fine wrought iron gates and overthrow at Belton may be his. Thus so competent were the builders of Belton that <b>Winde</b> may have done little more than provide the original plans and drawings, leaving the interpretation to the on-site craftsmen. This theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block. More provincial, and less masterful in proportion, it is known to have been entirely the work of Stanton.|$|E

2500|$|On {{starting}} at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year. Historian Brigitte Hamann writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of High German with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable. Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: [...] "Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger <b>Winde</b> wegen Wienwärts" [...] ("Wittgenstein strolls wistfully Vienna-wards due to adverse winds"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark (5) in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing. He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931: [...] "My bad spelling in youth, up {{to the age of}} about 18 or 19, is connected with the whole of the rest of my character (my weakness in study)." ...|$|E
