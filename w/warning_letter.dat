25|$|The War of Independence {{broke out}} in the state of Guanajuato in the town of Dolores, when Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla shouted the “Grito de Dolores” and raised an insurgent army on 15 and 16 September 1810. This army marched to San Miguel, today San Miguel de Allende, and then onto the city of Guanajuato. Just on the {{outskirts}} on 28 September 1810, Hidalgo sent a <b>warning</b> <b>letter</b> to city authorities, but it was ignored. Instead, royalist troops and many of the elite made their stand at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas granary, an imposing building with few windows and thick walls. After entering the city unopposed, Hidalgo decided to attack the granary. This was the first battle against Spanish troops in the war and is popularly called the 'Siege of the Alhondiga'. The insurgents were unable to take the heavily defended building as royalist gunfire kept them from approaching the only entrance until a miner by the name of Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, better known as El Pípila, brilliantly strapped a large flat stone onto his back for protection. Crawling, he carried a flask of tar and a torch. When he reached the wooden doors of the main entrance, he smeared it with the tar and set it on fire. This allowed the insurgents to penetrate the building, defeat the Spanish royalist army and elite, and take over the heavily fortified and defended building. This action is commemorated by a colossal statue of Pipila on a hill overlooking the city.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George criticised Haig to Foch on a {{visit to}} the Western Front in September, and {{proposed}} sending Robertson on a mission to persuade Russia to make the maximum possible effort. With Royal backing, and despite Lloyd George offering to go himself, Robertson refused to go, later writing to Haig that it had been an excuse for Lloyd George to “become top dog” and “have his wicked way”. Lloyd George continued to demand, in the teeth of Robertson’s objections, that aid be sent to help Romania, eventually demanding (9 October) that 8 British divisions be sent to Salonika. This was logistically impossible, but to Robertson’s anger the War Committee instructed him to consult Joffre. Derby dissuaded him from resigning the next day, but instead he wrote a long letter to Lloyd George (11 October) complaining that Lloyd George was offering strategic advice contrary to his own and seeking the advice of a foreign general, and threatening to resign if his advice was not followed. That same day Northcliffe stormed into Lloyd George’s office to threaten him (he was unavailable) and the Secretary of State also received a <b>warning</b> <b>letter</b> from Gwynne, who had earlier been highly critical of his interview with Foch. Lloyd George had to give his “word of honour” to Asquith that he had complete confidence in Haig and Robertson and thought them irreplaceable. However, he wrote to Robertson wanting to know how their differences had been leaked to the press (although he affected to believe that Robertson had not personally “authorised such a breach of confidence & discipline”) and asserting his right to express his opinions about strategy. The Army Council went on record forbidding unauthorised press contacts, although that did nothing to stop War Office leaks.|$|E
25|$|St Helens' former stadium was Knowsley Road, renamed in 2008 to the GPW Recruitment Stadium for {{sponsorship}} reasons. Prior to this, {{in particular}} when St Helens were playing simply rugby football, {{they shared the}} City Ground with St Helens Recs. They left this stadium in 1890 for Knowsley Road and played there for 120 years. The ground {{at the time of}} its construction was considered modern, with one seated stand, and three standing areas that could, prior to strict safety regulations set in place, hold up to 40,000 people, shown by their record home crowd of 35,695 against Wigan in 1949. In their first match at the new ground, St Helens beat Manchester Rangers, played under rugby football rules. After the great schism of 1895, and St Helens joining the NRFU, their first game at Knowsley Road under traditional rugby league rules was against Rochdale, in front of 3,000 spectators. Over the years, however, age took its toll on the ground. Despite the big names like Meninga, van Vollenhoven, Lyon etc. coming to the club, it was constantly argued that, unlike other big clubs, St Helens did not have the stadium to suit their on—field talent. In 2006, the ground was treated to something of a makeover, after financial input from St Helens big money sponsors Earth Money. This aided the ground in gaining international rugby, with a fixture between Great Britain and New Zealand being held there in 2006. However, in 2008, St Helens were given a <b>warning</b> <b>letter</b> from the RFL, as a result of the ensuing licensing system that was to be introduced into Super League in 2009, stating that the quality of their current stadium was too poor for the expected quality of a licence in the league. Thankfully for Saints, they were permitted by the council to begin construction on a new ground, and confirmed that they would move away from Knowsley Road in 2011. It was announced that the new complex, to be built on an unused glass site in Peasley Cross, was to feature at least 12,000 seats, a large car park, and a Tesco store next to the ground. In addition to this, an iconic bridge, directly linking the ground to the town centre went under construction on 9 August 2010. Whether the stadium would be ready for the beginning of the 2011 season was always uncertain, and grounds such as Leigh Sports Village were suggested to home Saints for the period between. However, the Halton Stadium, Widnes was the chosen venue for Saints for the 2011 season, and they will play all of their home games there before permanently relocating in 2012. Saints currently play at the Totally Wicked Stadium.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the number and}} type of <b>warning</b> <b>letters</b> issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to pharmaceutical manufacturers for promotional violations. Methods: Two reviewers downloaded, printed and independently evaluated <b>warning</b> <b>letters</b> issued by the FDA to pharmaceutical manufacturers from years 2003 - 2008. Misleading claims were broadly classified as clinical, Quality-of-Life (QoL), and economic claims. Clinical claims included claims regarding unsubstantiated efficacy, safety and tolerability, superiority, broadening of indication and/or omission of risk information. QoL claims included unsubstantiated quality of life and/or health-related quality of life claims. Economic claims included any form of claim made {{on behalf of the}} pharmaceutical companies related to cost superiority of or cost savings from the drug compared to other drugs in the market. Results: In the 6 -year study period, 65 <b>warning</b> <b>letters</b> were issued by FDA, which contained 144 clinical, three QoL, and one economic claim. On an average, 11 <b>warning</b> <b>letters</b> were issued per year. Omission of risk information was the most frequently violated claim (30. 6 %) followed by unsubstantiated efficacy claims (18. 6 %). Warning letters were primarily directed to manufacturers of cardiovascular (14. 6 %), anti-microbial (14. 6 %), and CNS (12. 5 %) drugs. Majority of the claims referenced in <b>warning</b> <b>letters</b> contained promotional materials directed to physicians (57 %). Conclusion: The study found that misleading clinical outcome claims formed the majority of the promotional violations, and majority of the claims were directed to physicians. Since inadequate promotion of medications may lead to irrational prescribing, the study emphasizes the importance of disseminating reliable, credible, and scientific information to patients, and more importantly, physicians to protect public health...|$|R

500|$|In 1994 Richwood Pharmaceuticals {{acquired}} Rexar {{and began}} promoting Obetrol {{as a treatment}} for ADHD (and later narcolepsy as well), now marketed under the new brand name of Adderall, a contraction of the phrase [...] "A.D.D. for All" [...] intended to convey that [...] "it was meant to be kind of an inclusive thing" [...] for marketing purposes. The FDA cited the company for numerous significant CGMP violations related to Obetrol discovered during routine inspections following the acquisition (including issuing a formal <b>warning</b> <b>letter</b> for the violations), then later issued a second formal <b>warning</b> <b>letter</b> to Richwood Pharmaceuticals specifically due to violations of [...] "the new drug and misbranding provisions of the FD Act". Following extended discussions with Richwood Pharmaceuticals regarding the resolution {{of a large number of}} issues related to the company's numerous violations of FDA regulations, the FDA formally approved the first Obetrol labeling/sNDA revisions in 1996, including a name change to Adderall and a restoration of its status as an approved drug product.

The film was disagreeable to O'Hara because Payne dropped out {{and was replaced by}} George Montgomery, whom she found [...] "positively loathsome". Montgomery attempted to make a pass at her during the production, prolonging his kiss with her after the director had yelled [...] "cut". Later that year, O'Hara starred opposite Tyrone Power, Laird Cregar and Anthony Quinn in Henry King's swashbuckler The Black Swan. O'Hara recalled that it was [...] "everything you could want in a lavish pirate picture: a magnificent ship with thundering cannons; a dashing hero battling menacing villains... sword fights; fabulous costumes...". She found it exhilarating working with Power, who was renowned for his [...] "wicked sense of humor". O'Hara grew very concerned about one scene in the picture in which she is thrown overboard in her underwear by Power, and sent a <b>warning</b> <b>letter</b> home to Ireland in advance. She refused to take her wedding ring off in one scene which resulted in screen adjustments {{to make it look like}} a dinner ring. Though the film was praised by critics and is seen as one of the period's most enjoyable adventure films, the critic from The New York Times thought O'Hara's character lacked depth, commenting that [...] "Maureen O'Hara is brunette and beautiful—which is all the part requires".|$|E

500|$|During {{her time}} at the English court, Lehzen {{attracted}} attention outside of the royal household for her close relationship with Victoria. She was criticised for her influence with the queen, particularly from those who disliked German influences at court. Pamphlets, many released by the Tory party, complained of the [...] "stranger harboured in our country" [...] and the [...] "evil counsellors" [...] surrounding Victoria. One in particular, published as the <b>Warning</b> <b>Letter</b> to Baroness Lehzen, declared that a [...] "certain foreign lady pulled the wires of a diabolical conspiracy of which Lady Flora {{was to be the}} first victim," [...] a reference to the Flora Hastings affair. More positive, The Times once described her as having simply [...] "held a highly and strictly confidential situation about the person of the Sovereign." [...] As a sign of the perceived political influence she possessed, in 1838 false rumours suggested that Lehzen had been [...] "converted" [...] to the Whig party, and that she had been offered [...] "an urgent proposal of marriage" [...] by Whig prime minister Viscount Melbourne. Despite all of this criticism, historian Gillian Gill describes how Lehzen was honest and frugal; even after Victoria ascended the throne, she seems to have made no demands for money or rank, preferring instead to simply be in the queen's company. Historian K.D. Reynolds adds that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character and moral development, in particular giving the queen the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship. Not all of her influence was positive however; Reynolds also speculates that the 1839 Bedchamber crisis stemmed partly from Victoria's unwillingness to lose Lehzen.|$|E
