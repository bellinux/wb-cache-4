5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. <b>White</b> <b>gloves,</b> shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|Sora was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura as the protagonist of Kingdom Hearts. However, he was not originally slated to be the protagonist as Disney wanted Donald Duck to fill the role, while Square wanted Mickey Mouse. Nomura designed Sora with the concepts of the Disney characters in mind, basing his outfit on Mickey Mouse's trademark <b>white</b> <b>gloves,</b> red shorts and giant yellow shoes. Sora originally wielded a weapon resembling a chainsaw; however, the weapon was not well received by Disney which led Nomura to redesign the weapon into a Keyblade. He was also designed with lion-like features, which were removed as the staff {{found them to be}} similar to the one of the Final Fantasy IX protagonist Zidane Tribal. After a talk with the Disney staff, the design was further reworked, and Nomura finished it after a night's work.|$|E

25|$|Roose {{generally}} {{carried a}} pair of <b>white</b> <b>gloves</b> onto the pitch but preferred, in good weather, to play with bare hands. He was regarded as unusual in insisting on playing in padded knee-bandages and a twin-peak cap.|$|E
25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and <b>white</b> <b>gloves.</b> <b>White</b> <b>gloves</b> were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore <b>white</b> <b>gloves</b> making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades <b>white</b> <b>gloves</b> are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E

25|$|Mickey Mouse {{is a funny}} animal cartoon {{character}} and the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and <b>white</b> <b>gloves,</b> Mickey {{has become one of}} the world's most recognizable characters.|$|E
25|$|The Opry House (March 28, 1929) was {{the first}} time in which Mickey wore his <b>white</b> <b>gloves.</b> Mickey wears them in almost all of his {{subsequent}} appearances and many other characters followed suit. The three lines on the back of Mickey's gloves represent darts in the gloves' fabric extending from between the digits of the hand, typical of glove design of the era.|$|E
25|$|The {{counterpart}} to the slave was the dandy, a common {{character in the}} afterpiece. He was a northern urban black man trying to live above his station by mimicking white, upper-class speech and dress—usually to no good effect. Dandy characters often went by Zip Coon, after the song popularized by George Washington Dixon, although others had pretentious names like Count Julius Caesar Mars Napoleon Sinclair Brown. Their clothing was a ludicrous parody of upper-class dress: coats with tails and padded shoulders, <b>white</b> <b>gloves,</b> monocles, fake mustaches, and gaudy watch chains. They spent their time primping and preening, going to parties, dancing and strutting, and wooing women.|$|E

25|$|On 4 April, {{the body}} of John Paul II was moved onto a red velvet catafalque, with his head propped on three red pillows. The Papal Gentlemen, clothed in black morning coats and <b>white</b> <b>gloves,</b> were chosen as pallbearers and stood {{along the sides of}} the pope's bier. Cardinal Martínez Somalo, dressed in red and gold vestments, officiated the {{asperges}} rite. He blessed the pope with the holy waters of baptism three times: {{to the right of the}} pope, at his head and then to his left. An acolyte then brought to the Camerlengo a thurible and boat. Cardinal Martínez Somalo incensed the pope three times.|$|E
500|$|The {{councillor}} cut {{an impressive}} figure. [...] He was well over six foot tall with piercing sky-blue eyes. [...] His resplendent diplomat's uniform, {{which he used}} on all occasions, shone brightly with gold brocade and included a high collar with <b>white</b> <b>gloves,</b> even in the tropical heat. [...] Such fashion was calculated {{to give him a}} larger-than-life presence, symbolic of the enormous empire he represented. [...] Paraguayans were sensitive to subtleties in appearance and they understood such an image... In appearance he suggested a modern European statesman, a man who combined shrewdness and easy familiarity with power...|$|E
500|$|The {{township}} {{had several}} other significant houses. Generations of the Shakerley {{family lived in}} Shakerley Old Hall, close to the Shakerley Brook and Roman road. In medieval times they paid rent to Cockersand Abbey and dues of [...] "one pair of <b>white</b> <b>gloves</b> at the feast of Easter" [...] to Adam Tyldesley. Chaddock Hall was home to a family of yeomen farmers. Its name was variously recorded as Chaydok, Chaidoke and Chaidok, the last syllable probably meaning [...] "oak". It {{was surrounded by a}} hamlet in the east of the township. The Chaddocks, like the Tyldesleys and Shakerleys, had a reputation for lawlessness.|$|E

500|$|The Marquess, who {{had been}} jailed for jewel theft in his youth, was harsh towards his eldest son, {{according}} to friends of the latter. He did not show John any clear love or affection, and was emotionally distant {{to the extent that}} John was required to wear long <b>white</b> <b>gloves</b> during dinner. [...] "He treated his son and heir with indifference and contempt," [...] said Anthony Haden-Guest. [...] Jamie Spencer-Churchill, a schoolfriend, summed up the relationship: [...] "Victor created the monster that John became." [...] John was a ward of court for some time after his mother left Ickworth.|$|E
500|$|Buzz {{is one of}} the two {{official}} mascots of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Buzz {{is usually}} represented as a stylized yellowjacket with yellow-and-black fur, white wings, a yellow head, and antennae. Buzz is almost never drawn with six legs, but rather with arms, legs, hands (in <b>white</b> <b>gloves)</b> and feet (in black Converse high tops), like a human. Invented in 1972 and restyled in 1979, Buzz reflects the tradition of referring to Georgia Tech students as [...] "Yellow Jackets." [...] Buzz is also one of Georgia Tech's emblems and trademarks, one that they defended in a 1998 legal conflict with the Salt Lake Buzz.|$|E
500|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Geisel {{told his}} biographers, Judith and Neil Morgan, that he {{conceived}} the beginnings of the story while he was with Spaulding, in an elevator in the Houghton Mifflin offices in Boston. It was an old, shuddering elevator and was operated by a [...] "small, stooped woman wearing 'a leather half-glove and a secret smile'". Anita Silvey, recounting a similar story, described the woman as [...] "a very elegant, very petite African-American woman named Annie Williams". Geisel told Silvey that, when he sketched the Cat in the Hat, he thought of Williams and gave the character Williams' <b>white</b> <b>gloves</b> and [...] "sly, even foxy smile".|$|E
