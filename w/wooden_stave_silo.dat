40|$|Examination of the {{contents}} of the three types of silo in use at the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station showed the following chemical changes during the actual period of silage formation. 1. Non-reducing sugar was rapidly changed to reducing sugar, and the latter then decreased in amount but did not disappear completely. 2. The amount of volatile acids increased daily. 3. In the concrete silo, as already demonstrated for the hollow tile and <b>wooden</b> <b>stave</b> <b>silos,</b> the racemic lactic acid produced showed a daily increase. 4. Alcohol was formed in small amounts in each silo. 5. Carbon dioxide developed very rapidly after filling the silo. 6. Free oxygen disappeared entirely after the second or third day. 7. The maximum temperature observed in any of the three silos was 91 0 Fahrenheit. 8. Within the limits of this investigation, no differences were noted which might be attributed to difference in the material of which the silos were constructed...|$|R

Each silage from the <b>stave</b> <b>silos</b> was full-fed to 16 steers in individual pens. Half the steers received 2 lbs. of supplement; the other half received supplement + 2 lbs. of cracked corn. Steers fed Sila-bac and Silo Guard silages performed slightly better than those fed control silage. Adding cracked corn improved rate of gain (. 37 lb. /day) and feed efficiency (. 71 lb. less DM/lb. of gain). Each 1. 0 lb. of extra gain required 5. 5 lbs. of air-dry corn...|$|R

50|$|In a {{case with}} {{similarities}} to the Bentley case, a House of Lords judgment of 17 July 1997 cleared Philip English of murdering Sergeant Bill Forth in March 1993, the reasons being given by Lord Hutton. English had been handcuffed before his companion Paul Weddle killed Sgt Forth with a concealed knife. The existing joint enterprise law allowed {{the conviction of}} English for murder because they had both been attacking Sgt Forth with <b>wooden</b> <b>staves,</b> making English an accessory to any murder committed by Weddle {{as part of that}} assault. Lord Hutton made the 'fine distinction' that a concealed knife was a far more deadly weapon than a <b>wooden</b> <b>stave,</b> so that proof of English's knowledge of it was necessary for conviction. The appeal may have influenced the allowing of a posthumous referral of the Bentley case.|$|R
50|$|Concrete <b>stave</b> <b>silos</b> are {{constructed}} from small precast concrete blocks with ridged grooves along each edge that lock them {{together into a}} high strength shell.
