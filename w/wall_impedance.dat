40|$|A {{technique}} is presented {{for the analysis}} of measured data obtained from a rotating microphone rake system. The system is designed to measure the interaction modes of ducted fans. A Fourier analysis of the data from the rotating system results in a set of circumferential mode levels at each radial location of a microphone inside the duct. Radial basis functions are then least-squares fit to this data to obtain the radial mode amplitudes. For ducts with soft walls and mean flow, the radial basis functions must be numerically computed. The linear companion matrix method is used to obtain both the eigenvalues of interest, without an initial guess, and the radial basis functions. The governing equations allow for the mean flow to have a boundary layer at the wall. In addition, a nonlinear least-squares method is used to adjust the <b>wall</b> <b>impedance</b> to best fit the data in an attempt to use the rotating system as an in-duct <b>wall</b> <b>impedance</b> measurement tool.

In this paper, a calibration method is proposed which uses hard <b>wall</b> <b>impedance</b> measurements at different positions of the reference section.
