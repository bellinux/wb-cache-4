2500|$|According to {{director}} Len Wiseman, [...] "You'd {{think that}} the concept of vampires and werewolves mixing it up had been done more than a few times on film. But according to Wiseman, the mix hadn't really been done in decades. [...] "It's funny {{because a lot of the}} talk has been that it's a simple concept and why hasn't this been done before. It's true. When we decided let's do vampires and werewolves, we thought that concept's been done. Of course it's been done. We talked to our agent, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet, we looked at everything, and outside of the 50s, it just hasn't been done. It was kind of shocking to us".|$|E
2500|$|Kuk Harrell, {{one of the}} {{producers}} of Talk That Talk, spoke on the recording of the album saying: [...] "In addition to touring, we are recording Rihanna's new album. We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. Before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 22nd of this month. You {{have seen}} Mr. Chorley's book, I daresay, which I should like much to see.|$|R
6000|$|That {{evening he}} again spoke to her, saying merely a word. [...] "I think, my dear, we'll have it fixed that <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 30th. Sir Alured seemed to wish it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was. Mr. Appleby, our manager, {{took him}} {{on the day before}} <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trip. I don't know where Mr. Appleby met him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here we are again!" [...] sang out Fred, {{dropping}} his baggage and shaking hands all around. [...] "I declare it's like when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> houseboat trip." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> reef-belt still {{accompanied}} us; turning as we turned, and thundering its distant bass {{upon the}} ear, like the unbroken {{roar of a}} cataract. Dashing forever against their coral rampart, the breakers looked, in the distance, like a line of rearing white chargers, reined in, tossing their white manes, and bridling with foam.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's 'Good-night an' God bless you,' to th' owd place, granfeythers an' grammothers," [...] laughed George {{as he ran}} upstairs—"an' off <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gallivant," [...] {{he shouted}} from the landing.|$|R
6000|$|... "If we have {{to build}} up and {{underpin}} the line, it will certainly cost us something," [...] he said. [...] "However, we'll find that out as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> main thing is to start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No 'time,' gracious lady, for my impatience," [...] Mr. Mitchett replied, [...] "could {{be better}} than the present--but if you've reasons for wanting a better place why shouldn't <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot into another room?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted to}} {{ascertain}} whether the ropes had been picked up off the deck. One could only do that by feeling with one's feet. In my cautious progress I came against a man in whom I recognized Ransome. He possessed an unimpaired physical solidity which was manifest {{to me at the}} contact. He was leaning against the quarter-deck capstan and kept silent. It was like a revelation. He was the collapsed figure sobbing for breath I had noticed before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poop.|$|E
6000|$|... "The leader {{stopped and}} growled, {{at the edge}} of an open crack. His {{instinct}} warned him of danger, but I knew I could not get up the rough bank with my lame foot, and drove him past. As I limped by his side with the whip, I thought I heard the current gurgle under the ice, but <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> dogs snuffing and treading cautiously. Then there was a soft thud and a splash, the team was jerked back and I saw that the sledge had vanished. I suppose it had broken through a snow-bridge that our weight had shaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} such a fellow for keeping a promise! You {{stick to it}} through thick and thin, no matter how silly or hard it is. You remember, mother, last summer, how you {{told him not to}} go in a boat and he promised, the day <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> picnic. We rode up, but the horse ran off home, so we had to come back by way of the river, all but Jack, and he walked every step of five miles because he wouldn't go near a boat, though Mr. Burton was there to take care of him. I call that rather overdoing the matter;" [...] and Frank looked as if he thought {{moderation}} even in virtue a good thing.|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> up <b>the</b> long slope, I {{relating}} our adventures, {{to which}} Mr. Marnham listened without comment.|$|R
60|$|Then, as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> corner together, I {{told her}} why I did it, and {{recalled}} the car-ride.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who are we? I'll {{tell you}} one thing. While all the reformers are pecking at each other we shall quietly come along and swallow up the lot. We've simply grasped this {{elementary}} fact, that theories are no basis for reform. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evidence of our eyes and noses; what we see and smell is wrong we correct by practical and scientific means." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the white}} men are good and great," [...] Keesh made answer. [...] "The white men have taught us many things. The white men have given us {{blankets}} and knives and guns, such as we have never made and never could make. I remember in what manner we lived before they came. I was unborn then, but I have it from my father. When <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hunt we must creep {{so close to the}} moose that a spear-cast would cover the distance. To-day we use the white man's rifle, and farther away than can a child's cry be heard. We ate fish and meat and berries--there was nothing else to eat--and we ate without salt. How many be there among you who care {{to go back to the}} fish and meat without salt?" ...|$|E
60|$|We went on deck. Would we eat on board, asked another person. No, we wouldn't. We {{went out}} to a fourth little shed, which was a {{refreshment}} stall, and bought bread and sardines and chocolate and apples. Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck to make our meal. In a sheltered place I lit the spirit lamp, and put on water to boil. The water we had taken from the cabin. Then we sat down alone in the darkness, on a seat which had its back against the deck cabins, now appropriated by the staff. A thin, cold wind was travelling. We wrapped the one plaid round us both and snugged together, waiting for the tea to boil. I could just see {{the point of the}} spirit-flame licking up, from where we sat.|$|E
6000|$|... "If it is a thick {{night and}} the weather is bad we anchor, but when it is clear {{enough to see the}} stars, or if the wind is steady so as to give us our direction, we go on. There is a man always {{standing}} at the side with a lead-line, and that tells us the depth of water, which is quite guide enough for the master. Of course we never sail in rough weather, for if <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sand then we should soon go to pieces; but if it is fine when we stick fast, which is very seldom, we put out the anchor and lower the sail, and go to sleep until the tide floats us again. Come up into the top; you can see a great deal farther from there than you can from the deck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> I'm <b>the</b> King--that is, the Knight of Snowdon--James Fitzjames, for I'm in disguise, you know; and you're Ellen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Won't {{you look}} into school, and see how <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on?</b> <b>The</b> women complained so much of having their {{children}} on their hands, though I am sure they had sent them to school seldom enough of late, that I got this young woman from Mrs. Stuart's asylum till the holidays. I think we shall let her stay on, she has {{a good deal of}} method, and all seem pleased with the change.' ...|$|R
6000|$|After supper, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> board <b>the</b> steamer, {{and about}} ten o'clock she cast loose, {{and as she}} slowly moved away, we heard the old {{familiar}} words: ...|$|R
60|$|Another time, of date {{probably}} very contiguous, I remember hearing Sterling preach. It {{was in some}} new college-chapel in Somerset-house (I suppose, {{what is now called}} King's College); a very quiet small place, the audience student-looking youths, with a few elder people, perhaps mostly friends of the preacher's. The discourse, delivered with a grave sonorous composure, and far surpassing in talent the usual run of sermons, had withal an air of human veracity as I still recollect, and bespoke dignity and piety of mind: but gave me the impression rather of artistic excellence than of unction or inspiration in that kind. Sterling returned with us to Chelsea that day;--and in the afternoon <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Thames Putney-ward together, we two with my Wife; under the sunny skies, on the quiet water, and with copious cheery talk, the remembrance of which is still present enough to me.|$|E
60|$|On our left, as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> {{bush was}} low, all of yellow Cassia and white Hibiscus, and tangled with lovely convolvulus-like creepers, Ipomoea and Echites, with white, purple, or yellow flowers. On the right were negro huts and gardens, {{fewer and fewer}} as we went on--all rich with fruit-trees, {{especially}} with oranges, hung with fruit of every hue; and beneath them, of course, the pine- apples of La Brea. Everywhere along the road grew, seemingly wild here, that pretty low tree, the Cashew, with rounded yellow-veined leaves and little green flowers, followed by a quaint pink and red- striped pear, from which hangs, at the larger and lower end, a kidney-shaped bean, which bold folk eat when roasted: but woe to those who try it when raw, for the acrid oil blisters the lips; and even while the beans are roasting, the fumes of the oil will blister the cook's face if she holds it too near the fire.|$|E
60|$|To-day when I {{went up on}} deck, {{the first}} thing I saw was Uncle Henry. I hardly {{recognized}} him. He had on an old blue sailor's jersey, and was cleaning up a brass rail with a rag. I {{asked him why he}} was dressed like that and Uncle Henry laughed and said he had become an admiral. I couldn't think what he meant, as I never guess things with a double meaning, so he explained that he has got work as a sailor for the voyage across. I thought he looked very nice in his sailor's jersey, much nicer than in the coat with gold facings, when he was our High Admiral. He reminded me very much of those big fair-haired Norwegian sailors that we used to see when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Meteor to Flekkefyord and Gildeskaale. I am sure that he will be of great service to this English captain, in helping to work the ship across.|$|E
6000|$|... "My son, be not hasty," [...] {{returned}} the chief. [...] "Prayer is quite as needful as action. Besides, I {{know all the}} land round here--the direction which this youth tells me the enemy have taken, and a short cut over the hills, which will enable you and me to cross the path your father must take, and join him, {{so that we have}} plenty of time to make arrangements and talk before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> war-path." ...|$|R
60|$|After breakfast <b>we</b> <b>went</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front porch, lighted up {{two of the}} landlord's flor de upas perfectos, {{and took}} a look at Georgia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. It won't do {{any harm}} having {{somebody}} examine it who knows {{a bit about}} these things. Now, what shall <b>we</b> do. <b>Go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river?" ...|$|R
60|$|They went down, {{they went}} down in lines and heaps, riddled through and through. But still others came on for they fought under {{the eye of the}} Great King, and to fly meant death with shame and torture. We could not kill them all, they were too many. We could not kill the half of them. Now their {{foremost}} were within ten paces of us and since we must stand up to shoot, our men began to fall, also pierced with arrows. I caused the blast of retreat to be sounded on the ivory horn and step by step we drew back to the crest of the ridge, shooting as <b>we</b> <b>went.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> crest we re-formed rapidly in a double line standing as close as we could together and my example was followed all down the ranks to right and left. Then I bethought me of a plan that I had taught these archers again and again in Ethiopia.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was curious}} to see how {{different}} the different teams were {{in regard to the}} number of horses. Sometimes we had four horses, sometimes five, and once we had seven. For a long time I could not tell what the reason was for such a difference. But at last I found out. It was because some of the stages were pretty nearly level, and others were almost all up hill. Of course, where {{there was a great deal}} of up hill they required more horses. At the time when they put on seven horses I knew that we had come to a place where it was almost all up hill; and it was. The road went winding around through a region of hills and valleys, but ascending all the time. Still the road was so hard and smooth, and the horses were so full of life, that <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> full trot the whole way. Four horses could not have done this, though, with such a heavy load. It took seven.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had been}} a long while on the steamer waiting for Rectus. She was to sail at three o'clock, and it was then after two. The day was clear and fine, but so much sitting and {{standing}} about had made me cold, so that I was very glad to see a carriage drive up with Rectus and his father and mother. I went down to them. I was anxious to see Rectus, for it had been nearly a year since we had met. He seemed about the same as he used to be, and had certainly not grown much. He just shook hands with me and said, [...] "How d' ye do, Gordon?" [...] Mr. and Mrs. Colbert seemed ever so much more pleased to see me, and when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck, the old gentleman took me into the captain's room, the door of which stood open. The captain was not there, but I don't believe Mr. Colbert would have cared if he had been. All he seemed to want was to find a place where we could get away from the people on deck. When he had partly closed the door, he said: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> {{uppermost}} story. It was cut {{off from}} the rest of the house by a stout partition of wood, and a door covered with green baize.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>we</b> might <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{forecastle}} {{as well as}} not," [...] said Waldron, [...] "even {{according to}} your own rule. For there is a passenger there." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> through <b>the</b> straggling, raw village, deep {{beside the}} stream, then over the small bridge, {{and up the}} steep hill down which I had come earlier in the evening.|$|R
