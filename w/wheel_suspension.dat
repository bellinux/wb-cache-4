25|$|The AC Ace LM Prototype was {{a single}} piece from the year 1958 with the unusual chassis number LM5000, which John Tojeiro {{designed}} {{on behalf of the}} brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long distance racing]. The vehicle was only 737-kilogram and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, lightweight, tubular steel frame without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with single <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension,</b> this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with coil spring / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by the body builder Cavendish Morton. The engine/ transmission unit, a tuned production unit, came from the Bristol Type 100D2 / S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the prototype, which was not yet mature, completed two assignments in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next-class category in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The 'Bristol' engine / gearbox unit went back there, the racing car was sold without drive and later rebuilt. It still exists today as a collector's item.|$|E

40|$|WO 2010097173 A 1 UPAB: 20100920 NOVELTY - The system (1) has a set {{of wheels}} (7) {{positioned}} in <b>wheel</b> <b>suspensions</b> (6). The <b>wheels</b> are arranged on a wheel carrier (2) that is subjected by rotary drives (4, 5). Angles of wheel axles (8) are adjusted via the respective <b>wheel</b> <b>suspensions</b> by a control drive (13) during revolution of the wheel carrier. The <b>wheel</b> <b>suspensions</b> are equipped with a linear guide directed perpendicular to a rotation axis, and a free end of the guide is hinged at an adjusting pin (11). Actuators (14) are arranged {{at right angles to}} each other. USE - Drive system for driverless industrial trucks that are utilized for container handling. Can also be used for manually-driven industrial trucks e. g. fork-lift and towing vehicle. ADVANTAGE - The angles of the wheel axles are adjusted via the respective <b>wheel</b> <b>suspensions</b> by the control drive during the revolution of the wheel carrier, thus increasing efficiency of the system, reducing wear on the wheels, ensuring high protection against contamination while ensuring low expenditure for maintenance for the drive system...|$|R

50|$|The {{official}} BMW Motorrad {{explanation of}} the duolever includes this:The advantage of this front <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> on the motorcycle market at present is its torsional rigidity. The BMW Motorrad Duolever front <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> is not influenced by negative forces {{in the same manner}} as a conventional telefork whose fixed and take-off tubes twist laterally as well as longitudinally during jounce/rebound and steering. Its two trailing links absorb the forces resulting from the jounce/rebound and keep the wheel carrier stable. Thus, any torsioning is excluded and the front <b>wheel</b> <b>suspension</b> is very precise. The steering commands of the rider are converted directly and the feedback from the front wheel is transparent in all driving conditions.A kinematical anti-dive effect is additionally achieved, just as for the Telelever, due to the arrangement of the trailing link bearings. While a conventional telefork during strong braking manoeuvres jounces heavily or locks, the Duolever still has sufficient spring travel remaining in this situation and therefore the rider can still brake into the corner extremely late yet directionally stable.|$|E
