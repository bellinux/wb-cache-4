The purpose was the theoretical and experimental investigations of energy consumption during the wide strip rolling and the development of the energy saving technology for the sheet producing on this base. The possibility of the electric energy consumption economy at the expence of more complete proceeding of softening processes in the finishing stand of the hot <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> and minimization the force power consumption during the variation of applied stress level were revealed theoreticaly. The evaluation of energy consumption for the rolling with reduction and metal consumption during the edge cutting at the maximum possible decrease of a slab wide with use of edging rolls was made. The algorithm of automatic calculation and norm of energy consumption of the given section of mill were developed.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War {{there was}} an {{increase}} in demand for steel products such as sheet, plate and strip due to improved living standards. As products became relatively cheap the demand grew for such items as refrigerators, canned foods and cars. SPT had a <b>Strip</b> <b>Mill,</b> which could satisfy some of this demand. It had been producing strip to a maximum width of 230mm since 1921, however the limitation in the maximum width and site restrictions prevented extension, enlargement or modernisation of the plant. A new mill was required which would cater for the increased demand, and to this end market research was carried out to determine the size and potential of the market. When the technical and commercial research was concluded, it was decided to build a continuous Hot <b>Strip</b> <b>Mill</b> rolling mild, carbon and special steels up to 457mm. This new mill filled the gap between the narrow and <b>wide</b> <b>strip</b> <b>mills</b> operating at that time.So in July 1955 it was announced that Brinsworth Hot <b>Strip</b> <b>Mill</b> would be built on Sheffield Road opposite Templeborough Melting Shop at a cost of £3.6 m. In less than two years it was built and the first slabs rolled on 10 June 1957, quite an achievement. Full capacity was expected to be 8000 tonnes per week and in 1956 there were new orders for two to three years. These orders were mainly for the motorcar, bicycle, tube and stamping industries and nearly all of them for the home market.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this article, {{a robust}} hot <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> {{steering}} control is proposed {{in order to}} guarantee the system stability and to improve its performances. The rolling process consists in crushing a metal strip between some rolls for obtaining a product with constant and desired thickness. The quality of the rolled products {{and the safety of}} the production process are linked to the lateral movement of the strip in the line. Then, the main task of the steering control consists in reducing this displacement. A hot <b>strip</b> <b>mill</b> treats products with very different characteristics. Then, the products are divided into several families, with reference to their physical characteristics, and the stabilisation problem is formulated as a convex problem. Finally, for each family, a different robust controller is designed.
