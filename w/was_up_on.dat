2500|$|The {{incident}} of the Golden Calf {{as it is}} narrated in the Qur'an paints Aaron in a positive light. The Qur'an says that Aaron was entrusted the leadership of Israel while Moses <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Tur Sina’ ( [...] , Mount Sinai) {{for a period of}} forty days (Qur'an 7: 142). It adds that Aaron tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf, which was built not by Aaron but by a wicked {{man by the name of}} 'As-Samiri' (Qur'an 19: 50). When Moses returned from Mount Sinai, he rebuked Aaron for allowing the worship of the idol, to which Aaron pleaded with Moses to not blame him when he had no role in its construction (Qur'an 7: 150). The Qur'an then adds that Moses here lamented the sins of Israel, and said that he only had power over himself and Aaron (Qur'an 5: 25).|$|E

2500|$|In early 2000, Radiohead {{toured the}} Mediterranean, {{performing}} Kid A and Amnesiac songs {{for the first}} time.

Colin Greenwood said: [...] "We played in Barcelona {{and the next day}} the entire performance <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Napster. Three weeks later when we got to play in Israel the audience knew the words to all the new songs and it was wonderful." [...] Kid A was leaked online and shared via Napster three weeks before release. Asked whether he believed Napster had damaged sales, Capitol president Ray Lott likened the situation to unfounded concern about home taping in the 1980s and said: [...] "I'm trying to sell as many Radiohead albums as possible.

[...] Jim Henson and Frank Oz performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by Jerry Juhl shooting off a fire extinguisher. It {{should be noted that}} as the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them, Jerry Juhl suddenly realized that he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the [...] "Java" [...] music through the speakers in the elevator so he knew exactly how much time he had left until it was too late.
