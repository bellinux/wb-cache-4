[...] Of the figure [...] "the reaper" [...] Van Gogh expressed his symbolic, spiritual view of those who worked close to nature {{in a letter to}} his sister in 1889: [...] "aren’t we, who live on bread, to a considerable extent like wheat, at least aren't <b>we</b> <b>forced</b> to submit to growing like a plant without the power to move, by which I mean in whatever way our imagination impels us, and to being reaped when we are ripe, like the same wheat?" ...|$|E

In December 2011, Gingrich termed the courts [...] "grotesquely dictatorial {{and far too}} powerful" [...] and said that as president, he would abolish whole courts whose decisions he disagrees with, asking [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>forced</b> for a lifetime to keep someone on the bench who is so radically anti-American {{that they are a}} threat to the fabric of the country?"

2500|$|The {{most notable}} example {{is that of}} the top Chinese {{scientist}} Qian Xuesen. Allegations were made that he was a communist, and his security clearance was revoked in June 1950. The Federal Bureau of Investigation located an American Communist Party document from 1938 with his name on it, and used it as justification for the revocation. Without clearance, Qian found himself unable to pursue his career, and within two weeks announced plans to return to mainland China, which had come under the government of Communist leader Mao Zedong. The Undersecretary of the Navy at the time, Dan A. Kimball, tried to keep Qian in the U.S., commenting: [...] "It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and <b>we</b> <b>forced</b> him to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision now whether you're going to pick us up or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact <b>we</b> <b>forced</b> them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E
