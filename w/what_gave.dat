5|$|Every five years, two censors {{were elected}} for an eighteen-month term. Since the {{censorship}} {{was the most}} prestigious of all offices, usually only former consuls were elected to it. Censors were elected by the assembly of Roman Soldiers, the Centuriate Assembly, usually after the new consuls and praetors for the year began their term. After the censors had been elected, the Centuriate Assembly granted the new censors censorial power. Censors did not have imperium powers, {{and they were not}} accompanied by any lictors. In addition, they did not have the power to convene the Roman Senate or Roman assemblies. Technically they outranked all other ordinary magistrates (including consuls and praetors). This ranking, however, was solely a result of their prestige, rather than any real power they had. Since the office could be easily abused (as a result of its power over every ordinary citizen), only former consuls (usually patrician consuls) were elected to the office. This is <b>what</b> <b>gave</b> the office its prestige. Their actions could not be vetoed by any magistrate other than a plebeian tribune, or a fellow censor. No other ordinary magistrate could veto a censor because no ordinary magistrate technically outranked a censor. Tribunes, by virtue of their sacrosanctity as the representatives of the people, could veto anything or anyone. Censors usually did not have to act in unison, but if a censor wanted to reduce the status of a citizen in a census, he had to act in unison with his colleague.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, the superb fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected {{with the rest of the}} continent via a land bridge. <b>What</b> <b>gave</b> rise to subspecies cyaneus became isolated as the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania but more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E

Bertram co-ruled with his elder brother, taking turns of 6 – 8 months {{in charge of the}} country each year. By 1939 Bertram's son Anthony had taken the reins of government, and it was with considerable controversy that Vyner attempted to cede Sarawak to Britain secretly in 1946 in <b>what</b> <b>gave</b> rise to the anti-cession movement of Sarawak.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} said that the male (usually {{significantly}} smaller than the female, down to 1% of her size as seen in Tidarren sisyphoides) {{is likely to be}} killed by the female after the coupling, or sometimes even before intercourse has been initiated. This supposed propensity is <b>what</b> <b>gave</b> the black widow spider, Latrodectus mactans, its name. However, the three species of North American black widows do not usually kill the male (although they have been known to do so). Males can sometimes even live in the web of a female for a while without being harmed in any way. The male Australian redback spider Latrodectus hasselti is killed by the female after he inserts his second palpus in the female genital opening; in over 60% of cases the female then eats the male.|$|E
25|$|Many {{high-profile}} actors {{refused to}} join SAG initially. This changed when the producers {{made an agreement}} amongst themselves not to bid competitively for talent. A pivotal meeting, {{at the home of}} Frank Morgan (Ralph's brother, who played the title role in The Wizard of Oz), was <b>what</b> <b>gave</b> SAG its critical mass. Prompted by Eddie Cantor's insistence, at that meeting, that any response to that producer's agreement help all actors, not just the already established ones, it took only three weeks for SAG membership to go from around 80 members to more than 4,000. Cantor's participation was critical, particularly because of his friendship with the recently elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After several years and the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, the producers agreed to negotiate with SAG in 1937.|$|E

500|$|Leonard {{was working}} with Michael Jackson, on some transcriptions for his Bad album, when Penn called {{him to come to}} Foley's home. There he asked Leonard who would sing the track, since it was written from a man's perspective. Leonard, {{although}} he had initially envisioned a male voice interpreting the song, decided to use Madonna as the main vocalist and used the demo version as the main vocal with backup drums only. He later recalled that [...] "it was so innocent and so shy. It's as naive, as raw, as [...] raw can be and that's part of <b>what</b> <b>gave</b> it all its charm." [...] In a 1986 interview, Madonna said that the mood on the song was inspired by a different facet of her image makeover and her desire to focus on something different.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{very tense}} climate in 19181920, a time of decision. It was decided that a {{plebiscite}} would be held in Cieszyn Silesia asking people which country the territory should join. Plebiscite commissioners arrived {{at the end of}} January 1920 and after analyzing the situation {{declared a state of emergency}} in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the territory remained very tense. Mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings, and even killings affected the area. A plebiscite could not be held in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision. Eventually 58.1% of the area of Cieszyn Silesia and 67.9% of the population was incorporated into Czechoslovakia on 28 July 1920 by a decision of the Spa Conference.

500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do {{at the beginning of the}} game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in that you do not know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is <b>what</b> <b>gave</b> Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E

500|$|Despite Little's prowess in combat, as an aviator he was {{ordinary}} at best, enduring {{a number}} of crash-landings. <b>What</b> <b>gave</b> him his edge as a fighter pilot was his keen eye, excellent marksmanship, and willingness to single-handedly take on entire enemy formations and close in on his prey—down to twenty-five yards on occasion—before opening fire. Fellow No.8 Squadron member Reggie Soar recalled, [...] "Although not a polished pilot, {{he was one of}} the most aggressive... an outstanding shot with both revolver and rifle...", while ace Robert Comptson described Little as [...] "not so much a leader as a brilliant lone hand... Small in stature, with face set grimly, he seemed the epitome of deadliness". His squadron nicknamed him [...] "Rikki", after the mongoose [...] "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi", which outstrikes cobras in the story of the same name by Rudyard Kipling.

However, their father is not a typical hunter: he hunts supernatural creatures like ghosts, vampires, and spirits, and has trained his sons to do the same. Along the way, Sam and Dean save innocent people, fight creatures and ghosts, and collect clues to their father's whereabouts. Sam begins to mysteriously develop psychic abilities and visions as they travel. They also find another man with abilities similar to Sam's, whose mother died the same way.
