5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperature,</b> or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
25|$|A {{sustained}} <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> exceeding 35°C {{is likely}} to be fatal even to fit and healthy people unclothed in the shade next to a fan; at this temperature, environmental heat gain instead of loss occurs. , wet-bulb temperatures only very rarely exceeded 30°C anywhere, although significant global warming may change this.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in a reservoir of clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperature</b> 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E
40|$|This study {{tries to}} analyze the theory of {{measuring}} humidity based on dry-bulb and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperatures.</b> And a theoretical formula is deduced for the calculation of relative humidity from dry-bulb and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Through analysis of the theoretical formula, a two-dimensional conversion table is produced to transform dry-bulb and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperatures</b> into relative humidity. A method is proposed to obtain humidity by combining searching table and linear smoothing algorithm, which is suitable for rapid control.

Coincident design temperatures currently defined by ASHRAE and CIBSE may not fully allow engineers to design an HVAC system that can match a risk level desired for the problem at hand. A rational method is therefore presented in this paper for the proper selection of coincident climate design conditions, which is based on the theory of probability. An average statistic risk level has been proved to be approximately equal to the annual percentile of coincident dry- and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperatures</b> for HVAC systems whose thermal time constant is less than 1 h.

25|$|In a {{wet cooling}} tower (or open circuit cooling tower), the warm water can be cooled to a {{temperature}} lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, if the air is relatively dry (see dew point and psychrometrics). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, {{a small portion of}} the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately 970 BTU of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 MJ/kg). Evaporation results in saturated air conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperature,</b> which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.|$|E
2500|$|When ambient {{temperature}} is excessive, humans and many animals cool themselves below ambient by evaporative cooling of sweat (or other aqueous liquid; saliva in dogs, for example); this helps prevent potentially fatal hyperthermia. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling depends upon humidity. <b>Wet-bulb</b> <b>temperature,</b> which takes humidity into account, or more complex calculated quantities such as wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which also takes solar radiation into account, give useful indications {{of the degree}} of heat stress and are used by several agencies as the basis for heat-stress prevention guidelines.

40|$|Abstract: Mean annual surface {{temperatures}} were determined using a ten year surface maximum and minimum temperatures for twenty eight locations in Nigeria.

Two of the aforementioned read off parameters: <b>wet-bulb</b> potential <b>temperature</b> and equivalent potential temperature were then used to estimate precipitable water values respectively while one of the parameters, mixing ratio was used to calculate for precipitable water. With reference to calculated precipitable water, the impact of <b>wet-bulb</b> potential <b>temperature</b> and equivalent potential temperature on precipitable water was compared.

40|$|The {{selection}} of design solar irradiance {{in the current}} ASHRAE and CIBSE design handbooks is independent on design dry-bulb and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The probability that the load would not exceed the system capacity determined on this basis may not match the reliability level that the design weather data were meant to safeguard. Hence, a statistic method was developed for the rational {{selection of}} coincident solar irradiance, dry-bulb and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The new method combines, {{based on the principle}} of heat transfer, the three weather parameters and building characteristics into a single impact factor, which may be called as equivalent temperature. This ensures that the joint probability of occurrence of the three coincident weather parameters can match the capacity reliability level of air-conditioning systems, which may be required by building owners. The method was applied to historic weather records of 25 years in Hong Kong to generate coincident design weather data. These new design weather data were compared with those design weather data produced by the traditional method. Results show that traditional design solar irradiance, dry-bulb and <b>wet-bulb</b> <b>temperatures</b> may be significantly overestimated in many conditions. Moreover, the new method allows HVAC engineers to determine the peak cooling load directly without the need for calculating 24 h cooling loads on one design day for every month of the year. This greatly simplifies the design cooling load calculation. Although the new design weather data are only for buildings whose thermal lag is less than 1 h, the method provides a basis for further generating design weather data for buildings with a large thermal lag.
