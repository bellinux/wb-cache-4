25|$|Steam power – The {{improved}} {{steam engine}} invented by James Watt and patented in 1775 was initially mainly used for pumping out mines, {{but from the}} 1780s was applied to power machines. This enabled rapid development of efficient semi-automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale in places where <b>waterpower</b> was not available.|$|E
25|$|Today, the {{original}} house built by Robert Harper {{is the oldest}} remaining structure in {{the lower part of}} the park. Though it is believed that George Washington visited the area earlier, his trip to the rivers' confluence in 1785, searching for a waterway to ship goods westward, is his earliest mention of the area. Later, Washington began the construction of the federal Harpers Ferry Armory on the site, utilizing <b>waterpower</b> from the rivers for manufacturing purposes.|$|E

5000|$|For many centuries, it {{has been}} a centre for the {{metalworking}} industry, especially with many factories for hand tools. The <b>waterpowered</b> Manuelskotten is still in use as a museum for industrial history.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture and lumbering {{were the}} main occupations with several <b>waterpowered</b> sawmills once {{operating}} in the area. In the mid twentieth century, a small hydro electric plant operated in the river gorge. The community once boasted its own school, (closed 1969), a Presbyterian church, a United church and a general store. Of these, only the United Church remains open.|$|R
25|$|The Blackstone River Valley {{was a major}} {{contributor}} to the American Industrial Revolution. It was in Pawtucket that Samuel Slater set up Slater Mill in 1793, using the <b>waterpower</b> of the Blackstone River to power his cotton mill. For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in textiles. However, with the Great Depression, most textile factories relocated to southern US states. The textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy but does not have the same power that it once had.|$|E
25|$|Challenges to {{the system}} began {{to emerge in the}} 1950s: the {{accessible}} <b>waterpower</b> sites were exploited; and the province's electricity distribution system was limited in capacity. To address these problems, the HEC began constructing new coal-fired electricity generation plants near major sources of electricity demand and launched plans to build nuclear power plants across the province of Ontario. Between the early 1970s and early 1990s twenty CANDU power reactors were brought into service at the Pickering (8 reactors), Bruce (8 reactors) and Darlington (4 reactors) nuclear generating facilities.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, Massachusetts {{became a}} {{national}} leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing precision manufacturing tools and paper. The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of <b>waterpower</b> and later the steam engine to power factories, and canals and later railroads for transporting goods and materials. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon Catholic immigrants from Ireland and Canada.|$|E
50|$|The Columbus Historic Riverfront Industrial District {{encompasses}} one of {{the most}} significant assemblages of 19th-century <b>waterpowered</b> mill technology in the American South. A National Historic Landmark District, it includes five historic industrial complexes with elements surviving as far back as the 1830s, located in four separate areas along the eastern bank of the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978.|$|R
50|$|The two {{communities}} of Minneapolis and St. Anthony shared {{the resources of}} the Falls. Both towns grew quickly and developed a number of industries at the falls. The earliest <b>waterpowered</b> facilities were sawmills; flour mills soon followed. For many years river crossing between the communities was via a rope-drawn ferry, by foot when the river surface was frozen, or on floating log booms that often filled the channel.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the region into an urbanized industrial area started in the late 18th century with the early industrialisation in the nearby Wupper Valley in the Bergisches Land. By around 1820, hundreds of water-powered mills were producing textiles, lumber, shingles and iron in automated processes here. And in even more workshops in the hills, highly skilled workers manufactured knives, tools, weapons and harnesses, using water, coal and charcoal. History has no established name for {{this phase of the}} industrial revolution, but one could call it the early <b>waterpowered</b> industrial revolution.|$|R
25|$|The {{manufacture}} of woollen cloth was well established {{here by the}} time of Queen Elizabeth I. It expanded rapidly after the late 18thcentury. The first textile mill was built at Dogley in about 1787 and used <b>waterpower</b> to prepare wool for spinning and for fulling the finished cloth. In about 1800 another mill opened at Linfit, which used steam power. Both mills gradually took on other processes and developed into substantial businesses under the Kenyon and Hey families. By 1880 there were eight mills at work in the township.|$|E
25|$|Engineers in the Abbasid {{caliphate}} made {{a number}} of innovative industrial uses of hydropower, and early industrial uses of tidal power, wind power, and petroleum (notably by distillation into kerosene). The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. By the time of the Crusades, every province throughout the Islamic world had mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. These mills performed a variety of agricultural and industrial tasks. Abbasid engineers also developed machines (such as pumps) incorporating crankshafts, employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and used dams to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Such advances made it possible for many industrial tasks that were previously driven by manual labour in ancient times to be mechanized and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. It has been argued that the industrial use of <b>waterpower</b> had spread from Islamic to Christian Spain, where fulling mills, paper mills, and forge mills were recorded {{for the first time in}} Catalonia.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1837, {{a visitor to}} the Everglades {{suggested}} {{the value of the}} land without the water:Could it be drained by deepening the natural outlets? Would it not open to cultivation immense tracts of rich vegetable soil? Could the <b>waterpower,</b> obtained by draining, be improved to any useful purpose? Would such draining render the country unhealthy?... Many queries like these passed through our minds. They can only be solved by a thorough examination of the whole country. Could the waters be lowered ten feet, it would probably drain six hundred thousand acres; should this prove to be a rich soil, as would seem probable, what a field it would open for tropical productions! What facilities for commerce! ...|$|E
50|$|The natural outlet of Portage Lake {{was located}} {{about a mile}} north of the present-man made outlet. This stream ran northwesterly from the Portage Lake side (close to and {{crossing}} the section lines between sections 21 and 28) the present-day intersection of Ridge Avenue and Portage Point Drive, north along Norwood Avenue to cross Lakeisle Avenue and then to pass into Lake Michigan {{just north of the}} intersection of Lakeisle and Lakeside Avenue are located, almost exactly on the section line separating sections 28 and 33. It was recognized very early as an excellent site for a <b>waterpowered</b> saw mill.|$|R
50|$|In 1704, Thomas Cotchett {{set up a}} <b>waterpowered</b> silk {{throwing}} mill {{to produce}} organizine in Derby. It failed due {{to the use of}} the wrong type of machinery. In 1717, John Lombe, visited Piedmont and returned to England with details of the Italian machines, and some Italian craftsmen. He was granted a fourteen-year patent, and built Lombe's Mill in Derby. The King of Sardinia retaliated by prohibiting the export of raw silk. Nevertheless, in 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a silk throwing enterprise at Logwood mill in Stockport, and in 1744, The Button Mill was erected in Macclesfield and in 1753 Old Mill was built in Congleton. These three towns remained the centre of the English Silk Throwing Industry.|$|R
50|$|The city of Columbus {{is located}} at the fall line of the Chattahoochee River, a place where the river drops 125 ft in a stretch of 2.5 mi. This locationt was {{recognized}} early in the American Industrial Revolution as a prime location for <b>waterpowered</b> factories, and the river was first dammed in 1828 (by a predecessor to the now-breached City Mills Dam), beginning what became one of the South's largest 19th-century industrial complexes. Embedded in five major industrial sites are the remains of industrial components used in the transfer of water power, and for the early generation and transfer of electrical power. Included in these are the Eagle and Phenix Mills, once the South's largest textile operation. Columbus was a powerhouse of manufacturing for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.|$|R
500|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819, at {{the confluence of the}} Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, and soldiers began using the falls for <b>waterpower.</b> When land became available for settlement, two towns were founded {{on either side of the}} falls: Saint Anthony, on the east side, and Minneapolis, on the west side. The two towns later merged into one city in 1872. Early development focused on sawmills, but flour mills eventually became the dominant industry. This industrial development fueled the development of railroads and banks, as well as the foundation of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. Through innovations in milling techniques, Minneapolis became a world-leading center of flour production, earning the name [...] "Mill City". As the city grew, the culture developed through its churches, arts institutions, the University of Minnesota, and a famous park system designed by Theodore Wirth.|$|E
500|$|One {{means by}} which certain {{technological}} advances were transmitted within Europe {{was a result of}} the General Chapter of the Cistercian monks. This may have included the blast furnace, as the Cistercians are known to have been skilled metallurgists. According to Jean Gimpel, their high level of industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques: [...] "Every monastery had a model factory, often as large as the church and only several feet away, and <b>waterpower</b> drove the machinery of the various industries located on its floor." [...] Iron ore deposits were often donated to the monks along with forges to extract the iron, and within time surpluses were being offered for sale. The Cistercians became the leading iron producers in Champagne, France, from the mid-13th century to the 17th century, also using the phosphate-rich slag from their furnaces as an agricultural fertilizer.|$|E
500|$|Minneapolis {{developed}} around Saint Anthony Falls, {{the highest}} waterfall on the Mississippi River {{and a source}} of power for its early industry. Forests in northern Minnesota were a valuable resource for the lumber industry, which operated seventeen sawmills on power from the waterfall. By 1871, the west river bank had twenty-three businesses, including flour mills, woolen mills, iron works, a railroad machine shop, and mills for cotton, paper, sashes, and planing wood. Due to the occupational hazards of milling, six local sources of artificial limbs were competing in the prosthetics business by the 1890s. The farmers of the Great Plains grew grain that was shipped by rail to the city's thirty-four flour mills. Millers have used hydropower elsewhere since the 1st century B.C., but the results in Minneapolis between 1880 and 1930 were so remarkable the city has been described as [...] "the greatest direct-drive <b>waterpower</b> center the world has ever seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The early dams {{built to}} harness the <b>waterpower</b> exposed the {{limestone}} to freezing and thawing forces, narrowed the channel, and increased the damage from floods. [...] A report in 1868 found that only eleven hundred feet of the limestone remained upstream, {{and if it were}} eroded away, the falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer be useful for <b>waterpower.</b> [...] Meanwhile, the St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company approved a plan for the firm of William W. Eastman and John L. Merriam to build a tunnel under Hennepin and Nicollet Islands that would share the <b>waterpower.</b> [...] This plan was met with disaster on October 5, 1869, when the limestone cap was breached.|$|E
2500|$|Until the Industrial Revolution, {{most of the}} {{technological}} advances in Europe {{were made in the}} monasteries. [...] According to the medievalist Jean Gimpel, their high level of industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques: [...] "Every monastery had a model factory, often as large as the church and only several feet away, and <b>waterpower</b> drove the machinery of the various industries located on its floor." [...] <b>Waterpower</b> was used for crushing wheat, sieving flour, fulling cloth and tanning [...] a [...] "level of technological achievement [...] could have been observed in practically all" [...] of the Cistercian monasteries. [...] The English science historian James Burke examines the impact of Cistercian <b>waterpower,</b> derived from Roman watermill technology such as that of Barbegal aqueduct and mill near Arles in the fourth of his ten-series Connections (TV series), called [...] "Faith in Numbers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Timber, <b>waterpower,</b> {{mineral deposit}} and {{wilderness}} are four major natural resources of Lishui prefecture that rank first in Zhejiang province. 69% of the prefecture {{is covered with}} forest, which gives it the name [...] "Foliage Ocean of Zhejiang". The prefecture boasts potential <b>waterpower</b> of about 2 gigawatts. So far, 57 mineral reserves are proved to scatter the prefecture and 460 mines are available for exploitation. Among its most important minerals, are gold, silver, lead, zinc, molybdenum, fluorite, pearlstone, pyrophyllite, dolianite, kaoline and mineral water, whose reserves claim an important place in Zhejiang, even in China.|$|E

2500|$|Prussian mercantilist {{policies}} supported manufacturing {{enterprises and}} Berlin had numerous small workshops. Lacking <b>waterpower,</b> Berlin entrepreneurs were early pioneers {{in the use}} of steam engines after 1815.

2500|$|The Bosson Mill, {{built around}} the time of the Civil War, was one of the first major mills to use the <b>waterpower</b> of the Great Falls Gorge. [...] Water from the falls was used to power a grist mill on the mill's first floor and a carding factory on the second floor. [...] Water was then {{diverted}} via flume to a sawmill downstream. [...] The Bosson Mill, which was moderately profitable, was destroyed when the Caney Fork flooded in 1882.|$|E
2500|$|The Duck River system spills over a limestone-rich {{shelf of}} the western Cumberland Plateau known as the Highland Rim. [...] As the Duck and Little Duck {{approach}} their convergence, they rapidly drop in elevation, and have cut relatively deep gorges around the peninsula upon which the ancient structure is located. [...] Both gorges are highlighted {{by a series of}} substantial waterfalls and whitewater rapids. [...] The natural <b>waterpower</b> in these two gorges attracted entrepreneurs and millwrights throughout the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{time the}} Oatka was called Allan's Creek after the area's first settler, Ebenezer [...] "Indian" [...] Allan. Its <b>waterpower</b> {{facilitated}} early 19th-century European settlement of the abundant fertile lands in the Holland Purchase. Today it remains an important regional resource, used for water supply and recreational purposes, and actively protected to assure water quality. It is a popular trout stream, stocked from the oldest fish hatchery in the Western Hemisphere near its mouth. A dam in Le Roy makes the section below it a losing stream, dry during the warm {{months of the year}} as the stream flows through subterranean channels.|$|E
2500|$|Hennepin Island {{was named}} after explorer, Catholic priest, and Franciscan missionary Louis Hennepin (May 12, 1626– [...] ). In 1865, {{entrepreneurs}} William W. Eastman and John L. Merriam had bought its sister island, Nicollet Island, {{with the idea of}} creating a tunnel from Nicollet Island under St. Anthony Falls to provide for-profit spillway services to the many milling and lumber business located upstream of St. Anthony Falls. The tunnel was {{to be part of a}} system of waterworks that supported the industries driving Minneapolis' growth. The project was designed to create more industry on Nicollet Island through the <b>waterpower.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hydropower {{policy in}} the United States {{includes}} all the laws, rules, regulations, programs and agencies that govern the national hydroelectric industry. Federal policy concerning <b>waterpower</b> developed over considerable time {{before the advent of}} electricity, and at times, has changed considerably, as water uses, available scientific technologies and considerations developed to the present day; over this period the priority of different, pre-existing and competing uses for water, flowing water and its energy, {{as well as for the}} water itself and competing available sources of energy have changed. [...] Increased population and commercial demands spurred this developmental growth and many of the changes since, and these affect the technology's use today.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Francis Cabot Lowell {{and his friends}} and colleagues {{established}} in Waltham, Massachusetts, the Boston Manufacturing Company—the first integrated textile mill in the United States. [...] After Lowell's death in 1817, his partners searched for a new location with greater <b>waterpower</b> to expand textile production and add calico printing to their capabilities. In 1821 they purchased property adjoining the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack River, an area also served by the Middlesex Canal. In 1823 the Merrimack Manufacturing Company began producing cotton cloth in the [...] "Middlesex Village" [...] hamlet in East Chelmsford. In 1826, the area was incorporated as the town of Lowell, Massachusetts, {{named in honor of}} Francis Cabot Lowell.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton mills have abounded in the Spartanburg {{area since}} 1816, earning Spartanburg the {{reputation}} as the [...] "Lowell of the South." [...] Although there were few mills in the area before the Civil War, technological advances, northern capital, and out-migration from the poor farms that made white labor available, created a wave of postbellum mill development here and {{in much of the}} Piedmont South. Additionally, the abundant streams and rivers in the area are just beginning their descent towards the lower-lying Midlands region. In many places, these waterways descend abruptly, providing a source for plentiful <b>waterpower.</b> Cotton mills were built along these rivers to harness this power, and so began the region’s servitude to King Cotton. These mills, their owners and their laborers dominated the politics and economy of the region for nearly a century. Although nearly all abandoned, many mills remain along the riverbanks, the Piedmont equivalent of Gothic ruins.|$|E
2500|$|As Minneapolis (and {{its former}} {{neighbor}} across the river, St. Anthony) developed, the water {{power at the}} falls became a source of power for several industries. [...] Water power was used by sawmills, textile mills, and flour mills. Millers on the Minneapolis side formed a consortium to extract power by diverting upper-level water into waterwheel-equipped vertical shafts (driven through the limestone bedrock into the soft, underlying sandstone) and then through horizontal tunnels to the falls' lower level. These shafts and tunnels weakened the limestone and its sandstone foundation, accelerating the falls' upriver erosion to [...] per year between 1857 and 1868. The falls quickly approached {{the edge of their}} limestone cap; once the limestone had completely eroded away, the falls would degenerate into sandstone rapids unsuitable for <b>waterpower.</b> The mills on the St. Anthony (east) side of the river were less-well organized harnessing the power, and therefore industry developed at a slower pace on that side.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1920s, the New England textile {{industry}} began to shift South {{and many of}} Lowell's textile mills began to move or close. Although the South did not have rivers capable of providing the <b>waterpower</b> needed to run the early mills, the advent of steam-powered factories allowed companies {{to take advantage of}} the cheaper labor and transportation costs available there. Labor strikes in the North became more frequent, and severe ones like the 1912 Bread and Roses Strike in neighboring Lawrence were driving up costs for investors. Many textile companies changed to a policy of disinvestment, running the mills with no capital improvements until they were no longer capable of producing profit that could be used to build or improve new factories elsewhere. In 1916, the Bigelow Carpet Company, which had previously purchased the Lowell Manufacturing Company, left Lowell. This was the first of the major corporations to move operations to the South or go bankrupt. World War I briefly improved the situation, but from 1926 to 1929, most of the rest of the companies, including the Lowell Machine Shop (which had become the Saco-Lowell Shops) left the city: [...] The Great Depression had come to Lowell early. In 1930, Lowell's population was slightly over 100,000, down from a high of 112,000 a decade earlier. The {{textile industry}} employed 8,000 in 1936, it had been 17,000 in 1900. By the onset of World War II, 40% of the city's population was on relief. World War II again briefly helped the economy, since not only did demand for clothing go up, but Lowell was involved in munitions manufacturing. [...] After the war, things cooled again. In 1956, the Boott Mills closed, and after over 130 years, the Merrimack Manufacturing Company closed in 1958.|$|E
