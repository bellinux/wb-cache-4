5|$|The Order of St Patrick earned {{international}} coverage when, in 1907, its insignia, known generally as the Irish Crown Jewels, <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> {{from the}} Bedford Tower in Dublin Castle shortly before {{a visit by}} the Order's Sovereign, King Edward VII. Their whereabouts remain a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Baldur's Gate II {{is set in}} {{the year}} 1369 DR (Dale Reckoning), and thus takes place not long after the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), when the Tablets of Fate, {{powerful}} magic items which maintain a balance between good and evil, <b>were</b> <b>stolen.</b> Lord Ao, the Overdeity, forced the gods to become mortal until the Tablets were found; some gods died while in this mortal state.|$|E
5|$|Dunster Doll Museum {{houses a}} {{collection}} of more than 800 dolls from around the world, based on the collection of the late Mollie Hardwick, who died in 1970 and donated her collection to the village memorial hall committee. Established in 1971, the collection includes a display of British and foreign dolls in various costumes. Thirty-two of the dolls <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> during a burglary in 1992 and have never been recovered.|$|E

50|$|Receiving stolen {{property}} {{and possession of}} <b>stolen</b> property <b>are</b> treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that the property <b>was</b> <b>stolen.</b> If the person knew that the property <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> {{at the time he}} received it, the crime <b>is</b> receiving <b>stolen</b> property. If the person did not know the property <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> at the time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime <b>is</b> possession of <b>stolen</b> property.|$|R
5000|$|Stradivarius {{instruments}} {{are at risk}} of theft. <b>Stolen</b> instruments <b>are</b> often recovered, however, even after being missing for many years. They are difficult to sell illicitly as dealers will typically call the police if approached by a seller with a Stradivarius known to have <b>been</b> <b>stolen.</b> In recent years, the General Kyd Stradivarius <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> in 2004. It was returned three weeks later by a woman who 'found it' and handed it over to the police. [...] The Sinsheimer/Iselin <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> in Hanover, Germany in 2008 and recovered in 2009. the Lipinski Stradivarius <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> in an armed robbery on 27 January 2014 and subsequently recovered. The Ames Stradivarius <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> in 1981 and recovered in 2015.|$|R
5|$|In 1999 the Lebanese {{government}} {{started a}} massive campaign to recover antiquities that <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> or traded {{during the civil}} war. Many artifacts were recovered from warehouses or private homes since Lebanese law dictates that any item more than 300 years old belongs to the state. In 2011, the ground floor restoration lab was moved and a new exhibition hall, named after prince Maurice Chehab was opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|In France in 2004, Nayyouf's {{apartment}} in Hauts-de-Seine was burglarized and secret papers documenting relations between Iraq {{and a number}} of Western and Middle Eastern governments <b>were</b> <b>stolen.</b> At the time of the burglary, Nayyouf had been meeting with an official of the Ministry of the Interior about supplying those documents to the French government, a request which he refused.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh and Nichols then robbed Moore in {{his home}} of $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewels, {{transporting}} the property in the victim's own van. McVeigh {{wrote a letter to}} Moore in which he claimed that the robbery had been committed by government agents. Items that <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> from Moore were later found in Nichols' home and in a storage shed that he had rented.|$|E
50|$|Some {{registration}} {{programs are}} exclusively designed for {{spreading the word}} after a bike has <b>been</b> <b>stolen,</b> while others focus on registering bikes before they <b>are</b> <b>stolen.</b>|$|R
50|$|Statistics in Australia {{show that}} {{three out of}} four vehicle thefts <b>are</b> older cars <b>stolen</b> for joyriding, transport, or to commit another crime. Immobilisers are fitted to around 45% of all cars in Australia, but account for only 7% of those cars that <b>are</b> <b>stolen.</b> In many {{instances}} where a vehicle fitted with an immobiliser has <b>been</b> <b>stolen,</b> the thief had access to the original key. Only around one in four <b>stolen</b> vehicles <b>are</b> <b>stolen</b> by professional thieves. The majority of vehicles <b>are</b> <b>stolen</b> by opportunistic thieves relying on finding older vehicles that have ineffective security or none at all.|$|R
50|$|Two thefts {{occurred}} at St Athan Road in 1906. In March of that year, {{four and a}} half pence <b>was</b> <b>stolen.</b> In June, the stationmaster's watch <b>was</b> <b>stolen.</b>|$|R
5|$|Potter fans waited {{three years}} between the {{releases}} of {{the fourth and fifth}} books. Before the release of the fifth book, 200million copies of the first four books had already been sold and translated into 55languages in 200countries. As the series was already a global phenomenon, the book forged new pre-order records, with thousands of people queuing outside book stores on 20 June 2003to secure their copy at midnight. Despite the security, thousands of copies <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> from an Earlestown, Merseyside warehouse on 15 June 2003.|$|E
5|$|The first horses on the American {{mainland}} {{since the}} end of the Ice Age arrived with the Spanish Conquistadors. Hernán Cortés brought 16 horses of Andalusian, Barb, and Arabian ancestry to Mexico in 1519. Others followed, such as Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, who brought 250 horses of similar breeding to America in 1540. More horses followed with each new arrival of Conquistadors, missionaries, and settlers. Many horses escaped or <b>were</b> <b>stolen,</b> becoming the foundation stock of the American Mustang.|$|E
5|$|The rare finger pillory at {{the west}} end immobilised {{offenders}} without exposing them to the public degradation associated with the stocks. In the centre aisle hangs a large brass candelabrum donated by Leonard Piddocke, High Bailiff of Leicester, in 1733. It is surmounted by a brass dove and was made by William Parsons of London. Some of the branches <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> in 1776, but soon recovered.|$|E
50|$|Theft of {{equipment}} {{was a problem}} during filming. While filming in Brighton, all the catering equipment <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> and in Notting Hill Gate, a mobile kitchen with generator <b>was</b> <b>stolen.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} shooting, a Mitsubishi Lancer arrived and the would-be robbers made their getaway in it. No money had <b>been</b> <b>stolen</b> by them, but both {{vehicles}} {{used at the}} crime scene had <b>been</b> <b>stolen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hampshire College {{students}} had a tradition regarding a Velvet Elvis which <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>stolen</b> by successive students, who would display it {{in a common}} area in their homes from where it could <b>be</b> <b>stolen</b> again.|$|R
5|$|Thutmose I was, however, not {{destined to}} lie {{alongside}} his daughter after Hatshepsut's death. Thutmose III, Hatshepsut's successor, decided to reinter his grandfather {{in an even}} more magnificent tomb, KV38, which featured another yellow sarcophagus dedicated to Thutmose I and inscribed with texts which proclaimed this pharaoh's love for his deceased grandfather. Unfortunately, however, Thutmose I's remains would be disturbed late during the 20th dynasty when KV38 was plundered; the sarcophagus' lid was broken and all this king's valuable precious jewellery and grave goods <b>were</b> <b>stolen.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the Soviet Union entered World War II in 1941, {{most of the}} museum's {{exhibits}} {{were evacuated}} for safety from Alupka. However, some 537 artistic and graphics exhibits (including temporary exhibition paintings from the State Russian Museum and the Simferopol Art Museum), 360 pieces of the building's decor, sets of unique furniture, {{and a series of}} historic books <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> by occupying Nazi German forces, amounting to a loss of 5 million rubles at the time.|$|E
5|$|A sale of 1,000 coins {{was made}} to an {{executive}} of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they {{were placed in the}} Archives of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many wound {{up in the hands of}} a coin dealer, who sold them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.|$|E
50|$|Theft is {{a felony}} if {{the value of}} the {{property}} exceeds $300 or the property <b>is</b> <b>stolen</b> from the person of another. Thresholds at $10,000, $100,000, and $500,000 determine how severe the punishment can be. The location from which property <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>is</b> also a factor in sentencing.|$|R
25|$|The 1893 version (shown here) <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> {{from the}} National Gallery in Oslo in 1994 and recovered. The 1910 {{painting}} <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> in 2004 from The Munch Museum in Oslo, but recovered in 2006 with limited damage.|$|R
50|$|On April 4, 2012 an antique, baroque {{dress of}} the Mother of God (which had even survived the Warsaw Uprising) <b>was</b> <b>stolen,</b> {{and the next}} day a {{painting}} of Our Lady of Perpetual Help <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> as well.|$|R
5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} pieces <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> at {{an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for this piece alone.|$|E
5|$|American Idiot is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Green Day. Produced by Rob Cavallo, {{the album was}} {{released}} in the UK on September 20, 2004 and in the US on September 21, 2004 by Reprise Records. Green Day first achieved popularity in the 1990s {{with a string of}} successful albums. Following disappointing sales of their sixth album, Warning (2000), the band took a break before recording their next album, titled Cigarettes and Valentines. The recording process was cut short when the album's master tapes <b>were</b> <b>stolen.</b> Rather than re-record that material, the group decided to start over.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1975, Alyeska {{terminated}} Ketchbaw's {{contract and}} took responsibility for analyzing weld X-Rays itself. The controversy continued, however, as Kelley's lawsuit moved forward, a Ketchbaw manager was found dead of cyanide poisoning, and photographs of welds <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> from a pump station construction camp. Alyeska began a review of all 30,800 welds {{that had been done}} in 1975, and submitted its report to the Interior Department in April 1976. In May, it submitted its technical analysis and a report on repair work under way. The review produced a list of 3,955 questionable welds—10 percent of 1975's work.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of March 3, staff members {{discovered}} {{that more than half}} of the double run - the editors had been warned by an administrator that the edition might <b>be</b> <b>stolen,</b> so they ordered more copies - <b>was</b> <b>stolen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A certain gift may be {{particularly}} sought after, prolonging the game (almost indefinitely). To address this, two related variations have been widely adopted: First, no gift may <b>be</b> <b>stolen</b> more than once per turn. However, this gives a distinct advantage to the final participant. Because of this, a second common variation states that after a gift has <b>been</b> <b>stolen</b> {{a certain number of}} times (usually three) it is [...] "frozen" [...] (or [...] "dead" [...] or [...] "safe") and cannot <b>be</b> <b>stolen</b> again. Another version dictates that in order to steal a gift, the stealer has to take a shot of alcohol for every time the gift has already <b>been</b> <b>stolen,</b> including the current time.|$|R
5|$|Several VCs have <b>been</b> <b>stolen</b> and, being valuable, {{have been}} placed on the Interpol watch-list for stolen items. The VC awarded to Milton Gregg, which was donated to the Royal Canadian Regiment Museum in London, Ontario Canada in 1979, <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> on Canada Day (1 July 1980), when the museum was overcrowded and has been missing since. A VC awarded in 1917 to Canadian soldier Corporal Filip Konowal <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> from the same museum in 1973 and was not {{recovered}} until 2004.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{continuing}} external threats Gibraltar was {{neglected by}} the Spanish crown and its fortifications fell into disrepair. Barbary pirates from North Africa {{took advantage of}} the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The Shrine of Our Lady of Europe was sacked and all its valuables <b>were</b> <b>stolen.</b> Many of the captives were subsequently released when a Spanish fleet commanded by Bernardino de Mendoza intercepted the pirate ships near Alborán as they were bringing ransomed hostages back to Gibraltar. The Spanish crown belatedly responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the Charles V Wall to control the southern flank of the Rock and commissioning the Italian engineer Giovanni Battista Calvi to strengthen other parts of the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing <b>were</b> <b>stolen</b> and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{when the}} Duchess {{was staying at}} Ednam Lodge, {{the home of the}} Earl of Dudley, some of her jewels <b>were</b> <b>stolen.</b> There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the Royal Collection by the Duke, or by the Windsors {{themselves}} as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at Cartier the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces were {{only a small portion of}} the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.|$|E
50|$|Huddleston {{was being}} tried for selling stolen goods and {{possessing}} stolen goods, related to two portions of {{a shipment of}} Memorex videocassettes that had <b>been</b> <b>stolen</b> from the Overnight Express yard in South Holland, Illinois. Huddleston later sold the missing videocassettes to the owner of Magic Rent-to-Own in Ypsilanti, Michigan. At the trial, he did not dispute that the cassettes had <b>been</b> <b>stolen.</b> He contested a crucial element of the charged crimes — whether {{he knew that the}} cassettes had <b>been</b> <b>stolen.</b>|$|R
