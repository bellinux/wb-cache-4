25|$|Stroopwafels {{are thin}} waffles with a syrup filling. The stiff batter for the waffles {{is made from}} flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. Medium-sized balls of batter are put on the waffle iron. When the waffle is baked {{and while it is}} still warm, it is cut into two halves. The <b>warm</b> <b>filling,</b> made from syrup is spread in between the waffle halves, which glues them together. They are popular in the Netherlands and Belgium and sold in pre-prepared {{packages}} in shops and markets.|$|E
50|$|Quilts {{are made}} by joining layers of cloth - usually a {{decorative}} top, <b>warm</b> <b>filling</b> of either raw wool or cotton, and plain backing - and sewing or “quilting” them together.

5000|$|In {{the modern}} recipe, ground pork or pork sausage is blended {{into the ground}} beef for {{additional}} flavor. Onions, bell pepper and when used garlic and parsley provide aromatics. Ground black pepper and cayenne pepper are added to get attention without being uncomfortable. Flour {{is added to the}} browned meat and vegetable mixture to dry, thicken and loosely bind the filling. The meat filling can be used in other foods (e.g., tacos, tamales, enchiladas, stuffed bell pepper et al) but the wheat turnover crust is a defining element. The traditional size is approximately 4 ounces (by weight) on a 5"-6" [...] diameter pastry dough. The filling should be made the day before to allow the flavors of the ingredients to meld. Filling, dough and tools should be chilled before assembly. <b>Warm</b> <b>filling</b> will cause the dough to disintegrate.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is {{considered}} to be aspecies of least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global <b>warming,</b> <b>filling</b> of wetlands due to urbanization and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population of the American black duck. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.|$|R

60|$|Having dressed herself, {{she entered}} the kitchen, which was <b>warm,</b> <b>filled</b> {{with the smell of}} frying meat. Streaks of grease smoke floated fantastically beneath the low ceiling, and Hannah, with the frying-pan {{in one hand and a}} fork in the other, was bending over the stove. Wisps of her scant, {{whitening}} hair escaped from the ridiculous, tightly drawn knot at the back of her head; in the light of the flickering gas-jet she looked so old and worn that a sudden pity smote Janet and made her dumb--pity for her mother, pity for herself, pity for Lise; pity that lent a staggering insight into life itself. Hannah had once been young, desirable, perhaps, swayed by those forces which had swayed her. Janet wondered why she had never guessed this before, and why she had guessed it now. But it was Hannah who, looking up and catching sight of Janet's face, was quick to divine the presage in it and gave voice to the foreboding that had weighed on her for many weeks.|$|R

2500|$|A common {{recipe for}} feeding the troops was beef broth and potatoes– a hearty, <b>warm</b> and <b>filling</b> meal that could {{normally}} feed {{up to eight}} men. Stews and meat pies were regularly cooked and small beer– for which a man received around [...] per diem– and rum were watered down in order to last and deter the men from drunken behaviour. Small beer was often brewed to kill any germs that was present in the water, and was {{one way in which}} to reduce the spread and rates of disease.

60|$|By the {{quantity}} of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! <b>Warm</b> tears <b>filled</b> my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, {{that they might not}} intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.|$|R
