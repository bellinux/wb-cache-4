5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down {{the entire length of the}} Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E
25|$|Kanhai <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{third day}} when the score had reached 124, having made 84. The {{remaining}} wickets added only another 57, though Nurse - the sheet anchor - battled away until he was ninth out for 70. His innings included only a single boundary, {{in sharp contrast to}} Kanhai's 13, and lasted for 305 minutes. Davidson finished with the fine figures of 6/53. Some rain had seeped through the covers overnight, but the pitch was not difficult enough to justify the West Indian collapse.|$|E
25|$|The race {{started with}} a bang, as Senna's hopes at a home Grand Prix victory were dashed after a clash with Berger in the first turn. In what {{would prove to be}} a regular {{occurrence}} during the season, the semi-automatic transmission in the Ferrari 640 allowed Berger to get a lightning start from 3rd on the grid and he attempted to go inside of Senna and Patrese into the turn. Patrese got through unscathed and in the lead of his record breaking 177th Grand Prix start whilst Berger <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot (the first of 10 straight retirements for the Austrian driver) while Senna was forced to pit for repairs and would finish the race 2 laps down in 11th place.|$|E

25|$|His Test {{debut at}} Lord's was disastrous, but his next two Tests won him notice. In the final Test against Australia in 1959–60 at Calcutta, {{he went in}} to bat {{towards the end of}} the first day and {{finished}} on 20 not out on the second day. He started his second innings just before stumps on the third day, batted throughout the fourth scoring only 59 runs, and <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final day for 74. This made him the first batsman to bat on all five days of a Test match. At Kanpur against Pakistan a year later, he batted through a whole day for just 54 runs. This innings, which lasted 505 minutes for 99 runs, ironically ended when he attempted a quick single to complete his hundred.|$|E
500|$|Lori Grimes accuses Andrea of {{participating}} {{very little in}} household tasks. Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; [...] "Lori is really just aggravated over {{a lot of things}} and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has {{a lot of things going}} on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road again. She's going through a lot of stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} game, Crisp reached base {{in his next}} at-bat, and {{attempted}} to steal 2nd Base once again. On this steal attempt however, Rays 2nd Baseman Akinori Iwamura was covering the bag. Unlike his previous steal attempt, Crisp slid feet first, resembling the way a runner would attempt {{to break up a}} double play by sliding into the player covering the base. Crisp <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> play. Rays manager Joe Maddon engaged in a heated argument with Crisp upon Maddon making a mound visit, Crisp being in the Red Sox dugout at that time. Joe Maddon said after the game's conclusion, [...] "I was not pleased with the slide. I totally felt there was intent to hurt our middle infielder and that's what I was upset with. There's no place for that when you intentionally try to hurt somebody." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chargers {{played the}} Daredevils {{in the first}} semi-final. The Chargers won the toss and decided to field first. The Daredevils failed to make an opening partnership. Gautam Gambhir <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 5th ball of the match with a zero run in {{scorecard}} for him and the team. And the Daredevils got a big shock when David Warner followed Gambhir in the very next ball. Daredevils were 0/2 after Over 1. But Virender Sehwag and Tillakaratne Dilshan added 85 runs in the 3rd wicket partnership. At the 85 run Sehwag was out scoring 39 from 31. After that the middle and lower middle batting order took the run to 150's. Daredevils scored 153 for 8 after 20 overs. Tillakaratne Dilshan scored the highest run for his team. He scored 65 from 51. Chargers pacer Ryan Harris was the most successful bowler with a 3/27 figure in 4 overs. After coming to bat Chargers lost their first wicket in 22 runs. But captain's 85 from 35 made the target easier and Charger reached the target in 17.4 overs with 6 wickets in hand. Adam Gilchrist was {{the man of the}} match ...|$|E

2500|$|Courtney did {{return to}} rowing, however, {{and the next}} year a rematch was {{scheduled}} at Lake Chautauqua, New York, for a $6,000 prize. To accommodate the expected crowds, a temporary grandstand was built along with a special rail line to carry spectators to the site. The morning before the race, Courtney's racing shell was sawed in half, and he declined offers of other boats. What actually happened to the boat is unknown. Some thought that Hanlan's supporters had destroyed the boat, but others suspected Courtney had done it himself to avoid another loss. Courtney claimed Hanlan <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town the night before the race and his supporters were concerned they would lose their money they wagered on him. He would also claim that Hanlan’s supporters offered Courtney the entire $6,000 prize to fix the race. Courtney was latter reported as saying in response to the offer, [...] "Gentlemen, the race will be raced tomorrow, and whoever wins it will have to row for it." [...] Courtney's backers believed that Hanlan's backers sneaked into Courtney's boathouse and destroyed his boat. Another version of events was that Courtney did not want to row unless the race would be fixed in his favor. Hanlan's friends agreed that Hanlan would lose. Hanlan and his friends did not have any intention of living up to this promise to Courtney and bet heavily on Hanlan to win. Courtney's supporters learned of the double-cross and destroyed Courtney's boat.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do you go with this? How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock {{them in a way}} that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I think we have a pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E
