40|$|We have {{performed}} {{a search for}} <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs as high proper motion objects in a second epoch WFPC 2 image of the Groth-Westphal strip. We identify 24 high proper motion objects with mu > 0. 014 ''/yr. Five of these high proper motion objects are identified as strong white dwarf candidates {{on the basis of}} their position in a reduced proper motion diagram. We create a model of the Milky Way thin disk, thick disk and stellar halo and find that this sample of white dwarfs is clearly an excess above the < 2 detections expected from these known stellar populations. The origin of the excess signal is less clear. Possibly, the excess cannot be explained without invoking a fourth galactic component: a <b>white</b> dwarf dark <b>halo.</b> We present a statistical separation of our sample into the four components and estimate the corresponding local white dwarf densities using only the directly observable variables, V, V-I, and mu. For all Galactic models explored, our sample separates into about 3 disk white dwarfs and 2 <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs. However, the further subdivision into the thin and thick disk and the stellar and dark halo, and the subsequent calculation of the local densities are sensitive to the input parameters of our model for each Galactic component. Using the lowest mean mass model for the dark halo we find a 7 % <b>white</b> dwarf <b>halo</b> and six times the canonical value for the thin disk white dwarf density (at marginal statistical significance), but possible systematic errors due to uncertainty in the model parameters likely dominate these statistical error bars. The <b>white</b> dwarf <b>halo</b> can be reduced to around 1. 5 % of the halo dark matter by changing the initial mass function slightly. The local thin disk white dwarf density in our solution can be made consistent with the canonical value by assuming a larger thin disk scaleheight of 500 pc.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the statistics of gravitational lenses in flat, low-density cosmological models with different cosmic equations of state w. We compute the lensing probabilities {{as a function}} of image separation θ using a lens population described by the mass function of Jenkins et al. and modeled as singular isothermal spheres on galactic scales and as Navarro, Frenk & <b>White</b> <b>halos</b> on cluster scales. It is found that COBE-normalized models with w > - 0. 4 produce too few arcsecond-scale lenses in comparison with the JVAS/CLASS radio survey, a result that is consistent with other observational constraints on w. The wide-separation (θ > 4 ") lensing rate is a particularly sensitive probe of both w and the halo mass concentration.

40|$|The MACHO {{collaboration}} lensing event statistics {{suggest that}} a significant fraction of the dark galactic halo can be comprised of baryonic matter {{in the form of}} white dwarf stars with masses between 0. 1 and 1. 0 M⊙. Such a <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarf population, in order to have escaped detection by those who observe the white dwarf luminosity function of the disk, must have formed from an old population. The observations indicate that the number of <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs per cubic parsec per unit bolometric magnitude is less than 10 − 5 at 10 − 4. 5 L⊙; the number must rise significantly at lower luminosities to provide the needed baryonic <b>halo</b> mass. Such <b>white</b> dwarfs may easily escape detection in most current and earlier surveys. Though it is limited in angular extent, the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) probes a sufficient volume of the galactic halo to provide interesting limits on the number of <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarf stars, and on the fraction of the halo mass that they can make up. If the HDF field can be probed for stars down to V = 29. 8 then the MACHO result suggests that there could be up to 12 faint <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs visible in the HDF.

40|$|Galactic double white dwarfs were {{postulated}} as {{a source}} of confusion limited noise for LISA, the future space-based gravitational wave observatory. Until very recently, the Galactic population consisted of a relatively well studied disk population, a somewhat studied smaller bulge population and a mostly unknown, but potentially large halo population. It has been argued that the halo population may produce a signal that is much stronger (factor of ~ 5 in spectral amplitude) than the disk population. However, this surprising result was not based on an actual calculation of a <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarf population but was derived on (i) the assumption that one can extrapolate the halo population properties from those of the disk population and (ii) the postulated (unrealistically) high number of white dwarfs in the halo. We perform the first calculation of a <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarf population using population synthesis models. Our comparison with the signal arising from double white dwarfs in the Galactic disk+bulge clearly shows that it is impossible for the double <b>white</b> dwarf <b>halo</b> signal to exceed that {{of the rest of the}} Galaxy. Using microlensing results to give an upper limit on the content of white dwarfs in the halo (~ 30 % baryonic mass in white dwarfs), our predicted halo signal is a factor of 10 lower than the disk+bulge signal. Even in the implausible case where all of the baryonic halo mass is found in <b>white</b> dwarfs, the <b>halo</b> signal does not become comparable to that of the disk+bulge, and thus would still have a negligible effect on the detection of other LISA sources.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of three nearby old <b>halo</b> <b>white</b> dwarf candidates in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including two stars in a common proper motion binary system. These candidates are selected from our 2800 square degree proper motion survey on the Bok and U. S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station 1. 3 m telescopes, and they display proper motions of 0. 4 - 0. 5 arcsec/yr. Follow-up MMT spectroscopy and near-infrared photometry demonstrate that all three objects are hydrogen-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs with Teff = 3700 - 4100 K. For average mass white dwarfs, these temperature estimates correspond to cooling ages of 9 - 10 Gyr, distances of 70 - 80 pc, and tangential velocities of 140 - 200 km/s. Based on the UVW space velocities, we conclude that they most likely belong to the halo. Furthermore, the combined main-sequence and white dwarf cooling ages are 10 - 11 Gyr.
