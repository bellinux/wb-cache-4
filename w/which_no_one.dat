5|$|The defeat {{convinced}} Manuel II {{to escape}} the city and travel to Western Europe for aid. During this time the reconciled John VII led the city's successful defence against the Ottomans. The siege was finally broken when Timur of the Chagatai Mongols led an army into Anatolia, dismantling the network of beyliks loyal to the Ottoman Sultan. At the Battle of Ankara, Timur's forces routed Bayezid I's forces, a shocking defeat for <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was prepared. In the aftermath, the Ottoman Turks began fighting each other led by Bayezid's sons.|$|E

5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|Martha bumps into Jonah, who is {{now going}} {{by the name of}} Michael. Martha tries {{to get him out of}} town, vandalises his van and {{verbally}} abuses him. She falls into a mine shaft with him and he saves her. They grow closer and later they start a relationship, <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> approves of. Martha looks after Jack while he is in a coma after he is shot. Jack reveals he still loves her, but he decides to stand by Sam. Martha realises she loves Jack as well as Michael. She and Michael leave town, but Martha returns days later to stop Jack and Sam's wedding, but she fails.|$|E
5|$|On her own Tara finds a spell to {{help the}} town get its voices back, and goes out {{to show it to}} Willow. On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E

In their last match of the season, after two draws and two losses, they played Himachal Pradesh at Maharaja Bir Bikram College Stadium in Agartala, Tripura's main home ground. Their captain, Rajib Dutta, scored 32 and 71 not out in a low-scoring match in <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else reached 50, and Tripura won by 130 runs. Vineet Jain, Tripura's opening bowler, took 2 for 20 and 7 for 29.|$|E

It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1990s, jazz {{has been}} {{characterized}} by a pluralism in <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> style dominates, but rather {{a wide range of}} active styles and genres are popular. Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes in the same performance. Pianist Brad Mehldau and power trio The Bad Plus have explored contemporary rock music {{within the context of the}} traditional jazz acoustic piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists Greg Osby and Charles Gayle, while others, such as James Carter, have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.|$|E
25|$|On September 29, 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan disputed Treaty of Lausanne. He said “We {{gave away}} the islands (in the Aegean) through the Treaty of Lausanne,”, “The islands, which if we care to shout (from the western Asia Minor coast) we’ll {{be heard on}} the other side (the islands), we gave away with Lausanne. What will now happen with the {{continental}} shelf? What will happen with the airspace and land? We’re still fighting for all of these". This caused displeasure in Athens. A Greek Foreign Ministry source remarked that “everyone should respect the Treaty of Lausanne,” noting that it is “a reality in the civilized world <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one,</b> including Ankara, can ignore.”, added that the Turkish leader’s comments were likely geared for domestic consumption.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} Intercontinental Cup, Real Madrid titled {{themselves}} world champions until FIFA {{stepped in and}} objected, citing that the competition did not include any other champions from the other confederations; FIFA stated that they can only claim to be intercontinental champions of a competition played between two organisations in <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else {{had the opportunity to}} participate. FIFA failed to authorise the competition in the 1960s. FIFA stated that they would prohibit the 1961 edition to be played out unless the organisers regarded the competition as a friendly or a private match between two organisations. That same year the Intercontinental Cup was first played, FIFA authorised the International Soccer League to be contested with ratification from Sir Stanley Rous, who had become the FIFA President by that point.|$|E

50|$|In welfare economics, {{a social}} planner is a {{decision-maker}} who attempts {{to achieve the}} best result for all parties involved. In neo-classical welfare economics, this means the maximization of a social welfare function. In modern welfare economics, {{there is a greater}} emphasis on Pareto optimality, in <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> economic status can be improved without worsening someone else's. Pareto-optimal solutions are not unique, and according to the Second Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics, a social planner can achieve any Pareto-optimal outcome by an appropriate redistribution of wealth by means of competitive market.|$|R

25|$|The {{residents}} of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying of strychnine poisoning. Hastings, a house guest, enlists {{the help of}} his friend Hercule Poirot, who is staying in the nearby village, Styles St. Mary. Poirot pieces together events surrounding the murder. On the day she was killed, Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone, either her husband Alfred or her stepson John. Afterwards, she seemed quite distressed and, apparently, made a new will — <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> can find. She ate little at dinner and retired early to her room with her document case. The case was later forced open by someone and a document removed. Alfred Inglethorp left Styles earlier in the evening and stayed overnight in the nearby village, so was not present when the poisoning occurred. Nobody can explain how or when the strychnine was administered to Mrs. Inglethorp.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} types of {{republic}}, the Kemalist republic is a representative democracy with a Parliament chosen in general elections, a President as head of state elected by Parliament and serving for a limited term, a Prime Minister appointed by the President, and other Ministers appointed by Parliament. The Kemalist President does not have direct executive powers, but has limited veto powers, {{and the right to}} contest with referendum. The day-to-day operation of government {{is the responsibility of the}} Council of Ministers formed by the Prime Minister and the other Ministers. There is a separation of powers between the executive (President and Council of Ministers), the legislative (Parliament) and the judiciary, in <b>which</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> branch of government has authority over another–although parliament is charged with the supervision of the Council of Ministers, which can be compelled to resign by a vote of no-confidence.|$|E
