[...] Today <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>this</b> distribution of charges in a device, a capacitor. He observed that a charge was built up on both sides between a piece of nonconducting material. In the case of the Leyden jar this was glass (nonconducting matter) and on each side of it was a metal material (conducting matter). These opposite metal layers had the exact opposite electric charges (positive and negative). He observed that when the wire {{on the inside of the}} jar was electrised positively by a certain amount, that the outer conductor simultaneously became electrised negatively in the same proportion.|$|E
