5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} in southern Baja California, killing two rescue works from floodwaters. Resort areas near the coast experienced minor effects, though further inland {{the damage was}} more severe. The impact of Ignacio <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> flooding from Hurricane Marty a month later, with damage from the two hurricanes totaling about $1billion (2003USD, $1.1billion 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans {{did in the}} face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's caprices lead to sour {{relations}} with the family. She argued with the Grand Duchess Vittoria over precedence, and with Grand Duke Ferdinando over her spending. Her spending habits not only spelled conflict with the Grand Duke, but made her unpopular with the Florentines. This <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> her unseemly conduct, such as the two grooms who frequented her chamber at all hours.|$|E

5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> fears {{that as they}} shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a {{potential}} fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, even though he knew it wasn't true.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{dominance}} of the Gelug sect of Buddhism in Tawang, the Nyingmapa or the Black Hat sect of Buddhism was dominant and this resulted in their hegemony and even hostile approach towards the founder, Merek Lama. This problem <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the Drukpas of Bhutan, who also belonged to the Nyingmapa sect, who even tried to invade and take control of Tawang. Hence, when the Tawang monastery was built like a fort structure, a strategic location was chosen from the defense point of view.|$|E
5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.|$|E

5|$|George Eastham, who had {{previously}} been Waddington's assistant, was appointed as manager in March 1977, but the club's slide into the Second Division in 1976–77 season proved unstoppable. Eastham did not last long, leaving in January 1978 after only 10 months in charge. The club's misery <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> a defeat to non-league Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup shortly afterwards. Alan Durban, arriving from Shrewsbury Town, {{was selected as the}} club's new manager in February 1978. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in his first full season, 1978–79, with a third-place finish. After consolidating the club's position in the First Division, Durban left for Sunderland in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. As the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nguyễn Ánh {{had stayed}} in Siam with a {{contingent}} of troops until August 1787. His soldiers served in Siam's war against Bodawpaya of Burma (1785–86). Having consolidated their hold on southern Vietnam, the Tây Sơn decided to move north to unify the country. However, the withdrawal of troops from the Gia Định garrison weakened them their hold on the south. This <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> reports that Nguyễn Nhạc was being attacked near Qui Nhơn by his own brother Nguyễn Huệ, and that more Tây Sơn troops were being evacuated from Gia Dinh by their commander Dang Van Tran in order to aid Nguyễn Nhạc. Sensing Tây Sơn vulnerability in the south, Nguyễn Ánh assembled his forces {{at home and abroad}} in preparation for an immediate offensive.|$|E

5|$|Mike Summerbee {{opened the}} scoring on 13 minutes, but Newcastle soon equalised. Neil Young made it 2–1, but again Newcastle equalised. A second strike by Young was {{disallowed}} for offside, and at half-time {{the score was}} 2–2. Straight after half-time Young scored again, and Francis Lee scored a fourth on 63 minutes. A late Newcastle goal set up a nervy finish, but City held on to win 4–3 and secure the title. The win <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> a 2–1 victory by Sunderland over Manchester United, giving City the title. Liverpool won one of their remaining games but lost the other, missing their chance to leapfrog United into second by one point.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Venezuela, Bret first {{affected}} Trinidad and Tobago, causing minor {{flooding and}} power outages. It passed {{just south of}} Curaçao, where the storm damaged the coral reef and the roofs of 17homes. The storm later brushed northern Colombia, killing one person there, before hitting Central America. In Nicaragua, Bret killed 31people and left US$3million in damage, with many coastal towns isolated by floods. There was one death in neighboring Costa Rica and seven in Honduras, all due to flooding. In Central America, damage <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> Hurricane Gert moving through the region in early September.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of maintaining {{an air force}} with little funding {{during a time of}} rapid technological development <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the Swiss militia system: all but a handful of military personnel were citizen soldiers who served only a few weeks each year following their initial recruitment phase. Military pilot candidates underwent the same recruit training, NCO school and officer candidate school as other Swiss army officers, followed by a pilot school of 173days, then re-entered civilian life. During his first two years of service, a pilot's training continued with ten logged flight hours per month, and thereafter he was required to fly fifty hours per year at his convenience.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 1931–32, Arsenal {{reached the}} FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United. Arsenal had led 1–0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser {{came after a}} long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again {{in the second half}} to win the match 2–1. Arsenal's pain <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the fact that Everton had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the 1931–32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that they}} had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E

5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E
5|$|Helm {{was painted}} as a {{suspicious}} figure {{by some of}} the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the fact that Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.|$|E
5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E
