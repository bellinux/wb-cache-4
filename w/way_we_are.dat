In November 2001, R duo Chemistry's debut album The <b>Way</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> sold over 1.14 million copies in the first week, and debuted at the number-one position on the Oricon weekly album charts. Hip hop bands such as Rip Slyme and Ketsumeishi were also at the top of the Oricon charts.|$|E
25|$|Many consequentialist {{theories}} {{may seem}} {{primarily concerned with}} human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue {{that we should not}} limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, if we were to look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).|$|E

500|$|Part of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick's {{films are}} {{considered}} by film historian Michel Ciment to be [...] "among {{the most important}} contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century", and he is frequently cited {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. [...] Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes Anderson, George Lucas, James Cameron, Woody Allen, Terry Gilliam, the Coen brothers, Ridley Scott, and George A. Romero, [...] have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration. On the DVD of Eyes Wide Shut, Steven Spielberg comments that the way Kubrick [...] "tells a story is antithetical to the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> accustomed to receiving stories" [...] and that [...] "nobody could shoot a picture better in history". Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's Kubrick, film director Martin Scorsese notes that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood when first released, and came to be regarded as masterpieces only in the years after their releases. Orson Welles, one of Kubrick's greatest personal influences and all-time favorite directors, said that: [...] "Among those whom I would call 'younger generation', Kubrick appears to me to be a giant." ...|$|E

The line [...] "Fix me in forty-five" [...] is {{a reference to the}} length of a therapy session. On [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", Wentz uses wartime-inspired metaphors to discuss their newfound popularity; he called the song [...] "kind of a tongue-in-cheek look at the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> so addicted and obsessed with new arts, cultures and loves – {{to the point where it}} just becomes oversaturated."

[...] "The roads that we are using today were all built by Smith," [...] he said. [...] "All the infrastructure is Smith's. We never suffered the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> suffering now because Smith took care of the economy that supported all people and they had enough to eat. When he left power the [...] pound was {{on a par with the}} Zimbabwean dollar, but President Mugabe has killed all that." [...] David Coltart, another MDC politician, issued a statement after Smith's death praising him as a man of modesty and integrity, but criticising what Coltart felt to be [...] "disastrous political decisions as Prime Minister"; Coltart considered Smith's policies to have radicalised black nationalists, fomented Mugabe's rise to power and thereby [...] "directly contributed to the trauma that Zimbabwe is suffering from today". Godwin took a similar line, describing the emergency powers Smith used to combat black nationalists as [...] "draconian"; he also pointed out that these [...] "levers of repression" [...] had formed the base for much of what Mugabe later did. Lord Carrington spoke scathingly about Smith in a 2005 interview with Heidi Holland, saying he disliked both Smith and Mugabe but would choose the latter if he [...] "absolutely had to choose"; Smith was, in his opinion, [...] "a bigoted, stupid man" [...] responsible for all of Zimbabwe's problems.|$|E
500|$|At {{an early}} age, she was {{introduced}} by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: [...] "I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, {{and a lot of}} Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> as we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S.

500|$|In the East, the {{persecution}} was officially discontinued on April 30, 311, although martyrdoms in Gaza continued until May 4. Galerius, now on his deathbed, issued a proclamation to end hostilities, and give Christians {{the rights to}} exist freely under the law, and to peaceable assembly. Persecution was everywhere at an end. Lactantius preserves the Latin text of this pronouncement, describing it as an edict. Eusebius provides a Greek translation of the pronouncement. His version includes imperial titles and an address to provincials, suggesting that the proclamation is, in fact, an imperial letter. The document seems only to have been promulgated in Galerius's provinces.Among all the other arrangements that we are always making for the benefit and utility of the state, we have heretofore wished to repair all things {{in accordance with the}} laws and public discipline of the Romans, and to ensure that even the Christians, who abandoned the practice of their ancestors, should return to good sense. Indeed, for some reason or other, such self-indulgence assailed and idiocy possessed those Christians, that they did not follow the practices of the ancients, which their own ancestors had, perhaps, instituted, but according to their own will and as it pleased them, they made laws for themselves that they observed, and gathered various peoples in diverse areas. Then when our order was issued stating that they should return themselves to the practices of the ancients, many were subjected to peril, and many were even killed. Many more persevered in their way of life, and we saw that they neither offered proper worship and cult to the gods, or to the god of the Christians. Considering the observation of our own mild clemency and eternal custom, by which we are accustomed to grant clemency to all people, we have decided to extend our most speedy indulgence to these people as well, so that Christians may once more establish their own meeting places, so long as they do not act in a disorderly <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> about to send another letter to our officials detailing the conditions they ought to observe. Consequently, in accord with our indulgence, they ought to pray to their god for our health and the safety of the state, so that the state may be kept safe on all sides, and {{they may be able to}} live safely and securely in their own homes. Galerius's words reinforce the Tetrarchy's theological basis for {{the persecution}}; the acts did nothing more than attempt to enforce traditional civic and religious practices, even if the edicts themselves were thoroughly nontraditional. Galerius does nothing to violate the spirit of the persecutionChristians are still admonished for their nonconformity and foolish practicesGalerius never admits that he did anything wrong. The admission that the Christians' god might exist is made only grudgingly. Certain early 20th-century historians have declared that Galerius's edict definitively nullified the old [...] "legal formula" [...] non licet esse Christianos, made Christianity a religio licita, [...] "on a par with Judaism", and secured Christians' property, among other things.|$|E
