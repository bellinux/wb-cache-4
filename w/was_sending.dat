5|$|By {{the time}} Resident Evil 3 was released, {{development}} on Code: Veronica was nearing completion. Much of Code: Veronicas 70-person development staff was outsourced because Capcom resources had been tied up working on Resident Evil 3. Shinji Mikami and Yoshiki Okamoto's team at Flagship oversaw the game's scenario and direction, while XAX Entertainment assisted with environments and Nextech handled {{much of the}} technical development. Capcom Production Studio 4 still handled art direction and character design. By September 1999, Sega <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> some of its own developers to help add final touches to the game. Sega assisted Capcom with the game's programming to help keep a good framerate.|$|E
5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius saying that he <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes {{it more likely that}} the battle occurred in 634.|$|E

5|$|Realizing Calgary's {{path to the}} Stanley Cup {{would go}} through Edmonton, coach Bob Johnson devised a seven-point plan for beating the Oilers that focused on {{limiting}} Wayne Gretzky, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri's creativity, limiting access {{to the left side}} of the ice where the Oilers' top stars liked to skate, leaving their physical players on the ice by not engaging them and utilizing Neil Sheehy and Colin Patterson in roles designed to frustrate the Oiler players. Johnson first utilized the strategy in a late season game that ended in a 4–4 tie. The Flames then defeated the Oilers 9–3 in their final regular season meeting, a game that ended with another brawl and accusations by both teams that the other <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> their goons out after talented players.|$|E
5|$|When Oliver {{arrived in}} Adelaide he started playing for West Suburbans and {{immediately}} began to draw attention from the two largest South Australian Football League (SAFL) clubs, Norwood and Port Adelaide. South Australian businessman Edwin T. Smith <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> Oliver letters asking him to come train with Norwood whilst John Woolard, then captain of Port Adelaide who like Oliver grew up in Broken Hill, was also enquiring about his services. Before Oliver made his debut with Port Adelaide he was lined up with a job shovelling furnace waste. Disgruntled, {{he spoke to the}} Musgrave brothers father who suggested he approach West Torrens and train with them, to which Oliver agreed. Port Adelaide secretary James Hodge prevented this move as Oliver had signed a contract with him shortly beforehand. Hodge later took Oliver out on a fishing trip to resolve the feud and found him a better job.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} neared completion, Miller began {{to market the}} game to players. Strongly {{encouraged}} by the updates the team <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> him, he began heavily advertising the game {{in all of the}} bulletin board systems (BBS) and game magazines he had access to. The game was completed in early December 1990, and on the afternoon of December 14 Miller began uploading the completed first episode to BBSs, with the other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for US$30. After the arrival of the first royalty check from Apogee, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game, the team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} the Luftwaffe <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> {{increased}} numbers of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters over England, at night and at low-level. They were able to hit the coastal areas and their speed and agility meant they were a difficult prospect to intercept. The German pilots were disadvantaged in some respects. There {{was a lack of}} nigh-flying experience in these units, the Fw 190s did not carry radar and had a short range. Aside from a small mirror, the pilot could not always see behind him well enough at night. On 16 May 1943 the Fw 190s lost four and probably a fifth to 85 Squadron. On 13 June 1943 Cunningham intercepted an Fw 190 not far from his airfield at West Malling. The GCI controller telephoned the crew-room to notify them the commanding officer was closing on an enemy aircraft heading to London. They heard both aircraft and the brief burst of fire followed by the explosion. To his amazement, Cunningham later learned the pilot—Leutnant Ullrich from 3./Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (Fast Bomber Wing 10—SKG 10)—was thrown through the canopy as the Fw 190A-5, Werknummer, 840047 code CO+LT, fell earthwards. He deployed his parachute and was picked up by a searchlight crew with a broken arm.|$|E
5|$|In October 2001, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that it}} <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> a special forces task group built around an SASR squadron {{to participate in the}} campaign against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan designated Operation Slipper. After staging through Kuwait, 1 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001 with the other SASR squadrons rotating in at approximately six-monthly intervals. The SASR's main role in Afghanistan was to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance of al-Qaeda and Taliban positions, activities and capabilities. SASR force elements also conducted some offensive operations. After arriving at FOB Rhino, the SASR initially operated in southern Afghanistan with US Marines from Task Force 58, conducting long-range vehicle mounted patrols over several hundred kilometres around Kandahar and into the Helmand Valley near the Iranian-border. On 16 February 2002 Sergeant Andrew Russell was killed when the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) he was travelling in hit a land mine during an operation in the Helmand Valley. Two other soldiers were wounded in the incident. Later the SASR operated under command of Task Force 64.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, British {{warships}} bombarded Dar es Salaam {{and destroyed}} the German wireless station there. By this time, Königsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff {{needed to find}} a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship Möwe. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, Königsberg passed over {{the bar at the}} mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed {{at the mouth of the}} river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg, observed a British cruiser—Pegasus—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 {{installment}} of the TNA World X Cup Tournament was announced in February 2008 by TNA Management Director Jim Cornette. Cornette did not reveal when the tournament would be held or who would be involved. On the May1 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, TNA commentator Mike Tenay announced that the tournament was planned for the summer. In mid-May, {{it was reported that}} New Japan Pro Wrestling <b>was</b> <b>sending</b> Milano Collection A.T. and Taichi Ishikari to be featured in the tournament. TNA was also interested in bringing in British wrestler Doug Williams. Averno, Rey Bucanero, Último Guerrero, Volador Jr., Naruki Doi, and Masato Yoshino were revealed at the end of May to be involved. In June, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that Daivari, Tyson Dux, Williams, and Alex Koslov would make up Team International, while Averno, Bucanero, Guerrero, and Volador Jr. would be Team Mexico, and Team Japan would consist of Milano Collection AT, Ishikari, Doi, and Yoshino. The finals of the tournament were also planned to be held at TNA's Victory Road pay-per-view (PPV) event on July13. It was announced on the June19 episode of Impact! that the finals would be contested in an Ultimate X match. Team Mexico had trouble entering the United States, resulting in the tournament starting without them and the team appearing late in the festivities. Team TNA was revealed on the June12 episode of Impact!, with Kaz as the team captain and Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, and Curry Man rounding out the team. Despite the report by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Ishikari did not compete in the tournament; instead, Puma filled out Team Japan.|$|E
