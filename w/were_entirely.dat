5|$|Caragiale had by then {{proceeded}} to research the matter on his own, {{and came to the}} independent conclusion that the accusations <b>were</b> <b>entirely</b> concocted. Late in 1901, he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu, taken up by the Ilfov County court. On the first day, Caion excused himself as sick, while Stoenescu recused himself, taking the prosecution's side. For these reasons, the trial was held without a jury.|$|E

5|$|On 29 April 1946, {{five days}} after the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-300 and the Yak-Jumo made their first flights, the Council of Ministers ordered that the Yakovlev OKB begin design of a new {{aircraft}} similar to the Yak-Jumo, using the RD-10 engine with improved aerodynamics. This generally resembled the original aircraft, but the wings <b>were</b> <b>entirely</b> redesigned with laminar flow airfoils, the tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted.|$|E

5|$|Colours (stylized as CoLOURS) is {{the fifteenth}} studio album by Japanese {{recording}} artist Ayumi Hamasaki.

The songs on the album <b>were</b> <b>entirely</b> written by Hamasaki, while production was led by long-time collaborator Max Matsuura; it also included a variety of Western producers such as Armin van Buuren, members from RedOne Productions De Paris and Rush, Darkchild, and Fedde Le Grand, among others. This became Hamasaki's first studio album to have not been fully produced by Matsuura, and her first album to incorporate {{a large amount of}} English language. Musically, Colours is an electronic dance music album.|$|E
5|$|Demo {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Night Fishing began {{several days before}} {{the release of the}} band's debut album Go to the Future in May 2007.

After the album sessions had finished, however, the band immediately kept on recording for their future projects. The album's track order was not considered until the very final mastering stages of the album. Yamaguchi did much of the album's final mixing himself personally.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 to 2001, {{the book}} was also adapted as an {{animated}} television series, broadcast on CITV in the UK and on YTV in Canada. It was produced by Martin Rosen and starred several well-known British actors, including Stephen Fry, Rik Mayall, Dawn French, John Hurt, and Richard Briers, running {{for a total of}} 39 episodes over three seasons. Although the story was broadly based on that of the novel and most characters and events retained, some of the story lines and characters (especially in later episodes) <b>were</b> <b>entirely</b> new.

5|$|In 1940, six {{aircraft}} without engines were {{fitted with}} Mikulin AM-35A engines, while VVS officials evaluated both the Charomskiy ACh-30 and Charomskiy M-40 aircraft Diesel engines. At least nine Pe-8s were fitted with Diesel engines in 1941, {{but neither the}} ACh-30 nor the M-40 <b>were</b> <b>entirely</b> satisfactory, despite greatly increasing {{the range of the}} aircraft. All surviving Pe-8s were re-engined with AM-35As by the end of 1941. Production continued slowly at Factory No. 124; most of the factory's resources were devoted to the higher-priority Petlyakov Pe-2, a successful light bomber. At this time, most of these aircraft, re-designated as the Pe-8 after Petlyakov was killed in a Pe-2 crash on 12 January 1942, were built with out-of-production AM-35A engines.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Mauritius and Réunion were lost after {{the arrival of}} humans, so that the {{ecosystems}} of these islands are severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, the islands <b>were</b> <b>entirely</b> covered in forests, very little of which remains today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. On Mauritius, the Mascarene grey parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. On Réunion, it lived alongside the Réunion ibis, the hoopoe starling, the Mascarene parrot, the Réunion parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon.|$|E

The 2nd Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) was organized on 9 October 1950, assuming the lineage of A Company of the 2nd Ranger Battalion. It had an initial strength of 135 enlisted men and 5 officers under the command of First Lieutenant Warren E. Allen, company commander, and Second Lieutenant James C. Queen, executive officer. Originally it had been designated the 4th Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne), but the two companies switched designations, apparently to prevent accusations of racial discrimination.

5|$|Strong winds {{in southwestern}} Haiti from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} hundreds of trees. The path of Flora over the area was best determined by the trajectory of fallen trees across the peninsula. The strong winds left entire villages roofless, with many buildings entirely destroyed. The combination of rough waves and strong winds destroyed three entire communities. Many {{of those who died}} in southwestern Haiti suffered from intense burns from strong winds. In most areas, crops <b>were</b> <b>entirely</b> destroyed. The coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane, though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years. Additionally, strong winds downed shading trees for the coffee crop on the southern peninsula. One official estimated it would require three years for the coffee crop to be replanted and regrown.|$|E
