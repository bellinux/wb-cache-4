In the morning," [...] Miss Penny went on, after a pause, [...] "two woodcutters {{on their way to}} work noticed that the door of the hut was ajar. They approached the hut cautiously, their axes raised and ready for a blow if there should be need of it. Peeping in, they saw a woman in a black dress lying face downward in the straw. Dead? No; she moved, she moaned. 'What's the matter?' A blubbered face, smeared with streaks of tear-clotted grey dust, is lifted towards them. 'What's the matter?'--'He's gone!' What a queer, indistinct utterance. The woodcutters regard one another. What does she say? She's a foreigner, perhaps. 'What's the matter?' they repeat once more. The woman bursts out violently crying. 'Gone, gone! He's gone,' she sobs out in her vague, inarticulate way. 'Oh, gone. That's what she says. Who's gone?'--'He's left me.'--'What?'--'Left me....'--'What the devil...? Speak a little more distinctly.'--'I can't,' she wails; 'he's taken my teeth.'--'Your what?--'My teeth!'--and the shrill voice breaks into a scream, and she falls back sobbing into the straw.
