5|$|The {{combined}} Roman-Pergamese army {{started their}} march from Ephesus. They advanced inland passing Magnesia on the Maeander {{and into the}} territory of Alabanda where they <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> 1,000 infantry and 300 cavalry led by Attalus' brother. They then marched to Antiochia where they <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> Antiochus' son, Seleucus who offered corn {{as part of the}} treaty that was being concluded.|$|E
5|$|Abernathy {{later wrote}} that the {{movement}} received a worse reception in Chicago than in the South. Marches, especially the one through Marquette Park on August 5, 1966, <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> thrown bottles and screaming throngs. Rioting seemed very possible.|$|E
5|$|The Romans and the Pergamese {{arrived at}} the city of Gordium and found it deserted. As they camped there they <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> a {{messenger}} sent by Eposognatus.

5|$|Around noon, General Henry Abbot {{arrived at}} President Street with a {{battalion}} of 99 to 114 engineers. As the group advanced toward the armory of the 6th Regiment where {{they were to be}} quartered, they <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> a crowd of 500. Jeers from the crowd turned to missiles until one soldier, Private Corcoran, was struck in the head and wounded. Abbot gave orders that his men were to halt and fix bayonets, at which point the crowd scattered.|$|E
5|$|Kanthaugen has {{traditionally}} {{served as a}} recreational area for Lillehammer, and has in particular been used for alpine skiing. In 1946, Norway's then-largest ski lift was installed between Stampesletta and Kanthaugen. It remained in use until the late 1970s. At {{the time of the}} closing, a local businessman proposed that it be renovated and that a tobogganing slide be built from Kanthaugen to Stampesletta. The plans <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> local opposition and were not carried through.|$|E
5|$|Pećanac was {{the most}} {{prominent}} figure in the Chetnik movement during the interwar period. During the 1920 Constitutional Assembly elections, Prime Minister Nikola Pašić sent Pećanac to the Sandžak with orders to intimidate the local Muslim population {{in the hope of}} keeping the turnout low. In the same year, attempts by the Yugoslav government to disarm and conscript Kosovo Albanians <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> revolts. Pećanac was sent to Kosovo to form detachments made up of local Serbs to fight the rebels. This resulted in rebel attacks on Serb villages.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Stowe's {{writings}} about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During {{a visit to}} his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had an audience with Governor Marcellus Stearns. They <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> his cabinet and staff {{on the steps of the}} state capitol building—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.|$|E
5|$|The {{instigator}} was, again, {{his nephew}} Máel Coluim, who now {{had the support}} of Óengus of Moray. King Óengus was David's most powerful vassal, a man who, as grandson of King Lulach of Scotland, even had his own claim to the kingdom. The rebel Scots had advanced into Angus, where they <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> David's Mercian constable, Edward; a battle took place at Stracathro near Brechin. According to the Annals of Ulster, 1000 of Edward's army, and 4000 of Óengus' army – including Óengus himself – died.|$|E

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control <b>were</b> <b>met.</b> <b>By</b> lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|An {{infantry}} battalion, {{forming the}} right flank of Abd el-Hamid's 16th Brigade, was {{in position to}} defend the Lexicon-Tirtur crossroads. Initially, Reshef sent two armored battalions northward on Lexicon. As the Israeli tanks neared the infantry battalion, they <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> heavy fire from anti-tank weapons. They lost 27 tanks during this engagement, although seven Israeli tanks managed {{to break through the}} battalion's westernmost position on Lexicon and advance northwards to al-Galaa'. Thereafter, 'Abd el-Hamid ordered tank-hunting squads – groups of ten equipped with RPG-7 rockets and RPG-43 grenades – to deploy around al-Galaa' and destroy those tanks that broke through; he also sent a tank company to reinforce the infantry battalion.|$|E
5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades {{were already}} on the ground before the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945. The German defenders had been alerted, and the gliders <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> a concentrated anti-aircraft barrage. This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives. The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E

5|$|At times, some ox cart trains {{did not go}} all the way through, {{but were}} {{supplemented}} by river craft. First flatboats and then shallow-draft steamboats ascended the Minnesota River to Traverse des Sioux and upstream points, where they <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> cart brigades travelling the West Plains Trail. In 1851, weekly steamboat service on the Mississippi began between Saint Anthony Falls and Sauk Rapids on the Middle and Woods trails. In 1859, steamboat machinery was carried overland to the Red River where a boat was built, but service was intermittent. The Dakota War of 1862 and the American Civil War delayed further improvements.|$|E
5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had been shot down and four were attempting to make a run for home. The remainder dropped their bombs and <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E
5|$|Captain Renaudin, of Généreux, and Joseph Allemand, of Ville de Marseille, {{were both}} honourably acquitted during the {{automatic}} court-martial {{for the loss}} of their ships. The French Navy made no further efforts to reach Malta, and all subsequent efforts by French warships to break out the port <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> the blockade, only one frigate breaking through and reaching France. Without the supplies carried on Perrée's convoy, starvation and disease spread throughout the garrison {{and by the end of}} August 1800, French soldiers were dying at a rate of 100 a day.

5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nablus {{came under}} Jordanian control. Thousands of Palestinian {{refugees}} fleeing from areas captured by Israel arrived in Nablus, settling {{in refugee camps}} {{in and around the}} city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. The 1967 Six-Day War ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.|$|E
5|$|Escorted by {{elements}} of the 3rd Krajina Brigade, Tito {{made his way to}} Potoci, where he was met by a battalion of the 1st Proletarian Brigade. At Potoci, they <b>were</b> <b>met</b> <b>by</b> the staff of the Allied military missions. The British mission signals officer had brought the only surviving radio. Initially, Tito had been in favour of continuing the attack on the SS paratroopers, but after reassessing the situation, he cancelled further attacks. As the German intention to encircle the Supreme Command in a small area around Drvar with approaching units, and then destroy it with land forces had become apparent by now, serious reorganisation of Partisan dispositions was now required. After German troops were observed in the area of Potoci, Tito and his companions were escorted towards Kupres.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to 1934, Wu {{studied at}} the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University and {{reinstated}} in Taiwan), first in mathematics, but later transferring to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected {{as one of the}} student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since {{she was one of the}} top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That being the case, she was careful not to neglect her studies.
