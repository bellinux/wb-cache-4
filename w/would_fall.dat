5|$|Following {{their opening}} victory, the United {{traveled}} up north {{to take on}} New England Revolution on 26 March. The United <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> into a 2–0 hole early in the match, with some citing poor officiating as the cause. A late penalty kick goal from Charlie Davies resulted in a 2–1 loss for the United.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, at {{the church}} of St Vigeans, near Arbroath, communion was not held for several years because the villagers {{believed}} there was a curse on the church. The curse said that if communion were held then the church <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> into a large subterranean lake.|$|E
5|$|According to Njal's saga, Bróðir {{tried by}} sorcery {{to predict the}} outcome of the battle against Brian. He augured that if the battle were on Good Friday, King Brian <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> but win the battle; but if they fought on any day before, all who opposed Brian would be killed. Brian was unwilling to fight on Good Friday, as he would not fight on a fast day, but the Danes forced the battle to the Friday, which fell that year on 23 April.|$|E

5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> quickly {{in the event of an}} invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned. The government of the time instead suggested Lloyd Kenyon as a possible successor. Mansfield clung to office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) {{in the hope that}} the government <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> before he was forced to retire. This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.|$|E
60|$|People {{who knew}} the river shook their heads, {{and said that the}} {{decision}} had been delayed too long. The Nile <b>would</b> have <b>fallen</b> to a point so low that it would be difficult if not impossible to pass up the cataracts, and long before help could reach Khartoum the city and its noble governor <b>would</b> have <b>fallen</b> {{into the hands of the}} Mahdi.|$|R

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Boris I (r. 852–889) Bulgaria {{underwent}} major changes— the Christianization {{of the country and}} the admission of the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius, which {{marked the beginning of the}} creation and consolidation of the medieval Bulgarian literature and alphabet. Following intense negotiations with the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Bulgaria converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which caused discontent among part of the nobility who directly associated the new religion with the Byzantine Empire and feared that the country <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> under Byzantine influence.|$|E
5|$|If the hastati {{failed to}} break the enemy during their engagement, they <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> back and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break through, they would retire behind the heavy triarii spearmen who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line {{were some of the}} least {{dependable}} troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line.|$|E
5|$|In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's {{character}} Salviati, {{widely regarded}} as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> with the same finite speed in a vacuum. But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin. Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar.|$|E

5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|MAR {{operated}} in two modes, surveillance, and engagement. In surveillance mode, the range was maximized, and each face performed a scan in about 5seconds. Returns were fed into systems that automatically extracted {{the range and}} velocity, and if the return was deemed interesting, the system automatically began a track for threat verification. During the threat verification phase, the radar spent more time examining the returns {{in an effort to}} accurately determine the trajectory and then ignored any objects that <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> outside its area.|$|E
5|$|Pitched battles were {{conducted}} in a similar fashion: the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> back on the principes, who along with the hastati, had been re-equipped with pila rather than spears. If the principes could not break the enemy they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Prince finally {{succumbed to}} {{syphilis}} on 30 October 1713, sparking a succession crisis. Cosimo III deposited {{a bill in}} the Tuscan senate, the nominal legislature, provisioning for a male line succession failure by making the Electress Palatine Gian Gastone's heiress. It passed and was disseminated to chancelleries across Europe. Austria refused to sanction it, fearing that Tuscany <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> into the Bourbons' hands. However, France and England did.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of bog turtles between colonies facilitates genetic diversity. If this movement {{were to be}} prevented, or limited in any significant way, the species would have a higher likelihood of becoming extinct because genetic diversity <b>would</b> <b>fall.</b> Some aspects of a bog turtle's movement that remain unresolved include: phenomena that motivate bog turtles to move outside their natural habitat; the distances an individual {{can be expected to}} travel each day, week, and year; and how separation of small groups affects the genetics of the species.|$|E
5|$|They also {{expressed}} disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that {{one half of}} a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the counterslab. These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave {{the bulk of the}} fossil on one side and little on the other.|$|E

5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|Whether Sharp {{had made}} the claim is uncertain, but Beauchamp {{believed}} he had. He planned to murder him and flee with Anna to Missouri. He would murder Sharp {{in the early morning}} of November 7, 1825, when the new legislature convened its session, as he hoped that suspicion <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> on Sharp's political enemies. Three weeks prior to that date, Beauchamp sold his property, telling his friends that he was planning to move to Missouri. He hired laborers to help load his wagons two days before the planned murder.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the {{government}} became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory <b>would</b> <b>fall</b> behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.|$|E

50|$|It was {{reported}} that 30% of the population <b>would</b> likely <b>fall</b> ill within six months, and that half of those would be confined to their beds. Ultimately, {{one out of every}} two persons would have acquired the disease at some point. This meant that about 700,000 Norwegians <b>would</b> have <b>fallen</b> ill, and in this period, 700 to 3,000 more deaths than a regular influenza season were to be expected.|$|R
