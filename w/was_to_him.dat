Henry De la Beche and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Mary, and sometimes Mary's brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning {{kept in touch}} as {{he became one of}} Britain's leading geologists. William Buckland, who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning. It <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones, were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects coprolites. In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and Richard Owen visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.|$|E
25|$|Thus Gregory VII, as a {{politician}} wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged {{the existence of the}} state as a dispensation of Providence, described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the sacerdotium and the imperium. But at no period would he have dreamed of putting the two powers on an equal footing; the superiority of church to state <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> a fact which admitted of no discussion and which he had never doubted.|$|E
25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, Listen to me Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> personally, not good, and that {{he knew he had}} done better acting. In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and critics would say he would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as natural as possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E

25|$|Carl Adolph Agardh {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} algologists of all time, he was born in Sweden on 23 January 1785 and died on 28 January 1859. He was Professor of Botany at the University of Lund and later Bishop of Karlstad Diocese (Papenfuss, 1976). Many species still show his name as the authority of the scientific name. He traveled widely in Europe visiting Germany, Poland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy and was the first to emphasize the importance of the reproductive characters of algae and use them to distinguish the different genera and families. His son, Jacob Georg Agardh (1813–1901), who became Professor of Botany at Lund in 1839, made a study of the life-histories of algae, described many new genera and species. It <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that many workers sent specimens for determination and as donations. Because of this the herbarium at Lund is the most important algal herbarium in the world (Papenfuss, 1976).|$|E
25|$|Scorsese, who was {{strongly}} {{drawn to the}} characters {{and the story of}} Wharton's text, wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this aim, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that made an emotional impact on him. In Scorsese on Scorsese, he documents influences from films such as Luchino Visconti's Senso and his Il Gattopardo as well as Orson Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons and also Roberto Rossellini's La prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV. Although The Age of Innocence was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including for Scorsese for Best Adapted Screenplay), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award–winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis, with whom he would work again in Gangs of New York.|$|E

He {{became more and more}} closed off. He began to dam the river leading to his camp to keep boats away, and installed fences and padlocks to discourage land travelers. He put up signs around his land reading [...] "Danger: Land Mines". As added discouragement, he kept a 12-gauge shotgun with him at all times.|$|E

500|$|Though Hazlitt {{could find}} much to {{appreciate}} in the comedies, tragedy <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> inherently more important, and he weights the tragedies much more heavily. In this he differed from Johnson, who thought Shakespeare best at comedy. The greatest of the plays were tragedies—particularly Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and Hamlet—and Hazlitt's comments on tragedy are often integrated with his {{ideas about the}} significance of poetry and imaginative literature in general. As he expressed it at the end of [...] "Lear", tragedy describes the strongest passions, and [...] "the greatest strength of genius is shewn here in describing the strongest passions: for the power of the imagination, in works of invention, must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions, which are the subject of them." ...|$|E

[...] "At last, Eureka! Eureka! [...] I had found it. [...] I was so elated that I lost all desire for rest and had to take morphine to make me sleep." [...] To embark upon this project, he needed financing. [...] Unlike Butcher, his father had succeeded as a farmer, running a gristmill and a freighting business as well; it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that Butcher turned for assistance. [...] Thomas Jefferson Butcher was initially skeptical; but after his son had arranged to photograph 75 homesteads, he agreed to provide a team and wagon for the project.|$|E
500|$|Each homily {{begins with}} a {{paraphrase}} of a Gospel reading (important when the laity did not understand Latin), followed by exegesis (Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.174–75). The theological content is derivative; Orm closely follows Bede's exegesis of Luke, the Enarrationes in Matthoei, and the Glossa Ordinaria of the Bible. Thus, he reads each verse primarily allegorically rather than literally (Jack, George, in Matthew and Harrison 2004, pp.936–37). Rather than identify individual sources, Orm refers frequently to [...] "" [...] and to the [...] "holy book" [...] (Bennett 1986, p.31). Bennett has speculated that the Acts of the Apostles, Glossa Ordinaria, and Bede were bound together in a large Vulgate Bible in the abbey so that Orm truly was getting all of his material from a source that <b>was,</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> a single book. (Bennett 1986, p.31).|$|E

500|$|Another of Brownlee's {{contacts}} was T. A. Crerar, who {{had recently}} become leader of the Progressive Party of Canada, and it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that Brownlee turned for his political education. [...] Crerar introduced Brownlee to Ernest Charles Drury, the newly elected United Farmers of Ontario Premier of Ontario, and arranged for a meeting between Brownlee and Charles Stewart, by now Alberta Premier. [...] During the latter meeting, Brownlee told Stewart that {{he felt that the}} UFA's desires could be accommodated within Stewart's Liberal government, but warned against a quick election. [...] Foster suggests that this strategic advice from a political neophyte offended Stewart; whether this is true or not, Stewart did call a quick election, for July 1921. [...] The UFA had decided in January 1919, against Woods' wishes, that it would run candidates in the next election.|$|E
500|$|A new element {{was added}} when {{the office of}} [...] "President of the Council of Ministers" [...] was officially created in 1847—although it had existed in {{practice}} since 1843. The president of the Council owed his position to both his party and to the Emperor and these could sometimes come into conflict. 19th-century abolitionist leader and historian Joaquim Nabuco said that the [...] "President of the Council in Brazil was no Russian Chancellor, Sovereign's creature, nor a British Prime Minister, made only by {{the trust of the}} [...] Commons: the delegation of the Crown <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as necessary and important as the delegation of the Chamber, and, to exert with safety his functions, he had to dominate the caprice, the oscillations and ambitions of the Parliament, as well as to preserve always unalterable the favor, the good will of the emperor." ...|$|E
500|$|On his accession, Edward I {{sought to}} organise his realm, {{enforcing}} his claims to primacy in the British Isles. Llywelyn ap Gruffudd claimed to rule North Wales [...] "entirely separate from" [...] England but Edward viewed {{him to be}} [...] "a rebel and disturber of the peace". Edward's determination, military experience and skilful naval manoeuvres ended what <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> rebellion. The invasion was executed {{by one of the}} largest armies ever assembled by an English king, comprising Anglo-Norman cavalry and Welsh archers and laying the foundation for future victories in France. Llywelyn was driven into the mountains, later dying in battle. The Statute of Rhuddlan established England's authority over Wales, and Edward's son was proclaimed the first English Prince of Wales upon his birth. Edward spent vast sums on his two Welsh campaigns with a large portion of it spent on a network of castles.|$|E

After the resulting confrontation with Minna, Wagner left Zürich alone, bound for Venice, where he rented {{an apartment in the}} Palazzo Giustinian, while Minna returned to Germany. Wagner's attitude to Minna had changed; the editor of his correspondence with her, John Burk, has said that she <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> [...] "an invalid, to be treated with kindness and consideration, but, except at a distance, [...] a menace to his peace of mind." [...] Wagner continued his correspondence with Mathilde and his friendship with her husband Otto, who maintained his financial support of the composer. In an 1859 letter to Mathilde, Wagner wrote, half-satirically, of Tristan: [...] "Child! This Tristan is turning into something terrible. This final act!!!—I fear the opera will be banned... only mediocre performances can save me! Perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad." ...|$|E
