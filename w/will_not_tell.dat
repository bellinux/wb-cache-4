5|$|When Archie destroys Zoe's film project, {{essential}} for her graduation, lecturer Adrian P. Kennedy (Richard Lawrence) gives her an extension. Zoe finds a script belonging to Mike {{which he wrote}} 20 years ago about his decision to give Sarah up for adoption. Zoe uses the script and films it, and Adrian screens it in the SU Bar. At the screening, Sarah discovers the planned adoption and is in turmoil. Mike goes to see Adrian to tell him of the plagiarism. Adrian says that if she sleeps with him, he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the university. Zoe considers Adrian's offer but later claims she would rather be a failure than sleep with him, leading to him failing her project. Zoe then has a brief relationship with Natty (Danny Tennant).|$|E
5|$|A {{glassblower}} is {{attacked and}} hospitalized. Nemhauser (Greg Thirloway), another agent on the case, tells Scully that Patterson {{was responsible for}} getting Mulder assigned to the case and may admire him after all. Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a utility knife. Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> him {{how to find the}} creature that attacked him.|$|E
5|$|Mac {{returns to}} work after a month's leave. When Caroline meets him she implies that she is engaged to Guy. Mac and Guy are then drunk in a bar, where Mac tells Guy {{he is going to}} die {{in a couple of weeks}} and makes Guy promise he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> Caroline. However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, Caroline walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. Caroline confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying it would be better for her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells Mac to propose to Caroline because they love each other. Caroline and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with Caroline floating away into the sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{wants to}} spend time with his girlfriend, Elisa (Salma Hayek), but her job as a nurse does not allow it. While taking care of an elderly man named Mr. Templeton (George Bartenieff), who suffers from dementia, Jack persuades her {{to spend time with}} him, to which Elisa gives in to, and results in the two {{bringing}} Mr. Templeton along on their dates. One day, as they prepare to go out again, Jack and Elisa are shocked when Mr. Templeton's son, Michael (Scott Bryce), visits unexpectedly. The elderly man tells his son about the late night escapades, though Elisa tells the son that his story is not true. As Elisa distracts the son, Jack tries to leave the apartment, until Mr. Templeton sees him. Jack explains his situation with Elisa to Mr. Templeton, which he understands, and promises Jack he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> his son anything more of the late nights.|$|E

2500|$|Miller was championed, {{although}} not enthusiastically, by Bret Harte and Ambrose Bierce. Bierce, who once called Miller [...] "the greatest-hearted man I ever knew" [...] also {{is quoted as}} saying that he was [...] "the greatest liar this country ever produced.

2500|$|In his time, Miller {{was known}} for his {{dishonesty}} and womanizing.

2500|$|This {{statistic}} {{was somewhat}} disputed in a 2006 article about {{poverty in the}} slums of Haiti (written for the Red Cross), wherein ICRC officer Didier Revol wrote, [...] "Such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically {{because of the fact}} that the average Haitian and Haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily. The disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are; in the Haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question. For various reasons individuals <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> the truth on such a private matter. For some it is because 'it's none of your business', for others, they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them".|$|E

2500|$|Set {{just weeks}} after Rex's death, Andrew's first opening shot in Season 2 is to claim Bree is {{incapable}} of having murdered his father because [...] "it takes guts to kill somebody". He resents George Williams for dating Bree while Rex was still alive, and is very rude {{to him when he}} sees him with Bree. Andrew shaved his head after the 1st season. Bree blackmails Andrew with swim club subs into attending dinner with George. In response, Andrew imitates Bree's pleasure moan to provoke George, who tries to send him to his room but <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> Bree why, and she refuses to punish Andrew without a reason. George decides to get rid of Andrew by kissing his mother during his swim meet, which angers him so much that he jumps out of the pool and attacks George. That evening, Andrew packs his bags for Camp Hennessey a second time.|$|E
2500|$|From {{interviews}} with approximately two hundred families who followed Fard, Beynon concluded:Although the prophet lived in Detroit from July 4, 1930 until June 30, 1934, virtually nothing {{is known about}} him, save that he [...] "came from the East" [...] and that he [...] "called" [...] the Negroes of North America to enter the Nation of Islam. His very name is uncertain. He was known usually as Mr. Wali Farrad or Mr. W. D. Fard, though he used also the following names: Professor Ford, Mr. Farrad Mohammed, Mr. F. Mohammed Ali. One of the few survivors who heard his first addresses states that he himself said: [...] "My name is W.D. Fard and I came from the Holy City of Mecca. More about myself I <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> you yet, for the time has not yet come. I am your brother. You have not yet seen me in my royal robes."

2500|$|The {{incremental}} research techniques developed at IBM eventually became {{dominant in the}} field after DARPA, in the mid-80s, returned to NLP research and imposed that methodology to participating teams, shared common goals, data, and precise evaluation metrics. The Continuous Speech Recognition Group's research, which required large amounts of data to train the algorithms, {{eventually led to the}} creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium. In the 1980s, although the broader problem of speech recognition remained unsolved, they sought to apply the methods developed to other problems; machine translation and stock value prediction were both seen as options. A group of IBM researchers went on to work for Renaissance Technologies. Jelinek wrote, [...] "The performance of the Renaissance fund is legendary, but I have no idea whether any methods we pioneered at IBM have ever been used. My former colleagues <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> me: theirs is a very hush-hush operation!" [...] Methods very similar to those developed for achieving speech recognition are at the base of most machine translation systems in use today. Observers have said that Pierce's paradigm, according to which engineering achievements in this area would be built on scientific progress, has been inverted, with the achievements in engineering being at the base of a number of scientific findings.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, but they have no right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I bet I can tell you what everybody else is pitching you and it’s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed us about this production was {{the fact that we were}} presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface and how did the whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E
