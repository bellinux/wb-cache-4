Hanjour, al-Mihdhar, and Moqed were {{chosen by the}} Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System criteria, while the brothers Nawaf and Salem al-Hazmi <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> they did not provide adequate identification and were deemed suspicious by the airline check-in agent. Hanjour, Mihdhar, and Nawaf al-Hazmi did not check any bags for the flight. Checked bags belonging to Moqed and Salem al-Hazmi were held until they boarded the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Ouw Peh Tjoa was {{directed}} and produced by The Teng Chun for his company, Cino Motion Pictures. Since releasing Sam Pek Eng Tay in 1931, {{based on the}} legend of the Butterfly Lovers, The Teng Chun had released a series of films based on Chinese legends and folktales, including Pat Bie To (Eight Beautiful Women; 1932) and Pat Kiam Hiap (Eight Swordsmen; 1933). These stories <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> the peranakan Chinese in the Indies were unable to understand Mandarin and Cantonese imports from China, but wanted to see films based on Chinese mythology. Overall, The Teng Chun's films emphasised the martial art silat and were generally profitable, allowing him to dominate the industry.|$|E

5000|$|The organisers {{felt that}} the 2000 Tour de France hdd not {{included}} enough French teams and consequently changed the selection procedure. [...] <b>was</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> it included {{the winner of the}} previous edition, Lance Armstrong. [...] <b>was</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> it included the winner of the 2000 UCI Road World Cup, Erik Zabel). [...] <b>was</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> it won the team classifications in the 2000 Giro d'Italia. [...] <b>was</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> it won the team classifications in both the 2000 Tour de France and 2000 Vuelta a España. A further twelve teams qualified based on the UCI ranking in the highest UCI division at the end of 2001, after compensating for transfers. Although initially it was announced that four wildcards would be given, the tour organisation decided to add five teams: In total, 21 teams participated, each with 9 cyclists, giving a total of 189 cyclists.|$|R

50|$|Disgust <b>was</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> it <b>is</b> {{almost universally}} {{considered}} to be a basic emotion in the applicable literature. Fear <b>was</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> anxiety disorders, such as panic disorders or phobias are common, and they affect the life of many people. The participants reported on the intensity of the elicited emotions by rating experienced arousal. Only group two, the implementation intention participants, succeeded in reducing their disgust and fear reactions compared to the other two groups.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that patients with}} high CRP levels might benefit from use of statins. This {{is based on the}} JUPITER trial that found that elevated CRP levels without hyperlipidemia benefited. Statins <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> they have been proven to reduce levels of CRP. Studies comparing effect of various statins in hs-CRP revealed similar effects of different statins. A subsequent trial however failed to find that CRP was useful for determining statin benefit.|$|E
500|$|Composer Robin Thicke, then {{married to}} the film's costar Paula Patton, wrote and {{produced}} [...] "Push", the film's original main theme music. Later announcements confirmed that the song would be replaced by Mary J. Blige's [...] "I Can See In Color". Leona Lewis' song, [...] "Happy" [...] (from her album Echo) is featured in the film's trailer. Daniels stated that the artists featured on the film's soundtrack <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> they [...] "resonate not only in Precious's world, but speak to your soul {{no matter who you}} are." [...] Two other songs, performed decades earlier by Queen Latifah and Mahalia Jackson, were also chosen for the film's soundtrack. The soundtrack features LaBelle (Nona Hendryx, Sarah Dash, and Patti LaBelle), Donna Allen, Jean Carn, Sunny Gale, and MFSB.|$|E

500|$|Bull trout {{are one of}} the {{management}} indicator species for the forest. Population monitoring efforts are undertaken every year to provide an assessment of forest health. [...] They <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> they are dependent upon specific habitat conditions and are sensitive to habitat changes. Bull trout are only found in parts of the Salmon, Boise, and Payette river watersheds on the Fairfield District and the SNRA. The forest is home to the longest salmon migration in the continental United States, but with the damming of the Columbia River, salmon populations have collapsed. Redfish Lake was named for the sockeye salmon that would return to breed in the lake and its tributaries and historically had 10,000 to 35,000 adult fish return to the lake annually. Between 1990 and 1998 a total of 16 adult fish returned to Redfish Lake, but populations have recovered somewhat, and in 2014 approximately 1400 adult fish returned, up from 1100 in 2011. Repeated efforts to repopulate the sockeye salmon have taken place in the Columbia River watershed, and in 2008 the first salmon season in 31 years was held for chinook salmon in the upper Salmon River. Brook trout have been introduced to the forest and are now an invasive species that compete with the threatened bull trout. The Wood River sculpin is a fish species that is endemic to the Big Wood River and its tributaries on the Ketchum District and is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, and mountain whitefish are all native to portions of the forest waterways.|$|E

2500|$|On February 23, 1995, Mayor Rudy Giuliani {{proposed}} {{the sale of}} all 11 city hospitals operated by the Health and Hospitals Corporation. At this time, the city began accepting bids for sale of Queens Hospital, Elmhurst Hospital Center in western Queens, and Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn. These three hospitals <b>were</b> <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> they were the [...] "most marketable". A planned $485 million renovation of QHC was cancelled due to a financial crisis and the plans to sell the hospital. $25 million had already been spent by the city on preliminary designs by Henningson, Durham, and Richardson, Inc and Morrison-Knudsen. The plans to sell the hospital also prevented Queens Gateway Secondary School from being moved onto the campus. In March 1995, the pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing went on a hunger strike in protest of the proposed sales of the hospitals. Later that month, the pastor held a mock funeral outside Queens Hospital in protest. By September 1995, Giuliani and the city explored the possibility of leasing the three hospitals, with the Mount Sinai Health System planning to bid on Queens Hospital Center and Elmhurst Hospital Center. Meanwhile, {{a third of the}} Queens Hospital staff had left in the year leading up to fall 1995. The hospital also began charging uninsured patients for services such as prescriptions, which had previously been free of charge, in response to budgetary constraints.|$|E
