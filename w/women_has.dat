5|$|Non-fatal {{violence}} against <b>women</b> <b>has</b> severe implications for women’s physical, mental and reproductive health, and {{is seen as}} not simply isolated events but rather a systematic pattern of behaviour that both violates their rights but also limits their role in society and requires a systematic approach.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{increase}} in jobs for <b>women</b> <b>has</b> had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates about {{the conditions of the}} work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the maquila industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations. The mostly female workforce is often exploited by having unsafe working conditions, and stress is a major cause of many illnesses of these women.|$|E

5|$|The comic book's {{popularity}} with <b>women</b> <b>has</b> also {{been attributed to}} the strong female characters featured in the comic, such as Scarlett and Lady Jaye.

5|$|The kulintang is {{traditionally}} considered a women’s instrument by many groups: the Maguindanao, Maranao, Tausūg/Suluk, Samal, Badjao/Sama, Iranun, Kadazan, Murut, Bidayuh and Iban. Traditionally, the playing of the kulintang {{was associated with}} graceful, slow, frail and relaxed movements that showed elegance and decorum common among females. Nowadays, the traditional view of kulintang as strictly for <b>women</b> <b>has</b> waned as {{both women and men}} play all five instruments, with some of the more renowned kulintang players being men.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by <b>women</b> <b>has</b> come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E

5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married <b>women,</b> <b>has</b> changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} this debate often centers on a {{phenomenon}} named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this lesbian bed death. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women, or sexual contact between <b>women</b> <b>has</b> increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.|$|E

The goal {{of this study was}} to validate the risk of white and black women to breast cancer phenotypes, stratified by statuses of the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors...|$|R

5000|$|Since 1975, {{numerous}} other empirical {{studies have found}} evidence of gender symmetry. For example, in the United States, the National Comorbidity Study of 1990-1992 found 18.4% of men and 17.4% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced minor IPV, and 5.5% of men and 6.5% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced severe IPV. In England and Wales, the 1995 [...] "Home Office Research Study 191" [...] found that in the twelve {{months prior to the}} survey, 4.2% of both men and woman between the ages of 16 and 59 had been assaulted by an intimate. The Canadian General Social Survey of 2000 found that from 1994 to 1999, 4% of men and 4% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 22% of men and 28% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 7% of men and 8% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present.

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: <b>Women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> <b>Women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been an obscure group. Conclusion: The conclusion was that <b>women</b> who <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> <b>have</b> not been included in the STI information available on the internet within the county councils of Kalmar and Kronoberg...|$|R
