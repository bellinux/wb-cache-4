40|$|Though {{there have}} been {{numerous}} studies of freeway <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> (i. e., segments in which an on-ramp is followed by an off-ramp), there remains a significant lack of empirical and theoretical understanding of the traffic behavior that causes <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> to become bottlenecks with varying discharge flows. The present research entails empirical analysis and theoretical modeling of what triggered the bottleneck activations and discharge flow changes in two freeway <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> Both sites were recurrent bottlenecks during the rush, and investigations revealed that changes in the spatial patterns of vehicular lane-changes, especially among Freeway-to-Ramp (F-R) maneuvers, caused variations in bottleneck discharge flow. When the F-R maneuvers were concentrated near a weaving section’s on-ramp, they became more disruptive, resulting in bottleneck activations with diminished discharge flows. Findings further indicated that the spatial distributions of these lane changes, in turn, were dictated by the traffic conditions in the auxiliary lane (i. e., the lane connecting the off-ramp to the upstream on-ramp).

40|$|<b>Weaving</b> <b>sections</b> are {{frequently}} applied on Dutch freeways. Guidelines are present for designing those freeway <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> However, {{the origin of}} these guidelines is unclear {{and it is not}} always possible to apply the guidelines. Dutch road designers and road safety experts are searching for methods to evaluate the safety of a (proposed) design more quantitatively than is currently done by expert judgement. An alternative option would be to determine safety of Dutch <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> using VISSIM micro-simulation models in combination with the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). SSAM is able to calculate the number of conflicts that occurred in a micro-simulation model using the surrogate safety measures time-to-collision (TTC) and post-encroachment-time (PET). A conflict is an observable situation in which two or more road users approach each-other such that there is a risk of collision if their movement remains unchanged. The goal of this master thesis research is to assess whether this number of conflicts observed from VISSIM microsimulation models using SSAM is representing safety (crash rate) of Dutch <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> For that nine Dutch <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> were selected, and were ranked based on four criteria: (I) the crash rate from the BRON crash database, (II) the conflict rate (conflicts per number of vehicle kilometres) calculated from VISSIM micro-simulations using SSAM, (III) the expected number of crashes calculated using the crash prediction model developed by Iliadi et al. [29], and (IV) the judgement of road safety experts. The Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient was calculated between these rankings, to validate the ranking based on the conflict rate. For initial VISSIM and SSAM settings, a correlation of 0. 567 was found between the crash rate and conflict rate ranking, indicating a reasonable fit. However, due to the small sample size this correlation is not significant (-value is 0. 112). The effects of some micro-simulation settings, conflict analysis thresholds and the calibration method are assessed in a sensitivity analysis. Reducing the TTC threshold from 1. 5 seconds to 0. 5 seconds resulted improved the correlation between the conflict rate and the crash rate. However, changing other settings resulted in a weaker correlation. Although different than expected, extending the calibration process by adding calibration on speeds resulted in a weaker correlation. Hence care should be taken when using conflicts calculated by VISSIM and SSAM as (only) predictor for safety of Dutch <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> It is recommended to expand the selection of <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> to assess whether a larger sample results in a stronger, significant, correlation. Also, it can be assessed how a more extensive calibration of VISSIM parameters affects the correlation between the conflict rate and other measures. Furthermore, crash numbers might have more impact on policy makers and public perceptions than alternatives such as conflicts and surrogate safety measures.

40|$|AbstractThe traffic {{dynamics}} {{are very}} complex around the <b>weaving</b> <b>section,</b> {{which is a}} typical and primary bottleneck on urban expressway. Many simulation models have been established to investigate the dynamics and the operational capacity around the <b>weaving</b> <b>section.</b> However, those models mainly focus on the homogeneous condition, which {{is different from the}} real traffic condition. In fact, there are many slow vehicles, such as buses or trucks, with larger size and slower velocity. The mutual interference among different types of vehicles leads to much slower operational capacity comparison with that under homogeneous condition. This paper takes into account mixed traffic condition including small fast and large slow vehicles. The two kinds of vehicles are different in the maximum velocity and vehicle length. A cellular automata model is proposed to simulate the dynamics around the <b>weaving</b> <b>section.</b> Then the traffic dynamics and the operational capacity of <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> are investigated by analyzing simulation results. The influencing factors considered in the simulation include the proportion of large slow vehicle, and the inflow rate of weaving vehicle. The simulation results show that, the larger the proportion of large slow vehicle, the lower the operational capacity. And the traffic flow fluctuates stochastically with larger proportion of large slow vehicle. Such results are meaningful to understand the traffic flow evolution mechanism around <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> and helpful to design the traffic control methods...|$|E

A detailed literature review {{shows that a}} strong empirical understanding of the weaving mechanisms is still lacking.

40|$|Traffic {{simulation}} {{models have been}} {{proved to be more}} effective methods of dealing with <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> than traditional methods such as the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 1950 to HCM 2000, Leisch method - 1981 and Fazio - 1986. These have proved to be inadequate methods for weaving analysis (Cassidy and May, 1991, Ostrom et al., 1993, Vermijs and Schuurman, 1994, Lertworawanich and Elefteriadou, 2003, Zhang, 2005 and Lee, 2008). Recently, the HCM 2010 has been released with the same limitations as in previous versions even though there are some changes in some procedures. Then, it was found that not only were those mathematical methods inadequate for the analysis of weaving capacity but so were the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models (Zhang, 2005). The advantages of microscopic {{simulation models}} are capability of evaluating various traffic management alternatives {{in order to determine the}} optimum solution for any traffic scenario and provision of visualisation for the case under study. However, there are several shortcomings that have been reported through the literature such as computational performance, the accuracy of models in representing the traffic flow, and the difficulty of integration with advanced traffic management and traffic information systems (Skabardonis and May, 1998 and Hidas, 2005). Moreover, shortcomings were found in certain models, such as AIMSUN, relating to the cancellation of vehicles that could not reach their destinations because of their failure to achieve appropriate manoeuvres after waiting for a time known as maximum waiting time (TSS, 2002). To overcome these problems, a new model has been developed by this study for <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> The developed model includes different sub-models. Firstly, a car-following model which governs the longitudinal movement between the subject vehicle and its leader (Al-jameel, 2009 and 2010). Secondly, a lane changing model which controls the horizontal movement of the vehicle when changing lane. Thirdly, a gap acceptance model that governs the selection of suitable gaps for changing lane was also developed. Then, there were very limited data in the literature for calibrating and validating the developed model. Consequently, more than 50 hours of video recordings and several days of data collection from Motorway Incident Detection and Automated Signalling (MIDAS) data were collected. It is believed that this data is the most comprehensive collected looking at <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> (Al-jameel, 2011). Then, the developed model was calibrated with the field data in terms of the car-following model, the lane changing model, the gap acceptance model and the weaving simulation model. The results of calibration and validation of the developed model with field data show encouraging results that come very close to the reality according to the graphical and statistical tests. After developing, calibrating and validating the simulation model, the model is capable of representing reality. Therefore, it has been used to study different management scenarios such as using different speed limits and using what is called critical area, the lanes in which all weaving activities occur. The results of analysis show there is no significant effect of speed limits above 50 mph on the performance of <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> A 40 mph speed limit is not recommended because of its bad effect on the operational performance of <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> in terms of reducing speed and increasing delay along a weaving segment. On the other hand, it was found that the critical area principle applied by HCM 2010 negatively affected the performance of <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> especially under moderate to heavy flow because it prevents non-weaving vehicles from benefitting by increasing their speed in the other lanes of motorways...|$|R

Second, the HCM procedures fail to capture the impact of the distribution of weaving flows between freeway and on-ramp demand on the capacity of weaving sections, which is demonstrated to be an important factor in the analysis <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> capacities.

C, ETATS-UNIS, 12 -/ 01 / 2014 - 16 / 01 / 2014 An {{empirical}} {{analysis is}} conducted on lane changing behavior using a trajectory data set collected at a <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> in Grenoble (France). A detailed literature review shows that strong empirical {{understanding of the}} weaving mechanisms is still lacking. The goal is to investigate the lane changing behavior at a microscopic level. Data collection distinguished lane changes from the main road and those towards the main road. Descriptive empirical analysis examines {{the positions of the}} lane changes and the corresponding accepted gaps. Results show that under heavy congested traffic conditions the weaving vehicles tend to change lane as soon as possible after the start of the <b>weaving</b> <b>section.</b> When the traffic conditions are fluid, the weaving vehicles coming from the main road tend to change lane earlier than the weaving vehicles coming from the auxiliary lane. Moreover, weaving vehicles coming from the auxiliary lane accept smaller gaps and headways than the weaving vehicles coming from the main road. Our findings are questioning some results of previous works using micro-simulation to study weaving sections. As the weaving vehicles change lane {{at the beginning of the}} studied <b>weaving</b> <b>section,</b> our findings ask whether the length of the <b>weaving</b> <b>section</b> is a key variable to estimate its capacity. Our findings raise also some questions about the relevance of the gap acceptance theory to model lane changes at weaving sections. But further research are needed to asses these hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} algorithms for vision-based {{monitoring of}} weaving sections. These algorithms {{have been developed}} for the Minnesota Department of Transportation in order to acquire data for several weaving sections in the Twin Cities area. Unlike commercially available systems, the proposed algorithms can track and count vehicles as they change lanes. Furthermore, they provide the velocity and the direction of each vehicle in the <b>weaving</b> <b>section.</b> Experimental results from various weaving sections under various weather conditions are presented. The proposed methods are based on the establishment of correspondences among blobs and vehicles as the vehicles move through the <b>weaving</b> <b>section.</b> The blob tracking problem is formulated as a bipartite graph optimization problem...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new continuum model describing {{the dynamics of}} multiclass traffic flow on multilane freeways including <b>weaving</b> <b>sections.</b> In this paper, we consider a specific freeway weaving type, which is formed when an on ramp is near to an off ramp and these two ramps are joined by an auxiliary lane. Traffic interactions in this weaving zone are very complex due to the involvement of weaving flows and non-weaving flows in the so-called mandatory lane-changing process. To handle this complexity, {{it is essential to}} have a good understanding of the (microscopic) driving behavior within the weaving zones. These behaviors are modeled based on a gap-acceptance model. The methodology to obtain a weaving continuum traffic model is thus twofold. On the one hand, we develop a (macroscopic) model to determine the mandatory lane-changing probability based on a renewal process. On the other hand, we implement the lane-changing model into a current gas-kinetic traffic flow model for heterogeneous traffic flow on multilane roadways. From this, corresponding macroscopic model is obtained based on the method of moments...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a tool {{equipped}} in a vehicle for observing the lane-wise travel time and to analyze the lane-by-lane travel time using {{the data from the}} developed tool. For this purpose we developed a vehicle-attachable lane-wise traffic observing device, named TTMon which is capable of recording the vehicle trajectories as well as the video data of driving environment. Two probe vehicles equipped with TTMon drove the Gangbyun highway from Sungsan-bridge to Dongho-bridge keeping each lane, one for the median lane and the other for the center lane. With the vehicle trajectories and video data collected by TTMon, the lane-by-lane travel time feature was analyzed using TTMonAnalyzer specially developed for handling data from TTMon. The result shows that the space mean speed of the median lane is lower than the center lane because of the higher number of connected ramps on the median lane causing many conflicts in the <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> and also the travel time difference between lanes is inclined to increase as the congestion goes higher...|$|R
40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{discusses}} {{the safety of}} motorway tunnels in the Netherlands. Broadly speaking, it is not certain whether crashes in the Netherlands are relatively more frequent in tunnels than on open road stretches. However, there are certain factors that increase the risk in tunnels, such as {{the proximity of the}} tunnel wall, limited sight distance, merging or exit lanes in or near the tunnel and great differences in lighting at the entrance and exit. Road safety in tunnels can be improved by creating emergency lanes which increase the distance to the tunnel wall, by limiting the gradient percentage, thus minimizing speed differences (separate lanes for heavy traffic are an alternative), and creating wide layouts in horizontal bends where these cannot be avoided. In addition, tunnel entrances and exits must be carefully designed: the lighting must be of a high quality, and, if there are no emergency lanes, exit lanes and <b>weaving</b> <b>sections</b> should be avoided {{in the vicinity of the}} tunnel as well as inside the tunnel. Furthermore, tunnels should be equipped with high-quality outlet systems for fluids...|$|R
