5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} young chess {{players in the}} United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above-average IQ scores, but, within that group, the {{correlation}} between chess skill and IQ was moderately negative, meaning that smarter children tended to achieve {{a lower level of}} chess skill. This result <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.|$|E
5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> as due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> as being due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes III {{ascended the}} throne of Sparta in 236 BC or 235 BC, after deposing his father, Leonidas II. His {{accession}} to power ended a decade-long period of heightened conflict between the two royal families.

5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E

5000|$|Reschers {{proposal}} in [...] "The Price of an Ultimate Theory" [...] is to dualize {{the concept of}} explanation so that a fact can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> either derivationally, by the premises which lead to it, or systemically, by the consequences which follow from it. With derivational explanation, a fact t <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> when it <b>is</b> subsumed by some prior, more fundamental fact t. With systemic explanation, t <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> when it <b>is</b> a [...] "best fit" [...] for its consequences, where fitness is measured by uniformity, simplicity, connectedness, and other criteria conducive to systemic integration. Rescher concludes that while a theory of everything cannot <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> derivationally (since no deeper explanation can subsume it), it can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> systemically by its capacity to integrate its consequences.|$|R

5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> in the storyline as {{the result}} of Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate.

5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
5|$|Chakotay's backstory <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> {{during the}} course of Star Trek: Voyager. He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the demilitarized zone. While young, he was looked after by his grandfather. At the age of 15, Chakotay visited Earth with his father, who sought to find his tribe's ancestral home in Central America and the {{descendants}} of the Rubber Tree People. He was resistant to this, and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly, a pioneering astronaut in the early 21st century. He chose to enter Starfleet Academy against his father's wishes, and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu. He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to 2348, where he engaged in the sport of boxing. After graduating, he was assigned to a starship. One of his earliest away missions resulted in a diplomatic incident on Ktaria VII, and he was also on the team that made first contact with the Tarkannans.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence <b>was</b> <b>explained</b> by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E
