5|$|By 210, Severus' campaigning {{had made}} {{significant}} gains, but his campaign {{was cut short}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> fatally ill, dying at Eboracum in 211. Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again: they soon withdrew south permanently to Hadrian's Wall.|$|E

5|$|After World War II (Great Patriotic War), Molotov was {{involved}} in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to Andrei Vyshinsky. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov {{in a speech to}} the 19th Party Congress. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|Alan Hugh Dale (born 6 May 1947) is a New Zealander actor. As a child, Dale {{developed}} {{a love of}} theatre and also became a rugby player. After retiring from the sport, he took {{on a number of}} professions to support his family, before deciding to become a professional actor at age 27. With work limited in New Zealand, Dale moved to Australia, where he played Dr. John Forrest in The Young Doctors from 1979 to 1982. He later appeared as Jim Robinson in Neighbours, a part he played from 1985 until 1993. He left the series <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> out with the producers over the pay he {{and the rest of the}} cast received.|$|E

Later in the year during the tour of the West Indies he, along with four other teammates, was found guilty of smoking marijuana.|$|R
50|$|O'Dea was {{a defender}} who usually played across half back. He {{is known for}} an infamous {{incident}} which {{took place at the}} Moorabbin Oval during Round 14 of the 1972 season <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>felled</b> Collingwood player John Greening behind play. Greening suffered horrendous injuries and was lucky not to die as a result, and O'Dea was lucky not to be suspended for more than just ten weeks.|$|R
5|$|Alcoholism {{and poor}} health afflicted Clark during his final years. In 1809 he {{suffered}} a severe stroke. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> into an operating fireplace, Clark suffered a burn on his right leg that was so severe {{it had to be}} amputated. The injury made it impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13km) from the growing town of Louisville, and {{became a member of the}} household of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.|$|E
5|$|As {{territorial}} {{governor of}} Montana, Leslie quickly drew {{the ire of}} the press for his pro-temperance position. The territory's political machinery also turned against him, and he was removed from office by President Benjamin Harrison. When Grover Cleveland succeeded Harrison {{for a second term}} in office, he appointed Leslie district attorney for Montana. Leslie continued to practice law well into his eighties, and was being considered for a district court judgeship in Montana <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> ill with pneumonia and died on February 7, 1907, at the age of 87.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the 1928â€“29 tour, Chapman did {{not return}} to England until July, midway through the cricket season; Jack White and Arthur Carr captained England in his absence. Chapman resumed playing for Kent shortly after his return home but {{appeared}} in only seven matches, with a top-score of 28. His season was curtailed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> awkwardly while fielding in a match against Sussex at the beginning of August. He also missed the two MCC tours that winter to New Zealand and West Indies, neither of which involved a full-strength team.|$|E

5|$|In 2092, {{humanity}} has conquered mortality {{through the}} endless renewal of cells. The world watches in fascination as the 118-year-old Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth, edges towards death. Curious {{to know of}} life before quasi-immortality, they interview Nemo. Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to help Nemo recall some of his memories, while Nemo relates other memories to a journalist. As he is prodded, Nemo makes contradictory statements. He recounts his life at three primary points: at age 9, when his parents divorced, at age 15 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> in love, and at age 34 as an adult. All three unfold into their many possible outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Isaac D'Israeli {{had never}} taken {{religion}} very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend Sharon Turner, a solicitor, convinced him that although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.|$|E
5|$|Loring never enjoyed perfect health, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> ill in Chicago {{and moved}} on doctor's advice to Minneapolis, his friend Loren Fletcher helped him become manager of the supply store for Dorilus Morrison's lumber business. Loring and Emily S. Crosman married in 1855. They had one daughter, Eva Maria, and one son, Albert C. Loring who managed {{businesses}} for his father. Emily Loring died on March 13, 1894.

5|$|The {{first known}} death {{directly}} related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the Whitby Dunlops, a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's Major League Hockey, died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> to the ice, he hit his head. His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics. In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraftâ€”fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Mothsâ€”were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; {{neither he nor his}} student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E
5|$|Albert Benjamin Chandler {{was born}} in the farming {{community}} of Corydon, Kentucky in 1898. He was the eldest child of Joseph Sephus and Callie (Saunders) Chandler. Chandler's father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was fifteen, though no record of their marriage has ever been found. In 1899, Chandler's brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father. In his autobiography, Chandler said his mother leaving them was his earliest memory. Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in Jacksonville, Florida. She had married again and he had three half-siblings. His full brother, Robert Chandler, died <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> from a cherry tree when he was 13 years old.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Ben showed a {{developed}} vocabulary. In 1860, {{he was sent}} to Bethany, a boarding school in Edgefield where he became a star student, and he remained there after the American Civil War began. In 1863, he came home for a year to help his mother pay off debts. He returned to Bethany in 1864, intending a final year of study prior to entering the South Carolina College (today, the University of South Carolina). The South's desperate need for soldiers ended this plan, and in June 1864, still not yet 17, he withdrew from the academy, making arrangements to join a coastal artillery unit. These plans were scuttled as well <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> ill at home. A cranial tumor led to the removal of his left eye, and it was not until 1866, months after Confederate forces had disbanded, that Ben Tillman was again healthy.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 2012 the Czech {{police arrested}} Randy Blythe {{for his actions}} during a 2010 concert in Prague. Blythe was charged, in the Prague 8 {{district}} court, with committing intentional bodily harm after an incident in which a 19-year-old fan climbed up onto the stage with him. Blythe pushed the teen who then hit {{his head on the}} floor <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> and later died of the injury. Lamb of God canceled their upcoming tour but resumed touring 38 days later when Blythe was released on bail. Blythe was indicted on the charges in December 2012. According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage and had moral responsibility for the fan's death but he was not criminally liable. The decision was appealed, and upheld by the Prague High Court in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a rowing boat trying to pass underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E
50|$|LoPresti was {{climbing}} a ladder to clear leaves from his house's rain gutter <b>when</b> <b>he</b> slipped and <b>fell.</b> <b>He</b> died 35 days later (7 August 2002) {{of complications from}} the fall.|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} Andy Dibble at the Racecourse Ground in 2002 saw Rogers lose {{his place in}} the side and he found himself {{transfer}} listed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> also <b>fell</b> behind Paul Whitfield, which later lead to his departure from the club in May 2003.|$|R
