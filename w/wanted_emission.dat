40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{differences between}} developed countries {{as to how}} difficult {{it will be to}} meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. ‘High-cost abatement countries’ are particularly interesting as they can be seen as ‘test-cases’ for other nations in more ambitious climate policy agreements. We assume that a country’s objective is to develop an efficient climate policy, achieving cost effectiveness and environmental effectiveness, and that also is politically feasible. Norway is among the countries that will have a hard time in meeting their obligations. Our study suggests that Norway’s climate policy has emphasized an international approach, whereas the domestic performance on cost effectiveness has been more moderate. An obvious reason for this is the lower cost associated with the international approach. A ‘political cost’ associated with such a policy can be criticism from environmental NGOs and other countries. At least in the near term there is little reason to expect ‘climate enthusiasm’ from the public or many countries of the world. Therefore, just like Norway, they will <b>want</b> <b>emissions</b> reductions carried out as cheaply as possible, which could imply extensive international quota trading, whereas compromises with regard to cost effectiveness are struck at the domestic scene for political feasibility reasons...|$|R
5000|$|On 7November 2016, over 40 German companies, {{including}} energy suppliers EnBW and MVV Energie {{and network}} operator 50Hertz, together with Commerzbank, Deutsche Telekom, IKEA, and Hochtief, are lobbying {{for a more}} ambitious program, one which ensures that Germany's Paris Agreement commitments are met. The companies <b>want</b> sector-specific <b>emissions</b> targets for 2030 and state that [...] "only in this way can new business models and concrete plans for decarbonisation be developed". They want the goal to be the [...] "rapid switch to 100% renewable energy". British economist Nicholas Stern also backs a more ambitious plan.

5000|$|Some {{or all of}} the fee is {{returned}} to households as an energy dividend. Returning 100% of net fees results in a revenue-neutral carbon fee-and-dividend system; this revenue neutrality often appeals to conservatives, such as former Secretary of State George Shultz, who <b>want</b> to reduce <b>emissions</b> without increasing the size and funding of the federal government.|$|R

50|$|In 1993, Jonathan created Suntera, The Solar Electric Chariot Company, Inc. with a mind {{to design}} {{affordable}} solar-electric hybrid cars and trucks for commuters based on the designs he had created for vehicles for use on his own property - a solar powered pickup, tractor, lawnmower, etc. He hoped to create cars from low-maintenance materials and with fewer parts to avoid costly manufacturing and maintenance. Additionally, he <b>wanted</b> to reduce <b>emissions</b> that pollute the environment, arguing that even if his cars ran on batteries charged by electricity, the generators of the electrical power run cleaner than millions of individual gas-burning automobiles. To that end, he designed and built the SunRay Solar Neighborhood Electric Vehicle.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of future}} policy-makers substantially influences future greenhouse gas emissions. Uncertainty about {{the motives of}} future policy-makers may thus strongly influence the climate policy strategies of current policy-makers. Analytical and numerical analyses in this paper confirm this hypothesis. If current policy-makers <b>want</b> to constrain <b>emissions</b> accumulated over a prolonged period of time, and if future policy-makers tend, with a certain chance, to a less ambitious climate policy, then current policy-makers should intensify their efforts to reduce emissions {{and the cost of}} emission reduction. In this setting, if current policy-makers want to meet a cumulative emission contraint in expectation, then the preferred policy trajectory does not qualitatively deviate from one suggested by a standard cost-effective trajectory. If, however, the constraint is to be met with a certain probability, then the importance of early action is enhanced relative to that of postponed action. Costs substantially increase if current policy-makers want to set long-term goals without the full cooperation of future policy-makers...|$|R

40|$|Citizens well {{informed}} {{about climate change}} make for better polling, argue Alison Atherton and Rebecca Short WORLD WIDE Views on Global Warming Australia {{was part of a}} global citizen deliberation project of the same name. It {{was the first time the}} deliberative method has been used on a global scale. Participants had the chance to access balanced information materials based on up to date science, discuss the issues with each other and, through this hear from a range of competing stakeholders, to help them shape their overall opinions before voting. The aim is to reflect a more considered public view, with one group facilitator describing the ‘eagerness to understand and then to respond and… come up with the best response possible’. About deliberations Citizen deliberation is a tool that has been used regularly by the Danish government (who instigated the World Wide Views event), to learn how citizens feel on a range of issues and what policy makers should do next. It has been valuable in influencing Danish policy, and this project was created to provide useful data for climate negotiators at the United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen in December.   Citizen deliberations have been used successfully in many countries around the world. In Australia, these kinds of processes have been used in discussions over the Australian Republic and on climate change, for example the Green Cross National People’s Assembly on Climate Change. There are clear benefits to making citizen deliberation a regular feature of Australian democracy. World Wide Views proved that Australians are motivated to discuss important issues in an appropriate forum. It can provide policy makers with a direct link to the public and in-depth advice on policy options.   Citizen deliberation does not seek to favour one side or another on an issue; instead the focus is on fostering genuine dialogue between ordinary people, based on access to good information.   Is it just another poll? The citizens’ collated views are emphatically in support of strong climate action.   For example, the support for Australia to join a global deal to curb climate change was 94 %.   89 % supported emissions cuts of 25 % or higher by 2020 for developed countries including Australia. In comparison, the Australian Greens Party released a Galaxy poll on November 15 saying that 54 % of Australians surveyed <b>wanted</b> absolute <b>emissions</b> cuts of 25 % or higher. Recent Pew Centre and Lowy Institute polls imply that interest in climate change is waning. An explanation of the differences between deliberative processes and polling does not lend itself well to pithy media soundbites. In general terms though, a deliberative process provides a much more informed and in-depth view of public opinion than a snapshot poll result. It reflects ordinary people’s views once they’ve had a chance to think over the issues and test their opinions against others.   Through one-on-one briefings with politicians and advisors, and through a short documentary, the Institute for Sustainable Futures is endeavouring to communicate what has been done and what it means on the world stage.   Something that isn’t explicitly built into the process but is often an outcome is the impact on participants’ everyday lives. Participants who were previously ambivalent on the issue can experience personal changes in their views that result in them becoming advocates. As well as the formal voting and other procedures built into the process, World Wide Views captured people’s informal feedback in surveys, on video, and when they were interviewed by their local media. Many said that they had heard about climate change, but didn’t really know what to think, or what the right course of action was. After the event they were more confident in articulating the issues and the possible solutions. One Vietnam Veteran in his 60 s, who said he was a ‘fence sitter’ before attending, now believes “"We are destroying the planet. Scientific results displayed at the event proved global warming was happening," Some did their own press release, several were interviewed by their local paper, and told us that they since fielded comments and questions, mostly supportive, in their community.   One of the participants, with a strong sense of personal spirituality, is speaking on his experience to a group of HSC religious studies students, at an inter-faith seminar. For issues like climate change, which so often remain the province of politicians, experts and policy makers, processes like World Wide Views democratise knowledge and decision-making. Right now, with Copenhagen so close, interest and awareness is being raised through forums all over Australia, like GetUp, 350. org, and others.   World Wide Views however, did not attract people through their passion on climate change or community activism. Instead it randomly selected totally un-connected members of the public and invited them to take part, forming a “mini public”. The final report for the Australian event has just been released and provides detailed facts and stats on how Australians voted and how this compared to the rest of the world.   • Alison Atherton and Rebecca Short are working on the World Wide Views on Global Warming project in Australia  ...|$|R
40|$|Just {{like the}} blind {{men in the}} popular story of perceiving the elephant, the three major {{constituencies}} participating in the energy debate have greatly different perceptions of the problem. The constituency that is worried about climate change believes the energy problem is caused by profligate use of fossil fuel that has dramatically changed our atmosphere. The energy security group sees dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil increasingly held by countries hostile to the US. The economic vitality group sees high energy prices and their effect {{on the economy and}} our life-style. Just like the blind men, each of the three constituencies perceives a different problem. And just as with the blind men, while each perspective is right as a piece of the elephant, it takes all the perspectives together to actually solve the problem. Environmentalists focus on solutions responding to the scientific consensus that greenhouse gases are creating rapid climate change. The tipping point has come: it is now a consensus position among scientists the global warming is being affected by anthropogenic activity to 90 % certainty according to the last IPCC report. Although they still struggle with the prediction of how much global temperatures will rise if we do nothing [...] is it 5 deg or 10 under BAU? This group believes that we cannot afford to take a chance because we get only one chance. We can not afford {{to do this kind of}} experiment with the Earth. Any choice which decreases our CO{sub 2 } footprint is favored, even if it means a decrease in standard of living. The energy security constituency sees the geo-politics of oil becoming increasingly dire. They look at oil money being used to fund anti-American activities of groups such as the Wahabis in Saudi Arabia, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the infamous Al Qaeda. They quip that the Iraq war is the first war where we are paying for both sides. They note Iran and the Shia throughout the Middle East seeing the possibility of controlling 2 / 3 of the world's oil. They see oil and gas being used by Russia to exert political power using the gas tap and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela clearly anti-American and now a virtual dictator who controls 15 % of our oil imports. Conflicts in Nigeria over oil wealth and corruption affected our oil supply. Countries such as China are at best unwilling to join political action against countries such as Sudan that supply them oil, and at worst, selling them arms in order to cement their relationships with respect to importing oil. This security constituency favors ending our vulnerability by ending our ''addiction to foreign oil''. This group thinks that there is no domestic source of energy that is bad. They will be happy to see our corn turned into ethanol; our coal turned into liquid fuel for transportation. No matter that the price of tortillas doubles in Mexico, we expand corn farming at the expense of the environment, our tanks and pipes in gas stations corrode and leak, or we make liquid fuel from coal, thus increasing the carbon footprint by 30 % per unit of energy. The economic vitality group sees increasing international demand for oil occurring simultaneously with a peaking supply of light sweet crude. They see an oil market where higher prices drive more production of oil which is heavier and more sour (supply follows demand). However, fast growth in world-wide demand increases even faster and prices will go up. For example, China adds 10, 000 cars per month, and there is an uncanny correlation between the price of oil and the amount of oil imported by China. The security contingent also worries about reliability of supply as affected by pipeline leaks in Alaska or hurricanes or potential terrorism. This constituency thinks the problem is one of capacity and favors solutions that will increase oil production, reservoirs, pipelines and refineries. They believe that the energy system will be determined by the market and want solutions that favor investment in capacity. What the environmentalists don't seem to get is climate change by itself will fail to gather broad enough support to achieve the environmentalists goals. People will not likely choose to shiver in the dark for a climate problem which is intangible to them. Where environmentalists have been successful they have built coalitions with other constituencies. As an example, the renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS) in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas etc. are supported by people who <b>want</b> to lower <b>emissions</b> to protect air quality, or protect the state from energy supply crises or promote economic development within the boundaries of the state. The adoption of an RPS addresses a coalition of interests. In Nevada, there was an effort to change the RPS to a low-carbon portfolio standard. The effort failed because those who were interested in economic development or energy security in the state saw no benefit...|$|R
40|$|The Coalition 2 ̆ 7 s Direct Action Policy seems {{designed}} to fail, argues Matt Grudnoff. Last week Tony Abbott branded the Government’s target {{to reduce emissions}} by five per cent by 2020 as ‘crazy’, but the crazy {{thing is that the}} Coalition has the same target. Was this just Mr Abbott getting over excited in his attacks on the Government? A slip of the tongue similar to when he told us climate change was ‘crap’? Surely the Opposition Leader is being sincere in <b>wanting</b> to cut <b>emissions?</b> He even has a way of achieving it; the Coalition’s grandly named Direct Action Plan. But what is the Direct Action Plan? The Direct Action Plan is a competitive grant program where businesses and farmers would submit proposals to the government on how they would reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and how much it would cost. Those proposals that cost the least would then be chosen by bureaucrats and taxpayers’ money would be used to fund them. They would keep funding projects until they reached the emissions reduction target. The Coalition has set aside 10. 5 billion out to 2020 to fund the projects. The two big questions are will this be enough money and will it reduce emissions by enough? The good news is we have a large source of information on competitive grant programs that have tried to reduce greenhouse gas emissions {{in the same way as}} the Coalition is proposing. In fact over the past 10 years or so, governments in Australia have allocated over 7 billion to such programs. The bad news is that analysis of these competitive grant programs by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) and the Grattan Institute has found that they have performed very poorly. They found that they take far longer to achieve much less emission reductions than is planned at a much bigger cost than has been budgeted for. How much longer? The ANAO found that delays of two years were not uncommon. How much less emissions? The Grattan Institute found that even after 10 years, on average they had only found projects for 18 per cent of their funds. How much more expensive? The Grattan Institute estimates that to achieve the five per cent target would require allocating not 10. 5 billion, as the Coalition has predicted, but rather 100 billion. That’s an average of 11. 1 billion per year over the next nine years or around 1300 per household per year. So the Coalition’s Direct Action Plan will be unable to reduce emissions by enough and the emissions they will reduce will cost around 140 per tonne of CO 2 e compared with a carbon tax starting at 23 per tonne with the revenue being paid back in compensation and other climate change policies. If the Coalition were to introduce their Direct Action Plan it is unlikely that there would be enough funds available to meet the emissions reduction target. When this happens the Coalition would have two choices. They could increase the money allocated to the plan and potentially blow its budget out to more than 11 billion a year. The second option is they could continue allocating 1. 2 billion per year and not meet their emissions reduction target. If they choose this option then, rather than emissions falling by five per cent, emissions would instead rise by 22 per cent. Which of the two options would the Coalition chose? We don’t know for sure but perhaps Malcolm Turnbull gave us some insight when he appeared on the ABC’s Lateline on the 18 th May. In reference to the Coalition’s policy he said: “it can be easily terminated. If in fact climate change is proved to be not real, which some people obviously believe - I don 2 ̆ 7 t. If you believe climate change is going to be proved to be unreal, then a scheme like that can be brought to an end. ” So why does the party that’s supposed to love free markets reject a market based solution in favour of a program of big government spending administered by an army of bureaucrats that has a track record of failing? Malcolm Turnbull gave us the best answer we have heard so far. The Coalition’s Direct Action Plan is actually a policy that is {{designed to}} waste a lot of money, fail and then to be terminated. A policy from a party whose leader is on the record as saying climate change is ‘crap’. Rather than being honest with the Australian people and telling them that the Coalition does not believe in climate change they put up a fig leaf policy that has no chance of success. It might be good politics to keep sniffing the wind, reading the audience and changing your opinion, but it is bad policy. If the Coalition wants to give Australian business certainty then they need their current leader to stake out some principles and stand by them.
