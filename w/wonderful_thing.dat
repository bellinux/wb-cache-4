500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the love triangle was [...] "very important" [...] to Weingartner, who was once part of such a relationship. Although the actors were uncertain at first that Peter could forgive Jan and Jule's betrayal, Weingartner uses the situation to explore his concept of friendship: [...] "Friendship means more to him than bourgeois moral values. Peter loves Jule – he doesn't own her. He can tell that when she {{falls in love with}} Jan, their love is a <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> coloured by a joint rebellion – a shared rejection of social constraint." ...|$|E

Carradine said he even sold his Kung Fu residuals to raise money for his own projects, and consequently gone into debt. [...] He also sought advice from directors he had worked with, including Martin Scorsese and Ingmar Bergman. [...] "The <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> about working with good directors, Carradine admitted, is it gives me the opportunity to pick their brains for my own films."

500|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} received well by critics. Jesus Freak Hideout editor John DiBiase {{called it a}} [...] "powerful anthem" [...] {{and said that the}} opening track was [...] "merely the tip of the iceberg" [...] for the album's quality among the other tracks. Bob Felberg of The Phantom Tollbooth was favorable towards the song, saying, [...] "'Unbreakable'...is one of the strongest Christian rock songs in a long time, both in music and lyrics", and that it featured [...] "a slinky-like guitar and strings interacting before slamming rhythms blow your hair straight back". In response to [...] "Unbreakable" [...] being featured on NBC's Bionic Woman, The Phantom Tollbooth's second reviewer Bert Saraco said, [...] "Mainstream attention is a <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> of course, but often signals a necessarily generic element to a project that sometimes sends out danger signals as to its artistic or creative potential." [...] Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms magazine said that the song was [...] "excellent".|$|E

[...] In promotion of the project, Fiona Reynolds, the Director-General of the National Trust, stated: [...] "We want this day to have its own place in history and be a snapshot of everyday life {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century." [...] Journalist John Plunkett expressed scepticism of this aim, writing in The Guardian that, despite the intentions of the campaign, it was only going to be [...] "a historical record of people with computers". He was also critical of History Matters in general, saying that he had [...] "no idea how history [...] going to impact on [...] ". Dave Hill, also writing for The Guardian, described the campaign as a [...] "brilliant idea".

500|$|The {{original}} {{creators of}} Angel Beats!, Jun Maeda and Na-Ga of Key, were interviewed in the July 2009 issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine. Around the time Key completed the first release of their sixth visual novel Little Busters!, Hironori Toba of Aniplex (himself {{a fan of}} Key's works) approached Maeda around October 2007 about collaborating to produce an original anime series. Maeda began meeting with Toba and Aniplex {{on a monthly basis}} and the story started to gradually progress. Aniplex wanted Maeda to write a screenplay that would be very [...] "Key-like, with touching moments of laughter and tears," [...] but initially Maeda found himself at a loss to write a story more amusing than Little Busters!, because he thought that he had reached a limit with Little Busters! in regards to a [...] "Key-like story". However, one day Maeda was struck by inspiration, where he thought up the initial idea of a story set in the afterlife. Furthermore, with everyone already dead, Maeda conceived of flashy battles where the combatants go all out without fear of death. According to Maeda, the theme of the series is [...] "life", which in Angel Beats! is depicted as a precious and <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing,</b> despite the characters in Angel Beats! who fight against their fate.|$|E
500|$|The work at Siding Spring was rewarding, but {{it could}} also be dangerous. During construction, Gascoigne {{constantly}} warned colleagues to take care on the elevated catwalks around the telescope. However, Gascoigne himself was almost killed when, while working one night around the telescope structure, he fell seven metres {{to the floor of the}} observatory, narrowly missing [...] "a massive steel structure with long protruding bolts". He survived, and was the first to take a photograph using the telescope, on 26 or 27 April 1974. Gascoigne was so pleased with the quality of the optics that he said he wanted a number describing the hyperboloid shape of the mirror (1.1717) engraved on his headstone. The site quickly became one of the world's most important astronomical observatories and was for many years home to world-leading astrophotographer David Malin. The successes of the AAT have been documented in annual reports by its Board, while a 2008 analysis of the relative impacts of astronomical observing facilities placed the AAT in the top three, coming after only the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the W. M. Keck Observatory (both telescopes built more than two decades later). For Gascoigne, it was [...] "a <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> to be associated with – the high point in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The <b>wonderful</b> <b>thing</b> about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
