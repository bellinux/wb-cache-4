5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, Wheeler and three of his {{batteries}} were assigned to fight against German and Italian forces in the North African Campaign. In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, {{they were forced to}} travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake. There, Wheeler took a brief leave of absence to travel to Jerusalem, where he visited Petrie on his hospital deathbed. Back in Egypt, he gained permission to fly as a front gunner in a Wellington bomber on a bombing raid against Axis forces, to better understand <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> aircrew to be fired on by an anti-aircraft battery.|$|E
25|$|The Marshall's film, now {{considered}} by many to be among the top ten baseball-themed films ever made, prompted the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum to host in 2003 a 15th Anniversary Reunion of the AAGPBL induction, in order to honor the actual women who played the game and inspired it. English attended to the event, between many others. She described her career to a very attentive audience of nearly 200 people, and said <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> the Belles to win two AAGPBL championship series in 1943 and 1946. She fondly recalled her whopping salaries that were considered good money in those days. Finally, she recalled the impact that the women had on the national pastime and the nation as a whole during those perilous times. The same year, the town of Everett dedicated her the Madeline English School, a pre-kindergarten to eighth grade school.|$|E

Digital Spy's Daniel Sperling noted that Rainford sang a [...] "pimped-up version" [...] of the song which he called [...] "incredible". A writer of BBC Online described her rendition as [...] "moving". On May 28, 2012, Fatai Veamatahau sang [...] "Ave Maria" [...] on The Voice (Australia). Simon Holt of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that [...] "she has a voice which brought tears to many eyes", including coach and mentor Seal's. Coach Joel Madden said: [...] "I have to be respectful. That was a very spiritual performance. I'm not sure <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> people at home, but that felt electric in here". A reviewer for Take 40 Australia called it a [...] "rousing version". Veamatahau's version peaked at number 25 on the Australian Singles Chart for the week of June 10, 2012.|$|E

40|$|A {{widespread}} assumption {{in current}} philosophy of {{mind is that}} a conscious state’s phenomenal properties vary with its representational contents. In this paper, I present (rather dogmatically) an alternative picture that recognizes two kinds of phenomenal properties that do not vary concomitantly with content. First, it admits phenomenal properties that vary rather with attitude: <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> {{for me to see}} rain is phenomenally different from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to remember (indistinguishable) rain, which is different again form <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to visualize (indistinguishable) rain – where these differences cannot be traced back to variations in content. Secondly, {{there is a kind of}} phenomenal property that varies neither with content nor with attitude but is altogether invariant across all conscious states: a substantive phenomenal commonality among <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to see, remember, and visualize rain, cats, or dogs. This substantive commonality, I will suggest, is the for-me-ness component of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for me to have any of these experiences. I will close by discussing the interrelations among these three concentric layers of phenomenality: content-based, attitude-based, and for-me-ness...|$|R

How can one describe <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a particular entity, without actually being it yourself? Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can we ever know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> another self? For that matter, what can we know about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> ourselves?

The release was part of EMWMusic's celebrations for Shankar's 90th birthday. Shankar said of his reasons for reissuing the film: [...] "It was a very special period of my life.

60|$|No. It {{was none}} of these, the salmon stream at Harthover. It was such a stream as you see in dear old Bewick; Bewick, who was born and bred upon them. A full hundred yards broad it was, sliding on from broad pool to broad shallow, and broad shallow to broad pool, over great fields of shingle, under oak and ash coverts, past low cliffs of sandstone, past green meadows, and fair parks, and a great house of gray stone, and brown moors above, and here and there against the sky the smoking chimney of a colliery. You must look at Bewick to see just <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>for</b> he has drawn it a hundred times with the care {{and the love of}} a true north countryman; and, even if you do not care about the salmon river, you ought, like all good boys, to know your Bewick.|$|E
