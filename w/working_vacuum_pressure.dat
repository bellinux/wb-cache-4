The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a statistical model with a design of experiment (DOE) methodology and use dimensionless number to evaluate and understand the influence of the height of refrigerant liquid and secondary fluid inlet temperature on cooling capacity of a compact pate-type evaporator for sorption systems <b>working</b> near <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure.</b> For this purpose, an experimental campaign was conducted on a small adsorption test bench using 13 X/water as working couple. Cooling capacities from 640 to 2000  W were measured. The DOE is a Doelhert type with two parameters: the inlet secondary fluid temperature (from 10 to 21 °C) and the filing level of refrigerant in the evaporator (from 6 to 24  cm). Thanks to the exploitation of the mathematical model obtained, optimal points under different constraints were found. A maximum cooling capacity of 2021 +/− 75  W in the entire experimental field was predicted for a secondary fluid inlet temperature of 25 °C and a height of liquid level of 19. 2  cm. Bond number and modified Jacob number per the ratio Psat/Ptriple were analyzed. The dimensionless numbers are correlated to the cooling capacity as a first step for designing compact plate-type evaporator for adsorption systems using water as refrigerant...|$|R

The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of both methods and the techniques for preventing vacuum leakage through a middle sand layer in a deposit, as well as the method for maintaining <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> when large settlement occurs, have been described. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> is an isotropic consolidation pressure applied to a soil deposit, and the deformation induced is different from that induced by a surcharge (e. g. the weight of an embankment).

In this paper, the thermal steady-state equilibrium method was used to test the receivers’ heat-loss. The receivers with increasing emittance were tested to study the variation of heat-loss. Meanwhile, the variable <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> in the annulus that affects the efficiency of the system was investigated. The influence of vacuumizing rate and getters on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> and heat-loss were discussed.

It is important in improving the thermal insulation to investigate the impact of factors that insulate the effects and thermal properties of the pipeline. The thermal insulation of this pipeline comprises the vacuum layer and the insulating material layer. Experiments were performed to measure the combined heat transfer and equivalent thermal conductivities of the insulating material in the vacuum and rarefied air employed in the pipeline's insulation. The thermal properties {{of this type of}} insulation at <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures</b> of 0. 5 ~ 1013 mbar, employing thermal media temperatures of 343 ~ 573 K and with different thicknesses of vacuum layer, are discussed for this pipeline, for which diameters of inner steel pipe/steel jacket are DN 50 /DN 250, DN 100 /DN 300, DN 200 /DN 500 and DN 500 /DN 850, respectively.

The equivalent thermal conductivity of the insulating material layer is distinctively lower than the vacuum layer, but decreasing the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> improves the insulating effect of vacuum layer substantially more than insulating the material layer. As the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases from 1013 mbar (atmospheric pressure) to 10 mbar at the thermal media temperature of 523 K e. g., the reduction of equivalent thermal conductivities of vacuum layer is approximately three times greater than that of insulating material layer.
