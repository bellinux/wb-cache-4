5|$|In the mid-ninth century BC, Egypt made {{a failed}} attempt to once more gain a {{foothold}} in <b>Western</b> <b>Asia.</b> Osorkon II of Egypt, along with a large alliance of nations and peoples, including Persia, Israel, Hamath, Phoenicia/Canaan, the Arabs, Arameans, and neo Hittites among others, engaged in the Battle of Karkar against the powerful Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in 853BC. However, this coalition of powers failed and the Neo Assyrian Empire continued to dominate <b>Western</b> <b>Asia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{originally}} described by Micheli from Italy.

The black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse also occur in Spain, Portugal and southern France.

5|$|The {{hooded crow}} breeds in {{northern}} and eastern Europe, and closely allied forms inhabit southern Europe and <b>western</b> <b>Asia.</b> Where its range overlaps with carrion crow, as in northern Britain, Germany, Denmark, northern Italy, and Siberia, their hybrids are fertile. However, the hybrids are less well-adapted than purebred birds, {{and this is}} one of the reasons this species was split from the carrion crow. Little or no interbreeding occurs in some areas, such as Iran and central Russia.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{dromedary}} probably {{evolved in}} the hotter, arid regions of <b>western</b> <b>Asia</b> from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was {{closely related to the}} earliest Old World camels.

30|$|Origins of Agriculture in <b>Western</b> Central <b>Asia</b> by David Harris {{presents}} the archaeological results of work undertaken by Harris {{and a team}} of specialists at and near the site of Jeitun in Turkmenistan between 1989 and 1998; it also impressively reviews existing knowledge on the environment, flora, fauna and archaeology of <b>western</b> Central <b>Asia.</b> This region is of particular interest, due to its proximity to the Fertile Crescent, that part of the ancient Near East which saw the domestication of many of the plants and animals we rely upon today. The volume aims to address the where, when, how and why of the origins of agriculture in <b>western</b> Central <b>Asia.</b> These are important questions, well understood for the westward expansion of Neolithic economies and lifeways from the Fertile Crescent, but not so for the eastward expansion.|$|R

5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of <b>western</b> <b>Asia</b> Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the end of}} Melissenos's revolt, it left a {{profound}} legacy: although Melissenos himself submitted to Alexios Komnenos, the towns he had occupied and garrisoned with Turkish soldiers in Ionia, Phrygia, Galatia, and Bithynia remained in their hands. Thus, by becoming involved in the Byzantine civil wars as mercenaries and allies – especially through their use by Botaneiates and Melissenos during their respective revolts to hold down various cities for them – the Turks completed their relatively peaceful take-over of central and <b>western</b> <b>Asia</b> Minor.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} epoch, the Chinese lost their secret to the Koreans, the Japanese, and, later, the Indians, as these {{cultures}} discovered {{how to make}} silk. Allusions to the fabric in the Old Testament show that it was known in <b>western</b> <b>Asia</b> in biblical times. Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BCE the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West. Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, {{with the possible exception}} of Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia.|$|E
5|$|Historian Matti Moosa {{considered}} Marrash to be {{the first}} truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer of modern times. Marrash adhered to the principles of the French Revolution and defended them in his own works, implicitly criticizing Ottoman rule in <b>Western</b> <b>Asia</b> and North Africa. He was also influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh. His modes of thinking and feeling, and ways of expressing them, have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the Mahjari poets.|$|E
5|$|Navajo {{textiles}} {{were originally}} utilitarian blankets {{for use as}} cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar purposes. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, weavers began to make rugs for tourism and export. Typical Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns. They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and <b>Western</b> <b>Asia,</b> but with some notable differences. In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe. Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.|$|E
