5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its <b>way.</b> <b>To</b> <b>begin</b> with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in a single shipment, all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

He also played a one-day game against Sri Lanka A, again with little success, and though he played a few games the following year it was only in 2001 that he became anything like a regular in the side.

Leto explained, [...] "At the show in Austria, where there were tens of thousands of people, and I ran into him and interviewed him; he was the first interview of the summer, and he shared this story about losing his father, and what it taught him, it was really an organic and serendipitous and beautiful <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> He shared a really personal part of himself and we're really grateful to him, and that continued throughout all the interviews." ...|$|E
500|$|His Band and the Street Choir {{peaked at}} number 32 on the Billboard 200, and at number 18 on the UK Album Chart. The album {{received}} a warm reception in North America—as Moondance had done—largely {{due to the}} success of [...] "Domino", a sampler single that peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. This single remains Morrison's biggest US hit (as of 2010), as it climbed one place higher than his 1967 hit [...] "Brown Eyed Girl", from the album Blowin' Your Mind!. [...] "Domino" [...] was also a hit in the Netherlands, reaching number 22 on the Dutch Top 40. Jon Landau of Rolling Stone magazine attributed the success of [...] "Domino" [...] to the guitar figure {{at the beginning of the}} track, which he considered [...] "not only a great way to start a single, but a fine <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the album". [...] "Blue Money" [...] debuted as the second single, faltering outside the Top 20 at number 23 in the US. The final single, [...] "Call Me Up in Dreamland", managed only two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, while reaching number 95; biographer Ken Brooks believed it deserved better. John Platania recalled that Morrison [...] "had designs" [...] on securing radio airplay for Street Choir, and the success of its singles reflected a growing audience and commercial appeal for his music.|$|E

2500|$|This sonnet is {{important}} because it is the first one that Shakespeare gives us. It sets the tone {{for the rest of the}} collection of sonnets. According to Helen Vendler, this sonnet can be “as an index to the rest of the sonnets". The main reason she says that it {{is important}} is because it brings [...] "into play such a plethora of conceptual material; it seems a self-conscious groundwork laid for the rest". Scholars like Helen Vendler think that this particular sonnet may have been composed after the others. She says that because of the [...] "sheer abundance of values, images, and concepts important in the sequence which are called into play" [...] and [...] "the number of significant words brought to our attention" [...] in this sonnet, that it [...] "may have been deliberately composed late, as a 'preface' to the others". Philip Martin says that Sonnet 1 is important to the rest because it [...] "states the themes for the sonnets immediately following and also for the sequence at large". To him, the themes are announced in this sonnet and the later ones develop those themes. Joseph Pequigney says that Sonnet 1 does serve an introductory and does it unconventionally; [...] "it might on that very account be seen as a befitting <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the least conventional of Renaissance love-sonnet sequences". It provides a [...] "production of metaphorical motifs that will recur in the upcoming sonnets, particularly in the next fourteen or so; it gives the concepts of beauty and time and their interrelationship, as also the emblem of the rose, all of which carry the weight in the other sonnets; and it shows the theme of reproduction, to be taken up in all except one of the sixteen ensuing poems".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1941, Ribbentrop worked {{for the failure of}} the Japanese-American talks in Washington and for Japan to attack the United States. In October 1941 Ribbentrop ordered Eugen Ott, the German {{ambassador}} to Japan, to start applying pressure on the Japanese to attack the Americans as soon as possible. Ribbentrop argued to Hitler that a war between the United States and Germany was inevitable given the extent of American aid to Britain and the increasingly frequent [...] "incidents" [...] in the North Atlantic between U-boats and American warships guarding convoys to Britain. He said that having such a war start with a Japanese attack on the United States was the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> it. Ribbentrop told Hitler that because of his four years in Canada and the United States before 1914, he was an expert on all things American; he thought that the United States was not a serious military power. On 4 December 1941, the Japanese Ambassador General Hiroshi Ōshima told Ribbentrop that Japan {{was on the verge of}} war with the United States. In turn, Ribbentrop promised that Germany would join the war against the Americans. On 7 December 1941, Ribbentrop was jubilant at the news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and did his utmost to support a declaration of war on the United States. He delivered the declaration to the American Chargé d'Affaires Leland B. Morris on 11 December 1941. In the winter and spring of 1942, following American entry into war, the United States successfully pressured all of the Latin American states, except for Argentina and Chile, to declare war on Germany. Ribbentrop considered the acceptance of declarations of war from small states such as Costa Rica and Ecuador to be deeply humiliating, and he refused to see any of the Latin American ambassadors. He had Weizsäcker accept their declarations of war instead.|$|E
