40|$|AbstractThe {{continuous}} {{increasing demand}} for {{energy and the}} decreasing petroleum resources {{has led to the}} search for alternative fuel which is renewable and sustainable. The quality and efficiency of Biodiesel fuel was found to be more significant than petro diesel. For predicting the properties of Biodiesel, various models were developed using various <b>feed</b> <b>oils</b> and blends, the quality of Biodiesel depends on the type of <b>feed</b> <b>oils.</b> The %ARD values were proposed, which vary with composition of <b>feed</b> <b>oils</b> for a given model in comparison between predicted and experimental data.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) computer code, ICRKFLO, has been developed for flow simulation of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) riser reactors, which convert crude oil into gasoline and other valuable products. The FCC flow, especially in the entry region, is a three-phase reacting flow including hot catalyst particles, inert lift gas, and <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> droplets. The impact of the hydrodynamics processes of heat transfer, droplet evaporation, and mixing on the chemical kinetics or riser performance can be significant. ICRKFLO {{was used to evaluate}} the impact of these processes on the performance of an advanced FCC unit. The code solves for major flow properties of all three phases in an FCC riser, with models governing the transport of catalyst particles and <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> droplet, the vaporization of the <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> droplets, the cracking of the oil vapor, and the formation and deposition of coke on particles. First, the code was validated against available test data of a pilot-scale FCC unit. Then, flow calculations for the FCC unit were performed. Computational results indicate that the heat transfer and droplet vaporization processes {{have a significant impact on}} the performance of a pilot-scale FCC unit.

40|$|An {{optimal control}} {{solution}} where {{the objective is}} to determine a well-defined relationship between the vital variables (reactor temperature/riser outlet temperature, regenerator gas temperature, regenerated catalyst feed rate, and the airflow rate) through the use of Fuzzy Logic control scheme is the focus of this paper. In the catalytic cracking unit, <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> is contacted with re-circulating catalyst and reacted in a riser tube. The <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> vaporizes and is cracked as it flows up the riser, thus forming lighter hydrocarbons (the gasoline fraction). Large amounts of coke are formed as a byproduct. The coke deposits on the catalyst and reduces its activity. The lighter hydrocarbon products are separated from the spent catalyst in the ‘reactor’. Steam is supplied to strip volatile hydrocarbons from the catalyst. The catalyst is then returned to the regenerator, where the coke is burnt off in contact with air. This is usually done by partial or complete combustion. The regenerated catalyst is then re-circulated back to mix with the inlet <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> from the crude unit. [1]. The behaviour of the reactor temperature/riser outlet temperature and the regenerator gas temperature during the chemical reactions in the FCCU were simulated using MATLAB®. The problem of control, will however involve the control of two outputs (reactor temperature/riser outlet temperature and the regenerator gas temperature) by manipulating the two inputs (regenerated catalyst feed rate and the airflow rate), which are the critical and vital factors for optimization of the cracking process in th...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present studies was to determine effects of basal dietary forage source on the response of milk fatty acid composition to an oil supplement based (2 : 1, respectively, w/w) on soybean oil and marine algae biomass oil high in cis- 9, cis- 12 C 18 : 2 n − 3 and C 22 : 6 n − 3, respectively. In Study 1, Hampshire × Dorset ewes (48) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four treatments and 12 pens in a completely randomized design blocked on the basis of lambing date and number of lambs suckled. Control rations (60 : 40 forage:concentrate, dry matter (DM) basis) based on alfalfa pellets (AP) or corn silage (CS) were fed from lambing. Beginning at 22 days postpartum, three pens of ewes fed AP and three pens of ewes fed CS were supplemented with oil (30 g/kg of ration DM) in place of corn meal. Average ewe DM intake (DMI) and average daily gain (ADG) were measured weekly. Milk yield and composition were measured at 42 days postpartum. DMI was lower (P< 0. 02) for CS and for oil, but milk yield was not affected by forage source or oil supplementation. Milk fat content was higher for oil (P< 0. 10) and milk protein content was higher for AP (P< 0. 04). Total CLA concentration (g/ 100 g fatty acids) increased (P< 0. 01) with CS and oil, and the response to oil was greater for AP (P< 0. 04). Similarly, total trans-C 18 : 1 and C 22 : 6 ω− 3 concentrations were higher for CS and oil, but the response to oil was greater for CS (P< 0. 06 and P< 0. 01, respectively). In Study 2, the experiment was repeated using alfalfa haylage (AH) instead of AP. The DMI decreased (P< 0. 05) with <b>oil</b> <b>feeding,</b> but was not affected by forage source. Milk yield was decreased by <b>feeding</b> <b>oil</b> with AH, but not by <b>feeding</b> <b>oil</b> with CS (P< 0. 03). Milk fat content tended to be increased by <b>feeding</b> <b>oil</b> with AH, but tended to be decreased by <b>feeding</b> <b>oil</b> with CS (P< 0. 08). Total CLA concentration was increased (P< 0. 01) for AH versus CS and by oil, and the response to oil supplementation was greater for AH (P< 0. 01). In contrast, total trans-C 18 : 1 concentration was higher for CS versus AH, with a greater response to oil for CS (P< 0. 05). <b>Feeding</b> marine <b>oil</b> increased the C 22 : 6 ω− 3 (P< 0. 01) concentration, and the response was greater for AH (P< 0. 04). To further characterize the response of milk fat composition to dietary oil in ewes, a third study used six pens of three ewes each assigned to either the control CS diet used for Study 2 or the same diet supplemented with 45 g/kg (DM basis) of the <b>oil</b> mixture. <b>Feeding</b> <b>oil</b> had no effect on DMI, milk yield or milk fat concentration, but again increased (P< 0. 001) total trans-C 18 : 1 and C 22 : 6 ω− 3 concentrations and numerically increased (114 %) total CLA concentration. Milk fatty acid composition responses to supplemental vegetable and marine oils were affected by forage source. Milk trans-C 18 : 1 concentration was higher when CS was fed in Studies 1 and 2, but the effect of forage species on CLA concentration differed between studies, which may reflect differences in diet PUFA content and consumption, as well as amounts of dietary starch and fiber consumed. Despite large increases in trans-C 18 : 1 concentration, milk fat content was not decreased by <b>feeding</b> unsaturated <b>oils</b> to ewes, even at diet levels of 45 g/kg of ration DM...|$|R

40|$|Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC) is {{the primary}} {{conversion}} process in modern oil refining. It uses a catalyst to convert heavy oil into lighter oil products in a riser. In order to meet increasing demands and succeed in a competitive market, it is desired to improve performance of current FCC units and to design new, advanced units. To achieve these goals, industry 2 ̆ 7 s focus is currently {{on the development of}} new catalysts that are able to crack heavier <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> stocks more effectively and also on the design of a new low profile, multi-staged FCC riser. Recently, numerical simulation of the riser section has been recognized as a valuable tool with the means to facilitate and reduce the design time of new units, and also optimize existing units. However, the complex nature of the multiphase interactions and chemical reactions that occur in the riser reactor presents a huge challenge for analysis. ^ In this study, new phenomenological models for <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> droplet vaporization and catalytic cracking kinetics were developed for FCC riser simulation. These two models address the current trends in oil refining mentioned above. For the low profile riser design, residence times in the riser section are decreased dramatically and the numerical modeling of the <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> droplet vaporization process becomes key. The new droplet vaporization model considers the effects of multicomponent vaporization. The new model is implemented by the definition of a new droplet transport property for each droplet size group that relates the boiling point of the size group to the amount of liquid mass remaining in each size group during the vaporization process. This new feature describes the actual physical characteristics of the <b>feed</b> <b>oil</b> as it undergoes vaporization and improves vaporization rate calculation accuracy. The new catalytic cracking model is based on the physical fundamentals of the cracking process. The model relates the kinetic constants of the cracking reactions to the physical properties of the catalyst. By using the properties to describe the cracking process, if the catalyst is redesigned with different properties, the model can still be used. This expands the application of the kinetic model for use with various catalysts. Using the new models, numerical simulations of FCC risers were conducted. Parametric studies of the design and operating conditions of FCC risers were conducted and found to have significant effects on product yields and profitability of the FCC unit. A new conceptual low profile FCC riser design was also evaluated and optimized for product yields. ...|$|R

50|$|Lubrication of {{the first}} {{high-speed}} engines, such as the Ideal (an open-crank horizontal engine), were lubricated by a development of the <b>oil</b> <b>cup</b> systems previously widespread on medium-speed stationary engines. <b>Oil</b> <b>cups</b> and multi-point lubricators could oil shaft bearings well enough and a single sight-glass could be observed by even the most careless engine driver or oiler. The difficulty was that on high-speed engines, oilers {{could no longer be}} mounted on moving parts, such as the crosshead or connecting rod. Any oil reservoir here would be churned around by the movement and such a necessarily small reserve might also be inadequate incapacity for an engine doing so much work in a small space. More care was thus given to the thoroughness of oiling, and moving parts such as the crankpin were fed by drillings through the crankshaft from oil supplies that were rotating but not moving, such as the main bearings. Centrifugal force was also used to distribute the oil. It was usual that high-speed engines would have only one or two lubricators, so that engine tending was a simpler task and less prone to breakdowns from simple carelessness and running a lubricator dry.|$|R
