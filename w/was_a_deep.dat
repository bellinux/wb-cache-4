5|$|The most {{important}} grave, {{and the most}} spectacular set of artefacts, was found near {{the centre of the}} cemetery. Grave 42 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep,</b> wide pit in which a high-status individual was buried on top of a wooden bed with iron fittings. The body lying on the bed was most likely that of a woman of very high-ranking noble descent, possibly royalty, as {{the quantity and quality of}} the jewellery found in the grave is indicative of a woman ranking at the top of Anglo-Saxon society. Such burials are highly unusual; only a dozen are known in the whole of the UK, and the one at Street House is the most northerly known.|$|E
5|$|Until {{at least}} {{the end of the}} Middle Triassic, high sea levels enabled shallow water to cover much of the South China Block, a tectonic plate that today {{consists}} of the stable Yangtze Craton and the less stable South China Fold Belt. A mountain-building event known as the Indosinian orogeny uplifted Precambrian rocks to form four major landmasses on the South China Block: Khamdian to the west, Jiangnan in the centre, Yunkai to the south, and Cathaysia to the east. Island chains also stretched between Yunkai and Cathaysia in the east. Located between Khamdian and Jiangnan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> oceanic basin known as the Nanpanjiang Basin. Along the western edge of this basin, fossil-bearing sediments were laid down to become what are now the Lagerstätten (sedimentary deposits characterized by exemplary preservation) of Panxian, Luoping, and other localities.|$|E

5|$|Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871– 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{at various}} times between 1898 and 1909. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia. An amateur, MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire, captaining that county {{for most of his}} career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.|$|E

25|$|Other authors, however, have {{concluded}} that the rite can be traced back much earlier. Occult historian Allen H. Greenfield has observed that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in sexual magic and sex as a spiritual tool which began in the early-to-mid-19th century and built throughout the century. A number of spiritual sexual rites and practices were either allegedly rediscovered or created during this period.|$|E

25|$|This {{idea was}} made more precise by Leonard Susskind, {{who had also}} been {{developing}} holography, largely independently. Susskind argued that the oscillation of the horizon {{of a black hole}} is a complete description of both the infalling and outgoing matter, because the world-sheet theory of string theory was just such a holographic description. While short strings have zero entropy, he could identify long highly excited string states with ordinary black holes. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> advance because it revealed that strings have a classical interpretation in terms of black holes.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Eakins {{was a man}} {{of great}} character. He {{was a man of}} iron will and his will to paint and to carry out his life as he thought it should go. This he did. It cost him heavily but in his works we have the {{precious}} result of his independence, his generous heart and his big mind. Eakins <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> student of life, and with a great love he studied humanity frankly. He was not afraid of what his study revealed to him.|$|E
25|$|Winston Churchill had Montgomery {{promoted}} to field marshal {{by way of}} compensation. In September 1944, Montgomery ordered Crerar and his First Canadian Army to take the French ports on the English Channel, namely Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk. On 4 September, Antwerp, the third largest port in Europe was captured by Horrocks, with its harbour mostly intact. The Witte Brigade (White Brigade) of the Belgian resistance had captured the Port of Antwerp, before the Germans could destroy the port. Antwerp <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> water inland port connected to the North Sea via the river Scheldt. The Scheldt was wide enough and dredged deep enough to allow the passage of ocean-going ships.|$|E

25|$|Discharges {{from the}} Darton sewage {{treatment}} works contained residues from dyes {{used by a}} local carpet manufacturer, which reached the works by a foul sewer, but could not be adequately treated by the existing processes. As a result, the final effluent <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> red colour, and was {{a major factor in}} the poor biochemical oxygen demand ratings for the river. Major improvements, including new primary settlement tanks and tertiary treatment lagoons, were made to the treatment works, and the carpet manufacturers installed facilities to treat their effluent before it was discharged to the sewer. By 1994, fish were again appearing below the Star Paper Mill weir, and Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency carried out another fish restocking programme.|$|E
25|$|Human dissections {{were carried}} out by the Greek {{physicians}} Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of Chios {{in the early part of}} the third century BC. During this period, the first exploration into full human anatomy was performed rather than a base knowledge gained from 'problem-solution' delving. Before and after this time investigators appeared to largely limit themselves to animals. While there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> taboo within the Greek culture concerning human dissection, there was a strong push by the government to build Greece into a hub of medical insight. For a time, Roman law forbade dissection and autopsy of the human body, so physicians had to use other cadavers. Galen, for example, dissected the Barbary macaque and other primates, assuming their anatomy was basically the same as that of humans.|$|E
25|$|The skull was long, low, and curved so {{that both}} {{extremities}} {{were higher than}} the middle. The premaxilla bones that formed {{the end of the}} snout were enlarged to form a wide tip; there were at least four teeth in the right premaxilla and five in the left. The left maxilla (main tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw) is more complete than the right, and had at least 29teeth. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> groove along the midline of the nasals and the frontals; the frontals were fused into a single bone, as is seen in other adult mesoeucrocodylians. Unlike derived neosuchians, it had external antorbital fenestrae. Tykoski and colleagues subjected the skull to CT scanning, which revealed internal cavities and air passages, and showed that it had a double-walled secondary palate similar to that of true crocodylians, and similar pneumatic cavities as well.|$|E

25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that time there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity {{they wanted to know}} what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E

Magalotti otherwise described the king's main pursuits as hunting, the upcoming war, and jokes.|$|E

500|$|The main {{construction}} site was located at a substantial temporary staging pier erected in the River Thames {{a short distance}} south of the Hungerford Bridge. It was described {{at the time as}} [...] "a small village of workshops and offices and an electrical generating station to provide the power for driving the machinery and for lighting purposes during construction." [...] The [...] wide stage was located [...] from the Hungerford Bridge's first pier, [...] from the north bank of the Thames. It was originally intended that the work should begin close to the south bank, with a bridge connecting the stage to College Street– a now-vanished road {{on the site of the}} present-day Jubilee Gardens. However, test borings showed that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression in the gravel beneath the Thames, which it was speculated was the result of dredging carried out for the abortive Charing Cross & Waterloo Railway project. This led to the work site being relocated to the north side of the river.|$|E
500|$|Although it did {{not achieve}} the {{objective}} of reaching the North Pole, the expedition made major geographical and scientific discoveries. Sir Clements Markham, president of Britain's Royal Geographical Society, declared that the expedition had resolved [...] "the whole problem of Arctic geography". It was now established that the North Pole was located not on land, nor on a permanent ice sheet, but on shifting, unpredictable pack ice. The Arctic Ocean <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> basin, with no significant land masses north of the Eurasian continent—any hidden expanse of land would have blocked the free movement of ice. [...] Nansen had proved the polar drift theory; furthermore, he had noted {{the presence of a}} Coriolis force driving the ice {{to the right of the}} wind direction, due to the effect of the Earth's rotation. [...] This discovery would be developed by Nansen's pupil, Vagn Walfrid Ekman, who later became the leading oceanographer of his time. From its programme of scientific observation the expedition provided the first detailed oceanographic information from the area; in due course the scientific data gathered during the Fram voyage would run to six published volumes.|$|E
