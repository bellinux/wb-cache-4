5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. <b>Willow</b> <b>ptarmigan,</b> common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
25|$|Few animals live {{in these}} areas; birds, mostly, {{such as the}} willow warbler, the meadow pipit, the {{northern}} wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European golden plover, the Eurasian dotterel, the snow bunting, and the Lapland longspur. The <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> is relatively common, whereas the rock ptarmigan is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufjället is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Although absent or rare in {{some areas}} where the golden eagle occurs, this {{is by far the}} most {{significant}} family of birds in the diet of golden eagles, making up 10.3% of their known prey. In Scandinavia and the Baltic States, grouse are the primary prey for these eagles, comprising between 47.6% and 63.3% of their diet, and displacing mammals altogether. The main prey species in most of this sizeable area is the largest species of grouse, the western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), supplemented by its cousins, the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia). However, in the northernmost parts of Scandinavia, these are replaced by the smaller <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus) and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta). A study in Belarus showed grouse were the most common family of prey at 47.8% of the eagle diet. In Estonia, the prey base is more varied, but grouse were still the most represented bird family, comprising 18.1%. The red grouse, a race of <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus scotica), and the rock ptarmigan (also called just ptarmigan) occur heavily in the golden eagle's diet in parts of Scotland, up to 47.8% in one study. One paper in Alaska showed that the two ptarmigan species (primarily the more abundant willow) made up 49.1% of the remains in a golden eagle pair's nest, making it the only known study in North America where birds were more prevalent in the diet than mammals. Other reports from Alaska show the <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> as secondary prey. In some other areas, grouse are taken only as supplemental prey. A study in the Italian Alps revealed grouse made up 19.4% of nest remains and were the most common avian prey. In eastern Washington state, sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus) was the second most significant prey species (at 13%) after yellow-bellied marmot. Considered globally, it is likely that every species of grouse is prey of the golden eagle at least somewhere.|$|E

25|$|Migratory {{waterfowl}} (ducks, geese, and swans) and upland {{game birds}} (ptarmigans and grouse) were a valued source of fresh meat. Grouse (spruce grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, ruffed grouse Lower Tanana deyh Tanacross deyh, ch'ehtêeg, tsą́ą' ts'uug Upper Tanana daih, ch'ahtagn, tsąą'ts'uu) and ptarmigan (<b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> and rock ptarmigan Lower Tanana k'orrh'eba, ddhełk'ola Tanacross k'étmah, ddheł k'aal Upper Tanana k'atbah) were taken opportunistically throughhout {{the year with}} bow and arrows or with snares and fence-snare arrangements. Ducks and geese were easily captured when molting. Men in birchbark canoes quietly approached waterfowl in bays and coves and shot them with bow and arrows. Women and children then caught the birds and collected eggs from their nests.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{at least}} half the prey biomass is made up from small rodents from the Cricetidae (voles, lemmings) and Murinae (Eurasian mice and {{sometimes}} young Eurasian rats). Shrews, songbirds, lizards, and frogs and toads (typically as tadpoles) make up most of the remaining vertebrate prey. Birds are generally of little importance however, except in spring when male songbirds are engaged in courtship display and often rather oblivious of their surroundings, in late summer when inexperienced fledglings abound, and in winter when most small mammals hibernate. Occasionally bats, newts and salamanders, and even fish are eaten. Prey animals may exceptionally be almost as large as the birds themselves, for example chicks of the <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus) or a young stoat. Large arthropods are the second-most important prey by quantity, though not by biomass; in the latter respect they are only a bit more important than birds, except as food for nestlings where they usually form a substantial part of the diet. Most important among invertebrate prey are insects, especially beetles, crickets and grasshoppers, and bumblebees and wasps. Invertebrate prey of minor importance are spiders and scorpions, crayfish and isopods, snails, and oligochaete worms. Carrion and berries are rarely if ever eaten; though it might occasionally plunder songbird nests this is not well documented and it is not known to eat eggs.|$|E
25|$|After the leporids, {{the next}} most {{significant}} group in the diet of golden eagles is the ground squirrels. They comprise about 11.2% of the prey taken by this species across the range. In areas where leporids are scarce, this group of rodents seems to become more prominent. In {{many parts of the}} golden eagle's range, ground squirrels are rare or absent, such as the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula and some portions of central Eurasia. Nonetheless, all of the large Spermophilus group, all species of prairie dog, all four species of antelope squirrel and all the species of marmot has been found as golden eagle prey. Nests in Denali National Park in Alaska included, among a sampling of 690 remains, contained 84.2% Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii). Studies in Alaska have shown that the other major prey species in Alaska, the <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> and the snowshoe hare, follow an 8 to 11 year population cycle. The locally abundant ground squirrels have less dramatic population variations and come out of hibernation in mid to late May (shortly after the eagles return from migration). The Alaskan Arctic ground squirrel appears to be eaten supplementally in peak years but then fill the primary niche when the ptarmigan and hare populations crash. In Alberta, Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) (occasionally supplemented by other species like yellow-bellied marmots) were the primary prey species, making up 84% of the diet of eagles nesting there. In the French Alps, the most significant prey species is the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) at 68.9% out of a sampling of 198 from 6 nests. This is also the main prey species in the Italian Alps above the tree line, comprising 49.7% of a sample size of 79 from 12 nests. In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, yellow ground squirrels (Spermophilus fulvus) are the most important mammalian prey at 23.4% of a sampling of 468 from 36 nests. Along Coastal California, California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) replace black-tailed jackrabbits (which are scarce there) as the primary prey species. In Washington state, where the golden eagle inhabits mainly forest openings made by humans, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) is the main prey species, making up 41.8% of a sampling of 47 from 2 nests and 40.3% of a sampling of 315 from 74 nests. In many other areas, ground squirrels are secondary prey, usually ranking after lagomorphs in dietary significance. This is especially true in the contiguous Western United States outside of Washington state and coastal California where they often register as second, third or even fourth most represented family by remains. Prairie dogs feature only as supplemental prey for breeding golden eagles but wintering eagles reportedly prey heavily on colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Although rare, tree squirrels have turned up as prey in some eagle nests in both North America and Eurasia.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} fascinating, though {{relatively}} little studied, aspects of the golden eagle's biology is how it interacts with other predators in a natural environment, especially other large predatory birds. The golden eagle is a powerful hunter with few avian rivals in size or strength, although what it gains in these areas it loses somewhat in its agility and speed. Golden eagles are avian apex predators, meaning a healthy adult is not generally preyed upon. There are several other large birds of prey that inhabit the Northern Hemisphere that may be attracted to the same prey, habitats and nesting sites as the golden eagles. Two examples are the common raven and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) as these are two fairly large-bodied, mostly predatory birds that co-exist with golden eagles in almost every part of their range, although the former occurs in much larger numbers and the latter has a much larger natural distribution in more varied habitats. Both the raven and the peregrine are often attracted to much the same precipitous habitat as the golden eagle. However, both are generally dominated by the much larger eagle and will actively avoid nesting {{in the same area}} as a golden eagle pair. Ravens and peregrine falcons have both been robbed of food on a few occasions by golden eagles. Both species have turned up widely in the diet of golden eagles, much more so the raven than the peregrine. However, these conspecific species follow no set [...] "rules". Ravens often vigorously and successfully displace golden eagles from their nesting territories. Peregrine falcons have also displaced golden eagles from their nesting territories and, in one instance in Utah, even killed a golden eagle that had breached the area of their nest. In another case, a peregrine falcon kleptoparasitized a <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> from a golden eagle. In a study of four cliff-nesting raptor species in Spain, the golden eagle was not observed to engage in agonistic encounters with the other species but the peregrine falcons but were dominated by and occasionally killed by a relatively small race of Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo hispanus). Both ravens and peregrine falcons appear to easily outmaneuver golden eagles in flight.|$|E

2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl may hunt {{at least}} 300 species of bird. In Europe, {{the most common}} avian prey species are the {{normally}} feral or domestic [...] rock pigeons (Columba livia), although the [...] common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) can be locally even more significant. In the Netherlands, the common wood pigeon {{is the most important}} prey species, making up 37.3% by number and 38.3% by biomass. Yet another, smaller study of the Netherlands found the rock pigeon to be the primary prey species. In a dietary study from Luxembourg, the common wood pigeon was the most frequent prey species, making 19% of the remains by number. A study from Romania listed the rock pigeon was the second most frequently recorded prey behind only the Romanian hamster and the largest contributed of biomass. Unusually, in the Netherlands, birds were the primary food in both number (77.6%) and biomass (72%). Also, in Luxembourg, eagle-owls hunted birds in general were more regularly than mammals, as nearly 70% of prey remains there were avian. At least six other species of pigeon and dove have also been recorded as prey. However, perhaps the most significant contributor of prey at the family level is the corvids. The [...] carrion crow (Corvus corone) is the second most widely recorded avian prey species in Europe and, locally, good numbers are also taken of [...] hooded crow (Corvus cornix), [...] western jackdaws (Corvus monedula), [...] Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), [...] common ravens (Corvus corax), [...] rooks (Corvus corone), two species each of magpie and chough and the [...] spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), in rough descending order of reportage in the eagle-owl’s diet. In Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the carrion crow was the most frequently recorded bird among an exceptionally diverse recorded prey base including than 65 bird species there (although birds only comprised 27% of the prey numbers overall). Unlike smaller passerines, corvids roost in numbers in relatively open spots, which make them fairly vulnerable to a predator as stealthy and powerful as the eagle-owl. [...] More than 17 species of gamebirds have been recorded in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet but they are normally taken in small numbers. There are, however, exceptions. In one study conducted in lower Austria, the most frequently identified prey species was the [...] grey partridge (Perdix perdix), which is the most widely reported gamebird prey for eagle-owls in Europe. One study of a “primeval” forested region of Finland found various grouse species to be the most significant contributor of biomass, namely in descending order the [...] western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the [...] black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the [...] hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). In inland areas of Norway, the large forest grouse were also significant biomass contributors. The same forest grouse species were also found to be significant to diet along the Pechora River in Russia. Other gamebirds can be important secondary prey species in different parts of Europe: the [...] red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) in western Europe, the [...] rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and the [...] rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) in alpine highlands, the [...] ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) in eastern Europe and the [...] <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus) in the sub-Arctic zone.

40|$|Global {{warming is}} {{predicted}} to cause substantial habitat rearrangements, with the most severe effects expected to occur in high-latitude biomes. However, one major uncertainty is whether species {{will be able to}} shift their ranges to keep pace with climate-driven environmental changes.

Here, we have used an interdisciplinary approach that combines ancient DNA techniques, coalescent simulations and species distribution modelling, to investigate how two common cold-adapted bird species, <b>willow</b> and rock <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus and Lagopus muta), respond to long-term climate warming. Contrary to previous findings in mammals, we demonstrate a genetic continuity in Europe over the last 20 millennia. Results from back-casted species distribution models suggest that this continuity may have been facilitated by uninterrupted habitat availability and potentially also the greater dispersal ability of birds. However, our predictions show that in the near future, some isolated regions will have little suitable habitat left, implying a future decrease in local populations at a scale unprecedented since the last glacial maximum...|$|R
40|$|Wild herbivorous mammals may damage treeline {{vegetation}} an cause {{soil erosion}} {{at a local}} scale. In many high mountain areas of Europe and North America, large numbers of red deer have become {{a threat to the}} maintenance of high-elevation forests and attempts to restore the climatic treeline. In northern Fennoscandia, overgrazing by reindeer in combination with mass outbreaks of the autumnal moth are influencing treeline dynamics. Moose are also increasingly involved damaging treeline forest. In the Alps, the re-introduction of ibex is causing local damage to subalpine forests and tree establishment above the forest limit as well as aggravating soil erosion. High-elevation forests and treeline in Europe are susceptible to the deleterious impact of wild ungulate populations because of former extensive pastoral use. Rodents may damage tree seedlings and saplings by girdling, root cutting, bark stripping and burrowing. Hares damage young trees by gnawing. Large numbers of small rodents may occasionally impede tree regeneration by depleting the seed sources. Rodents do not contribute to forest expansion beyond the current treeline. Among birds, nutcrackers are highly effective in influencing tree distribution patterns and treeline dynamics. Without the nutcracker caching of stone pine seeds any upward advance of the trees in response to climatic warming would be impossible.

50|$|Fish {{comprise}} about 80% of {{the diet}} of eagles nesting in the Amur River. Elsewhere, other prey can comprise almost an equally important portion {{of the diet}}. Nonpiscine prey consists largely of water-dwelling birds, including ducks, geese, swans, cranes, herons, and gulls. Along the sea coast and in Kamchatka, water birds {{are the most common}} prey for Steller's sea eagles. Among bird prey, this eagle has shown a strong local preference for slaty-backed gulls (Larus schistisagus). Common and thick-billed murres (Uria aalge and U. lomvia, respectively) dominated the diet around the Sea of Okhotsk, followed by black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), slaty-backed gulls, crested auklets (Aethia cristatella), and pelagic cormorants (Phalacrocorax capillatus). Small chicks of murres and cormorants were sometimes taken alive in Russia and brought back to nests, where they independently fed on remains of fish in the eagles' nests until they were killed themselves. In Russia, upland bird species, black-billed capercaillie (Tetrao parvirostris) and <b>willow</b> and rock <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus & L. muta) can be an important prey species. Grouse are not typically taken by other Haliaeetus species. Other landbirds hunted by Steller's sea eagles have included short-eared owls (Asio flammeus), snowy owl (Bubo scandiaca), carrion crow (Corvus corone) and common raven (Corvus corax), as well as (rarely) smaller passerines. In one case, a Steller's sea eagle was observed feeding on a rare prey item in the Northern Hemisphere, a great albatross (Diomedea), as that genus nests in the sub-Antarctic oceans.

Furthermore, these herbivores may alter forage plants {{in such a way}} as to increase the quantity and accessibility of their own food source. We estimated the effect of winter browsing by ptarmigan and moose on an abundant, early-successional willow (Salix alaxensis) in northern Alaska by comparing browsed to unbrowsed branches. Ptarmigan browsed 82 - 89 % of willows and removed 30 - 39 % of buds, depending on study area and year. Moose browsed 17 - 44 % of willows and browsed 39 - 55 % of shoots. Browsing inhibited apical dominance and activated axillary and adventitious buds to produce new vegetative shoots. Ptarmigan- and moose-browsed willow branches produced twice the volume of shoot growth but significantly fewer catkins the following summer compared with unbrowsed willow branches. Shoots on browsed willows were larger and produced 40 - 60 % more buds compared to unbrowsed shoots. This process of shoot production at basal parts of the branch is the mechanism by which willows develop a highly complex "broomed" architecture after several years of browsing. Broomed willows were shorter and more likely to be re-browsed by ptarmigan, but not moose. Ptarmigan likely benefit from the greater quantity and accessibility of buds on previously browsed willows and may increase the carrying capacity of their own habitat. Despite the observed tolerance of willows to browsing, their vertical growth and reproduction were strongly inhibited by moose and ptarmigan. Browsing by these herbivores therefore needs to be considered in future models of shrub expansion in the Arctic...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Shrubs {{have been}} {{expanding}} in the Arctic {{over the past}} century, with important consequences for ecosystem functioning, plant community composition, and wildlife habitat. Herbivores {{have the capacity to}} strongly moderate the growth and biomass of shrubs, and therefore need to be considered when attempting to understand and project future changes to Arctic ecosystems. Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus, L. muta) are common and widespread in many tundra regions, and feed on shrubs throughout their life cycle. Ptarmigan are likely to be an important herbivore in northern Alaska where shrub expansion is rapidly occurring; however, little is known about their spatial and temporal distribution in the Arctic, or the effect of their browsing on shrubs. This dissertation provides novel information on ptarmigan population ecology and herbivory in northern Alaska. Ptarmigan occupancy in northeastern Alaska increased from March through May, lending support to the idea that they undergo a spring migration from southern wintering grounds to breeding grounds north of the Brooks Range. Ptarmigan distributions were strongly linked to the presence of shrubs; occupancy was greatest in dense patches of riparian willows that grew tall enough to exceed snow depth. The frequency and intensity of ptarmigan browsing in feltleaf willow (Salix alaxensis) stands in northeastern and northwestern Alaska was high, such that ptarmigan browsed 82 - 89 % of willows and removed 30 - 39 % of buds. Browsed willow branches produced fewer catkins than un-browsed branches, but doubled the volume of current annual growth produced the following summer. These longer, larger-diameter shoots bore 40 - 60 % more buds than shoots on unbrowsed branches. The removal of distal buds stimulated dormant buds {{at the base of the}} branch to produce shoots, resulting in a "broomed" architecture. Despite their tendency to produce longer shoots when browsed, highly broomed willows with a history of browsing were shorter than un-broomed willows. Broomed willows were more likely to be re-browsed by ptarmigan. Moose browsing was not as prevalent (17 - 44 % of <b>willows</b> browsed) as <b>ptarmigan</b> browsing and resulted in reduced catkin production and increased shoot volume. Simulated ptarmigan browsing of feltleaf willows caused a similar response to that observed in the wild. Browsed willows produced fewer catkins and more buds per shoot, although buds were smaller than on un-browsed willows. Browsing altered the architecture and bud production of willows such that the biomass of easily accessible buds (within 50 cm of snow level) was greater (129 ± 30 mg) on browsed willows than un-browsed willows (113 ± 50 mg). Browsing did not affect nitrogen concentrations, but slightly reduced carbon concentrations and protein precipitation capacity (tannins) in buds produced the following winter. In a feeding preference study, when broomed and un-broomed willow branches were placed in the snow at equal heights, wild ptarmigan showed no preference for either type but obtained more buds from broomed willows. A synthesis of original and published research showed that browsing by vertebrate herbivores in the Arctic is not uniform, and that certain shrubs (such as willows) are more heavily browsed than others (such as evergreen ericoids, resin birches, and Siberian alder (Alnus viridis fruticosa)). These differences in preference translate to variation in the degree to which herbivores regulate Arctic shrub growth and community structure. As shrubs expand in the Arctic, unpalatable, fast-growing species such as alder may have an advantage over more palatable species such as willows. Collectively, this research fills critical gaps in our knowledge of ptarmigan population ecology in Alaska, provides novel insights into how ptarmigan regulate their food source for their own benefit, and enhances our understanding of how herbivores influence shrub expansion in the Arctic...|$|R
