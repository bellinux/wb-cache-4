5|$|In 1839, Melbourne {{resigned}} after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) {{voted against}} {{a bill to}} suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, {{to form a new}} ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> Tories. In {{what became known as the}} bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.|$|E

Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the <b>wives</b> <b>of</b> the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E

It is therefore uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E
