50|$|The {{shape and}} size of the metal {{nanoparticles}} strongly affect the strength of the enhancement because these factors influence the ratio of absorption and scattering events. There is an ideal size for these particles, and an ideal surface thickness for each experiment. Particles that are too large allow the excitation of multipoles, which are nonradiative. As only the dipole transition leads to Raman scattering, the higher-order transitions will cause a decrease in the overall efficiency of the enhancement. Particles that are too small lose their electrical conductance and cannot enhance the field. When the particle size approaches a few atoms, the definition of a plasmon does not hold, as there must be a large collection of electrons to oscillate together.An ideal SERS substrate must possess high uniformity and high field enhancement. Such substrates can be fabricated on a <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> and label-free superresolution microscopy has also been demonstrated using the fluctuations of surface enhanced Raman scattering signal on such highly uniform, high-performance plasmonic metasurfaces.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a facile method for fabricating one-dimensional, precisely positioned nanostructures over large areas offers exciting opportunities in fundamental research and innovative applications. Large-scale nanofabrication methods have been restricted in accessibility due to their complexity and cost. Likewise, bottom-up synthesis of nanowires has been limited in methods to assemble these structures at precisely defined locations. Nanomaterials such as PbZr_xTi_(1 −x) O_ 3 (PZT) nanowires (NWs) —which may be useful for nonvolatile memory storage (FeRAM), nanoactuation, and nanoscale power generation—are difficult to synthesize without suffering from polycrystallinity or poor stoichiometric control. Here, we report a novel fabrication method which requires only low-resolution photolithography and electrochemical etching to generate ultrasmooth NWs over <b>wafer</b> <b>scales.</b> These nanostructures are subsequently used as patterning templates to generate PZT nanowires with the highest reported piezoelectric performance (d_(eff) ~ 145 pm/V).

30|$|In addition, {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} electrochemical impedimetric immunosensor based on wafer-scaled NWA was successfully applied for quantitative detection of various proteins. At low frequencies, binding of protein to the immuno-affinity layer on the NWA electrodes resulted in large changes in impedance, and this effect {{was not observed}} at high frequencies. Thus, double-layer properties are more useful than solution resistance for qualifying protein. From the NWA electrodes, we calculated the change in Rct and estimated LOD for specific protein as stress induced phosphoprotein- 1 (STIP- 1) to be 10  pg/mL which represents a ≥[*] 100 -fold improvement over the bare electrodes which are an electrode without NWA. Electrochemical impedimetric NWA biosensor can also be applied for label-free detection without non-specific binding {{by means of the}} selective docking of immobilized antibodies. These properties provide high sensitivity and selectivity for <b>wafer</b> <b>scaled</b> NWA sensor. The results also show the advantages of using NWA over large areas to improve performance and decrease costs. We anticipate that the in vitro nanobiomedical device will lead the way for the realization of digitized nanomedicine at the molecular level.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. SOI {{material}} is now established as the substrate {{of choice for}} advanced microprocessors applications, pushing SOI technology to ultrathin layers and high volume production. When reviewing ITRS roadmap targets [1], several challenging items appear. Silicon film thickness and uniformity are the most aggressive, with values typically of 10 nm and ± 5 %, 6 s. These requirements lead to 10 Å thickness accuracy on a 300 mm wafer. Smart-Cut ® [2] SOI solution to this manufacturing challenge is discussed. Unibond ® SOI volume production is today running in Bernin fab, showing that splitting and bonding steps can be controlled at production levels, with high yields. Taking advantage of standard equipments flexibility, process has been successfully scaled up to 300 mm. Most advanced 200 mm processes were successfully transferred to 300 mm, with products showing uniformity and defectivity results compatible with industry requirements for fully depleted applications.

Fault tolerance {{certainly is a}} system-level consideration in many VLSI and <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> applications. However, most research in fault-tolerant <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> integration {{has been focused on}} defect tolerance for yield enhancement and fault tolerance for reliability improvement in non-real-time, restructurable environments [1], [2], [3].

The films are deposited by high-pressure on-axis magnetron sputter technique patterned to microbridges with widths down to 0. 5 µm by electron beam lithography and argon ion etching. For ratios of film thickness to step height of t/h≈ 1 / 2 the current-voltage characteristics show Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation and RSJ-(resistively shunted junction) -like behavior. The periodic dependence of the critical current upon the magnetic field resembles a Fraunhofer-pattern.

40|$|Chemical-Mechanical Polishing (CMP) {{is one of}} the {{enabling}} processes used in {{the manufacture}} of semiconductor chips. In the relentless progress to make computer chips faster, smaller, and cheaper, the CMP process plays a prominent role. One of its limitations, however, is non-uniform polishing rate at the die and <b>wafer</b> <b>scales.</b> In this thesis, an innovative CMP machine configuration is proposed to minimize wafer-scale non-uniformity. The new face-up machine lowers wafer-scale non-uniformity by minimizing over-polishing of any particular area. The thesis discusses the kinematics and design considerations of this machine. Additionally, this thesis develops an analytical model for slurry flow in CMP in two steps. First, a simple but useful method of estimating the effective gap between the wafer and the pad during polishing is developed. The method uses pressurized fluid flow and an analytical model to estimate the effective gap between the wafer and the pad. Second, this effective gap is used in the Couette model that describes the slurry behavior in CMP. The Couette model shows that rotational speeds of the wafer and pad, the effective gap, and the sizes of the wafer and pad dictate the slurry flow rate and flow pattern in both conventional CMP and the new face-up CMP. The Couette model can be used to estimate the slurry flow rate whenever the process parameters are changed. by Krzysztof D. Kopanski. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Integrated circuit size (and hence complexity) {{is limited}} by the fact that chips created using current design {{techniques}} will not function correctly in the presence of even a single circuit defect. This research examines the problem of constructing chips up {{to the size of the}} wafer (<b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> integration) that operate correctly despite the occurrence of such flaws. We concentrate on a particular family of parallel processors, configurable, highly parallel (CHiP) processors. ^ The key problem in the implementation of <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> integration is structuring the wafer so that only the functional PEs are connected together. A methodology, the two level hierarchy, that efficiently and economically solves the structuring problem for CHiP processors is presented. The principle elements are the use of column exclusion with high yield building blocks that contain redundant components. This approach limits the performance degradation due to structuring and allows the structuring problem to be solved with tractable computational effort. ^ Since the yield of building blocks must be high for the two level hierarchy to be a practical approach, yield phenomena are investigated in detail. A model of the integrated circuit manufacturing process is developed that predicts circuit yield and the probability distribution of manufacturing defects. These results are applied to the analysis of parallel processors in which several PEs occupy a single chip. In addition, they are used to design the building blocks meeting the requirements of the column exclusion strategy. ^ It was shown that these building blocks can be assembled into a <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> CHiP processor.

40|$|Fault {{tolerance}} to support mission life reliability {{is a key}} consideration in many system applications. Redundancy for defect tolerance, i. e., yeld enhancement, and wafer-level reliability enhancement have been standard practice {{since the advent of}} <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> technology. Korea [1], [21, [31, [4], [51 and others have shown how effective static redundancy techniques can bc for improving both yield and reliability. However, designers are often faced with the conflicting goals of maximizing system reliability and minimizing hardware. Not only are these two goals contradictory, but there is a point of diminishing return relative to the cost effectiveness of increasing system reliability at the expense of adding spare hardware. At ICWSI ' 93, Samson [6] presented an approach for optimizing real-time fault tolerance design in WSI via the Reliability-Availability Product. The approach was [xtsed upon the identification of fundamental optimization metrics, represented by simple product and quotient (reciprocal product) relationships, which extend traditional cost/benefit analysis to fault tolerance in VLSI and <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> architectures and systems [71.

This research uses the validated finite-element analyses to study the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors of the 96. 5 Sn– 3. 5 Ag, 95. 5 Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu lead-free solders, and the classical 63 Sn– 37 Pb solder bumped <b>wafer</b> level chip <b>scale</b> package (WLCSP) on printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies subjected to four different temperature cycle tests. The behaviors of equivalent stress and equivalent total strain hysteresis loops are examined in the five key areas, which are the center, upper-right, upper-left, lower-right, and lower-left, at the outmost corner solder joint. It can be seen that: (1) for the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors to these three solder alloys, the range of the temperature loading is the most important factor to assess the reliability of the solder bumped WLCSP on PCB assemblies; (2) {{in the case of the}} same scale to the WLCSP and the WLCSP with underfill, the difference of the equivalent total strain range exceed an order of magnitude for all the three solder joints.
