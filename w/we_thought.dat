5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be great to}} let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way.|$|E
5|$|<b>We</b> <b>thought</b> it fit {{to commend}} these things most fully to your care {{that you may}} {{know that we have}} given to those Christians free and {{unrestricted}} opportunity of religious worship. When you see that this has been granted to them by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship {{for the sake of the}} peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity or any religion.|$|E
5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

25|$|Before we {{introduced}} {{the testimony of}} our witnesses, we made them undergo independent verifying tests, including polygraph examination, truth serum and hypnosis. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> this would be hailed as an unprecedented step in jurisprudence; instead, the press turned around and hinted that we had drugged our witnesses or given them posthypnotic suggestions to testify falsely.|$|E
25|$|I {{resisted}} it completely. I just didn't {{know how}} we could make it last for two hours. But 20th Century Fox was really keen; our producer was really keen. So <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> OK, we'll write the script. And after three months, we fell {{madly in love with}} the script. Unfortunately, Fox did not.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I didn't {{know all}} about it," [...] said Bessie, [...] "or else I've forgotten. I {{have been trying to}} {{remember}} whether <b>we</b> ever <b>thought</b> about Mamma; and oh, Christabel! do you know--I believe <b>we</b> only <b>thought</b> she was cross! Oh dear! it was so naughty and bad of us!" ...|$|R

5000|$|... "We {{just kept}} being punkers {{and doing it}} all by ourselves. Now here we are today. <b>We</b> never <b>thought</b> {{it would be like}} this. <b>We</b> just <b>thought</b> we'd always be playing {{backyard}} parties. A couple of hundred people in Long Beach can claim we played in their back yards". —Nowell, on Sublime's success in 1995.|$|R
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> — let's just make one album.|$|E
25|$|In December 1947 Bevin hoped (in vain) {{that the}} USA would support Britain’s “strategic, {{political}} and economic position in the Middle East”. In May 1950 Bevin told the London meeting of foreign ministers that “the United States authorities had recently seemed disposed to press us to adopt a greater measure of economic integration with Europe than <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> wise” (he {{was referring to the}} Schuman Plan to set up the European Coal and Steel Community). In May 1950 he said that because of links with USA and the Commonwealth Britain was “different in character from other European nations and fundamentally incapable of wholehearted integration with them”.|$|E
25|$|After {{having worked}} {{with members of}} 27 as guest musicians on {{previous}} full-length Oceanic, for Panopticon Isis turned to Justin Chancellor, bassist of tour-mates Tool. According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
5000|$|In the aftermath, Johnny Cronin said: [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were goners, <b>we</b> really <b>thought</b> {{that this}} was it - game over. It was {{like being in a}} tumble drier - only worse. It¹s a miracle we all made it out alive." ...|$|R

25|$|In {{an article}} in The Globe and Mail written by Andre Picard on January 9, 1990, she is quoted as saying, “it was morbid and horrible what {{happened}} to Édouard. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> it was about time someone showed a little respect for his body – and his soul.” Lesperance felt the same and began plans to have the body returned to Willow Bunch {{the same year as}} his visit to the university. This first attempt failed because university officials claimed that the court would have to decide who had the right to the body. Although Lesperance gained power of attorney to act on behalf of the family, he did not proceed with any legal action at that time.|$|E
25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I dare say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E

40|$|Bad Memory {{reveals that}} despite state censorship, {{events of the}} time were vividly recorded. Treglown looks at what’s {{actually}} there—monuments, paintings, public works, novels, movies, computer games—and considers, in a captivating and open-minded narrative, the totality of what it shows. The result is a much-needed re-examination of a history <b>we</b> only <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> knew...|$|R
25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E
500|$|Kaif's {{paternal}} parentage {{has been questioned}} by {{some members of the}} film industry. In a 2011 interview with Mumbai Mirror, Boom producer Ayesha Shroff accused Kaif of fabricating her history: [...] "We created an identity for her. She was this pretty young English girl, and we gave her the Kashmiri father and thought of calling her Katrina Kazi. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> we'd give her some kind of Indian ancestry, to connect with the audience... But then <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that Kazi sounded too... religious?... Mohammad Kaif was at the top, and so we said, Katrina Kaif sounds really great". Kaif called Shroff's comments [...] "hurtful".|$|E
500|$|Many years later, co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I {{was really}} surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we were {{creating}} the quintessential American show. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> the Muppets were quintessentially American, {{and it turns}} out they're the most international characters ever created". Mike Dann, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of Sesame Street. Dann's appointment led to television critic Marvin Kitman stating, [...] "After he [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".|$|E

5000|$|In 1982 Frankenheimer {{described}} The Pursuit of D. B. Cooper as [...] "... {{probably my}} worst-ever experience. A key {{member in the}} chain of command had been lying to both management and myself with the result that <b>we</b> all <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> were making a different movie." [...] After doing very poorly in theatres, the film went straight to video.|$|R
5000|$|On October 16, 2009, Mosshart {{confirmed}} {{that a second}} album was [...] "halfway done". White later announced that the first single from the new album would be called [...] "Die By The Drop", for which he would sing lead vocals. He commented that it was [...] "bluesier and heavier than <b>we</b> ever <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> could be".|$|R
500|$|On 29 April 2015, Boyd {{was married}} {{for the third}} time at the Chelsea Register Office at Chelsea Old Town Hall in London.

500|$|Yeats {{used the}} {{occasion}} of his acceptance lecture at the Royal Academy of Sweden to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked, [...] "The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English travelling companies, and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players. When <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> of these plays <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> of everything that was romantic and poetical, because the nationalism we had called up—the nationalism every generation had called up in moments of discouragement—was romantic and poetical." [...] The prize led to {{a significant increase in}} the sales of his books, as his publishers Macmillan sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money, and he was able to repay not only his own debts, but those of his father.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Sesame Street {{debuted in}} the USA, the CTW was asked {{independently}} by producers from several countries to produce {{versions of the}} series in their countries. Cooney remarked, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we were creating the quintessential American show. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> the Muppets were quintessentially American, {{and it turns out}} they're the most international characters ever created". She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, [...] "After [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV". This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the series. [...] By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term [...] "co-productions".|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought the}} Colonial Office knew. We were {{confident}} that they knew. The Colonial Secretary had stated {{that he had been}} there.

6000|$|... "Oh, sure," [...] assented Jacob cordially. He felt {{a little}} dazed. Miss Hannah's nimble change of base was {{hard for him to}} follow, and he had an injured sense of having wasted a great deal of commiseration on her when she didn't need it at all.
