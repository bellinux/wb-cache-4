40|$|ObjectivesWe {{evaluated}} whether statins have anti-arrhythmic effects {{by exploring}} {{the association of}} statin use with appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) -II. BackgroundA few {{studies have suggested that}} lipid-lowering drugs may have anti-arrhythmic effects in patients with coronary artery disease. MethodsPatients receiving an ICD (n = 654; U. S. centers only) in the MADIT-II study were categorized by the percentage of days each patient received statins during follow-up (90 % to 100 %, n = 386; 11 % to 89 %, n = 116; and 0 % to 10 %, n = 152). The Kaplan-Meier method with significance testing by the log-rank statistic and time-dependent proportional hazards regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of statin use on the probability of ICD therapy for the combined end point VT/VF or cardiac death and for the end point VT/VF. ResultsThe cumulative rate of ICD therapy for VT/VF or cardiac death, <b>whichever</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>first,</b> was significantly reduced in those with ≥ 90 % statin usage compared to those with lower statin usage (p = 0. 01). The time-dependent statin:no statin therapy hazard ratio was 0. 65 (p < 0. 01) for the end point of VT/VF or cardiac death and 0. 72 (p = 0. 046) for VT/VF after adjusting for relevant covariates. ConclusionsStatin use in patients with an ICD was associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiac death or VT/VF, <b>whichever</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>first,</b> and was associated with a reduction in VT/VF episodes. These findings suggest that statins have anti-arrhythmic properties...|$|R
