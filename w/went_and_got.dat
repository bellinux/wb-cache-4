500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> high and wrote the record. I <b>went</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> ripped, I <b>went</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> out of my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days}} when I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E
