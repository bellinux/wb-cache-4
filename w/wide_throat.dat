40|$|Sharpleaf penstemon is a {{short-lived}} perennial forb 20 - 60 cm (8 - 24 inches) tall. One to several erect stems arise from a thick crown. Stems and leaves {{can be both}} glabrous and glaucous. The fleshy leaves are entire with the basal leave oblanceolate and tapering to a petioled base. The basal leaves are 4 - 10 cm long and 7 - 15 mm wide. The upper leaves are 2 - 7 cm long and 10 - 35 mm wide, often sessile and clasping, and ranging from lanceolate to ovate with acute to acuminate tips. Flower clusters are compact and subtended by bracts that are usually wider than long with overlapping, heart-shaped bases. The calyx is 4. 5 - 9 mm long during flowering and elongates as it matures. The individual sepals are narrowly lanceolate in shape. The blue to lavender or pink corolla ranges from 11 - 20 mm long with the tube narrow at the base, tapering gradually to a <b>wide</b> <b>throat.</b> The corolla lobes flare broadly. The anthers are glabrous and black outside, the sacs splitting completely to become opposite and boat-shaped. The stamen is glabrous or often with a short, yellow beard at the tips.

40|$|The sapwood fibers {{in green}} {{softwood}} are normally filled - or nearly filled - with free water. This water forms a continuous phase {{through the narrow}} bordered pits between fiber lumens. In a drying process water evaporates from the menisci formed at these narrow throats and initially located {{close to the surface}} of the wood. As the amount of free water decreases in this way, a retraction of the meniscus will happen in the <b>widest</b> <b>throat,</b> which can be located anywhere, not necessarily close to the surface. As the individual size of these narrow throats is a stochastic variable, this process will produce complicated water phase structures that gradually fragmentize. If this drying behavior is viewed as such an invasion percolation process it is obvious that the result differs from normal diffusion, which however most often is used as the basis for wood drying modeling. A computer based simulation model that utilizes the above principle has been developed. This model has been used for the simulation of a few situations of practical and theoretical importance. It has been found that this invasion percolation approach can reproduce some previously unexplained features seen in softwood drying processes.

5000|$|Variable-Venturi: {{in which}} the fuel jet opening is varied by the slide (which {{simultaneously}} alters air flow). In [...] "constant depression" [...] carburetors, this is done by a vacuum operated piston connected to a tapered needle which slides inside the fuel jet. A simpler version exists, most commonly found on small motorcycles and dirt bikes, where the slide and needle is directly controlled by the throttle position. The most common variable Venturi (constant depression) type carburetor is the sidedraft SU carburetor and similar models from Hitachi, Zenith-Stromberg and other makers. The UK location of the SU and Zenith-Stromberg companies helped these carburetors rise {{to a position of}} domination in the UK car market, though such carburetors were also very widely used on Volvos and other non-UK makes. Other similar designs have been used on some European and a few Japanese automobiles. These carburetors are also referred to as [...] "constant velocity" [...] or [...] "constant vacuum" [...] carburetors. An interesting variation was Ford's VV (Variable Venturi) carburetor, which was essentially a fixed Venturi carburetor with one side of the Venturi hinged and movable to give a narrow throat at low rpm and a <b>wider</b> <b>throat</b> at high rpm. This was designed to provide good mixing and airflow over a range of engine speeds, though the VV carburetor proved problematic in service.|$|R

In 1894/95 the German Army changed the barrel specifications from 7.9/8.1 mm to 7.9/8.2 mm hoping to improve accuracy and Gewehr 88 rifles made from that date on had different bores. The 8.08 mm (.318 in) bullet diameter however remained unchanged. After 1895 most Gewehr 1888 rifles were regrooved.In 1903, the Germany Army adopted a new service cartridge that fired lighter bullets measuring 8.20 mm (.323 in) in diameter. From then on, many Gewehr 88 rifles were rechambered to fire the new 1903 pattern 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge becoming Gewehr 88 S rifles. This rechambering required more work as the 7.92×57mm Mauser chambering required a <b>wider</b> chamber <b>throat</b> to take the thicker brass of the new 1903 pattern cartridge. 7.92×57mm Mauser adapted rifles have the receiver marked with a large [...] "S" [...] rollmark.

5000|$|Callet's {{method of}} brass embouchure {{consists}} of the tongue remaining forward and through the teeth at all times.
