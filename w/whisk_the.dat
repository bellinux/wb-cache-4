5|$|Gimmick!, known outside Japan as Mr. Gimmick, is a {{platform}} video game developed {{and published by}} Sunsoft, and originally released in Japan for the Family Computer on 31 January 1992. The story follows a small green character named Yumetaro who was given to a young girl as a birthday present. One night, the girl's other toys become jealous of the attention he is receiving, and <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> girl away to another dimension. Playing as Yumetaro, the player must maneuver {{through a variety of}} levels, using the protagonist's star-shooting power to defeat enemies and progress through the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiation}} {{into these}} Nnukwu-Ozo titles was and still is, very expensive. Historically, the initiation ceremony into {{the secrets of}} the Nnukwu-Ozo involved the very painful and prestigious Ichi scarification, by which these men were identified in public. The Ichi scarification as part of the ritual has been discontinued in modern times for aesthetic reasons. The last bearer of Ichi marks, Chief Ezenwosu died in the early twentieth century. Other distinctive pieces of regalia that identify the Ozo title holder and the Nnukwu-Ozo title holder in Awka-Etiti are the red cap (with eagle feathers for the Nnukwu-Ozo), the horse tail fly <b>whisk,</b> <b>the</b> round cow hide fan and the elephant tusk.|$|E
25|$|Geelong – Games between Collingwood and Geelong {{have become}} highly {{anticipated}} since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 {{points in a}} high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points—20.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong’s only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258. In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder—with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies.|$|E

2500|$|At this stage, {{the teams}} were being manned {{according}} to the planned missions' objectives from their base at [...] "Whiskey-3". Some 120 to 200 Commandos were available for duty at a given moment, and their missions were usually shallow incursions from Military Region 3 into North Vietnam. These were generally indirect fire operations with improvised rocket launchers, supported by an idling helicopter waiting to <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> Commandos away afterwards. Developed for the Commando Raiders in 1969, the two-shot 2.75 inch rocket launcher was modified from the rocket pod on O-1F Bird Dog spotter aircraft. High explosive heads were fitted, and a simple tripod attached to the launching tubes. Several versions of the rocket launcher were made, including a six-shot wheeled type. Rocket missions were successful in harassing the NVA in what they had considered [...] "safe" [...] territory, {{but there was no}} feedback concerning enemy casualties or the damage inflicted. However, an unsuccessful raid on Lang Mo on 21 October 1970 brought an end to this practice.|$|E
60|$|The self-contained, methodical soldier had {{suddenly}} turned almost inarticulate with his excitement.

60|$|Out {{into the}} storm they passed, Kwaque, {{with a heart}} wild with gladness, {{bringing}} up the rear. At the beginning Daughtry strove to walk aloof, but in a trice, in the first heavy gust that threatened to <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> frail old man away, Dag Daughtry's hand was grasping the other's arm, his own weight behind and under, supporting and impelling forward and up the hill through the heavy sand.|$|E

60|$|But {{he was a}} happy boy, {{in spite}} of poverty and pain; and the day a great gust came blowing {{fragments}} of a gay placard and a dusty newspaper down the court to his feet, {{was the beginning of}} good fortune for patient Johnny. There was a theatre in the street beyond, and other pictured bits found their way to him; for the frolicsome wind liked to <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> papers around the corner, and chase them here and there till they settled under the chair or flew wildly over the wall.|$|E
60|$|Mr John Browdie, {{with his}} hands in his pockets, hovered restlessly about these delicacies, {{stopping}} occasionally to <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> flies out of the sugar-basin with his wife's pocket-handkerchief, or to dip a teaspoon in the milk-pot and carry it to his mouth, or to cut off a little knob of crust, and a little corner of meat, and swallow them at two gulps like a couple of pills. After every one of these flirtations with the eatables, he pulled out his watch, and declared with an earnestness quite pathetic that he couldn't undertake to hold out two minutes longer.|$|E
60|$|But when cats make {{up their}} minds to do {{anything}} they generally DO it; and this cat began to look about {{to see if there was}} really no way of getting at his ball. Yes! there was, and it was much surer than the other, though rather more difficult. Above the bough where the ball was hung was another bough much thicker, which he knew could not break with his weight; and by holding on tight to this with all his four paws, he could just manage to touch the ball with his tail. He would thus be able to <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> ball to and fro till, by-and-by, the string would become quite loose, and it would fall to the ground. It might take some time, but the lion's little brother was patient, like most cats.|$|E

50|$|Second, {{actions are}} {{performed}} {{similar to the}} in-to-out flow of the breath (e.g. cleaning <b>the</b> <b>whisk</b> (chasendōji), rotating <b>the</b> tea bowl and <b>whisking</b> <b>the</b> tea). With practice, the temae can be performed in natural flowing harmony with the breath. From an 'unshakeable core expanding out' is the fundamental direction of assertive action and the tea ceremony of the Ueda Tradition is based on this fundamental. To captures this in the temae, the practitioner moves at one with an energising in-to-out flow of breath.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind--I am not tired--I {{have been}} here ever so long,' said Bob. 'And I--' But the chair having been placed behind him, and a smart touch {{in the hollow of}} a person's knee by the edge of that piece of {{furniture}} having a tendency to make the person sit without further argument, Bob sank down dumb, and the others drew up other chairs at a convenient nearness for easy analytic vision and the subtler forms of good fellowship. The miller went about saying, 'David, the nine best glasses from the corner cupboard!'--'David, the corkscrew!'--'David, <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> tail of thy smock-frock round the inside of these quart pots afore you draw drink in 'em--they be an inch thick in dust!'--'David, lower that chimney-crook a couple of notches that the flame may touch the bottom of the kettle, and light three more of the largest candles!'--'If you can't get the cork out of the jar, David, bore a hole in the tub of Hollands that's buried under the scroff in the fuel-house; d'ye hear?--Dan Brown left en there yesterday as a return for the little porker I gied en.' ...|$|E
60|$|Once, only, {{he dreamed}} to advantage. Famishing, shipwrecked or marooned, he {{fought with the}} big Pacific surf for rock-clinging mussels, and carried them up the sands to the dry flotsam of the spring tides. Of this he built a fire, and among the coals he laid his {{precious}} trove. He watched the steam jet forth and the locked shells pop apart, exposing the salmon-colored meat. Cooked to a turn--he knew it; and {{this time there was}} no intruding presence to <b>whisk</b> <b>the</b> meal away. At last--so he dreamed within the dream--the dream would come true. This time he would eat. Yet in his certitude he doubted, and he was steeled for the inevitable shift of vision until the salmon-colored meat, hot and savory, was in his mouth. His teeth closed upon it. He ate! The miracle had happened! The shock aroused him. He awoke in the dark, lying on his back, and heard himself mumbling little piggish squeals and grunts of joy. His jaws were moving, and between his teeth meat was crunching. He did not move, and soon small fingers felt about his lips, and between them was inserted a tiny sliver of meat. And in that he would eat no more, rather than that he was angry, Labiskwee cried and in his arms sobbed herself to sleep. But he lay on awake, marveling at the love and the wonder of woman.|$|E

60|$|Green Gables was a {{busy and}} joyous house that forenoon. Diana arrived early, with little Fred and Small Anne Cordelia, {{to lend a}} hand. Davy and Dora, the Green Gables twins, <b>whisked</b> <b>the</b> babies off to the garden.|$|R

50|$|It {{was held}} in a room known as a kissa-no-tei. The host of the event was called the teishu, a term which is still in use in modern tea-gatherings.

50|$|Dynamic Boy ambushes The Flame and Hydro. Pyroman {{arrives and}} electrocutes Dynamic Boy, {{apparently}} killing him (of course, the reader knows that Dynamic Boy is a robot).

5000|$|The {{closeness}} of the feet so that the lower legs of the dancer are [...] "locked" [...] together crossed is the main difference from other cross-steps used, e.g., in the Grapevine, where the moving (crossing) foot travels away from the standing foot and the lower legs are separated.

60|$|But {{that was}} {{easier said than}} done, for, quick as a wink, as they came to lay hold of him, <b>the</b> soldier <b>whisked</b> <b>the</b> feather cap {{from his pocket and}} clapped it upon his head, and then they might as well have hoped to find the south wind in winter as to find him.|$|R
50|$|There {{are small}} stylistic {{differences}} between the different schools.

Also, Omotesenke uses both an untreated bamboo chasen and a susudake chasen, or darkened-bamboo tea whisk, while Urasenke uses untreated bamboo for its chasen or tea whisk.|$|R
