5|$|Epstein asked {{chartered}} accountant James Trevor Isherwood {{to set up}} a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12 May 1964. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.|$|E
5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> {{that the}} Gibraltar Police were {{handling}} the police {{investigation into the}} shootings, having been closely involved in the {{events leading up to}} them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the close}} {{resemblance}} {{of his voice}} to the legendary singer Mukesh (Mukesh Chand Mathur), Babla began his career recording covers of Mukesh songs for T-Series. Then one day, in 1990, seminal Indian film composer R.D. Burman was passing through Khar, Mumbai, {{when he heard the}} song ‘Sajan re jhoothmut bolo’ blaring from an audio cassette shop. Burman commented on how well Mukesh had sung the song, and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> it was not Mukesh, but the voice of Babla coming from the shop. He was so impressed he contacted Babla and asked to meet him the very next day. Then Pancham Da took Babla under his wing, and he became a regular singer in Pancham Da’s live shows. Unfortunately, Puncham Da’s failing health delayed his film music debut.|$|E
25|$|The Fender Jazz bass guitar {{started out}} {{life as a}} {{standard}} 4-string bass, but in 1976, after being inspired by Jaco Pastorius' fretless playing, he commissioned a symphony bass repairman {{by the name of}} Neville Whitehead to replace the standard neck with a fretless version. The replacement neck was a planed-down real ebony neck removed from a 100-year-old upright bass. For six months Foster struggled with the pure black neck as there were no indicators for finger positioning. Eventually giving up the fight, he employed luthier Dick Knight to mark fretlines on the neck. After going to this trouble he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that Pastorius achieved the same thing by merely pulling off the frets and filling the resulting holes with epoxy resin. Since the early 80s the bass guitar has undergone several component replacements including the bridge and the pick-ups.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{first came}} to Genoa City to {{distract}} Paul Williams {{as a favor to}} Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), who wanted to break up Paul and his wife, Christine. Isabella approached Paul at his office with a case against her husband, which he took. Paul gave Isabella shelter, and the two were drawn to each other. Upon the ending of the case, Isabella's past as a call girl came out, but Paul forgave Isabella for lying, and they became even closer. Isabella was keen on leaving the city after the case was over, but both Michael and Paul had their reasons for keeping her in town. Isabella <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that she was pregnant with Paul's child. Paul's marriage took another hit when Christine returned home to find him passionately kissing Isabella. However, Isabella didn't want Paul, and she decided to tell Michael that she was carrying his child after a night of passion that they had. Michael reluctantly agreed to pay for her expenses and went along with all of her demands, while Paul became closer to his ex-wife, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). Paul found out that he was the father of Isabella's child and decided to raise his son with her. Both Michael and Mary Williams (Carolyn Conwell), Paul's mother, were not happy to learn the truth. Mary did her best to break up the couple, and Paul eventually realized that he couldn't be one happy family with Isabella and their baby.|$|E

Jankowski followed Hambleton down. Hambleton was concealed by a low fog bank as he landed in a dry rice paddy, unseen by the NVA troops. As Jankowski observed Hambleton land, his aircraft came under heavy antiaircraft fire. He was astonished at the huge number of NVA troops, equipment, and heavy weapons in the area. Hambleton found refuge in a group of bushes {{in the middle of the}} rice paddy. NVA troops were less than [...] away.

500|$|American vocalist Barbra Streisand {{recorded}} her {{own version}} of [...] "Jubilation" [...] for her sixteenth studio album, ButterFly (1974). Despite Anka's original version totaling six minutes and 29 seconds, Streisand's is considerably shorter at three minutes and 52 seconds.

Next thing you know he's her producer, and he's produced mega motion pictures". However, he also acknowledged Streisand's rendition: [...] "Barbra can sing the phone book.

500|$|Anderson {{believed}} {{it was a bad}} idea for his character to get involved with a work colleague.

Chrissie took the break up well, and Hobley told What's on TV that her character did not mind, as [...] "it was only a bit of fun. She never planned on settling down with him." [...] It was then announced Chrissie would become pregnant with Oliver's child. Hobley assessed that Chrissie <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that she was pregnant, but pleased, as she had lost a baby five years previously and did not think that she was capable of conceiving another. Oliver was displeased by the news, but Chrissie had no expectations that he should provide for her. Her father, nursing consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell), urged him to [...] "stand up to the mark and be a proper man". However, soon after, Chrissie miscarried their unborn baby.|$|E

The miniseries, starring Paul Giamatti as John Adams, was based on David McCullough's Adams biography and was Hooper's first wholly American production. He <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that the American Revolutionary War was not a well-documented period in film and television; Abigail Adams actress Laura Linney told him that, for her generation, the musical 1776 was the most well-known depiction of the era.

However, enough time had been bought for the pylon to materialize, and Kaldalis was reinforced by zealots warping in.|$|E
500|$|Mitt {{had missed}} {{much of the}} tumultuous anti-Vietnam War {{movement}} in America while away in France. Upon his return, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> {{that his father had}} joined that same movement during his unsuccessful 1968 presidential campaign. George was now serving in President Richard Nixon's cabinet as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. In a June 1970 newspaper profile of children of cabinet members, Mitt said that U.S. involvement in the war had been misguided– [...] "If it wasn't a political blunder to move into Vietnam, I don't know what is"– but supported Nixon's ongoing Cambodian Incursion as a sincere attempt to bring the war to a conclusion. During the U.S. military draft for the Vietnam War, Romney sought and received two 2-S student deferments, then a 4-D ministerial deferment while living in France as a Mormon missionary. He later sought and received two additional student deferments. When those ran out, the result of the December 1969 draft lottery where he drew number 300 ensured he would not be drafted.|$|E

Everything went to plan. I spotted a couple of little wobbles but what I was proudest of was the recovery. The technical crew, the cast—every time we maybe veered slightly off course, they pulled it back round." [...] Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie's killer, and was never tempted to air a different conclusion, despite at least ten characters having strong motives. Turner <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that Stacey was the killer, and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character, observing: [...] "She not only {{has to deal with}} the guilt of what she did but she also knows that she's inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death.
