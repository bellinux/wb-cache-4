5|$|Amenemhat {{may have}} died without a male heir, which could explain <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> succeeded by Sobekneferu. However, some egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt, have {{proposed}} that the first two rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef, were his sons. Amenenmhat IV may have been Sobeknefru's spouse, but no evidence currently substantiates this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} and Phan's response are {{often cited as}} one of the reasons <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> so admired by the populace and among future generations of Vietnamese anti-colonialists: he adhered to the highest personal standards of patriotism.

5|$|Coffin {{grew up on}} {{the family}} farm in North Carolina. He was educated at home and {{received}} little, if any, formal education. Exposed to slaves throughout his childhood, he sympathized with their condition. According to his own account, Coffin became an abolitionist at the age of seven when he asked a slave who was in a chain gang <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bound. The man replied that it was to prevent him from escaping and returning to his wife and children. The event disturbed Coffin, who considered the impact of a father being taken away from his family.|$|E
5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} it was a matter of circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young resilient brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had nothing to do with the missing parts of his brain.|$|E
5|$|In his own time, Bede was as {{well known}} for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, {{as well as other}} {{theological}} works.

It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum, and <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> made a saint.|$|E

5|$|Some sources, {{including}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the F {{version of that}} work, state that Æthelred was transferred in 870 from the Bishopric of Wiltshire to the see of Canterbury. However, the transfer has now been proven to be taken {{from the life of}} Ælfric of Abingdon, who was archbishop from 995 to 1005. Although the story of his transfer is false, Æthelred was consecrated as archbishop in 870. <b>Why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> selected for Canterbury is unknown, as there is no contemporary information on his election.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Ben takes Sawyer {{for a walk}} to high ground. Sawyer {{learns that}} he has no pacemaker; it was merely a con to prevent Sawyer from leaving, and Ben shows him the same rabbit from the day before, which had been merely sedated. Ben reveals to Sawyer that they are on a {{completely}} different island approximately twice the size of Alcatraz that overlooks the main island; escape is impossible. Upon asking <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> conned, Ben tells Sawyer that in order to gain a con artist's respect, they must be conned themselves.|$|E
5|$|A {{glassblower}} is {{attacked and}} hospitalized. Nemhauser (Greg Thirloway), another agent on the case, tells Scully that Patterson {{was responsible for}} getting Mulder assigned to the case and may admire him after all. Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a utility knife. Mulder refuses to explain to Scully <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow will not tell him {{how to find the}} creature that attacked him.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death {{also note that}} he was the author of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, {{at least not in the}} current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of Breton with the real author or if he did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which Breton was.|$|E
5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> snooping around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan what he was trying to accomplish and <b>why.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E

5|$|Geppetto {{discovers that}} his wish has come true, and {{is filled with}} joy. However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, Schnaufer filed {{claims for}} a further five aerial victories. Schnaufer and Baro were {{scrambled}} on 11/12 June in Bomber Command's attack on Düsseldorf, and on 16/17 June in defence of Cologne. However, in both missions they failed {{to make contact with}} the enemy. Their next success came when they shot down a Stirling from No. 218 Squadron on 22 June 1943 at 01:33. With Baro on the radio and radar, they managed another victory over a Wellington on 25 June 1943 at 02:58. On 29 June 1943, the two shot down three bombers in another attack on Cologne, a Lancaster and two Halifax bombers at 01:25, 01:45 and 01:55 respectively. This brought the number of aerial victories he was credited with up to seventeen. Schnaufer was promoted to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) on 1 July 1943. He had been eligible for this promotion since April 1943, <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> overlooked at the time remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, {{with a list}} of 300 names to Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this leniency towards the persecuted may have been one reason <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E
