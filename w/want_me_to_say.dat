Arsenal were unbeaten {{domestically}} since December 2001 and on course to complete their first league and cup double in four years. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: [...] "We have been facing cup games in the league every week {{for a long time}} and this is just another. Chelsea will be a difficult team to beat if they are at their best on Saturday, but such is the confidence in this squad, we just feel we can win every game." [...] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: [...] "What do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> Everybody thinks he has the prettiest wife." [...] The Arsenal manager was undecided whether to drop Richard Wright who started in every round of the FA Cup for David Seaman and to recall Sol Campbell who recovered from a hamstring injury.|$|E

Early in the case, Autry claimed that investigators {{tried to get him}} to testify falsely against Zach Adams. The family of Dylan Adams, who is mentally disabled, claimed that [...] "hey kept him up all night, would not give him anything to eat or drink and finally he said, 'What do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> According to family members, Dylan has some ability to read, but cannot perform other tasks such as telling time, and they believe that Dylan is being manipulated.|$|E
2500|$|Tillman was an atheist. According to {{speakers}} at his funeral, he {{was very}} well-read, having read a number of religious texts including the Bible, Quran and the Book of Mormon as well as transcendentalist authors such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. [...] However, responding to religious overtones at the funeral by Maria Shriver and John McCain, his youngest brother, Richard, asserted that [...] "Just make no mistake, he'd <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this: He's not with God, he's fucking dead—he's not religious." [...] Richard added, [...] "Thanks for your thoughts, but he's fuckin dead." [...] Another article quotes Tillman as having told then-general manager of the Seattle Seahawks Bob Ferguson in December 2003, [...] "You know I'm not religious." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then I {{happened}} to {{catch sight of}} myself in a looking-glass, and I was scared. I did not see how you could possibly love me. A terror came over me that in the Den you must have mistaken me for someone else. It was a darkish night, you know."

If you can't be landed this time, it's common sense for you to get out, and wait--isn't it? We'll see that you get a cheque to cover what you've put out." ...|$|R
2500|$|Reinhart {{is heavily}} {{inspired}} by various musical genres, including rock and roll, funk, pop, jazz, blues, and even African percussion, {{due to her}} parents' eclectic musical tastes while she was growing up. They were fans of rock legends such as Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix {{as well as more}} traditional pioneering jazz artists. More specifically, she cites The Beatles and band members Paul McCartney and John Lennon as her greatest musical influences. She states that [...] "people always <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a female name", and further explains that such an action would not be reality for her and that saying so would be disingenuous. She admires the singers' ability to have smooth, bluesy voices at some points and raw, gritty, visceral voices at others. Due to her parents' influences, she also grew up idolizing such artists as Sarah Vaughan, Heart, and Tony Bennett. When she was young, she also helped her mother learn songs by Billie Holiday. She explains, [...] "I got a really good ear from just shedding out different tunes and learning different genres." [...] Her album Better was heavily inspired by retro funk band Sly and the Family Stone.|$|E

50|$|Toward {{the end of}} his life, many {{colleagues and}} admirers asked Groddeck to form a society that would promote his ideas. To this request, he would laugh and reply:Disciples like their master to stay put, whereas I should think anyone a fool who <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the same thing {{tomorrow}} as I said yesterday. If {{you really want to be}} my follower, look at life for yourself and tell the world honestly what you see.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing {{she ever}} said," [...] {{returned}} her husband promptly. [...] "She'd die, first. When I {{was up there}} I thought she talked about him too much to be feeling just right about him. It was Bartley this and Bartley that, the whole while. She was always <b>wanting</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I thought she had done right to marry him. I did sort of say it, at last,--to please her. But I kept thinking that, if she felt sure of it, she wouldn't want to talk it into me so. Now, she never mentions him at all, if she can help it. She writes to him every day, and she hears from him often enough,--postals, mostly; but she don't talk about Bartley, Bartley!"

6000|$|... "He <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> investigate. He <b>says</b> he {{may have}} {{somebody}} arrested for this--and I can hardly blame him. It was a vile thing to do--bring a poisonous snake into the school." ...|$|R

He <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Oh no Charly, she's married' {{and then he says}} 'okay, I see' and then continues his rap. For <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do it wouldn't have made sense, you know what I mean. I hit up Mercy Johnson and said 'Babe, How far now?' This is what's up. She was in the states at that time and she came through. She sent me a voice note and I put it there. I put her name on it. Ice Prince [...] Ice Prince also said that he had plans to shoot the music video for the remix. However, the alleged music video was never shot.|$|R

6000|$|The girl hesitated. [...] "I don't think I {{ought to}} tell you all she said and did. It was really a private {{interview}} between us two, and I know she would not <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> much about it. And I don't think {{you would want to}} hear everything." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “I've been {{thinking}} about what Chris would have <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> today. The advice he'd give me, which'd be something like, 'Know what, babe? Fuck it. These guys know all about me. Tell them about someone different.' So I thought I'd {{tell you about a}} hero of Chris's: a man called Captain Joe Kittinger. In 1960, climbing into a foil balloon, Captain Joe ascended 32 kilometers into the stratosphere. And then, armed only with a parachute, he jumped out. He fell for four minutes and thirty-six seconds, reaching seven hundred and forty miles per hour before opening his parachute five kilometers above the Earth. It had never been done before, and it's never been done since. He did it just because he could. And that's why Chris loved him - because the thing about Chris was, he said yes. He said yes to everything. He loved everyone. And he was the bravest boy - man - I knew. And that was - he flung himself out of a foil balloon every day. Because he could. Because he was. And that's why - and that's why,.......we, we loved him.” ...|$|R

5000|$|However, he {{also said}} that the film {{contains}} [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] footage of Winehouse.

6000|$|Pasmer's noble mask of a face, {{from the}} point of his full white beard to his fine forehead, crossed by his {{impressive}} black eyebrows, expressed all the dignified concern which a father ought to feel in such an affair; but what he was really feeling was a grave reluctance to have to intervene in any way. [...] "What do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to him?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay,' said Robert, as {{a bright}} colour came over his usually set and impassive countenance. 'You do not <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{what you have}} always been to me, and how better things have been fostered by your presence, ever since the day you let me out of Hiltonbury Church.

6000|$|... "Yes; and Lord Rintoul <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I {{was sorry}} for what I had done, but I told him I need not say that, for I was sure to do It again. As you know, I have done it several times since then; and though I am a {{different}} woman since I knew you, I dare say I shall go on doing it at times all my life. You shake your head because you do not understand. It is not that I {{make up my mind}} to break out in that way; I may not have had the least desire to do it for weeks, and then suddenly, when I am out riding, or at dinner, or at a dance, the craving to be a gypsy again is so strong that I never think of resisting it; I would risk my life to gratify it. Yes, whatever my life in the future is to be, I know that must be a part of it. I used to pretend at the Spittal that I had gone to bed, and then escape by the window. I was mad with glee at those times, but I always returned before morning, except once, the last time I saw you, when I was away for nearly twenty-four hours. Lord Rintoul was so glad <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> come back then that he almost forgave me for going away. There is nothing more to tell except that {{on the night of the}} riot it was not my gypsy nature that brought <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Thrums, but a desire to save the poor weavers. I had heard Lord Rintoul and the sheriff discussing the contemplated raid. I have hidden nothing from you. In time, perhaps, I shall have suffered sufficiently for all my wickedness." ...|$|R
6000|$|Soon after Primus came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I {{learned that}} his {{schoolmaster}} {{had given him a}} holiday task. All the [...] "fellows" [...] in his form had to write an essay entitled [...] "My Holidays, and How I Turned Them to Account," [...] and to send it to their preceptor. Primus troubled his head little about the task while the composition of it was yet afar off; but as his time drew near he referred to it with indignation, and to his master's action in prescribing it as a [...] "low trick." [...] He frightened the housekeeper into tears by saying that he would not write a line of the task, and, what was more, he would [...] "cheek" [...] his master for imposing it; and I also heard that he and Johnny had some thought of writing the essay in a form suggested by their perusal of the [...] "Comic History of Rome." [...] One day I found a paper in my chambers which told me that the task was nevertheless receiving serious consideration. It was the instructions given by Primus's master with regard to the essay, which was to be [...] "in the form of a letter," [...] and [...] "not less than five hundred words in length." [...] The writer, it was suggested, should give a general sketch of how he was passing his time, what books he was reading, and [...] "how he was making the home brighter." [...] I did not know that Primus had risen equal to the occasion until one day after his departure, when I received his epistle from the schoolmaster, who <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether it was a true statement. Here is Primus's essay on his holidays and how he made the home brighter: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said she, [...] "I {{heard you}} before, but I could not {{immediately}} determine what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in reply.

I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare." ...|$|R
