Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
2500|$|Psalm 137, By {{the rivers}} of Babylon, there <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wept, is a moody {{meditation}} upon living in slavery, {{and has been}} used in at least one well-known reggae song; the Orthodox church often uses this hymn during Lent. [...] This psalm was adapted for the song On the Willows in the musical Godspell.|$|E
2500|$|... "After that NC State game, Eddie Gard befriends me. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> started talking. He {{brought in}} Bigos and Fuertado. He {{gave me the}} same old story: 'We control the game. We're good enough to beat these guys anyway and we can make some money. They ain't giving you no money here at L.I.U.' The same old story. We can control the game and nobody will get hurt except the gamblers. Now I'm one of the guys. Peer pressure." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> both <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} each other. I found no voice to speak.|$|R
60|$|But I didn't care. I just laughed, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{together}} <b>and</b> had a long, delightful, chummy talk.|$|R
60|$|I don't {{think anybody}} spoke; {{the thing was}} beyond words, but we tried to bind the poor fellow's arm up {{by the light of}} matches. Then <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again <b>and</b> watched.|$|R
2500|$|On 12 January 2015 the Prodigy {{released}} [...] "Nasty" [...] as {{the lead}} single off their upcoming album along with the title track on 26 January 2015. Howlett found that [...] "violent is the word that keeps on coming up" [...] when describing the album. The entire recording process took almost six years taking {{in a number of}} studios and a few restarts to establish that [...] "angry, energetic sound”. Unlike previous efforts The Day Is My Enemy became a band-album where Flint and Maxim worked in tandem with Howlett. This created a degree of friction although Flint noted that “four years ago <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> talked about where the next album was gonna go, and we knew we had to bust out the most ‘band’ album we could create".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that Metallica's Lars Ulrich was attempting to assemble a tour with the [...] "Big Four" [...] on one bill. [...] "It all started when Rick Rubin encouraged us, a couple of years before, to revisit some of our earlier records," [...] he told Kerrang! founder Geoff Barton in 2010. [...] "Last year, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> took stock of all the good fortune and good times we'd enjoyed. And we basically – as you know, because you were invited – tried to put 200 {{of the people who were}} primarily responsible for us being inducted into the Hall of Fame in one room, in one place, for a couple of days. We got most of them over to Cleveland, where the ceremony was held, and it was a great trip down memory lane. In the wake of that, this whole thing – the Big Four tour – came up." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 20, 2012, the Wallflowers began {{recording}} their sixth studio album, Glad All Over at the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye {{studio in}} Nashville. Jay Joyce, {{who had played}} guitar on the Wallflowers' Bringing Down the Horse agreed to produce the album. [...] Before going to the studio, the band had decided have a more collaborative writing process than {{they had in the}} past. [...] Instead of Dylan bringing in fully completed songs like he had done in the past, he only brought lyrics. [...] Dylan {{and the rest of the}} band wrote the music for the songs together in the studio. [...] Joyce explained: [...] "Jakob came to Nashville and <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I asked him to play me a song, but instead he pulled out this 2-inch-thick notebook. ‘This is what I’ve got. Let’s play some grooves and throw it around.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of scary, but it’s exciting.’ So we didn’t really know going in what we were going to do. We had no songs, no demos. It was all developed in the studio. [...] The band finished recording on February 20, 2012.|$|E
60|$|She sighed, {{and kissed}} me. And I felt at last that I {{had come home}} after many wanderings. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> mother <b>and</b> {{daughter}} on the sofa with their fingers locked. She did not speak of Mr. Manners's conduct, or of my stay in the sponging-house. And for this I was thankful.|$|R
6000|$|I {{found my}} two {{officers}} {{waiting for me}} near the supper table, in the lighted cuddy. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at once, <b>and</b> as I helped the chief mate, I said: ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{interviewed by}} Bloody Good Horror, Sully Erna {{described}} {{the writing process}} as equal collaboration between all {{four members of the}} band, stating [...] "It was truly an equal collaboration between all four of us. <b>We</b> all <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> discussed what <b>we</b> wanted and expected from each of us on this album, and God Damn it, we delivered every speck of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Michaels {{states in}} Heartbreak & Triumph that during {{planning}} {{he was told}} [...] "'This cannot be discussed with anyone. Pat can't know, nobody can know about this but {{the three of us}} right now'", [...] "We had the meeting, and as everyone was leaving, Vince asked me, Hunter, and Jerry Brisco, a longtime agent and close confidant of Vince's, to stay. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> talked", and [...] "Pat was in the room with us, and {{he had no idea what}} was going to happen. He had a strong relationship with Bret. He wouldn't have done it, and Vince knew that. That's why he didn't tell Pat...". However, in Dave Meltzer's online account of events before, during, and after the Screwjob, he states [...] "Vince McMahon held a meeting at the hotel with Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, Pat Patterson and Michaels. Reports are that at least two of the aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting" [...] which suggests that Patterson may in fact have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997 by Wade Keller which states, [...] "However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it. Ross and Patterson entered the meeting in a good mood and when they were seen in the hotel lobby afterwards, were said to be irritable, forlorn, and shaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am relieved," [...] the Baron confessed, with {{a little}} sigh. [...] "I {{addressed}} her as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> she made no reply. I {{began to wonder if}} I had offended." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then tell it. I am {{dying to}} hear news from home." [...] <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> I told my story. Perhaps the deputy {{ought not to}} have allowed me to say all I did, but he pretended not to hear.|$|E
5000|$|... "Ticket to Ride" [...] {{was written}} by John Lennon, {{although}} credited to Lennon-McCartney. In his authorised biography, however, Paul McCartney contradicts this, saying: [...] "we <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote it together … give him 60 percent of it … <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> together <b>and</b> worked on that for a full three-hour songwriting session." [...] Speaking in 1980, Lennon said that McCartney's contribution was limited to [...] "the way Ringo Starr played the drums" [...] on the recording.|$|R
6000|$|... "No,--no," [...] replied Rothermel. [...] "I was not conscious, at least, of so doing. And yet had <b>we</b> two <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{there by}} the wayside, or on that English stile, which {{attracted}} your attention so much; had <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> there <b>and</b> thrown forth each his own dream, each his own knowledge, it would have saved much that we must now forever regret. Are you even now ready to confide wholly in me?" ...|$|R

60|$|The big day {{arrived on}} time. At dawn the sentry on {{watch in the}} corral came into the cave and {{reported}} a moving black mass under the horizon, and a faint sound which he thought to be military music. Breakfast was just ready; <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> ate it.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{before the}} sun rose, Captain Robertson fired a huge pile of dried reeds and bushes, which was to give the signal to the river natives far away to begin their beat. This done, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> waited, after making sure that every gun had plenty of {{ammunition}} ready.|$|E
60|$|For a while <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{watched this}} grim people eating their evening meal in silence as grim as themselves, till at length, {{getting tired of}} contemplating them and the huge moving shadows on the rocky walls, I {{suggested}} to our new keeper that we should {{like to go to}} bed.|$|E
5000|$|Following the 2005 general election, former National {{deputy leader}} Gerry Brownlee stated that Cartwright had not allowed National the chance at forming a government. Brownlee said [...] "I have to {{publicly}} say that I have lost {{respect for the}} Governor-General and I think it is time <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> now <b>and</b> started {{to look at a}} much more formal constitution for New Zealand". In response, Helen Clark said that the Governor-General followed a [...] "very, very proper process".|$|R
60|$|Never pausing for {{an answer}} to {{anything}} he said, Traddles, who had clapped me into an easy-chair by the fire, all this time impetuously stirred the fire with one hand, and pulled at my neck-kerchief with the other, under some wild delusion {{that it was a}} great-coat. Without putting down the poker, he now hugged me again; and I hugged him; and, both laughing, and both wiping our eyes, <b>we</b> both <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> shook hands across the hearth.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking in 2009 {{about the}} next Skid Row album, Hill said [...] "we haven't <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{recorded}} anything yet, but <b>we</b> have <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> worked out some ideas and just played them on a handheld recorder. Everybody's writing and we're getting into that mind set. Once the wheels get in motion we'll all probably fly out to Atlanta spend {{a week or two}} up there come home, go back up there do it again, we're all living in different cities, which can make it difficult at times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'And you wouldn't {{be angry}} at it,' he said, 'would you? You are {{too much of a}} gentleman. We didn't bring this on you. And suppose <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> cried. What good would that be? Let those cry who made the trouble,' he concluded, with energy. 'Time's money, you say. Well--this time is money. Oh! isn't it!' ...|$|E
60|$|I was strolling {{along the}} shore after dinner, smoking a cigar and {{thinking}} of Grace Bates, Heloise Miller, and Clarice Wembley, when I happened upon him. It was a beautiful night, and <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> drank it in for a while. The first intimation I had that all was not well with him was when he suddenly emitted a hollow groan.|$|E
60|$|Poor thing! She {{began to}} cry {{as soon as she}} began to speak. Of course, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> talked to her, and said {{everything}} we could think of to reassure her. And in about half an hour she began to be much more cheerful, and to look as if the world might have something satisfactory in it after all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} him the water myself," [...] said Aunt Martha. This she did, and I noticed that the man's thirst was very soon satisfied. When David had been refreshed, and {{biscuits}} refused by the burglars, who could not very well eat them with their hands tied, <b>we</b> all <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> the stout man began his story. I give it as he told it, omitting some coarse and rough expressions, {{and a good deal}} of slang which would be unintelligible to the general reader.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a kind}} of {{pavilion}} or kiosk, {{which served}} as a cafe, and at which the delicacies procurable at such an establishment were dispensed. Miss Ruck pointed to the little green tables and chairs which were set out on the gravel; M.

I managed again to place myself next to Aurora Church; our companions were {{on the other side of}} the table.|$|R
5000|$|Producer Stephen Sayadian told twitchfilm.com in an interview: [...] "We did it as {{a series}} of six or seven vignettes; <b>we</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> hashed out the concepts. We’ll go to Heaven, we’ll go to Hell, we’ll have one in the Wild West. It was {{supposed}} to be like an old Vaudeville review." [...] His studio also produced one sheets and promotional posters for horror movies such as Dressed to Kill and The Funhouse and the sets used in both movies' posters were also used in filming Nightdreams.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{right for}} the night," [...] said the Doctor, as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> filled our glasses once more. [...] "Sometimes it is my turn and {{sometimes}} his, but, fortunately, we have never been down together. I should have been sorry {{to be out of}} it to-night, for I have a little mystery to unravel. I told you that I intended to sleep in the cooperage." ...|$|E
6000|$|We did obey her. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and,</b> {{such was}} the {{influence}} of her mesmeric eyes, we ate a tolerable breakfast. The obedient Amelia never spoke; Mrs. Matilda Pitman did not speak either, but she knitted furiously and chuckled. When we had finished Mrs. Matilda Pitman rolled up her knitting. [...] "Now, you can go if you want to," [...] she said, [...] "but you don't have to go. You can stay {{here as long as}} you like, and I'll make them cook your meals for you." ...|$|E
60|$|So, the heats considered, we {{resolved}} to take harbour; besides, our provisions were exhausted, {{and we had}} not many days' store left. Accordingly, putting in for the shore early in the morning, as we usually did once {{in three or four}} days for fresh water, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> considered whether we would go on or take up our standing there; but upon several considerations, too long to repeat here, we did not like the place, so we {{resolved to}} go on a few days longer.|$|E
6000|$|I said, [...] "Gentlemen, I wish to {{introduce}} my friend, Mr. Homos," [...] and then I presented them severally {{to him by}} name. <b>We</b> all <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> I explained: [...] "Mr. Homos is from Altruria. He is visiting our country for the first time, and is greatly interested in the working of our institutions. He has been asking me some rather hard questions about certain phases of our civilization; {{and the fact is}} that I have launched him upon you because I don't feel quite able to cope with him." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had come}} into view of a manner of {{pavilion}} or large kiosk, which served as a café and at which the delicacies generally procurable at such an establishment were dispensed.

5000|$|Deacon Blue last {{released}} a studio album in 2001, which was Homesick. In 2006, they {{released a}} compilation album, Singles. Front man Ricky Ross said [...] "It {{has been a}} very long gap, <b>We</b> haven’t <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> had a burning desire to do a new record {{for a while and then}} eventually it became obvious with the last compilation album and a couple of years after that, that you can do it". He also explained that the songs on the album were [...] "not ones he was working on over the decade", but ones he just [...] "was sitting there thinking about".|$|R
