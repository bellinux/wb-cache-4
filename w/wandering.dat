40|$|Noise can {{compromise}} {{the extraction of}} some fundamental and important features from biomedical signals and hence prohibit accurate analysis of these signals. Baseline <b>wander</b> in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is one such example, which {{can be caused by}} factors such as respiration, variations in electrode impedance, and excessive body movements. Unless baseline <b>wander</b> is effectively removed, the accuracy of any feature extracted from the ECG, such as timing and duration of the ST-segment, is compromised. This paper approaches this filtering task from a novel standpoint by assuming that the ECG baseline <b>wander</b> comes from an independent and unknown source. The technique utilizes a hierarchical method including a blind source separation (BSS) step, in particular independent component analysis, to eliminate the effect of the baseline <b>wander.</b> We examine the specifics of the components causing the baseline <b>wander</b> and the factors that affect the separation process. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm in removing the baseline <b>wander...</b>|$|R
