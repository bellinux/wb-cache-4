25|$|African Americans... {{were the}} only Americans who were enslaved for two centuries, but we were far from the only Americans {{suffering}} discrimination then and now.... Sexual disposition parallels race. I was born this <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no choice. I wouldn't change it if I could. Sexuality is unchangeable.|$|E
25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope you will not be there. By the <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E
500|$|Series writer Stacy McKee said of {{the sexual}} encounter: [...] "There's no turning back. There's nothing George and Meredith can do. The damage is done – things {{will never be the}} same. They've just changed {{something}} important in their lives forever." [...] When asked if O'Malley was becoming more assertive, Knight said: [...] Knight also commented that the character does not appreciate himself and his positive traits. On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been doing things is not working.' The big thing about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs to be kind of kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E
60|$|Alexander Abraham groaned, but I {{could see}} that the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> looked him over had chastened him considerably.|$|R
60|$|Well, I couldn't {{contradict}} her, {{not after}} the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him {{looking at her}} across the table.|$|R

2500|$|... “There’s {{a little}} bit of {{everything}} on it,” Reeves said about the new record. “It goes from really stripped-down acoustic to full band. There’s a couple things on there that I’ve never tried before, but for the most part it’s a return to the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been doing it all along — just the acoustic, organic feel.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was originally supposed {{to appear in}} only six episodes, but Mickey proved so popular with viewers that the soap's executive producer, Louise Berridge, decided to make him into a regular character. Swash has commented, [...] "I'm pleased it happened that <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done {{it on my own}} merit rather than coming in as part of a family. It's a bit more special." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alexander {{believed}} {{that in the}} selection of the artillery site to attack Fort Sanders, [...] "Leadbetter evidently had no appreciation of the ground" [...] he himself had earlier assessed as unpracticable and very exposed. Alexander believed Longstreet knew better, [...] "but was misled in some <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never [...] able to understand" [...] and that accepting Leadbetter's recommendations [...] "robbed him of most of his few remaining chances of victory." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{suddenly}} I became {{still more}} surprised at myself, at the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> somehow {{taken for granted}} things which did appear queer when one thought them out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{why did you}} {{pretend to}} like the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done it," [...] Maxwell demanded, angrily, [...] "if you think she will take the honors from him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Once I tried my {{scheme in}} a large medical <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{confined}} to my bed several days with lumbago. My case refused to improve. Finally the doctor said,-- ...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken, {{is not so}} {{streight}} as Metaphrase, nor so loose as Paraphrase: Some {{things too}} I have omitted, and sometimes added of my own. [...] Yet the omissions I hope, are but of Circumstances, and such as wou'd have no grace in English; and the Addition, I also hope, are easily deduc'd from Virgil's Sense. [...] They will seem (at least I have the Vanity to think so), not struck into him, but growing out of him. (5:529) ...|$|E
2500|$|Singh {{does not}} readily throw {{himself into the}} {{spotlight}} due to an awareness of how the media likes to develop cults of personality: [...] "I didn't choose to be covered in the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been. I've said no to interviews far more often than I've said yes." [...] In 2001, when the CBC's The Fifth Estate aired a documentary profile of Singh, {{it was difficult to}} get his cooperation. Anna Maria Tremonti, the show's host, noted that [...] "Often, people clamour to get in front of a microphone. But Jaggi didn't clamour." ...|$|E
2500|$|As an {{experienced}} test batsman, Turner {{was considered a}} strong chance {{to play for the}} [...] "establishment" [...] Australian team that summer against India. However he suffered a poor run of form. Turner decided to retire {{at the end of the}} summer, aged only 27. [...] "I was trying my guts out this season", he said at the time. [...] "I really was, but things just didn't go my <b>way...</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not gained ground in any direction in the past 12 months. I have been static in my cricket. So I decided to get out now to give some other younger bloke a go in an atmosphere without pressure. I don't want people saying I'm like a rat deserting a sinking ship. Believe me, the ship has sunk".|$|E

6000|$|... "By George! this {{is quite}} affecting," [...] said the traveller. [...] "I suppose that they are married; if not, they ought to be. Any <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better clear out for a while." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{discussion}} {{arose in}} this <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> proposed a match between our villain {{and the daughter}} of the local chemist, a singularly noble and pure-minded girl, the humble but worthy friend of the heroine.|$|R
2500|$|Fox's {{overexposure}} in {{the media}} led several men's websites, such as AskMen, to boycott her in 2009, although some refused to do so, feeling that the boycott was a publicity stunt and therefore hypocritical. In response to the boycott, Fox told magazine Nylon, in September of that year, that [...] "the media blitz" [...] for Transformers resulted in an over-extension of her welcome {{in the media}}. [...] "I {{was part of a}} movie that [...] wanted to make sure would make $700million, so they oversaturated the media with their stars," [...] she said. [...] "I don't want to have people get completely sick of me before I’ve ever even done something legitimate." [...] She became much less prominent in the media by 2010, after starring in the less commercially successful films Jonah Hex and Passion Play. That same year, Fox said, [...] "My biggest regret is that I've assisted the media in making me into a cartoon character. I don't regret what has happened to me, but I regret the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> dealt with it." [...] Dixon and Foster stated, [...] "The problem [...] faces is that the [...] construct has replaced the real {{in the minds of the}} public; and once established, a media persona is hard to recalibrate." ...|$|E
60|$|Which is {{the only}} {{possible}} <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> for making out the sum.|$|E
60|$|The other {{objection}} I find urged {{against the}} beginning of polities, in the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> mentioned, is this, viz.|$|E
6000|$|... "Work!" [...] I {{said with}} an effort at the heroic, and turned about with a sigh, and I was glad that the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to go would at least take me to my mother. [...] .|$|R
60|$|I {{instantly}} {{took the}} letter from him, {{and looked at the}} address. For once in a <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> jumped at a conclusion and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> proved to be right. The handwriting on the letter, and the handwriting of the confession which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> read overnight, were one and the same.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{cried the}} girl, anticipating the inquiry. [...] "Yes! She went the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> shown her. Then I came in, and Mrs. Snagsby came behind me from somewhere and laid hold of me, and I was frightened." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. Compromise? Robert, why do {{you talk}} so {{differently}} to-night from the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always heard you talk? Why are you changed? ...|$|E

5000|$|.....the finest {{people in}} some <b>ways</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever met. In {{a way they}} have lost everything, have been through enough to break most people, and remain strong and cheerful and humorous. If {{anything}} is revolutionary it is these comrades." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't quite that. She {{had grown}} up in the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected, but she had somehow grown beyond it. In fact, though I used {{to be a kind of}} elder brother, she had caught me up and left me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] he replied, frankly. [...] "But {{it will be}} {{best that}} <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to stand by Lucy--she's so sweet and gentle, and so sensitive. I don't say I did right. I only say I'd {{do the same thing}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has said}} No, {{because there is}} some {{obstacle}} in her <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> tried vainly to make her explain herself. She has promised to confide everything to you." ...|$|E

60|$|An officer ordered {{several other}} warriors to {{accompany}} him, {{and a moment}} later we were retracing the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just come.
