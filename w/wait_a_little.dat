Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

Then he recommended them to meet in a field for there was not room for them in doors, accordingly they met to the amount of several hundred. He informed us that we were to apply to New York for payment for the stock that they had received. I asked the Colonel if we best send a man in the fleet at this time for the payment to which the Colonel replied, we might if we chose but he recommended us to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time before application was made.|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{was easily}} re-elected as {{governor}} in 1893. [...] Despite the poor economic times in Ohio, he remained popular, and spoke {{across much of}} the nation for Republican candidates. [...] He followed the usual Ohio custom and stepped {{down at the end of}} two two-year terms, returning home to Canton in January 1896 to municipal celebrations. [...] The Canton Repository stated, [...] "It is just plain Mr. McKinley of Canton now, but <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while." [...] To devote full-time to McKinley's presidential campaign, Hanna in 1895 turned over management of his companies to his brother Leonard. Mark Hanna was certain, as he stated as McKinley's campaign began, that [...] "nothing short of a miracle or death will prevent his being the nominee of the party in '96".|$|E

500|$|By early 1862, however, Greeley {{was again}} {{sometimes}} {{critical of the}} administration, frustrated by the failure to win decisive military victories, and perturbed at the president's slowness to commit to the emancipation of the slaves once the Confederacy was defeated, something the Tribune was urging in its editorials. [...] This was a change in Greeley's thinking which began after First Manassas, a shift from preservation of the Union being the primary war purpose to wanting the war to end slavery. [...] By March, the only action against slavery that Lincoln had backed was a proposal for compensated emancipation in the border states that had remained loyal to the Union, though he signed legislation abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia. Lincoln supposedly asked a Tribune correspondent, [...] "What {{in the world is}} the matter with Uncle Horace? Why can't he restrain himself and <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while?" ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{reviewed}} {{my whole}} work in collecting indemnity and they [...] fully approved and {{are prepared to}} defend the course taken. The correspondents who have written {{were all in the}} dark, and had made no proper inquiries. I have invited correspondents to come and see what was being done, but they did not come. I have been very unjustly treated by these writers, and my friends are coming to the front in defense, as all the missions have done the same things, and all believe they are right. So also does Mr. Conger, who is our good friend. Do not be disturbed by anything you see in the papers. The correspondents jump on to the missionaries when they are out of matter, and news has been very scarce this winter. Dr. Sheffield thinks it better for the work that I return home now than <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer and make my class reunion in 1902.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj {{were named}} ODI captain and vice-captain respectively, {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Rahul Dravid. Yuvraj scored 121 at Hyderabad in a losing cause in the third of the seven ODIs against Australia, but accumulated only 71 in the other six matches of the series. He enjoyed a return to form in India's home ODI series against Pakistan in November 2007. He scored four half-centuries in five matches, averaging 68, and was named player of the series as India won the series 3â€“2. He was also fined for showing dissent in the final match in Jaipur. Although Yuvraj was included in Indian squad for the subsequent Test series against Pakistan, Test captain Anil Kumble said that Yuvraj [...] "will have to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more to become a regular member in the Test squad." [...] He did not feature in the playing eleven {{in the first two}} matches, but was picked in the third Test at Bangalore to replace an injured Sachin Tendulkar. Batting first, India was 61/4 before Yuvraj and Sourav Ganguly shared a 300-run fifth-wicket partnership, and Yuvraj recorded his highest Test score of 169 off 203 balls [...] and Ganguly went on to score 239 which was his highest score in tests.|$|E
