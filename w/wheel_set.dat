500|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the trail is a water-powered prayer <b>wheel,</b> <b>set</b> in motion by a flowing stream. The water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into. On the approach path to the monastery, there is a Lakhang (village level monastery) and a temple of Urgyan Tsemo ("U-rgyan rTse-mo") which, like the main monastery, is located on a rocky plateau with a precipitous projection of several hundred feet over the valley. From this location, the monastery’s buildings are on the opposite ravine, which is known by the name “Copper-Colored Mountain Paradise of Padmasambhava”. This is the view point for visitors and there is a cafeteria to provide refreshments. The trek beyond this point is very scenic with the sound of the water fall breaking the silence. Along the trek route blue pine trees, prayer flags and kiosks selling paraphernalia for worship (such as prayer wheels, temple bells and skulls) are seen. The route is scattered with number of temples. On this path, a large water fall, which drops by [...] into a sacred pool, is forded over by a bridge. The track terminates at the main monastery where colorful paintings are displayed. Guru Rinpoche's cave where he meditated is also seen. This cave is opened for public viewing only once a year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{motion of}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> {{is much more}} {{complicated}} than this analysis would indicate. There are additional restraining forces applied by the vehicle suspension and, at high speed, the <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> will generate additional gyroscopic torques, which will modify the estimate of the critical speed. Conventionally a railway vehicle has stable motion in low speeds, when it reaches to high speeds stability changes to unstable form. The main purpose of nonlinear analysis of rail vehicle system dynamics is to show the view of analytical investigation of bifurcation, nonlinear lateral stability and hunting behavior of rail vehicles in a tangent track. This study contains Bogoliubov method for the analysis ...|$|E

[...] If a {{wheelset}} is displaced to one side by an amount [...] "y" [...] (the tracking error), the radius of the tread in contact with the rail on one side is reduced, while on the other side it is increased. [...] The angular velocity is the same for both wheels (they are coupled via a rigid axle), so the larger diameter tread speeds up, while the smaller slows down. [...] The <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> steers around a centre of curvature defined by the intersection of the generator of a cone passing through the points of contact with the wheels on the rails and the axis of the <b>wheel</b> <b>set.</b> Applying similar triangles, we have for the turn radius: ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{kinematic}} description {{deals with}} the geometry of motion, {{without reference to the}} forces causing it, so the analysis begins with a description of the geometry of a <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> running on a straight track. [...] Since Newton's Second Law relates forces to accelerations of bodies, the forces acting may then be derived from the kinematics by calculating the accelerations of the components. [...] However, if these forces change the kinematic description (as they do in this case) then the results may only be approximately correct.|$|E

If the treads were truly conical in shape, the critical speed would be independent of the taper.

[...] Denoting the former as a, the critical speed becomes: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of a {{theoretical}} study of profile high-speed grinding (PHSG) for forming tread <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> during repair instead of turning and mold-milling. Significant disadvantages of these methods are low capacity to adapt to the tool and inhomogeneous structure of the wheel material. This leads to understated treatment regimens and difficulties in recovering <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> with thermal and mechanical defects. This study carried out modeling and analysis of emerging cutting forces. Proposed algorithms describe the random occurrence of the components of the cutting forces in the restoration profile of <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> with an inhomogeneous structure of the material. To identify the statistical features of randomly generated structures fractal dimension and the method of random additions were used. The multifractal spectrum formed is decomposed into monofractals by wavelet transform.

2500|$|A {{few lines}} of the Paris Métro in France operate on a four-rail power scheme. The trains move on rubber tyres which roll {{on a pair of}} narrow roll ways made of steel and, in some places, of concrete. Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two guide bars {{provided}} outside the running 'roll ways' become, in a sense, a third and fourth rail which each provide 750 V DC, so at least electrically it is a four-rail scheme. Each <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> of a powered truck carries one traction motor. A side sliding (side running) contact shoe picks up the current from the vertical face of each guide bar. The return of each traction motor, as well as each wagon, is effected by one contact shoe each that slide on top of each one of the running rails. This and all other rubber-tyred metros that have a [...] track between the roll ways operate in the same manner.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe {{this problem}} was often {{overcome}} {{by dividing the}} drive between inside and outside cylinders, or else by using Articulated locomotives, although {{at the time it}} was not believed possible to run one stably at greater than [...] American railroads proved to be unwilling to use locomotives with inside cylinders, so the problem of balance could not be solved by adding more cylinders per coupled <b>wheel</b> <b>set.</b> As locomotives got larger and more powerful, their reciprocating machinery had to get stronger and thus heavier, and thus the problems posed by imbalance and hammer blow became more severe. Speed also played a factor, since the forces became greater and more destructive at higher wheel speeds. Ralph P. Johnson thought that the growing size and piston thrusts of existing express passenger locomotives could not be sustained with the by-then conventional 4-8-4 2-cylinder layout. In addition, he became convinced that a single pair of cylinders with conventional valve gear and piston valves was approaching the limits in terms of steam flow.|$|E
