40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} information provided to drivers through advance <b>warning</b> <b>flashers</b> (AWFs) on driver’s probability of conflict {{at the onset of}} yellow at a high-speed intersection. AWFs are specifically designed to minimize the number of vehicles trapped in their respective dilemma zones at the onset of yellow. A probit modeling technique was used to establish dilemma zone boundaries. Based on the dilemma zone boundaries probability of a perceived conflict curves was computed and compared against actual conflicts observed at each of the studied intersections. The comparison between the actual and theoretical probability of conflict curves generated {{a better understanding of the}} risk associated with providing drivers with information prior to the onset of yellow through the use of advance <b>warning</b> <b>flashers</b> (AWFs). Results found that providing drivers with information in advance of the intersection using AWFs can potentially cause increased risk in RLRs and/or severe decelerations. Thus, caution should be used by engineers before providing drivers with information at a high speed intersection...|$|R
40|$|The GCT is a dual-mirror Small-Sized-Telescope {{prototype}} {{proposed for}} the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Calibration of the GCT's camera is primarily achieved with LED-based <b>flasher</b> <b>units</b> capable of producing ∼ 4 ns FWHM pulses of 400 nm light across a large dynamic range, from 0. 1 up to 1000 photoelectrons. The <b>flasher</b> <b>units</b> are housed in {{the four corners of}} the camera's focal plane and illuminate it via reflection from the secondary mirror. These <b>flasher</b> <b>units</b> are adaptable to allow several calibration scenarios to be accomplished: camera flat-fielding, linearity measurements (up to and past saturation), and gain estimates from both single pe measurements and from the photon statistics at various high illumination levels. In these proceedings, the performance of the GCT flashers is described, together with ongoing simulation work to quantify the efficiency of using muon rings as an end-to-end calibration for the optical throughput of the GCT.

40|$|Rural two-lane {{highways}} {{compose a}} large {{percent of the}} highway system nationwide. Preserving, expending, and enhancing these highways result in many one-lane, two-way work zones that have caused a safety concern for the traveling public. Aimed at reducing crashes attributed to inattentive driving in these work zones, a new traffic warning sign was proposed, which was assembled using the hazard <b>warning</b> <b>flashers</b> of motor vehicles. This warning sign, named as the Emergency Flasher Traffic Control Device (EFTCD), is flexible and cost-effective and particularly benefits the rural one-lane, two-way work zones that are frequently moved due to construction progress. This research project evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed EFTCD by comparing the speeds with and without the EFTCD and analyzing survey results in three one-lane, two-way work zones in Kansas. Study results showed that the EFTCD effectively reduced the mean speeds in work zones as well as the proportions of high speed vehicles. In addition, the EFTCD successfully captured the attention of most drivers when they were approaching the work zones. A majority of the surveyed drivers recommended the implementation of thi...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of 1976 the {{relatively}} large 1800 cc Vauxhall Victor came with a recommended sticker price {{lower than that of}} the more modern but smaller and relatively well equipped Vauxhall Cavalier GL, which will have encouraged fleet managers to negotiate for higher discounts on the Cavalier and left the basic Victor looking embarrassingly underpriced. To try to move the Victor upmarket, Vauxhall upgraded the trim level of the basic Victor 1800 cc to match that of the 2300 cc version, with improvements that included fabric seat trim, a new clarified instrument display embellished with mock timber surround as well as a new central console. Seat belts and hazard <b>warning</b> <b>flashers</b> were now included in the recommended price across the range. Under the bonnet / hood various upgrades were made to the 1800 cc engine which now offered [...] of output in place of the [...] previously claimed. The changes carried a weight penalty, but performance was nevertheless usefully improved with top speed up from 89 mph (143 km/h) to 100 mph (161 km/h). To draw attention to the changes Vauxhall also dropped the Victor name, and the car, which also replaced the Victor-based VX4/90, became the Vauxhall VX in January 1976. The VX Series is distinguished from the outside by a simplified grille and revised headlights.|$|R
40|$|In the Ahuachapán Geothermal Field the {{reinjection}} pipeline used {{to connect}} the <b>flasher</b> <b>unit</b> with the injection zone in Chipilapa has a total length of 6. 02 km. The main flow is carried by a 24 ” pipe diameter of 4647 length until the Ch- 7 bis pad where it is distributed into the injector wells Ch- 7, Ch- 7 bis and Ch- 9. Because the pipeline is operated by gravity “open channel ” the flow capacity {{is limited to the}} elevation between the flasher and any of the injector wells (dh). In this way using the wells Ch- 7 bis and Ch- 9 a dh of 18. 75 m give a maximum flow of 326 kg/s and if a residual water of 345 kg/s is operated 19 kg/s must be spilled into the waste channel. The use of the wells Ch- 7 and Ch- 9 decrease the dh to 11. 7 m given a maximum flow of 239 kg/s rising the spilling water to 106 kg/s. To overcome this problem the pipeline must be operated as “filled pipe ” by pressure gradient. Under this mode estimations of the pressure distribution along the pipeline give a maximum flow of 495 kg/s using by order the injector wells Ch- 7, Ch- 7 bis and Ch- 9...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} a human factors analysis {{to determine the effects of}} advanced <b>warning</b> <b>flashers</b> (AWFs) on simulated driving performance. The Minnesota Department of Transportation sponsored the project. Researchers used the flat-screen simulator at the University of Minnesota Human Factors Research Laboratory to conduct experiments. They measured vehicle speed, braking, and acceleration/deceleration during simulated driving and visually observed stopping behavior. In addition, they analyzed responses to a post-test questionnaire. They created a 11. 3 -mile simulated driving environment with 10 signalized intersections and configured four experimental models: low speed limit (SL) of 50 miles per hour with no AWFs, low SL with AWF at each intersection, high SL of 65 miles per hour with no AWFs, and high SL with AWF at each intersection Researchers set different vehicle-signal proximity intervals, with all green/no yellow as the control, and zero seconds with the vehicle adjacent to the signal, two seconds, three-and-a-half seconds, or five seconds. With each model, they assigned two intersections each proximity interval, with the sequence of intersection proximity intervals ordered differently for each model. Each of 24 subjects completed duplicate driving trials with each model. The study revealed that, relative to intersections with no AWFs, drivers who encountered yellow signals at AWFs intersections: stopped more frequently at low SLs but not at high SLs, drove more slowly while approaching intersections with two and three-and-a-half second proximity intervals, and displayed less inconsistent behavior at intersections with short proximity intervals. Researchers concluded that AWFs assist drivers with decision-making behavior and promote safer driving behavior. They recommended field research to study an actual environment. Guidesta...|$|R
50|$|The {{running gear}} {{and most other}} {{components}} stayed the same from the XM through to the XP. All of the utility, sedan delivery, and taxi/police kit vehicles had five-lug 13-inch wheels and larger 10-inch drum brakes, as had all previous commercial models. Commercials had always had lower-ratio differentials (4.00:1) and larger 6.70 x 13 tyres. The high-end Fairmonts came with 14-inch four-lug wheels to accommodate the standard disc brakes on this model, whereas other models had 13-inch wheels if disc brakes were not optioned. Fairmonts featured bucket seats, the 200 ci Super Pursuit engine initially in four-main bearing form and finally with the imported seven-main bearing unit, three-speed automatic transmission, and a padded dash along with carpets, perforated, colour-matched headlining, blower heater, screen washers, chrome-plated interior mirror, seven interior door-operated lights, and a handbrake on <b>warning</b> light <b>flasher</b> as standard. Vacuum-assisted disc brakes were standard in the Fairmont only and optional on other sedan and hardtop models.|$|R
40|$|Erroneous {{decisions}} by drivers to stop or {{go at the}} onset of yellow can lead to incidences of premature stopping or red light running, which in turn can cause severe rear end or right angle collisions. Because trucks or busses are relatively less maneuverable, have lower available acceleration and lower comfortable deceleration rates, and have a higher line of sight than do passenger vehicles, the risk of crashes is higher for trucks than other vehicles upon stop or go situations. Dilemma zone protection systems are used at high speed intersection s to enhance safety; however, such systems are generally designed around the dilemma zone boundaries of cars, and are static, lacking the intelligence to adapt to existing traffic, weather, or visibility conditions. The current research examined the effect of information systems such as advance <b>warning</b> <b>flashers</b> (AWFs) on the probability of conflict at onset yellow at high-speed intersections. A probit modeling technique was used to establish dilemma zone boundaries. Based on dilemma zone boundaries, probability of perceived conflict curves were computed and compared against actual conflicts that were observed at each of the studied intersections. This information was used to generate {{a better understanding of the}} risks associated with the use of AWFs. Results demonstrated that the provision of stop/go information that was consistent with the actual duration of yellow reduced the variability of driver decision making and reduced the dilemma hazard. When no information was provided to drivers, the critical time threshold for stopping was very close to the actual duration of yellow. These findings implied that drivers were inclined to stop when the time to stop bar was greater than the duration of yellow, and were inclined to go when the time to the stop bar was less than the duration of yellow. This concept was used to develop a prototype Yellow Onset Driver Assistance (YODA) system, consisting of a pole-mounted unit (StreetWave) and an in-vehicle unit (MobiWave). The in-vehicle unit was designed to request decision assistance from the pole-mounted unit as a truck approaches an intersection; based on the time to the stop bar and the duration of yellow, the YODA system advises drivers on whether or not it is safe to proceed through the intersection...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) research project SPR-P 1 (11) M 307, which evaluated the traffic operations and safety effects of 5 mph and 10 mph speed limit reductions in the vicinity of high-speed, signalized intersections with advance <b>warning</b> <b>flashers</b> (AWF). The methodology involved two studies: 1) field study of the impact of speed limit reduction at seven high-speed intersections, 2) crash analysis using the 10 -year history from 28 high-speed intersections. In the field study, traffic operational effects of the reduced speed limits were analyzed for seven high-speed, signalized intersections with AWF, using the Quantile regression model and Seemingly Unrelated Regression Estimation (SURE). The Quantile regression models indicated that reduction of speed limit from 60 mph to 55 mph did not lead to any statistically significant reduction in the 15 th, 50 th, or 85 th percentiles. It was found that a speed limit reduction from 65 mph to 55 mph led to a 4. 6 mph reduction in 85 th percentile speed. Also, the speed dispersion based on an inter-percentile range between 15 th and 85 th percentiles was reduced by 1. 4 mph {{in the vicinity of the}} intersection. SURE was used to estimate the mean and standard deviation of grouped average speeds simultaneously. The SURE model was chosen to account for any potential correlations between the mean and standard deviation of speed. It was found that a speed limit reduction of 10 mph, when the upstream speed limit was 65 mph, reduced the mean speed of vehicles by 3. 8 mph, or by six percent. This result was statistically significant at the 95 % percent level of confidence. It was also found that reducing the speed limit by 5 mph when the speed limit was 60 mph did not produce any statistically significant reduction in mean speed. In addition, the standard deviation of the speeds downstream of the speed limit sign was not statistically significantly different from the upstream for either 10 mph or 5 mph reductions. In the second study, a crash analysis based on 56 approaches from 28 intersections was performed to study the safety effects of speed limit reductions. The dataset included four approaches of 10 mph reduction from 65 mph to 55 mph, seven approaches of 5 mph reduction from 60 mph to 55 mph, two approaches of 5 mph reduction from 55 mph to 50 mph, and 43 approaches with no limit reduction (i. e., the control group). The 10 mph speed reduction from 65 to 55 mph was found to reduce, on average, 0. 4 crashes per approach per year with a 90 % level of confidence. Also, the studied approaches with 10 mph reduction were found to have a lower probability of possible injury crashes and a higher probability of possible damage crashes with a 90 % level of confidence. The 5 mph reductions from 60 mph to 55 mph and from 55 mph to 50 mph were found to reduce 0. 6 crashes per approach per year at a 95 % significance level. It was also found that lower speed limits in the vicinity of signalized intersections reduced the probability of fatal and injury crashes. The conclusions of this study, however, are limited by the low number of intersections with speed limit reductions. For example, only two intersections with 10 mph reduction were available for the study, where the speed limit was reduced from 65 mph to 55 mph. Based on this dataset, for a highway with speed limit at 65 mph, the reduction to 55 mph at intersections with AWF has been found to reduce mean speed and crash frequency, and alleviate possible crashes in comparison to the intersections with only AWF. It is recommended that future research include other speed limit combinations, such as a 5 mph reduction from 65 mph to 60 mph, and utilize larger datasets to provide better generalizability and transferability of results. A before and-after study could also provide partially controlled conditions to isolate the impacts of speed limit reduction...|$|R
40|$|A unique safety flasher {{powered by}} {{photovoltaic}} cells and ultracapacitors has been developed. Safety flashers are used wherever there are needs to mark actually or potentially hazardous locations. Examples of such locations include construction sites, highway work sites, and locations of hazardous operations. Heretofore, safety flashers have been powered by batteries, {{the use of}} which entails several disadvantages: Batteries must be kept adequately charged, and must {{not be allowed to}} become completely discharged. Batteries have rather short cycle lives, and their internal constituents that react chemically to generate electricity deteriorate (and hence power-generating capacities decrease) over time. The performances of batteries are very poor at low temperatures, which often occur in the circumstances in which safety flashers are most needed. The disposal of batteries poses a threat to the environment. The development of the present photovoltaic/ultracapacitor- powered safety flasher, in which the ultracapacitors are used to store energy, overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages of using batteries to store energy. The ultracapacitors in this <b>flasher</b> are electrochemical <b>units</b> that have extremely high volumetric capacitances because they contain large-surface-area electrodes separated by very small gaps. Ultracapacitors have extremely long cycle lives, as compared to batteries; consequently, it will never be necessary to replace the ultracapacitors in the safety flasher. The reliability of the flasher is correspondingly increased, and the life-of-system cost and the adverse environmental effects of the flasher are correspondingly reduced. Moreover, ultracapacitors have excellent low-temperature characteristics, are maintenance-free, and provide consistent performance over time...|$|R
