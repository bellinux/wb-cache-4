The tensile and {{flexural}} strengths of WPCs containing <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milling</b> WF had high strength by surface fibrous structure on WF [11, 12]. The strength did not improve in the WPCs containing dry ball-milling WF [13].

The X-ray diffraction pattern at room temperature indicated that the intercalation of potassium acetate into kaolinite causes an increase of the basal spacing from 0. 718 to 1. 42 nm, and with the particle size reduction, the surface area increased sharply with the intercalation and delamination by <b>ball-milling.</b> The <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milling</b> kaolinite after intercalation did not change the structural order, and the particulates have high aspect ratio according SEM images...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{synthetic}} {{methods for}} graphene based cathode materials, with low cost {{and in an}} environmentally friendly way, is necessary for industrial production. Although the precursor of graphene is abundant on the earth, the most common precursor of graphene is graphene oxide (GO), and it needs many steps and reagents for transformation to graphite. The traditional approach for the synthesis of GO needs many chemicals, thus leading to a high cost for production and potentially great amounts of damage to the environment. In this study, we develop a simple <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milling</b> method to construct a V 2 O 5 /graphene hybrid structure in which nanometre-sized V 2 O 5 particles/aggregates are well embedded and uniformly dispersed into the crumpled and flexible graphene sheets generated by in situ conversion of bulk graphite. The combination of V 2 O 5 nanoparticles/aggregates and in situ graphene leads the hybrid to exhibit a markedly enhanced discharge capacity, excellent rate capability, and good cycling stability. This study suggests that nanostructured metal oxide electrodes integrated with graphene can address the poor cycling issues of electrode materials that suffer from low electronic and ionic conductivities. This simple <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milling</b> method can potentially be used to prepare various graphene based hybrid electrodes for large scale energy storage applications...|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} {{studied the}} effects of adding CNF to WF on the properties of WF boards, {{with a focus on}} the binding effect of CNF in this system. <b>Wet</b> <b>ball-milling</b> of commercial cellulose powder {{led to the formation of}} nanostructured fibers with nano-sized surface fibrils. Increasing the pulverizing time or rotational rate reduced the particle size of the CNF. However, flocculation of the CNF particles could have occurred at long pulverizing times. The physical and mechanical properties of WF boards could be improved with the addition of CNF because of a binding effect between the CNF and WF particles.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNanostructured {{magnesium}} {{nickel oxide}} Mg 0. 6 Ni 0. 4 O and alumina Al 2 O 3 were studied as additives to sulphur/polyaniline (S/PANI) composites via <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milling</b> of sulphur and polyaniline followed by heat treatment. Metal oxide nanoparticles, which have small particle size, porous structure and high specific surface area to volume ratio, {{are expected to}} be catalytic for chemical reactions, including electron transfer and are able to adsorb lithium polysulphides. The composites were characterized by SEM and electrochemical methods. Cyclic voltammetry studies suggest that the alumina additive acts differently to the Mg 0. 6 Ni 0. 4 O. The results suggest that although the alumina additive improves the S/PANI composite performance as a lithium–sulphur battery cathode, the use of Mg 0. 6 Ni 0. 4 O is more effective...|$|R
40|$|Bismuth sodium {{titanate}} (Bi 0. 5 Na 0. 5 TiO 3, BNT) and its solid-solution with BaTiO 3 (BNT–BT) {{are promising}} lead-free piezoelectric ceramics. Around the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), the 0. 94 BNT– 0. 06 BT composition shows high piezoelectric performance. In this paper, we {{have investigated the}} effect of ZnO-doping on the reactive sintering and piezoelectric properties of 0. 94 BNT– 0. 06 BT ceramics. Bi 2 O 3, anhydrous Na 2 CO 3, TiO 2 (anatase), BaCO 3 and ZnO powders were <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milled</b> in ethanol, cold isostatically pressed at 200 MPa for 10 min, and reactively sintered at 1150 °C for 2 h in air. The relative density drastically increased from 83. 3 % (without ZnO) to 93. 7 % (with 0. 5 mol% ZnO). The sample with 0. 5 mol% ZnO showed the highest piezoelectric constant d 33 of 124 pC/N. Even by the one-step reactive sintering, the d 33 value was comparable {{with that of the}} two-step conventional sintering...|$|R
40|$|MgO-doped Al 2 TiO 5 {{ceramics}} were reactively sintered {{from commercial}} α-Al 2 O 3, TiO 2 anatase and MgCO 3 (basic) powders. Powder mixtures with molar ratio of Al 2 O 3 :TiO 2 :MgO = 1 : 1 : 0, 1 : 0. 95 : 0. 05, 1 : 0. 90 : 0. 10, and 1 : 0. 85 : 0. 15 were prepared by <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milling</b> with ZrO 2 media. The green pellets were sintered at 1300 – 1500 °C for 2 h in air to obtain dense samples. With changing the MgO doping amount, Al 2 TiO 5 /Al 2 O 3, Al 2 TiO 5 /MgAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 3, Al 2 TiO 5 /MgAl 2 O 4 composites were synthesized. MgO doping was effective {{to reduce the}} Al 2 TiO 5 matrix grain size and to reduce the strong anisotropy of Al 2 TiO 5, which resulted in fewer microcracks.

40|$|Micro-structured optical arrays (MOAs) are micro {{channels}} {{etched in}} silicon substrates {{and can be}} used as mirrors to reflect and focus X-rays. Piezoelectric PZT (lead zirconate titanate) thick films deposited on silicon substrates can be used to bend the micro channels to vary the focal length of the MOAs. Thick-film PZT is more robust and easier to pattern than bulk PZT so it is chosen to provide actuation for the MOAs. In this project the manufacturing processes of thick-film PZT on silicon substrates are investigated, including ball-milling of starting powders, paste composition, paste preparation, doctor blading method, sintering regime, and poling. The particle size and surface area of the starting powders were measured to see the effect of <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milling.</b> Active thick-film PZT samples on silicon substrates have been successfully made. The thick-film samples were characterised using d 33 measurement, impedance analysis, SEM, and XRD techniques. An average d 33 of 76 pC/N has been achieved. A feasible method to manufacture thick-film PZT on silicon substrates has been summarised.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the mechanical properties of wood/plastic composites (WPCs) produced using wood flour (WF) prepared by <b>wet</b> <b>ball-milling</b> under various milling times (0 – 120  min) and drying methods (freeze- or heat drying). The drying method did not affect the particle size distribution, shape, or specific surface area of WF at milling times shorter than 40  min. At milling[*]≥[*] 40  min, freeze-dried ball-milled WF (FDWF) had smaller particle sizes and higher specific surface area than heat-dried ball-milled WF (HDWF). The highest tensile strength and modulus of rupture (MOR) were observed in WPCs made from freeze- and heat-dried WF at a milling time of 30  min. At milling time of 30  min, the amount of 100 – 300  µm FDWF and HDWF was 37 % and 36 %, respectively. The impact strength of WPCs increased, as the milling time increased. The amount of small freeze- and heat-dried WF particles increased due to an increase in the amount of 17  µm particles and specific surface area with increased milling time. Thus, impact strength of WPCs increased as particle size decreased. At milling times[*]≤[*] 60  min, there were no significant differences in mechanical properties between WPCs containing freeze- and heat-dried WF under the condition of this study.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of the}} precursor film density during the development of the microstructure and photovoltaic properties of CuInSe 2 (CISe) thin films prepared from nanoparticulate precursors and to provide a simple but effective means to improve the density. In order to improve the packing density of a Cu&# 8211;In alloy nanocrystalline layer deposited by a doctor-blade method, a mild, <b>wet,</b> <b>ball-milling</b> technique is applied to colloidal ink without the use of organic additives or mechanical pressing. The focused ion beam milled cross-sections clearly show that the relative density of the precursor layers increases with an increase in the milling duration. The CISe thin films obtained by annealing the intermetallic layers with a relative density of 0. 78 exhibit extremely low porosity on the well-faceted surface, a thicker top layer with large grains in a typical double-layered structure, a uniform and planar surface morphology, and a thinner MoSe 2 layer. The transmission electron microscopy analysis also reveals that the nanocrystals in the bottom layer exist in the chalcopyrite CISe phase, forming a well-connected mesoporous network. As a result, the PV performance of low-bandgap (1. 0 eV) CISe solar cells is greatly improved, rendering a power conversion efficiency as high as 9. 32 %. Changes in the PV parameters induced by the increase in the relative density of the precursor layer are discussed in conjunction with the improved crystalline quality and the consequent improvements in diode characteristics, such as the series resistance, shunt conductance, and recombination current. close 0...|$|R
