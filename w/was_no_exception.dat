5|$|I think I was {{the first}} woman to play a marshal in a movie western. Roger would often cast against type in those days. I could never resist a plum role like a lady marshal in a genre that would never have {{considered}} such a gender reversal like that before. However, working with Roger was always an adventure and this film <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first sponsor {{to appear}} on Malmö FF's jerseys was local {{shipyard}} company Kockums in 1976, and since 1981 at least one sponsor logo has appeared on the club's kits. In the mid-1990s it became commonplace for Swedish clubs to have several shirt sponsors. Malmö FF <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception,</b> {{and this was the}} case until 2010 when the club returned to having only one sponsor logo on their kit.|$|E

5|$|Girdap's heyday {{was during}} the Balkan Wars and World War I (1912–1918), when it became the leading {{financial}} group in the kingdom and remained close to the government. It controlled some 83.97 million leva of invested capital, which put it ahead of the General Credit Society, the Balkan Bank and the Bulgarian Commercial Bank financial group. During the wars, Bulgarian banks established filial companies or invested in new enterprises. Girdap <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception</b> to that trend.|$|E
5|$|Gyeongju {{emerged as}} a {{railroad}} junction in the later years of the Japanese Occupation, as the Donghae Nambu Line and Jungang Line were established {{in preparation for the}} Second Sino-Japanese War and to exploit the rich resources of {{the eastern part of the}} Korean peninsula. Following liberation in 1945, Korea was plunged into turmoil, and Gyeongju <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception.</b> Returnees from abroad were numerous; a village for them was constructed in present-day Dongcheon-dong. In a period marked by widespread conflict and unrest, the Gyeongju area became particularly notorious for the level of guerrilla activity in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{of country}} estates became common around the 1920s. The annual tax payable had spiralled and was twenty {{times greater than}} in 1870 {{resulting}} in the break-up of many larger land-holdings. Pitfour <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception</b> and the dispersal of the estate continued piecemeal after the sequestration of George Arthur, the sixth laird. The main estate policies including the lake and other land were purchased by Bernard Drake in November 1926 when he bought Saplinbrae, the former minister's house. Drake was {{a partner in the}} electrical engineering company, Drake and Gorham.|$|E

5|$|The 1960s were {{a time of}} {{considerable}} student activism in the United Kingdom, and Bristol <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception.</b> In 1968, many students marched {{in support of the}} Anderson Report, which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the university). A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by Dorothy Hodgkin in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{season in}} the ACC was {{described}} as chaotic, and for Maryland, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception.</b> The Terrapins were within grasp of the ACC Atlantic Division championship {{at the end of}} Week 12, but lost their final two games and fell to a four-way tie for third place. Maryland closed the regular season with a 7–5 record—including four wins against Top 25-ranked teams—which was enough to secure bowl eligibility. In the postseason, Maryland defeated Nevada of the Western Athletic Conference in the Humanitarian Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have had}} great trouble {{determining}} the exact dispositions of the French fleet {{and even more}} trouble assessing the casualties it suffered in the battle. During The Terror then raging in France, bureaucracy broke down and consequently records were patchy or non-existent. The French Navy <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception</b> and few ship's logs have survived, making an accurate order of battle difficult to discern. Those estimates which are available are often the work of British naval officers at the battle whose accounts frequently differ. Casualties too are almost impossible to establish exactly. French sources published after the battle give a figure of 3,000, but this number does not include those captured, which amounted to 3,500 alone. British estimates aboard captured ships alone are of 1,500 casualties and most historians agree that total French losses during the month-long campaign were around 7,000, {{as opposed to the}} British losses estimated at between 1,100 and 1,500.|$|E

5|$|Paper {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} discoveries of ancient China. Beginning in the 3rd century BCE paper was made in all sizes with various materials. Silk <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception,</b> and silk workers had been making paper since the 2nd century BCE. Silk, bamboo, linen, wheat and rice straw were all used differently, and paper made with silk became the first type of luxury paper. Researchers have found an early example of writing done on silk paper in the tomb of a Marchioness who died around 168, in Mawangdui, Changsha, Hunan. The material was certainly more expensive, but also more practical than bamboo slips. Treatises on many subjects, including meteorology, medicine, astrology, divinity, and even maps written on silk have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Rage Software, {{developers}} of Incoming, were {{known for their}} cutting-edge graphics and effects. Incoming <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception.</b> The game utilized the 3dfx technology, and was included in some retail versions of the Voodoo2 graphics card. Critics were praising the game's visuals on its 1998 PC release. In particular, the explosions, similar special effects and cut scenes using the main game engine were noted for their quality. The Dolby Surround-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim. The reception, however, was less positive when the game was ported to the Dreamcast. A release title for Sega's console, critics complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range {{at the time of}} its late 1999 release, with the draw distance being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. An arcade version followed in 2003, running on the Vortek V3 Global VR arcade board, utilising the system's unique virtual reality hardware interface.|$|E
5|$|St. Louis {{suffered}} {{as much or}} more than comparable cities {{in the early years of}} the Great Depression. Manufacturing output fell by 57 percent between 1929 and 1933, slightly more than the national average of 55 percent, and output remained low until World War II. Unemployment during the Depression was high in most urban areas, and St. Louis <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception</b> (see table). Black workers in St. Louis, as in many cities, suffered significantly higher unemployment than their white counterparts. To aid the unemployed, the city allocated funds starting in 1930 toward relief operations. In addition to city relief aid, New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement construction jobs also reduced the number of persons on direct relief aid by the late 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. Lonergan liked to use the deus ex machina dramatic technique in {{the conclusion of the}} plots and this production <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>exception.</b> The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only cast credit claimed by Bowers is that of Marie Eline as the little girl. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. Known and more prominent members of the cast to appear in productions include the leading ladies, Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming, and the leading man was Frank H. Crane.|$|E
