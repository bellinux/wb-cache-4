40|$|Many {{physiological}} experiments involve switching {{between two}} or more solutions. For example, when drugs are applied to tissues the concentration of the drug is usually changed as a step function, by switching from a control saline to a saline containing the drug. There are many instances {{where it would be}} advantageous to change the concentration according to some other function such as a ramp. This paper describes how this has been achieved by a <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> under electronic control. The <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> (incorporating a Lee Products, solenoid valve No LFAX 050303 AC) was arranged to control the mixing of two solutions and thus vary the composition of the effluent stream. The composition of the solution leaving the output is directly proportional to the time that the valve allows each of the inputs to be connected to the output (Cook & Hokanson, 1976). The electronic circuit for control of the valve is shown in Fig. 1. Driving current for the valve is provided by TRX under control of a pulse width modulator, ICi Fig. 1 (A). Permanently connected to the non-inverting input of ICi is a triangula...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{synthesise}} {{and evaluate}} {{the evidence of the}} effectiveness of interventions to prevent scalds in children. MethodsAn overview of systematic reviews (SR) and a SR of primary studies were performed evaluating interventions to prevent scalds in children. A comprehensive literature search was conducted covering various resources up to October 2012. Experimental and controlled observational studies reporting scald injuries, safety practices and safety equipment use were included. ResultsFourteen systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included. There is little evidence that interventions are effective in reducing the incidence of scalds in children. More evidence was found that inventions are effective in promoting safe hot tap water temperature, especially when home safety education, home safety checks and discounted or free safety equipment including thermometers and thermostatic <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> were provided. No consistent evidence was found for the effectiveness of interventions on the safe handling of hot food or drinks nor improving kitchen safety practices. ConclusionEducation, home safety checks along with thermometers or thermostatic <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> should be promoted to reduce tap water scalds. Further research is needed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} interventions on scald injuries and to disentangle the effects of multifaceted interventions on scald injuries and safety practices...|$|R
