So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead.

Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

500|$|On the New Directions {{collaboration}} with Sue on [...] "Sing", Futterman wrote, [...] "By turning down {{the rock and}} bringing in a choral element, the song actually came off as a great anthem for the bunch of misfits that is the New Directions. <b>We</b> <b>kind</b> of wish they had put on their choir robes instead and fully embraced the arrangement."

500|$|... "The Ring" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It was first broadcast on March 11, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central, and then aired two days later on satellite Paramount Comedy in the United Kingdom. It was the first episode of South Parks thirteenth season and the first episode to be broadcast in high-definition (HD). Parker and Stone argued over whether to start the season with a Jonas Brothers episode or a show about the economic recession, which they had been planning to do for some time. Stone argued they should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. An episode about the economy entitled [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was shown later in the season. By March 8, three days before the episode premiered, the script was only half-finished and the animation was not yet complete, in keeping with the practice of show creators Parker and Matt Stone to finish episodes upon last-minute deadlines; Stone said of the practice, [...] "We don't do a live show, but <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of harness some of that energy. <b>We</b> <b>kind</b> of need that to work. We're, like, 'We have to do something right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" ...|$|E

[...] When {{an interview}} for his cover story shared with, Idol runner-up, Adam Lambert, Allen explained, [...] "It's a song that has a really good message-that we only have so much time, let's make the most of it.

He described the concept as [...] "silly", and insisted that it was not used. He later explained that the [...] "problem was that it was virtually impossible to come up with a sensible explanation and so <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of did a lot of hand waving on this episode". The use of the term RVN was only created after executive producer Rick Berman requested something similar to DNA. Regarding the method in which the characters were restored to adulthood, he said [...] "Let's not even talk about it. Let's just forget that ever happened."

500|$|U2 {{developed}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] from a {{song called}} [...] "Scott Walker," [...] an outtake from the band's 1997 album Pop. This incarnation, written as an homage to the singer of the same name, was only an outline when the recording sessions for Pop concluded. The group reworked it in preparation for their 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, but the song was still unfinished when that album was released. They rewrote the song for their 2004 album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "There was a melody and a groove that ultimately didn't go anywhere and <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of threw out everything, found chords that worked with that melody and built it back up, new drum parts, new bass parts, new guitars." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Masterpiece" [...] is a midtempo pop ballad {{featuring}} basic {{recording and}} production by Orbit. It {{was recorded in}} two locations, 3:20 Studios, Los Angeles, California and MSR Studios, New York, New York. Madonna reflected on the recording sessions with Orbit: [...] "We've worked on stuff {{for so many years}} that <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of finish each other's sentences. He knows my taste and what I like. Magic happens when we get into a recording studio together." [...] Additional production came from Harry, who also played acoustic guitars, keyboards, vocoder and did the programming for the track. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon mixed and engineered the song with help from Frank Filipetti, while Angie Teo did additional engineering and editing. Other personnel working on [...] "Masterpiece" [...] was Ron Taylor who did protools editing and further editing from Stephen [...] "The Koz" [...] Kozmeniuk.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} bass, drums and guitar, several other {{instruments}} were used during recording including a dulcimer (for its [...] "sixties spy movie sound"), an electric saz (on [...] "Into the Night"), an [...] "electric-sitar box" [...] ("Like a drum machine for Indian musicians") and a harpsichord which, according to Guto Pryce, was {{used on a}} lot of songs [...] "because it was there , and it was more in tune than the pianos". The latter had a strong influence on the album with Rhys stating: [...] "when we found the harpsichord everything started to go 1960s... and <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of followed that feeling..." [...] Although Gruff Rhys had initially told fans to expect a [...] "speaker-blowing" [...] LP the addition of instruments such as the harpsichord meant this was not the case; the album instead highlights the band's [...] "musical sweet tooth".|$|E

500|$|At the 2015 New York Comic Con, Muto {{revealed}} that the miniseries originated with ideas that were initially developed during the show's second season. He remarked, [...] "There was this idea from season two about Marceline and ... how she got her powers to begin with. <b>We</b> <b>kind</b> of rolled with that and expanded that into eight episodes." [...] Olson was not aware that the producers and writers were working on a Marceline-centric miniseries until the series' head writer, Kent Osborne, casually mentioned it {{to her in a}} conversation; when she learned of this, she reportedly cried because she was so excited. Due to the Marceline-centric nature of the miniseries, a new opening was created that features Olson singing the theme song over a bass guitar. This intro was storyboarded by Tom Herpich and was animated by Masaaki Yuasa's company Science SARU.|$|E

[...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears's {{relationship}} {{of three years}} with pop singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002 after months of speculation. In November 2002, Timberlake released the song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors {{that she had been}} unfaithful to him. [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] is often credited as being the song that propelled the album into the charts. In September 2001, Annet Artani accepted to become a backing vocalist for Spears's 2001–2002 Dream Within a Dream Tour. Her interactions with Spears during most of the tour were limited to small conversations at the gym and vocal warm ups. Artani had begun a relationship with the show's musical director during 2002; however, it was not working out well {{by the end of the}} tour. Before the last date in Mexico City, Spears called her and asked about the relationship. Artani told her they were going to break up, to which Spears responded, [...] "Don't worry about it, you're going to hang out with me". Following the end of the tour, Spears and Artani began to forge a friendship. Spears invited Artani to her house in Los Angeles, California. According to Artani, their relationship grew out of their shared romantic experiences at the time. She explained, [...] "Basically, we commiserated because she, at that time, had broken up with Justin [...] Maybe like nine months before, but of course it was really fresh in the media. I was just breaking up with this guy, so <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of like—I think <b>we</b> <b>kind</b> of needed each other." [...] Artani stayed at Spears's house for a few weeks, in which they started writing songs at the piano. Shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Artani added, [...] "It was me and her, her stylist and Felicia, and we had this humongous house to ourselves, and they had a piano there as well".|$|E
