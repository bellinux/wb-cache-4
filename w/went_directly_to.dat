In April 1987, the Supreme Court overturned Andrew's conviction with a ruling that his confession had been coerced involuntarily from him while under duress. It ordered a new trial.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Rechtschool in 1920, Soeprapto <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> working at the Landraad (court for Native Indonesians) in his hometown. For fifteen years he worked at Landraad in various locations, {{including}} in Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung, and Denpasar. He eventually rose to Head of the Landraad in Cirebon and Kuningan, serving from 1937 to 1941. From there, he transferred to the Landraad for Salatiga and Boyolali, then to Besuki, before settling {{as head of the}} landraad in Pekalongan. While in Pekalongan, Soeprapto befriended a local prosecutor Soekarjo Kario Hatmodjo, father of Hoegeng.|$|E
5|$|In 1341, King Edward III visited Norwich for a jousting tournament, {{coinciding with}} the {{completion}} of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, Isabella of France, were very impressed by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of the market to the city in perpetuity. The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E

5|$|Some of the temple's {{supplies}} {{came from}} direct donations by the king. In the New Kingdom, when Egypt was an imperial power, these donations often {{came out of}} the spoils of the king's military campaigns or the tribute given by his client states. The king might also levy various taxes that <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> support a temple. Other revenue came from private individuals, who offered land, slaves, or goods to temples in exchange for a supply of offerings and priestly services to sustain their spirits in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Verdi had {{intended}} to return to Italy in early 1848, but was prevented by work and illness, as well as, most probably, by his increasing attachment to Strepponi. Verdi and Strepponi left Paris in July 1849, the immediate cause being an outbreak of cholera, and Verdi <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> Busseto to continue work on completing his latest opera, Luisa Miller, for a production in Naples later in the year.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} and {{managing}} days, Speaker was an entrepreneur and salesman. By 1937, Speaker had opened a wholesale liquor business {{and worked as}} a state sales representative for a steel company. He chaired Cleveland's boxing commission between 1936 and 1943. Newspaper coverage credited Speaker with several key reforms to boxing in Cleveland, including the recruitment of new officials and protections against fight fixing. Under Speaker, fight payouts <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> boxers rather than managers. Speaker sorted out a scheduling conflict for a 1940 boxing match in Cleveland involving former middleweight champion Teddy Yarosz. Yarosz defeated Jimmy Reeves in ten rounds and the fight attracted over 8,300 spectators.|$|E

5|$|Although they {{recorded}} {{all income}} {{that came through}} the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.|$|E
5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's {{pharmacology}} {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would normally have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly {{a side effect of}} the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote a report of the findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties for the drug (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|E
5|$|The {{last round}} of matches, {{featuring}} {{all three of}} the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who <b>went</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a team effort saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in the thirties from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.|$|E
