[...] Blackmun subscribed to the idea of color consciousness, declaring that, [...] "in order to get beyond racism, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>first</b> take account of race. There is no other way.

As we shall see, the emphasis they placed on, for example, the celibacy of the clergy or the action effected in the sacrament, was itself intricately bound up with their expectations of judgment.

However, Man Chong ignored them and did everything by the book. A few days later, Man Chong reported to Cao Cao: [...] "Yang Biao had nothing to say when I interrogated him. Before executing a criminal, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>first</b> produce evidence of his guilt and show it to the public. Yang Biao is a reputable man.

I hope you will reconsider your decision carefully and not be too hasty in ordering Yang Biao's execution." [...] Cao Cao then released Yang Biao. Xun Yu and Kong Rong were initially angry with Man Chong when they found out that he tortured Yang Biao during the interrogation. However, they became more amiable towards him after they heard what he told Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|Academics such as Diamond (2005) Wirthlin (2009) take {{exception}} {{to the role of}} [...] "hot lesbian" [...] in advertisements, and what has turned lesbianism into a commodity. As Diamond (2005) states, [...] "media representations signal a new appreciation and celebration of women's sexual freedom and diversity. On the other hand this is not necessarily the case...by portraying it as a fashionable 'add on' to otherwise conventional heterosexuality" [...] (p.105). They argue that women view these advertisements and images as a true reflection of {{what it is to be}} lesbian, thus making it much harder for real lesbians to acknowledge their sexuality. Furthermore, Wirthlin (2009) points out that, [...] "In order to resist this <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>first</b> recognize the ubiquitous presence of [...] "fad" [...] lesbian images and then problematize their use in popular culture. Next, there needs to be an active resistance against these images through counterculture advertisements and the performative act of resistance, such as through the act of writing as oneself, by utilizing multiple voices and subjectivities" [...] (p.113). In both academics view, lesbian or bi-sexual women must be sure of what media means to them, and call into question things that do not appear [...] "authentic". Lesbians must also be educated on the topic of the [...] "hot lesbian", and ensure they do not fall into the [...] "heteronormative appropriation" [...] of advertising's effects.|$|E
