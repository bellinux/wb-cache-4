40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} within the Stellifer group of <b>weakfishes</b> (Stellifer, Odontoscion, Ophioscion, and Bairdiella) were evaluated using 2723 base pairs comprising sequences of nuclear (rhodopsin, TMO- 4 C 4, RAG- 1) and mitochondrial (16 S rRNA and COI) markers obtained from specimens of nine species. Our results indicate {{a close relationship}} between Bairdiella and Odontoscion, and also that the genus Stellifer is not monophyletic, but rather that it consists of two distinct lineages, one clade containing S. microps/S. naso/S. brasiliensis and the other, S. rastrifer/S. stellifer/Stellifer sp. B, which is closer to Ophioscion than the former clade. The O. punctatissimus populations from {{the northern and southern}} Brazilian coast were also highly divergent in both nuclear (0. 8 % for rhodopsin and 0. 9 % for RAG- 1) and mitochondrial sequences (2. 2 % for 16 S rRNA and 7. 3 % for COI), which we conclude is consistent with the presence of two distinct species. The morphological similarities {{of the members of the}} Stellifer group is reinforced by the molecular data from both the present study and previous analyses, which have questioned the taxonomic status of the Stellifer group. If, on the one hand, the group is in fact composed of four genera (Stellifer, Ophioscion, Odontoscion, and Bairdiella), one of the two Stellifer clades should be reclassified as a new genus. However, if the close relationship and the reduced genetic divergence found within the group is confirmed in a more extensive study, including representatives of additional taxa, this, together with the morphological evidence, would support downgrading the whole group to a single genus. Obviously, these contradictory findings reinforce the need for a more systematic taxonomic revision of the Stellifer group as a whole...|$|E

40|$|New {{information}} on <b>weakfish</b> introduction vectors, its invasive status, distribution, and {{use as a}} fishing resource arose {{after the publication of}} “The transatlantic introduction of <b>weakfish</b> Cynoscion regalis (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) (Sciaenidae, Pisces) into Europe” by Morais and Teodósio (2016). Currently, the first known report of <b>weakfish</b> in Europe dates back to September 2009, with a specimen captured in the Schelde estuary (Belgium/The Netherlands). This fact suggests that <b>weakfish</b> could have been introduced into Europe via multiple and independent ballast water introduction events, and not through a point-source introduction event with subsequent dispersion as previously hypothesized. It is also unlikely that Schelde <b>weakfish</b> migrated southwards to colonize Iberian aquatic ecosystems. <b>Weakfish</b> have established a population in the Gulf of Cádiz region and have already reached an invasive status in the Sado estuary (Portugal). <b>Weakfish</b> were also captured in several other locations along the Portuguese coast, including the Tagus and Mira estuaries at least since 2013 or 2014, and the Ria Formosa lagoon in 2017. Tagus anglers caught <b>weakfish</b> specimens of ~ 1 kg and ~ 40 cm in November 2016, which corresponds to fish of 3 + years of age in the native range. The presence of <b>weakfish</b> in the Tagus estuary is still fairly unknown to local anglers. Sado <b>weakfish</b> has already been sold in local fish markets in southern Portugal for 3 to 10 € kg− 1. However, we consider that the <b>weakfish</b> sale price is underrated in comparison with other wild species (e. g., meagre, seabass, gilthead seabream). Increasing sale price will convince fishers to use <b>weakfish</b> as a new fishing resource; however, it is necessary to promote the species among consumers and evaluate consumers’ preference in respect to other species.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the physicochemical, biochemical and functional characteristics of both the myofibrils (MF) and actomyosin (AM) of squid mantle (Illex argentinus) and <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion guatucupa) muscles, and evaluate the influence of the addition of myofibrilar proteins from the squid mantle on the physicochemical and functional properties of those of the <b>weakfish.</b> After extraction, purification and characterization of the MF and AM of both species, emulsions of each protein fraction from each muscle were formulated. Mixtures of the MF or AM of both species were also analyzed. The emulsifying properties were monitoring using the Emulsifying Activity Index (EAI) and Emulsion Stability (ES). In addition, gel pastes were formulated from the squid mantle, <b>weakfish</b> muscle and the mixture of both species, and the following functional properties of the gels assessed: water holding capacity, colour, textural profile analysis (TPA) (hardness, elasticity, cohesiveness, gumminess) and gel strength. The EAI values of emulsions formulated with the MF of the mantle were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than those formulated from those of <b>weakfish.</b> The incorporation of squid MF in the mixture increased the EAI values. Conversely, the highest ES values were obtained with <b>weakfish</b> MF, and the incorporation of MF <b>weakfish</b> in the mixture increased the ES values. Similar EAI and ES behaviours were observed for the AM of the corresponding species. Irrespective of the thermal treatment, the gel strength of the gelled paste of squid muscle was significantly (p< 0. 05) lower than that of <b>weakfish</b> muscle and of those obtained with the different mixtures. The behaviours of the expressible moisture (EM) from the gelled pastes were similar to those of gel strength. Irrespective of the thermal treatment, the pastes formulated with a high weakfish: mantle ratio showed less water loss. The gelled pastes of squid mantle showed the highest values for whiteness (WI) and the incorporation of squid muscle protein improved the WI of the mixtures...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} how morphological {{differences in}} the auditory periphery of teleost fishes may relate to hearing capabilities. Two species of western Atlantic sciaenids were examined: <b>weakfish</b> (Cynoscion regalis, Block and Schneider) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus, Lacepede). These species differ in the anatomical relationship between the swim bladder and the inner ear. In <b>weakfish,</b> the swim bladder has a pair of anterior horns that terminate close to the ear, {{while there are no}} extensions of the swim bladder in spot. Thus, the swim bladder in spot terminates at a greater distance from the ear when compared to <b>weakfish.</b> With the use of the auditory brainstem response technique, Cynoscion regalis were found to detect frequencies up to 2000 Hz, while Leiostomus xanthurus detected up to 700 Hz. There were, however, no significant interspecific differences in auditory sensitivity for stimuli between 200 and 700 Hz.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the isotopic {{composition}} in muscle of striped <b>weakfish</b> Cynoscion guatucupa from Southwest Atlantic Ocean in order to evaluate a possible variation in δ 13 C and δ 15 N in response to dietary shifts that occur as animals grow. We also explored for isotopic evidence of differences between sample locations. The results showed an agreement between isotope analysis and previous conventional studies. Differences in the isotope composition between sampling location were not observed. A positive relation exists between isotope values and total body length of the animals. The Cluster analysis defined three groups of size classes, validated by the MDS. Differences in the relative consumption of prey species in each size class were also observed performing isotope mixing models (SIAR). Variation in δ 15 N among size classes would be associated with the consumption of a different type of prey as animals grow. Small striped <b>weakfish</b> feed on small crustaceans and progressively increase their consumption of fish (anchovy, Engraulis anchoita), increasing by this way their isotope values. On the other hand, differences in δ 13 C values seemed to be related to age-class specific spatial distribution patterns. Therefore, large and small striped <b>weakfish</b> remain specialized but feeding on different prey at different trophic levels. These results contribute to the study of the diet of striped <b>weakfish,</b> improve the isotopic ecology models and highlight on the importance of accounting for variation in the isotopic composition in response to dietary shifts with the size of one of the most important fishery resources in the region...|$|R
