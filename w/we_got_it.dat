5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> right.|$|E

25|$|The {{package was}} aimed at {{attracting}} viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone, 7:00p.m. elsewhere), and was conceived {{as a result of}} the FCC's loosening of the Prime Time Access Rule, legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void. The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy! and Hollywood Squares. Marblehead Manor, <b>We</b> <b>Got</b> <b>It</b> Made and You Can't Take It With You were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. Out of This World ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.|$|E

Miller was a fan of McBride's novel prior to learning of the film adaptation by Lee. He fought hard to win the role of Sam, which resulted in him physically preparing for the part: “My physical prep was a little different than everybody else’s, because Spike wanted me for the movie, but he told me I had to lose weight to do it.

500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Sednaoui. Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took {{inspiration}} from Nobuyoshi Araki's work, {{and tried to}} convey a similar aesthetic to the photoshoot. The cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-coloured lights, dressed in a blue Véronique Leroy mini dress. Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album, Sednaoui had to photograph a separate artwork and dedicate it to those editions. The lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark. In order to create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed himself in a black body suit so he couldn't {{be seen in the}} final shot. However, Minogue remarked that [...] "the shoot was so very difficult but we knew that once <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> right it would be amazing." ...|$|E

In an interview with Corey Moss of MTV, Rihanna explained the concept behind the inspiration for the video, saying, [...] "We just wanted to reconnect with my peers, let them know I'm still a teen, I still have friends– but to make something provocative. The '' and 'Unfaithful' [...] were so out there, so we pulled it back a little bit. I'm chilling with my girls some." [...] The singer continued to talk about the choreographic content, saying, [...] "I'm dancing , like technical dance, which was a challenge... It usually takes years to learn, but <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> done in a few days. And it was beautifully shot."

Raised by penguins of an abandoned zoo, thirty-three years later, he returns for revenge along with the Red Triangle Circus Gang after being cheated by businessman Max Shreck. DeVito was suggested for the role by his friend Jack Nicholson after the financial success of the first film, in which Nicholson played The Joker. According to DeVito, [...] "It was four-and-a-half hours of makeup and getting into the costume. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> down to three hours {{by the end of the}} shoot". Dustin Hoffman was originally the first choice to play The Penguin, but he declined. Apart from Hoffman, famous actors Marlon Brando, John Candy, Bob Hoskins, Ralph Waite, Dean Martin, Dudley Moore, Alan Rickman, John Goodman, Christopher Lee, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta, Gabriel Byrne, Alex Rocco and Christopher Lloyd were all considered for the part before DeVito got it.|$|E

[...] Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, however, required extensive make-up. McDiarmid remarked {{in an interview}} with Star Wars Insider magazine, [...] "Yes—that was a four-hour job, initially, although <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> down to about two-and-a-half in the end.

500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". It was particularly challenging for animators to design the complex scheme of lights during the episode's disco club scene. Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said it {{took one of the}} technical directors [...] "about half a day" [...] to set up the brief scene. Parker said he was particularly happy with the animation in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", and said he believed the series was starting to settle into the defined look it has retained throughout the years. Parker said, [...] "I think that this was where we finally felt like <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> right, we got the look of it right". However, the animation includes some perspective errors, particularly during the football scenes, where Chef stands about as wide as a 10-yard marking on the field. Parker said the animators worked for a long time on the snow in the outdoor scenes, but ultimately decided they did not like how it came out.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

[...] According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] is played in the key of D minor and the track's time signature is common time. The song, which is cited as being a pop song, has a moderately slow tempo of 90 beats per minute. Instruments used include a piano and guitar. Jon Pareles stated that Jackson was calling himself [...] "a victim of police brutality" [...] and a [...] "victim of hate". He continued, [...] "A listener might wonder just who 'Us' is supposed to be... To make the songs lodge in the ear, Jackson uses elementary singsong melodies – a 'nyah, nyah' two-note motif in 'They Don't Care About Us'... and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements".|$|E
