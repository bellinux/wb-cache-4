He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his flamethrower.|$|E
5|$|As Bristol {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 20th century, {{the need for a}} new station to serve the outskirts grew, and on 29 August 1927, the Great Western Railway opened a station at Parson Street, named Parson Street Halt. There were two platforms, one {{on each side of the}} two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms were made of wood, <b>with</b> <b>access</b> from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the history}} of the various railways, Paddington is served by four London Underground lines through two {{separate}} stations: the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines have a combined sub-surface and deep-level station on Praed Street to the south of the main line station, and the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines have a sub-surface station <b>with</b> <b>access</b> from Paddington Basin to the north. Circle line services run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN began {{promoting}} audience interaction {{early in}} its history, by the regular incorporation of viewer telephone calls in its programming. It has since expanded into social media. In March 2009, viewers began submitting questions live via Twitter to guests on C-SPAN's morning call-in show Washington Journal. The network {{also has a}} Facebook page to which it added occasional live streaming in January 2011. The live stream is intended to show selected well-publicized events of Congress.

5|$|Central to the {{structure}} and plot {{of the show is}} the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire. Salon.com described the title {{as a metaphor for the}} viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police <b>with</b> <b>access</b> to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.|$|E
40|$|Aims To {{assess whether}} radial {{compared}} <b>with</b> femoral <b>access</b> is associated <b>with</b> consistent outcomes {{in patients with}} ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Methods and results In the Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by TRansradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of angioX (MATRIX) programme patients were randomized to radialor femoral access, stratified by STEMI (2001 radial, 2009 femoral) and NSTE-ACS (2196 radial, 2198 femoral). The 30 -day co-primaryoutcomes were {{major adverse cardiovascular events}} (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and net adverse clinical events (NACE), defined as MACEor major bleeding In the overall study population, radial access reduced the NACE but not MACE endpoint at the prespecified 0. 025 alpha. MACE occurred in 121 (6. 1 %) STEMI patients <b>with</b> radial <b>access</b> vs. 126 (6. 3 %) patients <b>with</b> femoral <b>access</b> [rate ratio (RR) = 0. 96, 95 % CI = 0. 75 - 1. 24; P = 0. 76] and in 248 (11. 3 %) NSTE-ACS patients <b>with</b> radial <b>access</b> vs. 303 (13. 9 %) <b>with</b> femoral <b>access</b> (RR = 0. 80, 95 % CI = 0. 67 - 0. 96; P = 0. 016) (Pint = 0. 25). NACE occurred in 142 (7. 2 %) STEMI patients <b>with</b> radial <b>access</b> and in 165 (8. 3 %) patients <b>with</b> femoral <b>access</b> (RR = 0. 86, 95 % CI = 0. 68 - 1. 08; P = 0. 18) and in 268 (12. 2 %) NSTE-ACS patients <b>with</b> radial <b>access</b> compared <b>with</b> 321 (14. 7 %) <b>with</b> femoral <b>access</b> (RR = 0. 82, 95 % CI = 0. 69 - 0. 97; P = 0. 023) (Pint = 0. 76). All-cause mortality and access site-actionable bleeding favoured radial access irrespective of ACS type (Pint = 0. 11 and Pint = 0. 36, respectively). Conclusion Radial as compared <b>with</b> femoral <b>access</b> provided consistent benefit across the whole spectrum of patients with ACS, without evidence that type of presenting syndrome affected the results of the random access allocation...|$|R
50|$|Any client {{entering}} a wireless network must first authenticate <b>with</b> an <b>access</b> point (AP) and is thereafter associated <b>with</b> that <b>access</b> point. When the client leaves {{it sends a}} deauthentication, or deauth, message to disassociate itself <b>with</b> the <b>access</b> point. An attacker can send deauth messages to an access point tied to client IP addresses thereby knocking the users off-line and requiring continued re-authenticate, giving the attacker valuable insight into the reauthentication handshaking that occurs.|$|R

5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, <b>with</b> <b>access</b> to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
