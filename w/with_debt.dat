5|$|As the war ended, the Holt {{company was}} left with huge surplus {{inventories}} of heavy-duty tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the war by the Holt Company's primary competitor, C.L.Best. The company decided to focus instead on heavy construction equipment and sought {{to capitalize on the}} passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. Laden <b>with</b> <b>debt</b> and needing more capital to switch its product line, the company struggled to move forward.|$|E

5|$|The post-millennium {{period has}} seen {{changes to the}} way the club is run as a {{business}}. When a new business management team was appointed {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season, it inherited a business saddled <b>with</b> <b>debt.</b> The subsequent turnaround has resulted in operational profitability based on the disposal of non-core property assets, a new equity investment and a financial restructuring agreement with lenders for all debt to be repaid within five years. In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed <b>with</b> <b>debt</b> from which he was never able to recover.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, his cocaine {{addiction}} intensified. Jennings {{claimed to have}} spent $1,500 a day on his habit, draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt <b>with</b> <b>debt</b> up to $2.5million. Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional tours to earn the funds, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated. Jennings decided to quit his addictions, leased {{a home in the}} Phoenix area, and spent a month detoxing himself, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward. In 1984, he quit cocaine. Jennings claimed that his son Shooter was his main inspiration to quit permanently.|$|E

5|$|However, the Orioles {{struggled}} <b>with</b> <b>debt.</b> Joe Kelley, star {{player for}} the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, {{reported that the}} team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and John McGraw. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder, owning 201 of the team's 400 shares. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold {{his interest in the}} Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman released McGann, McGraw, Cy Seymour, Roger Bresnahan, Joe Kelley, Joe McGinnity, and Jack Cronin from their contracts with Orioles. Freedman signed McGann, Bresnahan, McGinnity and Cronin to the Giants, joining McGraw, who had signed with the Giants ten days earlier. Brush signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds.|$|E

He helped the club to win promotion as champions in 1949–50, before {{he moved on to}} Brentford in March 1952 for a club record £16,000. In January 1953, Brentford appointed him player-manager, though he would only remain in charge for nine months. He joined Arsenal as a player in November 1953 for £10,000, where he saw out the remainder of his playing career. He had a promising start to his managerial career by leading Kettering Town to the Southern League title in 1956–57, but then only had two more seasons as manager, getting relegated with Notts County in 1957–58 and then relegated with Kettering Town in 1963–64. During the 1970s he struggled <b>with</b> <b>debt</b> and related legal problems, which were reported in the media {{as an example of a}} celebrated person having fallen from grace.|$|E

25|$|Although some {{privatization}} {{has been}} gradually done, {{there are still}} several state-owned companies of importance. The government keeps them as strategic assets or because they are natural monopoly. These include e.g. Neste Oil, VR Group (rail), Finnair, VTT (research) and Itella (mail). Depending on the strategic importance, the government may hold either 100%, 51% or less than 50% stock. Most of these have been transformed into regular limited companies, but some are quasi-governmental (liikelaitos), <b>with</b> <b>debt</b> backed by the state, {{as in the case}} of VTT.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were African American.

Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, however, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by personal labor.|$|E

He also incurred debt in helping support his only surviving daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, and her large family. She had separated from her husband, who had become abusive from alcoholism and mental illness (according to different sources), and brought her family to live at Monticello.|$|E
