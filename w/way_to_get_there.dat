25|$|Third, Searle {{argues that}} much of {{rational}} deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, {{not the other way}} around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a desire to go to Paris greater than that of saving money and calculate the cheapest <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) they value more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and our system of rules derives from finding patterns in what we see as rational.|$|E

At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss."

Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> and basically offered me a ride somewhere.

As the sun was to the outside dweller, this wall was to him the sun of his world. It attracted him as a candle attracts a moth. He was always striving to attain it. The life that was so swiftly expanding within him, urged him continually toward the wall of light. The life that was within him knew that it was the one way out, the way he was predestined to tread. But he himself did not know anything about it. He did not know there was any outside at all.|$|E

The trailhead can also be reached by descending from Marcy to the north, or via Panther Gorge and Elk Lake to the southeast, all very lengthy trips that are usually done via an overnight backpack.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Health {{and safety}} is a {{promising}} issue for organizing workers, whether as new members or in revitalizing local unions. Working conditions have dramatically deteriorated {{over the past}} decade, and millions of workers now work in workplaces that are unbelievably dangerous and unhealthy. There are many different organizing strategies. The authors start from the premise that from day one the goal of any organizing campaign is union building. Recognizing that <b>there</b> are different <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> and that resources and circumstances differ from campaign to campaign, we attempt in this article to outline the basic ingredients and a general strategic approach. While our focus here is on organizing new members, the general approach we outline is equally effective for union building in already constituted local unions...|$|R

Multi-channel retailers are most successful when they define distinct roles for each channel, use the Web creatively as a customer acquisition tool, and work hard at converting browsers to buyers. <b>To</b> help <b>get</b> this last part right, the authors isolate key defection points – critical moments when retailers are apt to lose customers.

40|$|European {{foreign policy}} towards the MMENA region has shifted {{in the past}} two decades, from a more {{comprehensive}} approach, as the one represented by the Barcelona process, to the European Neighbourhood Policy. This shift had several implications for the kind of democracy to be promoted: from a comprehensive, holistic conception of democracy, the ENP espoused a more limited reading, mainly focusing on rule of law reforms in the judicial system and refraining from adopting even soft forms of conditionality. Also, in terms of democratization strategies, it implied a mixture of the standard modernization thesis and sequentialism, two approaches sharing the postponement of political democracy as a secondary goal. Both trends were further enhanced by the adoption of the 2008 Union for the Mediterranean. The revision of the ENP following the Arab Awakening signals the re-framing of discourses on conditionality and democracy, towards a more political understanding of reforms albeit with limited changes in terms of the <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there...</b>|$|R
