5|$|Despite Dean's {{significant}} damage, it did {{not have}} severe effects on infrastructure, and the non-agricultural sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly. Most cruise lines diverted their ships away from the Western Caribbean in anticipation of Hurricane Dean's passage, though by August 27 all <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> schedule, except those with damaged ports in Belize and the Yucatán. The Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines, as their ports opened within days.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow {{declared}} a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. Consolidated Edison (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in Westchester. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in Tarrytown, New York, was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. Metro-North Railroad suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> schedule by 7:00p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{offensive}} began and Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because {{of the dangers of}} the bomb exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was split open. The operations did last long and by August 1944 the Mosquitoes <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> bomber support missions.|$|E

5|$|On 17 November, the RhAR was {{withdrawn}} {{for a period}} of rest and recuperation (R). The battalion's Transport Platoon was ambushed by communist guerrillas as it was returning to base: a shot through the windscreen of one of the two trucks nearly hit its driver, but the convoy was able to escape the ambush without anybody being injured. On 26 November, the RhAR and the King's Own Scottish Borderers assisted the local police at Kelapa Sawit in an action called Tartan Rock: the security forces moved into the village and arrested 34 communist sympathisers, most of whom were ethnic Chinese students from the University of Malaya in Singapore. Two days later, the RhAR <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> regular duty.|$|E
5|$|There {{were six}} protests on 1 April 2009: a {{security}} operation at ExCeL London, a Stop the War march, a Free Tibet protest outside the Chinese Embassy, a People & Planet protest, a Climate Camp protest, and a protest outside the Bank of England. Over 4,000 protesters {{were at the}} Climate Camp and the same number at the Bank of England. On 1 April over 5,500 police officers were deployed and the following day 2,800, {{at a cost of}} £7.2 million. Officers worked 14-hour shifts. They ended at midnight, slept on the floor of police stations, were not given a chance to eat, and <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> duty at 7 am. This was viewed as having contributed to the difficulties they faced.|$|E
5|$|The hosts {{scored the}} opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a {{position}} on the right. Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised. Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stábile gave Argentina a 2–1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stábile was offside, but to no avail. In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3–1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser. Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4–2 to seal the win. Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, {{to the head of the}} Uruguayan Football Association, Raúl Jude. The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay; in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate. Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.|$|E

25|$|Last year's champions Leicestershire Foxes <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{track for}} the quarter-finals thanks to 73 from John Sadler at the Riverside Ground. Sadler's 72-run second-wicket {{partnership}} with skipper HD Ackerman lifted the visitors to 154 for 7. Durham Dynamos yet again showed {{their inability to}} hit at anything significantly above 6 an over, Nicky Peng's top-score of 37 being off 41 balls. Despite captain Dale Benkenstein hitting 33 not out off 16 deliveries, it did not help, as Leicestershire smothered them to 122 for 7.|$|E
25|$|The club strip {{was changed}} again in 1901, Genoa adopted its famous red-navy halves and {{therefore}} {{became known as}} the rossoblu; these are the colours used even to this day as many other Italian club do as Cagliari, Bologna and an endless list of minor clubs. After a season of finishing runners-up to Milan Cricket and Football Club, things <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> track in 1902 with their fourth title. Juventus emerged as serious contenders to Genoa's throne from 1903 onwards, when for two seasons in a row Genoa beat the Old Lady in the national final.|$|E
25|$|The match went to extra time, and France {{finished}} slightly {{the stronger}} {{of the two}} sides. No more goals were scored, {{and so it was}} time for a penalty shoot-out. Socrates, who had earlier missed an open goal and headed an easy chance straight into the French keeper's arms, failed with the first kick for Brazil. The next six penalties were all converted, and then Platini fired over the bar. Brazil <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> level terms – but not for long. Julio Cesar struck the post with his penalty, and Luis Fernández then scored to put France through 4–3 on penalties.|$|E

Sadler's 72-run second-wicket {{partnership}} with skipper HD Ackerman lifted the visitors to 154 for 7. Durham Dynamos failed to hit {{quickly enough to}} win, however, as Nicky Peng's top-score of 37 was off 41 balls - a strike rate 38 points below the required 129.16 to win. Despite captain Dale Benkenstein hitting 33 not out off 16 deliveries, it did not help, as Durham's total was 122 for 7.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{ran from}} the studio but Llamas and Guerrero stayed, hiding under their anchor desks. After the shaking stopped, they both left the Televisa studios through a back door, and hours later they <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> {{the air in the}} studios of Canal de las Estrellas to {{broadcast}} live what was happening. Some members of the Hoy Mismo staff died, including producer Ernesto Villanueva and engineer David Mendoza Córcega, who had just parked at the Televisa building, but had no time to escape from his car. The falling debris also killed street vendors who worked just outside the studio building. Reconstruction of the studio building began in 1995 and ended in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 1870, {{police in}} Newcastle upon Tyne were {{recorded}} as 'in dispute' with their local Watch Committee over conditions {{of work and}} low pay, though they did not withdraw from duty. Two years later in 1872, 179 men of the Metropolitan Police refused to report for duty. They were protesting the poor conditions of their service and low pay, as had the police in Newcastle upon Tyne. The police <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the beat within hours. Of the 179 men who refused duty, 69 were dismissed from the force. The rest were allowed back on duty after having had apologised for their conduct. They gained improvements in pay and conditions. This action was significant for establishing a precedent for collective action by police {{in order to improve}} working conditions.|$|E
