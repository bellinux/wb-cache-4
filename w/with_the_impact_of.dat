5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting {{the importance of social}} relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E

In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism.
