5|$|Hurricane Daniel was {{the second}} strongest {{hurricane}} of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. The fourth named storm of the season, Daniel originated on July16 from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Mexico. It tracked westward, intensifying steadily to reach peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) on July22. At the time, {{the characteristics of the}} cyclone resembled those of an annular hurricane. Daniel gradually weakened as it entered an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the Central Pacific Ocean, it quickly degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on July26.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Georges {{began as}} a {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa in mid-September, 1998. Tracking towards the west, the wave spawned an {{area of low pressure}} two days later which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges and further to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September20 with winds of 155mph (250km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Over the following five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, causing over 600 fatalities, mainly in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juliette was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} and final tropical cyclone of the inactive 1995 Pacific hurricane season. The tenth named storm of the season, Juliette formed on September16 from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the southwest coast of Mexico. For {{the majority of its}} track, the storm moved toward the west-northwest, and Juliette quickly intensified to major hurricane status. On September20, the hurricane reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h). Later it turned toward the northeast, briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula, although the hurricane never affected land.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great <b>Wave</b> <b>off</b> Kanagawa. The sea has appeared in literature since Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC). The sea is a recurring theme in the Haiku poems of the Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression originated from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> {{the southern coast}} of Mexico in late May2006. An area of convection {{was associated with the}} wave, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that environmental conditions favored gradual development. The system, which was enhanced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), drifted northward with an anticyclone to its east and west. On June1, the convection became more concentrated, and by early the next day it developed a low pressure area; by that time, it began a steady northwestward track.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the Bahamas {{organized into}} Tropical Depression Six {{on the afternoon}} of July 21. The depression became the sixth named storm of the season only two hours later, the first time the sixth storm of the season had ever formed that early in the season. The storm headed northward from the Bahamas, then northeast over the Atlantic, becoming disorganized by July 24 under the effects of shear and drier air. It moved erratically, inching closer to Bermuda while barely remaining a tropical storm. Bermuda received some strong wind gusts, but was otherwise unaffected. Tropical Storm Franklin then accelerated north and northeast, roughly paralleling the East Coast of the United States, and intensified to near hurricane strength. Eventually, Franklin became extratropical along the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.|$|E

50|$|Jim Hurtubise {{once again}} tried to qualify his front-engined roadster, {{but on his}} second lap, hit the outside wall {{at the head of}} the mainstretch. His first two laps would not have been fast enough to bump his way in. The day ended as Dick Simon (<b>waved</b> <b>off)</b> and Jerry Grant (<b>waved</b> <b>off)</b> made {{unsuccessful}} attempts.|$|R
50|$|Scott Sharp, in a Foyt backup also <b>waved</b> <b>off</b> {{his first}} attempt. At 5:14 p.m., Emerson Fittipaldi {{made his first}} attempt in a Rahal backup car. His third lap was up to 226.097 mph, but the crew <b>waved</b> <b>off</b> the run. The move angered Fittipaldi, and proved unwise, as the speed would have been fast enough to qualify.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Carrie was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1957 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and second hurricane of the year, Carrie formed from an easterly tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the western coast of Africa on September2, a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Moving to the west, the storm gradually intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September5. Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on September8 as a Category 4hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) in the open Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated in intensity as it neared Bermuda on September14. However, Carrie passed well north of the island {{and turned to the}} northeast towards Europe. Weakening as it reached higher latitudes, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September23, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debby was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to strike the Mexican state of Veracruz since Hurricane Anna in 1956. The eighth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby developed from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> {{the west coast of}} the Yucatan Peninsula on August 31. The system slowly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward toward Mexico, eventually reaching tropical storm status on September2. Thereafter, Debby began to rapidly strengthen, and the storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day. After attaining peak winds of 75mph (120km/h), Debby made landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, in Mexico early on September3. The hurricane quickly weakened inland, but managed to reach the eastern Pacific on September5. Debby became Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, which moved northwest but remained poorly organized due to wind shear and dissipated on September8.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Howard was a {{powerful}} Category 4 hurricane which produced large swells along the coasts of the Baja California Peninsula and southern California. The eighth named storm of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, Howard originated out of a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Mexico on August30. Traveling towards the northwest, the storm gradually strengthened, becoming a hurricane on September1 and reaching its peak intensity the following day with winds of 140mph (220km/h). Decreasing sea surface temperatures then caused the storm to weaken. By September4, Howard was downgraded to a tropical storm. The next day, it degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area which persisted for another five days before dissipating over open waters.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings of dhows {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner. The genre of marine art became especially important in the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age, with works showing the Dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess. Artists such as Jan Porcellis, Simon de Vlieger, Jan van de Cappelle, Hendrick Dubbels, Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son, Ludolf Bakhuizen and Reinier Nooms created maritime paintings {{in a wide variety of}} styles. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great <b>Wave</b> <b>off</b> Kanagawa showing the destructive force of the sea at the same time as its ever-changing beauty. The 19th century Romantic artist Ivan Aivazovsky created some 6,000 paintings, the majority of which depict the sea.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kristy in 2006 was a {{relatively}} long-lived tropical cyclone in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on August30 from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the southwest coast of Mexico, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status, reaching peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). Subsequently, Kristy weakened from cooler waters and increased wind shear from Hurricane John to its northeast. Steering currents weakened, and turning to a southerly drift, it weakened to a tropical depression by September2. The next day it briefly regained tropical storm status, only to again deteriorate to depression status. After turning to the west, Kristy encountered marginally favorable conditions and attained tropical storm status for a third time, though unfavorable conditions caused it to dissipate on September9. The storm never affected land, although initially {{there was a slight}} threat to Clarion Island. Within the National Hurricane Center area of warning responsibility east of 140°W, Hurricane Kristy was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone of the season.|$|E
5|$|The 1931 Belize {{hurricane}} was {{the deadliest}} hurricane {{in the history}} of Belize, killing an estimated 2,500people. The hurricane was first detected as a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the west coast of Africa on 29August. Moving westward, the disturbance remained relatively weak until 6September, when it was first classified as a tropical cyclone just west of the Windward Islands. The depression gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity within the first six hours following tropical cyclogenesis. The cyclone intensified further to hurricane intensity by 8September. Strengthening and organization remained gradual until the storm reached the Gulf of Honduras, by which time it began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category4 hurricane intensity on 10September. The hurricane subsequently made landfall in Belize City with maximum sustained winds of 135mph (215km/h). Moving across the Yucatán Peninsula, the tropical cyclone weakened, and continued to do so when it moved across the Bay of Campeche. This track brought it to a second landfall north of Tampico, Mexico, as a tropical storm on 13September. Once inland, the storm quickly weakened and dissipated later that day.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Bobby Rahal {{was among}} those not yet in the field. His first {{presentation}} to the line was aborted when the car would not crank. He <b>waved</b> <b>off</b> two attempts, the second attempt was averaging 212.8 mph after three laps. A. J. Foyt went out early, but debris on the track forced him to pull off. His second attempt was too slow, and he <b>waved</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{wrecking}} his car {{in practice}} Saturday morning, Gary Bettenhausen made a last-ditch effort to bump {{his way into the}} field. He managed only 218 mph, and <b>waved</b> <b>off</b> after two laps. Just before the 6 o'clock gun, Willy T. Ribbs made a long-shot attempt to make the field. After a lap of 216 mph, then dropping to 212 mph, he <b>waved</b> <b>off</b> and time trials came to a close.|$|R
50|$|Promptly at 11:00 a.m., time trials {{began with}} Stan Fox the first driver in line. After three {{inconsistent}} laps, Fox <b>waved</b> <b>off.</b> Due to the challenging track layout (without the apron) and rules changes, several drivers and teams were uneasy about qualifying speeds and many <b>waved</b> <b>off.</b> Mario Andretti {{was the second}} car out, and completed his run at 223.414 mph, putting him on the provisional pole position.|$|R
5|$|The 1948 Bermuda {{hurricane}} (Air Weather Service designation: Dog) was {{an intense}} and long-lived Cape Verde-type tropical cyclone that wrought significant damage to Bermuda {{and areas of}} Newfoundland in September1948. The storm was the eighth named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season. Originating as a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa on September4, the cyclone tracked a general westward path for much of its initial stages as it gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity shortly after development and then hurricane intensity a day later. After reaching a longitude roughly {{equal to that of}} the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane began to curve northward on a parabolic track, bringing it near Bermuda at peak intensity as a Category4hurricane on September13. Afterwards, the hurricane began to accelerate northeastwards and weaken. The waning tropical cyclone grazed Cape Race before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September15; these remnants persisted for an additional day.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Celia was first identified on June5, 2010 by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a disorganized area of disturbed weather {{associated with a}} tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the western coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking westward, little development took place and the system eventually crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on June17. Situated several hundred miles south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, the disturbance moved slowly towards the west-northwest and little development was expected to occur. By June18, scatterometer data of the system indicated that a surface circulation had developed and the system's overall structure had become increasingly organized. Later that day, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system as it was now anticipated to become a tropical cyclone within 48hours. At this time, convective banding features had begun wrapping around the system; however, it lacked deep, central cloud cover. Further development {{was expected to be}} slow due to moderate wind shear in the region of the low. Around 1800UTC, the system had become sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate it as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 370mi (595km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not warned upon until early the next morning.|$|E
25|$|Strom's {{final game}} was Game 4 of the 1990 NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Portland Trail Blazers played June 12, 1990 {{in a game}} that saw Strom {{correctly}} <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> Trail Blazers Danny Young's half-court heave that would have sent the game into OT, had it come before the buzzer.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} hour and fifteen minutes, only four cars {{completed}} runs. Nine cars <b>waved</b> <b>off,</b> including Arie Luyendyk, and Gary Bettenhausen wrecked on his fourth lap. At 12:30 p.m., Raul Boesel put his car on the front row with a run of 222.379 mph. Nigel Mansell <b>waved</b> <b>off</b> his first run, after three laps in the 218-219 mph range. At 1 p.m., with ten cars in the field, the track became quiet, as drivers awaited better conditions.|$|R
25|$|Confirming {{predictions}} {{derived from}} model testing during the design phase, the ship developed a huge list when hit by any significant force. This was especially apparent during its maiden voyage, when Andrea Doria listed 28° after {{being hit by}} a large <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> Nantucket. The ship's tendency to list was accentuated when the fuel tanks were nearly empty, which was usually {{at the end of a}} voyage.|$|E
25|$|For each attempt, {{cars are}} allowed two warm-up laps. At that time, {{a member of}} the team is {{stationed}} {{at the north end of}} the mainstretch. He or she must wave a green flag, signaling an attempt, or else the car will be waved off. The attempt can be waved off during any of the four laps by the team, driver, or race officials. (The series will <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the run if it is obvious the run will not be fast enough to qualify and it is getting late in the day.) If an attempt is waved off after the run starts, the attempt counts towards the three-attempt limit and the previous time is still forfeited, unless race officials waved off the attempt because of weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Jeanne in the Mid-Atlantic {{region of the}} United States {{included}} two fatalities and $530million (2004 USD; $ USD) in damage. Originating from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Africa in early September 2004, Hurricane Jeanne tracked through the Leeward Islands and Hispaniola for several days, resulting in extensive damage and an immense loss of life. After completing a clockwise loop between September22 and 24, the storm intensified into a major hurricane before striking the Bahamas and Florida. Substantially weaker, the system turned northeastward over Georgia before affecting Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia; all of those states are in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. By the evening of September26, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center took over responsibility of monitoring the former hurricane over Virginia.|$|E

Newgarden pulled his car from the line shortly afterward; he returned later and, {{in light of his}} team-mate's crash, set a conservative run of 224.037 mph. Ryan Briscoe set down an early quick time of 226.484 mph, as the second driver to complete a full qualifying run. Only James Hinchcliffe came close to topping his time on their first run, falling short by a scant [...]003 miles per hour. Castroneves made an attempt at a second run, but it was much slower and was <b>waved</b> <b>off</b> after the first lap. Power also made a second attempt, but <b>waved</b> it <b>off</b> after three laps. Hinchcliffe's second run was <b>waved</b> <b>off</b> by race control after it became clear he would not go faster on his second run. Ryan Hunter-Reay was the only car that picked up speed on a second run, but did not gain any positions. Ryan Briscoe held on to take the pole position, by the closest margin in Indianapolis 500 history.|$|R
