5|$|A {{significant}} {{step in the}} process of acceptance back into the Olympic Movement was achieved at a ceremony held in Cardiff in November 1994, when the IRB was officially confirmed as a Recognised International Federation of the IOC. At that ceremony, International Olympic Committee President, Juan Antonio Samaranch, pointed out that rugby's history and values <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in tune with the Olympic philosophy and traditions. This historic meeting in Cardiff led to IRB representation at annual IOC meetings and consideration for inclusion in the programme of future Olympic Games. In 2002, a plan was presented to induct rugby sevens, golf and the Chinese martial art of wushu.|$|E
5|$|Cascioferro is {{considered}} to be the mastermind behind the murder of New York policeman and head of the Italian Squad, Joseph Petrosino, on March 12, 1909. He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running from the crime scene. Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants. The two men <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> aware of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascioferro as “a terrible criminal”, while Cascioferro had a photograph of the police officer.|$|E
5|$|The {{new regime}} {{was soon to}} {{discover}} that changes don't easily come about by legislative fiat. The part of the constitution that worked adequately was the experiment with indirect democracy. During {{the period in which}} the constitution was in force, the system of primary assemblies that elected delegates who voted for the respective organs of government worked efficiently, and kept the voters engaged. However, exactly because the Republic was a genuine democracy, other goals of the regime were less easy to attain. The elections often put people into office that <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> opposed to the unitary state that was now enshrined in the constitution, and to other innovations that it entailed, or in any case were of a conservative inclination.|$|E

25|$|Henriette Widerberg {{has often}} been {{compared}} with Emilie Högquist, as their personalities and life stories <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alike, and Emilie in many ways filled the place of Henriette when she retired.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} {{names are}} Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, Hendrick Laurensz. Spieghel and Roemer Visscher. Inevitably, their works and career <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{determined by the}} struggle between Reformation and the Catholic Church.|$|E

50|$|The {{platform}} <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> anti-Cold War {{on foreign}} policy, {{and called for}} the end of the Marshall Plan and nuclear weapons, as well as friendship with the Soviets and support for Israel.

25|$|Patrick Tracy Jackson led {{the task}} of convincing the state {{legislature}} that a railroad was a good idea, and later building the railroad itself. The former proved very difficult, as the investors of the Middlesex Canal <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> against building {{a new form of}} transportation designed to replace their canal.|$|E
25|$|That {{view was}} {{enforced}} by his very pragmatic approach to politics. Sir Oswald Mosley, for example, {{said he never}} understood why Eden was so strongly pushed by the Tory party, as he felt that Eden's abilities <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> inferior to those of Harold Macmillan and Oliver Stanley. In 1947, Dick Crossman called Eden “that peculiarly British type, the idealist without conviction”.|$|E
25|$|Marvel Comics {{created their}} own version of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, when they {{introduced}} Fafnir of Vanaheim and his companion Blackrat to the Conan comic series. The pairs of characters <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alike and Roy Thomas, who wrote the original Conan comics, made no secret that it was his intention to create characters that were a tribute to Fritz Leiber's creations.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, {{he married}} a young schoolteacher, Victoria Iuga. They had one son, Gheorghe. Although the two <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in love, the {{marriage}} soon began to crumble, due to Topîrceanu's bouts of womanizing and alcoholism. Unable to redeem himself, George nonetheless suffered enormously, and the gradual distancing from Victoria, whom he will repeatedly refer to as his one saving grace, also influenced his literary output.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, 1,000 leading American {{scientists}} were randomly chosen from American Men of Science and 41.8% believed God existed, 41.5% disbelieved, and 16.7% had doubts/did not know; however when {{the study was}} replicated 80 years later using American Men and Women of Science in 1996, results <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the same with 39.3% believing God exists, 45.3% disbelieved, and 14.5% had doubts/did not know.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{the cargo}} {{of the first}} Portuguese ships (usually about 4 smaller-sized ships every year) {{arriving}} in Japan almost entirely consisted of Chinese goods (silk, porcelain). The Japanese <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> looking forward to acquiring such goods, but had been prohibited from any contact with China by the Emperor of China, as a punishment for Wokou pirate raids. The Portuguese therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries in Asian trade.|$|E

25|$|The Liberal Democrats had {{suffered}} a disappointing performance in 1992, but they <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> strengthened in 1997 due to potential tactical voting between Labour and Lib Dem supporters in Tory marginal constituencies, particularly in the south - particularly given {{their share of the}} vote decreased while their number of seats nearly doubled. The Lib Dems promised to increase education funding paid for by a 1p increase in income tax.|$|E
25|$|Many {{areas of}} the county <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{involved}} in the Tithe War (1831–36). This {{can be seen from}} the many people, from many {{areas of the}} county, included in the lists of those who refused to pay tithes, known as the Tithe Defaulter Schedules. County Wexford wasn't as badly affected as some other areas by the Famine in the 1840s, but it still had a major impact on the county.|$|E

25|$|Anglo–Saxon {{building}} forms <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> part of {{this general}} building tradition. Timber was 'the natural building medium of the age': the very Anglo–Saxon word for 'building' is 'timbe'. Unlike in the Carolingian world, late Anglo–Saxon royal halls continued to be of timber {{in the manner of}} Yeavering centuries before, even though the king could clearly have mustered the resources to build in stone. Their preference must have been a conscious choice, perhaps an expression of 'deeply–embedded Germanic identity' {{on the part of the}} Anglo–Saxon royalty.|$|E
25|$|The dynastic female heiress {{reckoned}} most eligible {{according to}} the original law of primogeniture of Frederick III was Caroline of Denmark (1793–1881), the childless eldest daughter of the late king Frederick VI.
