500|$|In June 2009, Fox put out {{a casting}} call for several new {{characters}} for the second season.

Like someone in a John Frankenheimer movie". Actor Luke Goss was cast in the role after episode writer Akiva Goldsman personally called his house and asked him to join the show.

Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway.

500|$|Grey's Anatomy used a color-blind casting technique, {{resulting}} in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role was cast without the character's races being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes' vision of diversity. The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Meredith Grey, which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast. [...] "I kept saying <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile," [...] said Rhimes, [...] "and after a while, they were like, 'We {{think we can get}} that girl from Moonlight Mile." [...] The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read for the role of Cristina instead. Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, but when Patrick Dempsey read for the part, [...] "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes.|$|E

And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.'

500|$|For the 2004–05 season, {{the team}} {{moved into the}} Atlantic Division and the Raptors decided to revamp the team. Raptors President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Richard Peddie fired Grunwald on April 1, 2004, after the team ended the season three games short of the eighth and final playoff spot in the {{previous}} season. Head coach Kevin O'Neill and his four assistant coaches were also dismissed immediately after Grunwald's termination. Toronto interim manager Jack McCloskey said: [...] "While the blame for that certainly does not rest on O'Neill and his staff alone, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> change." [...] Rob Babcock was named General Manager on June 7, 2004, alongside the appointments of Wayne Embry as senior advisor and Alex English as director of player development. Sam Mitchell, a former NBA forward and assistant coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, was hired as new {{head coach of the}} Raptors.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Greenwalt {{was very}} keen {{to acquire the}} character of Cordelia for the spin-off series, commenting, [...] "I desperately wanted {{her to come to}} Angel because Angel being dark and broody, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> big bright smile." [...] At the same time, Whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in the fourth season of Buffy where [...] "All of our characters {{got to the point where}} they were loving and hugging, and it was sort of like, where's Cordelia?", leading him to introduce Spike (James Marsters) to the cast to accommodate her absence. Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a [...] "rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS. So in episode one of Angel, Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail, actually." [...] Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins [...] "finding within herself a new level of humanity".|$|E
500|$|Sales of Ōkami were {{considered}} somewhat poor for justifying a sequel; in July 2009, {{in response to}} users' questions {{on the possibility of}} a sequel, Svensson stated that [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> lot more people buying the current version before we seriously consider a sequel". However, after the appearance of a Japanese trademark by Capcom on the word [...] "Ōkamiden" [...] a few months before the Wii version of Ōkami in Japan, many speculated that a sequel was pending. The September 2009 issue of Famitsu announced that Ōkamiden was indeed a sequel to Ōkami for the Nintendo DS, to be released by Capcom in Japan in 2010, though without the input of the Clover staff. The game takes place nine months after the end of Ōkami, with the player in control of Chibiterasu, a wolf puppy with the same powers as Amaterasu, but not yet at his full potential, and features the same style of gameplay, including the Celestial Brush using the DS' touchscreen controls.|$|E

500|$|Samples used on {{the album}} were taken from artists {{as diverse as the}} {{electronic}} duo Suicide and gospel choir the Alabama Sacred Harp Singers. [...] "Internet Connection", one of four bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of the album, was recorded in collaboration with a group of Filipino Verizon workers. M.I.A. described the sound and imagery of the album as capturing a [...] "digital ruckus", adding that [...] "so many of us have become typists and voyeurs". <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> digital moshpit like we've never seen, harder than how people were doing it in the punk era.

She said that she contemplated using only the sound of drills as the backing for [...] "Steppin Up", but concluded that this was [...] "too experimental" [...] an approach.|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{clarified}} Vieira's future {{after the}} match: [...] "My intention is clear: {{to keep him}} [...] The challenge {{in front of us}} is hugely difficult and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> complete focus. I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season." [...] He added that if Vieira chose to leave, the club could sufficiently replace him: [...] "We've worked very hard {{in the last five years}} to get good young players in and you saw that today." [...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so I was much happier." [...] Bergkamp was impressed with Fàbregas's performance in the match: [...] "Normally at 17, you might be a bit unsure when you step out. But with players like Cesc, the way he has developed in one year is quite amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Pompeo {{discovered}} Grey's Anatomy {{after an}} extended period of doing nothing in the acting profession. [...] Her agent suggested she audition amongst other projects. [...] While casting actresses for the part of Meredith Grey, series' creator Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I kept saying <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile, and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from Moonlight Mile.' I spent time with her and got to know her, and then we started casting for the men." [...] She reported that Grey was not an easy role to cast because of the strong verbal possibilities. [...] Rhimes was informed that the actress in question was Pompeo, who had a deal in place with ABC, having previously tested for a pilot show on the network. It has been speculated that Pompeo was the first character to be cast, but when asked, she said she did not know of this. When asked of how she created Pompeo's character, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

500|$|Wenger lamented Arsenal's {{inability}} to make possession count, saying: [...] "It has happened all season. We don't finish." [...] He criticised the referee for not sending off Henchoz, especially as linesman Kevin Pike {{told him the}} Liverpool defender had committed a foul. On reflection of the season, Wenger disagreed {{it was one of}} failure – [...] "It is not easy to get to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, the final of the FA Cup and to finish in the top three of the Premiership in the same season," [...] but admitted he needed to make signings to strengthen the squad. Henry called for changes to Arsenal's forward line and felt the team would benefit from a [...] "fox in the box," [...] a player who would stay in and around the penalty area to score. [...] "When I make wide runs and put in crosses there is often no-one there to put the ball in the net. Owen was the hero because he is always in the right place. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> goalscorer like that," [...] he concluded.|$|E
500|$|Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning {{historian}} of the Birmingham civil rights campaign, asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they {{are faced with the}} harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, [...] "for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest." [...] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave: [...] "I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> thousand Atticus Finches." [...] McBride, however, defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with [...] "honesty and integrity".|$|E
