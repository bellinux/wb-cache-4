By {{breaking}} it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it’s something the viewers enjoy, {{and it makes it}} a little easier to digest when you’re telling some of these stories." [...] Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be [...] "broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back-to-back, it feels weird to start calling it different things... <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> have it in bite-sized chunks." [...] The season will begin airing its episodes on December 1, 2017, once Inhumans has aired its eight episodes, with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted.|$|E

They struggled to convert goal chances, having hit the goalposts twice in the second half. Miccoli finally broke Dinamo's defence with a 90th-minute goal. Four days later, the Italian led Benfica to a win in Choupana against Nacional, allowing Benfica to overtake Sporting and reach {{second place in the}} Primeira Liga, four points behind Porto. On 22 February, Benfica visited the Stadionul Dinamo for the second leg with Dinamo, beating them 2–1 to reach to the round of 16. Benfica played their last match of the month against Paços de Ferreira on 25 February. They won the match by 3–1 against the Paços de Ferreira-based side due to double from Simão and another from Nuno Gomes. The win opened a three-point gap over Sporting, but Santos said, [...] "That is not what matters. It is our three points.

500|$|On 16 December 2013, {{the anniversary}} of the attack, activists held {{memorials}} throughout New Delhi in memory of the victim widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning [...] "fearless". Members of women's organisations lit candles in her memory and protested against exploitation of women. University students and others organised a candlelight march at the bus stand in South Delhi where Nirbhaya and her friend, Pandey, boarded the bus in which the rape and beatings took place. At a commemorative prayer meeting political leaders resolved to increase efforts to improve women's security. Speaking with the victim's mother, former chief minister Sheila Dikshit said that Delhi's society and the various authorities will work together to build a permanent legacy to her daughter: [...] "...whatever you will want in her memory, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fulfill. And we will try with a conviction that such an incident is not repeated with anybody else in the future". [...] The victim's parents spoke at a memorial saying that they were proud of the courage that their daughter showed, which they believe [...] "has spurred more women to speak out instead of hiding the crimes committed against them".|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I think that, as well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That is something he has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but I think he can become a central striker again. That is what <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> develop together." ...|$|E

Tahir, the district commander of a separatist Islamic group in Kashmir, stated: [...] "We want the Kashmiri Pandits to come back. They are our brothers. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> protect them." [...] But the majority of the Pandits, who have been living in pitiable conditions in Jammu, believe that, until insurgency ceases to exist, return is not possible. Mustafa Kamal, brother of Union Minister Farooq Abdullah, blamed security forces, former Jammu and Kashmir governor Jagmohan and PDP leader Mufti Sayeed for forcing the migration of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley. Jagmohan denies these allegations. Pro-India politician Abdul Rashid says Pandits forced the migration on themselves so Muslims can be killed. He says the plan was to leave Muslims alone and bulldoze them freely.|$|E

Eventually, fatigue that remained from the tough quarterfinal caugh up with Lithuania, especially playing against such a powerful adversary. The Russian won 86–74, {{despite the efforts of}} Lithuanian captain Ramūnas Šiškauskas, who scored 30 points. Following the game, Šarūnas Jasikevičius declared that: [...] "We have to forget everything and endeavor to win the medals. [...] The situation of the Greeks is the same as ours.

It is too early to say any numbers for the numbers of people who are injured – we will give that during the course of the day – what I can assure you is we are doing everything within our power. We've set up a crisis centre in the foreign office where British citizens can phone in, just visit it and talk to them – they've had 800 calls already. And at the same time, we're in touch with many people who are caught up in the hotels and giving advice on what they can do. Our second responsibility is obviously to root out terrorism – to help the Indian government with their action – and that's why at the same time as giving support to the Indian prime minister, we're sending police emergency teams that are well versed in Indian terrorism and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> give what support we can through British police and security officials to the Indian government at this time".
