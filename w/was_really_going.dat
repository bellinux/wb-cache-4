[...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So {{it was kind of}} just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E

500|$|On 21 May, Amer asked Nasser {{to order}} the Straits of Tiran blockaded, a move Nasser {{believed}} Israel would use as a casus belli. Amer reassured him that the army was prepared for confrontation, but Nasser doubted Amer's assessment of the military's readiness. According to Nasser's vice president Zakaria Mohieddin, although [...] "Amer had absolute authority over the armed forces, Nasser had his ways of knowing what <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on". Moreover, Amer anticipated an impending Israeli attack and advocated a preemptive strike. Nasser refused the call upon determination {{that the air force}} lacked pilots and Amer's handpicked officers were incompetent. Still, Nasser concluded that if Israel attacked, Egypt's quantitative advantage in manpower and arms could stave off Israeli forces for at least two weeks, allowing for diplomacy towards a ceasefire. Towards the end of May, Nasser increasingly exchanged his positions of deterrence for deference to the inevitability of war, under increased pressure to act by both the general Arab populace and various Arab governments. On 26 May Nasser declared, [...] "our basic objective will be to destroy Israel". On 30 May, King Hussein committed Jordan in an alliance with Egypt and Syria.|$|E

Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ...

The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi.

500|$|Sex is now {{considered}} a bold, post-feminist, work of art, besides being labeled a [...] "cultural book". Martin Amis from The Observer wrote an essay discussing the book's cultural meaning. Critical theorist Douglas Kellner affirmed that with Sex [...] "Madonna became herself, an artifact of pop culture". French academic writer Georges Claude Guilbert (author of three books about Madonna) described Sex {{as one of the}} most successful publicity stunts in history whereas Russell W. Belk, author of Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, mentioned that the book is a quality product in marketing. In 1992, Madonna had generated more than US$500million ($ in [...] dollars) to Time Warner in sales of both albums and the Sex book, despite the negative feedback. However, Taraborrelli commented in his book, , that those [...] "who knew Madonna well at that time, knew what <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on with her: the Sex book—and the outrageous antics that preceded it and would follow it—was really just something she used as a barrier between her and the rest of the world." [...] For years it had seemed to Madonna that both her personal and professional life was extremely scrutinized by the public and media, and although she had started this scrutinizing by her provocative works, she was tired of it. Being vexed at this interest in her personal life, Madonna fought back by creating the persona of a renegade, something so outrageous as to defy explanation, something found objectionable by most people. Taraborrelli said that in Madonna's view, [...] "she had no other way of fighting back". The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert analyzed the singer's provocative attempt in an article published in the newspaper: ...|$|E
500|$|Dexters writing staff began {{meeting in}} March 2008 to {{brainstorm}} {{ideas for the}} third season's storylines. Writer Clyde Phillips said that, when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, [...] "we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he {{has spent most of}} his adult life taking lives." [...] They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be [...] "the central arc of the season", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, [...] "They promised upfront that this <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot. They've delivered the goods." [...] In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that [...] "That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season." [...] Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person, show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were [...] "protecting the character". He thought that it was [...] "very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it". Phillips said that [...] "We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake." ...|$|E

[...] "I had to drop clues all the way through because as you know in the seventh book when you have the revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape's motivation was. I had to plot that through the books because at the point where you see what <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on, it would have been an absolute cheat on the reader at that point just to show a bunch of stuff you've never seen before."

2500|$|General Murray {{also worked}} for a {{division}} of Lockheed Skunk Works. He {{was assigned to the}} project development of [...] "The Black Missile". This was the first missile that was undetectable by radar. It was being built in a large tan-colored hangar located on the north corner of The Burbank Airport, located in Burbank, California. The hangar was owned by Lockheed Skunk Works Division. It was accessed via San Fernando Rd. This hangar was not the typical hangar. It was larger than normal and heavily guarded. There were no signs of what <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on there. General Murray worked there daily, entering the door {{on the west side of}} the hangar. He explained, upon entering the hangar there was an enormous black curtain that was drawn across the center of the hangar, splitting the work space. He stayed on his side and the other workers stayed on their side. They never saw each other or looked beyond the curtain. General Murray was advised that the other side of the curtain contained a highly classified development, as his project wasn't classified enough. Years later, General Murray discovered what was going on behind the curtain. He was told the first stealth aircraft was in its early stages of development and testing. Murray declined to speak about which aircraft. The hangar was torn down in the year 2002, closing another door to an amazing piece of history.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{was one of}} {{the first}} Catholic {{scholars}} in the United States to use the historical-critical method to study the Bible. In 1943, reversing the approach that had existed since Providentissimus Deus fifty years earlier, Pius XII's encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu expressed approval of historical-critical methods. For Brown, this was a [...] "Magna Carta for biblical progress." [...] In 1965, at the Second Vatican Council, the Church moved further in this direction, adopting the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation Dei verbum, instead of the conservative schema [...] "On the Sources of Revelation" [...] that originally had been submitted. While it stated that Scripture teaches [...] "solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation," [...] Brown points out the ambiguity of this statement, which opened the way for a new interpretation of inerrancy by shifting from a literal interpretation of the text towards a focus on [...] "the extent to which it conforms to the salvific purpose of God." [...] He saw this as the Church [...] "turning the corner" [...] on inerrancy, while adopting a face-saving wording: [...] "the Roman Catholic Church does not change her official stance in a blunt way. Past statements are not rejected but are requoted with praise and then reinterpreted at the same time. ... What <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on was an attempt gracefully to retain what was salvageable from the past and to move in a new direction at the same time." [...] While the document cited the two earlier encyclicals, it was clear to observers that much had changed. The Second Vatican Council, one scholar observed, “raised biblical exegesis from the status of second-class citizenship to which it had been reduced among Catholics by an overreaction to the Protestant claim for its autonomy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Supergirl would air its second season on The CW instead of CBS, Pedowitz revealed that all four series—Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl—would crossover in the upcoming 2016–17 television season. In September 2016, Greg Berlanti, creator and executive producer on all four series, clarified that the crossover event would only officially involve The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow, though the event starts {{at the very end of}} the Supergirl episode [...] "Medusa", with Barry and Cisco Ramon arriving on Supergirl's Earth to recruit her. Andrew Kreisberg, executive producer on Arrow, The Flash and Supergirl, spoke more on why the crossover did not include Supergirl, saying that since [...] "Medusa" [...] also served as the mid-season finale for Supergirl, and the other three series have theirs in a subsequent episode after the crossover, [...] "We wanted to make sure that [...] spoke to what had been happening on the first seven episodes of Supergirl and not just as a tie in." [...] He added that, logistically, it would have been very difficult to incorporate the four series, also noting that finding the time for Melissa Benoist to shoot material for the other three series had its own complications, noting, [...] "Hopefully people didn't realize it, but Kara was not in a lot of episode 7 of Supergirl... specifically to free her up for five days so that she could appear in all these other episodes." [...] He expanded on these difficulties stating, [...] "The thing that we didn’t really plan on — because we weren’t aware that we were going to switch Supergirl from CBS to CW and it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to be part of it — that was the one show that didn't have built-in shut-down days, so all the other ones did...
