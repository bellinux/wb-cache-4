25|$|On September 29, 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan disputed Treaty of Lausanne.

A Greek Foreign Ministry source remarked that “everyone should respect the Treaty of Lausanne,” noting that it is “a reality in the civilized world which no one, including Ankara, can ignore.”, added that the Turkish leader’s comments were likely geared for domestic consumption.|$|E

25|$|Thus we {{have the}} President of the Reorganized Church and son of Joseph Smith admitting, as well as apologizing for the rash {{statements}} {{of his father and}} other leaders in the old church, and then we have Joseph F. Smith of the Utah church using about the same argument to excuse the language and murderous conduct of the Danites in Utah. All <b>we</b> <b>care</b> to say is reply to both of these descendants of the original prophet and organizer of the Danite Band is, that when the leading members and officers of the church for many years teach and practice, by threats and murders, ascribed to the Danite Band, then we believe the public is justified in denouncing such language and conduct, and affirming it to be the doctrine of the church.|$|E

500|$|... "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] {{raises the}} {{question}} of who really can be considered one's family. At first, Kyle's implicit idea is that family consists of [...] "those for whom <b>we</b> <b>care</b> that are related by blood". Based on this viewing of family, he no longer feels the need to help Ike when he learns that they are not related by blood. As the story progresses, Kyle questions his initial beliefs, and forms the episode's central moral by saying that [...] "Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's about who you care about." [...] Thus, Kyle's reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother, but his friends as well. Kyle's questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in the dialectical Socratic method of inquiry.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers were {{generally}} impressed by Smith's performances. Pete Paphides, writing for The Times, {{said that the}} songs were performed [...] "with power and restraint", while Johnny Davis, writing for The Observer, said [...] "ou can practically hear Katherine Jenkins weep as Faryl flawlessly executes Amazing Grace". Jason Birchmeier, writing for Allmusic, considered Smith's performance even more noteworthy because of her young age. However, though he considered Smith's voice impressive, Malcolm Mackenzie, writing for The London Paper, asked [...] "will <b>we</b> <b>care</b> when the kid from Kettering loses her precocious appeal?" [...] Reviewers also responded positively to Cohen's contribution to the album. Paphides claimed that his arrangements [...] "suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist", while Birchmeier claimed that the album was [...] "produced with fine precision".|$|E
500|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] was celebrated in 2005. Radio {{stations}} around the world paid homage to USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by {{the release of a}} two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song. Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to [...] "use it to do some more good [...] That's all <b>we</b> <b>care</b> about accomplishing." [...] Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20thanniversary of the song. The entertainer acknowledged that [...] "We Are the World" [...] had [...] "stood the test of time"; anyone old enough to remember it can still at least hum along.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers of {{the episode}} have also praised it for its {{character}} development. Todd Gilchrist of IGN said he thinks the key to The Simpsons longevity is its [...] "sentimental but not gooey" [...] approach to storytelling and character development. He cited [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] as an example and said: [...] "Lisa sabotages Homer's barbecue, which results in an unceremonious death for his prize pig. But rather than simply punctuating the episode with an iconic image of the porker soaring through the air, the writers actually develop a story into which the joke fits. The comedic effect is actually intensified because <b>we</b> <b>care</b> about the characters, are invested in the story, and primed for a great gag." [...] The Niagara Gazettes Phil Dzikiy said that [...] "the character development and storytelling is perfect", noting that the episode was [...] "equally hilarious, touching and satirical".|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] Wrayson assented, doubtfully. [...] "Somehow {{she seemed}} to get the upper hand of us towards the end. I think she {{suspected}} {{that some of us}} knew more than <b>we</b> <b>cared</b> to tell her about--her husband's death." ...|$|R

500|$|Faith No More's {{first album}} was <b>We</b> <b>Care</b> a Lot, {{released}} by Mordam Records in 1985. The band soon signed with Slash Records and released Introduce Yourself, their second album, in April 1987. Shortly afterwards {{the rest of}} the band fired the vocalist, Chuck Mosley, and replaced him with Mike Patton. During the tour supporting their third album, The Real Thing, Faith No More recorded their only live album, , and released their first number one single, [...] "Epic". Their fourth studio album Angel Dust was released in 1992 with their final two number-one singles, [...] "Midlife Crisis", and the Lionel Richie cover [...] "Easy", not included on the initial release of the album. Following the tour supporting Angel Dust and the departure of long-time guitarist Jim Martin Faith No More released their fifth studio album, King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime, in 1995. Their final studio album until 2015, Album of the Year, released on June 3, 1997, was their only number-one album.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} received mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. In October 2000 Howard Rosenberg commented [...] "If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping {{out the entire}} planet. It's actually quite moving. And she looks great on her bike." [...] Hal Boedeker from the Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review of Max, and compared her skills to those of Catwoman, Xena, Emma Peel and Wonder Woman. Time commented favorably on Alba's physical skills portraying Max, though stated she had [...] "an emotional range unusual among action babes." [...] Conversely, Joyce Millman said [...] "Cameron and Eglee give us very little incentive to care about Max as a person, the way <b>we</b> <b>care</b> about Buffy or Faith. And that's because Max {{is little more than}} lips and ass and a premise reminiscent of other, better shows". In December 2000 People listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the breakthrough performances of 2000.|$|E
500|$|Faith No More, a San Francisco-based band, have {{recorded}} approximately 100 songs {{over the course}} of their career; this includes material from six studio albums, one live album, and numerous B-side tracks and out-takes. Faith No More were founded in 1981 as Sharp Young Men, and changed their name to Faith No Man before releasing the 1982 double A-side single [...] "Quiet in Heaven" [...] / [...] "Song of Liberty". Upon assuming the name Faith No More, the band's first two full-length albums, <b>We</b> <b>Care</b> a Lot and Introduce Yourself, were driven mostly by new vocalist Chuck Mosley and the [...] "metallic guitar" [...] of Jim Martin, blending elements of rap and heavy metal music. Mosley was later replaced by Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, who added lyrics to the already-written music for 1989's The Real Thing. Their next studio album, Angel Dust, moved away from the band's rap-influenced sound to experiment with different musical genres; a trend which became much more pronounced on the 1995 album King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime.|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, Tancharoen {{stated that}} there was a {{possibility}} the season could continue the story of Agent Carter in some way, given it was not renewed for the 2016–17 season. Whedon added that [...] "We are linked to them through history [...] whether or not we'll tell their stories remains to be seen." [...] The Momentum Energy Labs group introduced in the season is eventually revealed to be a successor to the Isodyne Energy company from the second season of Agent Carter. The two companies are connected by the parent company Roxxon, a mainstay of the MCU, and deal with supernatural entities: Isodyne discovered the extra-dimensional Darkforce, while Momentum is shown experimenting on extra-dimensional energy using the Darkhold, the Book of Sins from the comics. In December, Whedon said that Peggy Carter [...] "is a part of the universe, and she’s a character <b>we</b> <b>care</b> about", and {{that there was}} a good chance of having bigger connections to her show moving forward after the Ghost Rider pod.|$|E
500|$|... "Silly Love Songs" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode, and wrote, [...] "This was our favorite type of Glee episode. Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles , the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and—dare we say it—we didn't even miss her." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal." [...] Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: [...] "On Tuesday night, Glee wasn’t only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters <b>we</b> <b>care</b> about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was like a perfect heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show’s fans about all the things we’ve missed about the show these last couple of months." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "highlight" [...] for Lynch was {{the scene}} where Kurt, Mercedes and Rachel were {{watching}} Twilight together, {{not only because the}} [...] "friendship between Kurt and Mercedes" [...] has been [...] "sadly downplayed", but because it was [...] "nice to see the Glee kids just being kids sometimes". The subsequent conversation between Kurt and Finn in the locker room was described by Canning as [...] "one of the truest moments of the season so far". Votta wrote, [...] "Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith often shine together in scenes, especially one-on-one, and this is no exception." [...] Another duo that reviewers complimented was Mercedes and Sam. Futterman, while she criticized the episode for setting [...] "its scope too wide", credited their storyline as the [...] "only one played out strongly enough through dialogue and song". Votta stated that [...] "Glee is getting more romantic tension mileage out of this duo than you can shake a stick at, and it's delicious, especially with Valentine's around the corner", and Canning noted that their week-long verbal silence [...] "helped build their relationship into something <b>we</b> <b>care</b> more about". Chaney, however, could not see the sense in Mercedes bringing Sam with her [...] "to see Miss Pillsbury to sort out her conflicted feelings for Sam and Shane".|$|E

500|$|The main plot of [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was panned by critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club {{wrote of}} the episode, [...] "This far into the show’s run, {{shifting}} to a much more dramatic bottle episode and reaching for emotional payoffs felt far too little too late." [...] He resumed: [...] "Nobody cares about {{any member of the}} Griffin family the way <b>we</b> <b>care</b> about every last Simpson. I feel bad about Meg becoming the scapegoat. Not because she’s a good character, but because instead of tweaking and working to make her appreciated or comically valuable, Family Guy spent years going down {{the path of least resistance}} and simply joined the fan chorus of hatred. One episode of pointed, forced justification for that shift doesn’t change a thing." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of D+. Similarly, Terron Moore of Ology felt that much of the episode was wasted. In his review, Moore stated that [...] "Seahorse Seashell Party" [...] was [...] "an episode that spends a lot of time addressing something that didn’t need to be addressed." [...] He gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten points. TV Fanatic Kate Moon was less negative of the episode, stating that even though Meg confronting her family in regards to her treatment was long overdue, she concluded that it felt contrived and uninteresting.|$|E
500|$|... "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was lauded by {{television}} critics. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald {{called it an}} [...] "incredible episode"; [...] "Walking Dead again proves {{it is one of}} the best dramas on TV and almost makes me feel good about paying my cable bill." [...] Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Rene Guzman opined that it [...] "delivers all that messy drama in spades with a true gut-wrenching end to one of the series’ core characters". Wetpaint's Molly Friedman stated that in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", the audience [...] "finally had a reason to shed some tears and remember just how much <b>we</b> <b>care</b> about the original gang of apocalyptic misfits". Kevin Yeoman of The Christian Science Monitor and E! Online journalist Tierney Bricker concluded that the episode managed to effectively surprise the audience, while Cyriaque Lamar of io9 declared that [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was inferior to its predecessor by writing that it [...] "served up a bunch of quasi-entertaining scenes of people arguing and capped them off with one of the most accidentally funny closers ever committed to basic cable". In his B+ review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said that the episode continued the series' path of a more focused and central direction. Josh Jackson of Paste was intrigued with the series' exploration of morality during an apocalyptic event in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner". Eric Goldman of IGN was much more pessimistic about the episode than the general consensus. In his 6.5 out of 10 rating review, he called it [...] "especially dull" [...] when compared to the previous installment.|$|E
500|$|USA Today praised Laurie's {{performance}} and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating [...] "a carry-over from last season's brilliant finale, House is firmly in the forefront. And {{when you have an}} actor of Hugh Laurie's range, depth and charisma, putting him center-stage makes perfect sense, particularly when you've written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships in a way that seems". The New York Daily News noted that [...] "The show pays more attention to relationships <b>we</b> <b>care</b> about, hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise, and thus doesn't rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden", and noted that [...] "the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the performances of the cast, especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas, calling him a [...] "delightful addition". She concluded, [...] "So different is the premiere that the savvy House (and Fox) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream. That {{does not seem to be}} the case, and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to Princeton. Not too different, of course, but different enough." [...] Conversely, The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan disliked Weston's character, calling him [...] "An unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak". She continued saying [...] "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails". The Sunday Times felt that the show had [...] "lost its sense of humour". The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism.|$|E
