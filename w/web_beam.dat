Therefore, web is usually investigated by comparing the thickness and the shape. There are various types of profile steel sheeting used in Malaysia, such as Spandek and Trimdek.

However, the actual behaviour {{is known to}} fall between these two extreme categories. The use of partial strength connections has been encouraged by studies on the matter.

This project is to analyze the behaviour of trapezoidal <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> profiled to the end plate connection. Comparison between the effect of trapezoidal <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> profiled to end plate connection and stiffener is made to predict the strength, stiffness and rotational capacity of the connections.

The dimension for the end plate stiffener provided is 95 x 95 x 10 mm. Linear analysis is performed to obtain the deformed mesh, maximum stress and strain under axial load. In addition, a non-linear contact analysis is also done to obtain the relationship of the load-deflection at contact surfaces.

40|$|Trapezoid <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> {{is a type}} {{of steel}} I-section in which the web is made {{corrugated}} in a trapezoidal profile form. The corrugated thin web is continuously welded to the flanges along the top and bottom edges. Trapezoid <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> is a built up section that able to support vertical loads over long spans. The higher bending capacity is achieved by increasing the depth of the section. Increasing the depth will increase the slenderness of web and hence reducing the shear buckling capacity. Ordinarily, the economic design of steel web I-beam requires thin web. To avoid shear buckling, intermediate stiffener has to be used, or alternatively, the web can be made corrugated in trapezoidal profile. When beams with corrugated webs are compared with those with stiffened flat webs, it can be found that trapezoidal corrugation in the web enables the use of thinner webs and trapezoidal web beams eliminate costly web stiffener...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{cover the}} {{problems}} of the numerical analysis of corrugated web beams exposed to constrained torsion. The calculation is performed using the finite element method. Virtual solid models and software package "Lira" are employed to perform the structural analysis. The results of the comparative analysis of performance of beams that have flat and corrugated webs and that are exposed to constrained torsion are presented in the article. Corrugated web beams that have different geometrical shapes of corrugations are considered. The results of the research have proven that a beam that has a corrugated web demonstrates average deflections of 15 - 18 %. The rotation angle of the midsection of a corrugated <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> is by far below the one of similar beams that have a flat web. Comparison of beams that have different corrugation web patterns and that are exposed to constrained torsion proves that beams that have a corrugated triangular shape web have a better bending stiffness, while beams that have a trapezoidal shape demonstrate the best torsion stiffness, given that the geometric parameters remain the same. The authors believe that the flexural stiffness of beams with a corrugated web needs more research, depending on its geometric characteristics. These results can be taken {{as the basis for the}} empirical and analytical dependence on the definition of deflection. Due to the fact that beams with a corrugated web are less sensitive to the increase in the eccentricity of load, it makes sense to apply the method of calculation of a flat <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> exposed to constrained torsion, but the qualifying factor is to be applied.

This effective width is obtained by a consideration of the buckling properties of thin sheet in shear. The results are in the same form as the familiar Wagner beam equations except that certain terms must be modified and corrections made.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been {{sustainable}} development in the steel and composite construction technology. One of the recent additions to such developments is the I-girders with corrugated web beams. The use of these new generation beams results in a range of benefits, including flexible, free internal spaces and reduced foundation costs. Corrugated web beams are built-up girders with a thin-walled, corrugated web and wide plate flanges. The thin corrugated web affords a significant weight reduction of these beams, compared with hot-rolled or welded ones. In this paper, optimum design of corrugated composite beams is presented. A recent stochastic optimization algorithm coded that is based on hunting search is used for obtaining the solution of the design problem. In the optimisation process, besides the thickness of concrete slab and studs, web height and thickness, distance between the peaks of the two curves, the width and thickness of flange are considered as design variables. The design constraints are respectively implemented from BS EN 1993 - 1 : 2005 (Annex-D, Eurocode 3) BS- 8110 and DIN 18 - 800 Teil- 1. Furthermore, these selections are also carried out such that the design limitations are satisfied and the weight of the composite corrugated <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> is the minimum. ...|$|E

The research focussed on investigating methods for expanding the web of a standard pultruded GFRP I-beam to achieve improved mechanical performance whilst achieving an overall saving on mass. The 14 (102 x 102 x 6. 4 mm) beam was chosen as the standard beam from which the beams were constructed and the mechanical performance of the larger 18 (203 x 203 x 9. 5 mm) beam as the target for the modified beams. Three designs were proposed and two full-scale beams were built and tested. Of the three designs proposed, one used Quickstep manufactured sandwich panels and another metal connectors fabricated by a Selective Laser Melting facility. All the designs were analysed using theoretical closed form solutions and ANSYS FE software. A tension coupon testing programme was carried out in support of these analyses. The two full-scale beams were tested, together with an 18 beam, in three-point bending and lateral-torsional buckling. The slender nature of the expanded web beams meant that lateral bracing was required for the lateral buckling testing.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{polymeric}} (FRP) composites {{are being}} considered for structural members in bridge construction as lighter, more durable alternatives to steel and concrete. Extensive testing and analysis of a pultruded, hybrid double <b>web</b> <b>beam</b> (DWB) developed for use in bridge construction has been conducted at Virginia Tech. A primary purpose of this testing {{is the development of}} a structural design guide for the DWB, which includes stiffness and strength data. The design manual also includes design allowables determined through a statistical analysis of test data. Static testing of the beams, including failure tests, has been conducted in order to determine such beam properties as bending modulus, shear stiffness, failure mode, and ultimate capacity. Measuring and calculating the shear stiffness has proven to be an area of particular interest and difficulty. Shear stiffness is calculated using Timoshenko beam theory which combines the shear stiffness and shear area together along with a correction factor, k. There are several methods for determining shear stiffness, kGA, in the laboratory, including a direct method and a multi-span slope method. Herein lays the difficulty as it has been found that varying methods produces significantly different results. The objective of current research is to determine reasons for the differences in results, to identify which method is most accurate in determining kGA and also to examine higher-order theories that may further aid the understanding of this material property.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to evaluate the fatigue strength of welded diaphragm-to-beam connections. Experimental tests were performed {{in order to determine}} the fatigue resistance of the detail, examine failure modes, and to evaluate repair methods. Two diaphragm configurations were studied: one with diaphragms positioned back-to-back and one with staggered diaphragms. The experimental results indicate that the back-to-back diaphragms distribute load laterally more than the staggered diaphragms. The back-to-back configuration provides stiffness to the <b>beam</b> <b>web</b> and acts as a continuous transverse member. Because of the stiffness, many of the web and flange welds connecting the diaphragm to the beam fractured for the non-staggered diaphragms that resulted in decreased load transfer. Horizontal cracking also developed in the <b>beam</b> <b>webs</b> but did not affect the fatigue strength of the beam. The staggered diaphragms do not stiffen the <b>beam</b> <b>web,</b> but pull the <b>beam</b> <b>web</b> out-of-plane causing high out-of-plane bending stresses to develop. In the staggered diaphragm tests, cracks perpendicular to the stress field developed in the <b>beam</b> <b>webs</b> at the toe of a bottom flange weld. However, the beams did not fracture immediately. The repair methods investigated were removing the diaphragm and drilling holes at the beam crack tips, removing the diaphragm and peening the bottom flange weld toes, and leaving the diaphragm in place and peening the bottom flange weld toes. Peening the bottom flange weld toes before fatigue cracks developed did prevent cracks from forming for both diaphragm configurations. When a crack was present in the <b>beam</b> <b>web,</b> drilling holes at the crack tips arrested the crack growth. Finite element models of the welded diaphragm-to-beam connection were developed {{in order to determine the}} stresses near the welds. The stresses were then used in a crack propagation model that predicts the fatigue life of cracked beam members that have the welded diaphragm connection. Based upon the experimental and analytical results, it has been shown that beam members that develop cracks have a long fatigue life. Also, repair methods are effective in extending the fatigue life of a beam member once cracks develop and before the onset of cracks. ...|$|R

Beam tests have demonstrated that any failure to adhere to the beam manufacturing technology may seriously affect the load-bearing capacity of a beam. Any deviation of longitudinal axis flanges of beams from the longitudinal axis of a corrugated web in excess of 3 mm adversely affects the bearing capacity of beams and contributes to the overall beam stability loss.

The design rules for block shear according to specifications from North America (US and Canada), Europe (Eurocode), and Japan are evaluated. For gusset plates, Eurocode rules provide a good prediction, but the other standards are significantly conservative. The North American standards generally give a good prediction for angles, the Japanese standard is conservative, and Eurocode is marginally non-conservative. Results for block shear in the <b>webs</b> of coped <b>beams</b> are mixed, and they include some significantly non-conservative predictions for all but Eurocode. Equally important to these comparisons, in many cases the rule provided by the standards is not reflective of the failure mode observed in the tests. A proposal for a block shear model that is consistent with observed failure modes and which provides a satisfactory comparison with test results is presented...|$|R
