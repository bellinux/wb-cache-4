5|$|Although Hurricane Vince {{developed}} {{in an unusual}} location in the northeastern Atlantic, <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from where tropical cyclones are usually found, it is neither the most northerly-forming nor the most easterly-forming Atlantic tropical storm; these records are held by Alberto of the 1988 season at 41.5°N, and Ginger of the 1967 season at 18.1°W, respectively.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} decade, Galileo stayed <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from the controversy. He revived his project {{of writing a}} book on the subject, {{encouraged}} by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E

5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from the students, and partly because after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E
5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from the building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E

Finally, Wells invoked a clause that allowed her to leave the label, advising the court that her original contract was invalid, as she had signed while she was still a minor. Wells won her lawsuit and was awarded a settlement, leaving Motown officially in early 1965, whereupon she accepted a lucrative ($200,000) contract with 20th Century Fox Records.|$|R
5|$|Companies {{object to}} being blamed for shark bite incidents, {{pointing}} out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans. Their position is that further {{research needs to be}} done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior. One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.|$|E

Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from crags {{on the side of the}} ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible, over the tops of Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470miles (760km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from the Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki {{to turn to the}} northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain.|$|E

5|$|On May 16, {{the first}} {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} season formed to the southwest of Baja California, out of a tropical disturbance that had developed during May 5 within the vicinity of Panama. During May 16 the depression gradually developed, before early {{the next day the}} National Hurricane Centre declared it a tropical storm and named it Andres. The newly named tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h), later that day. After maintaining its peak intensity for 24 hours, Andres started to gradually weaken as upper level windshear over the system increased before it dissipated during May 20. Throughout its life as a tropical cyclone, Andres moved very little and slowly executed a cyclonic loop, while remaining <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from any land.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{evolution in}} dreadnought protection {{came with the}} development of the anti-torpedo bulge and torpedo belt, both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from the final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead {{along the side of the}} hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture splinters, separated from the outer hull by one or more compartments. The compartments in between were either left empty, or filled with coal, water or fuel oil.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Vince {{was named}} on October 9 {{in the east}} Atlantic near Madeira (east-southeast of the Azores) and was {{upgraded}} to a hurricane later that day though later analysis indicated that it had formed as a subtropical storm the previous day. Although Vince was a very small and short-lived storm that only briefly reached hurricane strength, it was notable for developing in the eastern Atlantic, <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from where hurricanes are usually found. This may be the farthest north and east a tropical cyclone has ever formed in the Atlantic Basin.|$|E

5|$|Unfavorable {{environmental}} conditions caused {{weakening of the}} hurricane by September4 as it resumed a west-northwest course away from Hawaii. Conditions later became favorable and Uleki acquired winds of 105mph (165mph) on September7, constituting its secondary peak. The hurricane crossed the International Dateline on September8 and was reclassified as typhoon. Remaining <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from land, the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm by September12. Gradually turning north and later east, the degrading cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone four days later and ultimately dissipated on September17 near the International Dateline.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nadine was {{the fourth}} longest-lived Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record. The fourteenth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Nadine developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September10. By the following day, it had strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine. After initially tracking northwestward, Nadine turned northward, <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from any landmass. Early on September15, Nadine reached hurricane status as it was curving eastward. Thereafter, an increase in vertical wind shear weakened Nadine back to a tropical storm by September16. On the following day, the storm began moving northeastward and threatened the Azores; by late on September19, however, Nadine veered east-southeastward before reaching the islands. Nonetheless, the storm produced tropical storm force winds on a few islands. On September21, the storm curved south-southeastward while located south of the Azores. Later that day, Nadine transitioned into a non-tropical low pressure area.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from the southeast of England. Any airfield that {{was in danger of}} being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico on 20August 1966, Lerew married Josephine Henriette Oude Reimerink, a Dutch {{national}} {{he had met}} {{three years}} earlier. He was promoted ICAO's Chief of Flight Branch in April 1969, in which capacity he served until retiring from the organisation in 1972. In retirement, Lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively. Their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes, in December 1974 when they tired of the oppressively humid weather in Darwin and left just before Cyclone Tracy struck on Christmas Day, and in February 1976 {{when they decided to}} camp <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, which was devastated soon after by an earthquake that left over 22,000 people dead. The couple eventually settled in Vancouver, where John Lerew died of cancer on 24February 1996, aged eighty-three. He was survived by Josephine and the children of his first marriage.|$|E
5|$|Other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy {{receptacles}} {{and smaller}} fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow {{them so they}} pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from the parent tree. The germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way. Nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed. Many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring. Pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age in Scotland {{lasted from}} {{approximately}} 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland {{has produced a}} relative dearth of remains from this period {{in comparison to the}} Neolithic and later Iron Age. This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC. In Orkney, fewer large stone structures were built during this period, burials were now being made in small cists <b>well</b> <b>away</b> from the great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate. Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use as bronze metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period. There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it is legitimate to talk of a Celtic culture in Scotland, although the nature of the Orcadian Celtic civilisation and their relationships to their neighbours remains largely unknown.|$|E
