The setup for the experiments was relatively simple and was accomplished at very little cost. Series of shadowgraph images were taken of both dual nozzle and single nozzle strut based ejectors operating over a range of chamber pressures. The density gradient patterns in the shadowgraphs were compared to pressure data measured along the top and side <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the mixing <b>duct.</b> The shadowgraph images showed the presence of barrel shocks emanating from the nozzles which at low pressures terminated in Mach disks and at higher pressures extended beyond the barrel shape and reflected off the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duct.</b> Based on pressure data from previous testing, reflected shocks were expected on the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duct.</b> The shadowgraph images confirmed the locations of these reflected shocks on the top <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duct.</b> The shadowgraph images also showed the structure change which correlated {{to a change in}} pitch of the ejector noise, and corresponded to a change in trend <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> <b>wall</b> pressure ratio distributions.

The <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducts</b> containing flow are often acoustically lined in order to reduce sound. Many simple models of acoustic linings assume the lining to be linear and locally-reacting; examples considered here include the three-parameter, mass–spring–damper, Helmholtz resonator and enhanced Helmholtz resonator models. All of these models have been found to have stability issues with uniform mean grazing flow, and there has been some confusion over the existence of hydrodynamic instability surface waves over such linings. Mathematically, the standard proven Briggs–Bers stability analysis is not applicable. Computationally, the hydrodynamic modes are routinely ignored (in the frequency domain) and instabilities filtered out (in the time domain). This confusion also causes significant problems fo...|$|R

40|$|Mixed {{convection}} heat transfer in {{horizontal and vertical}} ducts with flow through the duct {{plays an important role}} in the design and operation of several industrial equipment involving heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena. The estimation of heat transfer requires consideration of both free and forced convective heat exchange mechanisms, in addition to surface radiation among the internal <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duct.</b> Free convection leads to the onset and growth of secondary flows, which interact with the forced {{convection heat}} transfer rate, and thereby affecting the overall heat removal rates from a duct. Surface radiation in the presence of mixed convection is found to affect both free and forced convection heat transfer rates. Therefore, the combination of the convection (free and forced) and radiation heat transfer modes present an interesting situation. Due to the emissivity <b>of</b> the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duct,</b> surface radiation from the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> will affect the overall heat transfer phenomena. The present study therefore focuses on the interaction of surface radiation on the free and forced convective heat transfer phenomena occurring in airflow through a duct. Three configurations: mixed convection heat transfer in thermally developing flow in horizontal ducts (CS 1), hydrodynamically developed thermally developing flow in horizontal ducts (CS 2) and thermally developing flow in vertical ducts (CS 3), are analyzed. Experiments are performed to study the mixed convection heat transfer in horizontal and vertical ducts with two differentially heated isothermal hot and cold walls and two adiabatic walls. Radiative heat transfer is estimated using a numerical scheme, with the help of experimentally obtained temperatures. The experimental work involved fabrication, assembly and instrumentation of test sections on horizontal and vertical <b>ducts</b> <b>of</b> suitable sizes. The major parameters considered in this work include wall emissivity, Reynolds number, thermal and geometric parameters and aspect ratios. To cover the required range of Reynolds numbers, two test sections were used in this study.

The test duct is made up of transparent perspex sheets to facilitate the flow visualization study. The duct has an inlet to exit area ratio of 1. 0 with centerline distance of 750 mm. The inlet aspect ratio <b>of</b> the test <b>duct</b> has been fixed at 1. 0. The velocities for the proposed investigations are to be measured by using a Pitot tube.

The manometer had two tubes emanating from it: one left open to the atmosphere and the other connected to the steel pipes attached to the four <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the curved <b>duct.</b> The difference in the readings helped us calculate the static pressure and thereby the normalized pressure. Wall pressure distribution along the curved and parallel <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> at 0 °, 22. 5 °, 45 °, 67. 5 ° and 90 ° measuring sections was measured. All the experimental data has been processed by an Intel i 3 CPU, 3 GB RAM PC and analyzed to give the distribution of static pressure in the square duct. The main purpose of this investigation is to show the development of secondary flow which happens when the flow takes place through the bend in the curvature. This secondary flow arises as a result of a centrifugal force acting when the flow moves through the bend. The investigation is carried out at three different velocities 20 m/s, 40 m/s and 60 m/s. The distribution of normalized pressure which is the ratio of static pressure to the dynamic pressure is mapped and shown in the form of contours by using the software package SURFER. The trend <b>of</b> <b>wall</b> static pressure development on the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> C shaped <b>duct</b> shows that as the flow proceeds towards the curvature, there exists a high pressure gradient between the outside face and inside face due the centrifugal force acting along the curvature.
