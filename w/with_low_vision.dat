40|$|ABSTRACT Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{life quality}} {{of elderly people}} <b>with</b> acquired <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> before and after hearing and speech intervention. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. The study was made with 52 elderly people <b>with</b> acquired <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Two questionnaires that measures life quality were used in this study. The first was &# 8216;Low Quality of Life Vision (LVQOL) &# 8217; and the second the &# 8216;National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEIVFQ- 25) &# 8217;. The study included people with more than 60 years <b>with</b> acquired <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and who accepted to participate signing the consent form. The hearing and speech therapy were made into three months, one meeting a week. The questionnaires were applied {{in the first and}} last day of the intervention. Results: The age ranged between 60 and 91 years. The macular disorder (38 %), such as age-related macular degeneration, macular hole and high myopia were the main causes of visual loss. Although the tests show superior performance after the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference. On the question about difficulties seeing in general, 17 participants answered that they had much more difficulty before the intervention and only 5 participants have reported having much difficulty after the intervention. Conclusion: The intervention trended to positive results, and after the meetings, participants showed improvements in aspects of the two questionnaires used in the study, decreasing the degree of difficulty in performing activities...|$|R

The quality of life related to the vision is widely highlighted in literature: for example Brown et al. in 2005 underlined the comparison from DMLE and chronic ills, like HIV, angina, dialysis, advanced prostate tumor, stroke, and heart attack. Peripheral <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> appeared the most crippling aspect to the walk, but in recent years a lot of studies stressed the walk difficulty in patients <b>with</b> central <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study has been carried out in partnership between Ophtalmic Department and Physiatrist Department. Its aim was to evaluate static posture in patients affected by maculopathy. We picked out subjects affected by maculopathy <b>with</b> central <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> due to a variety of causes but with preserved peripheral vision. RESULTS: Test trials had the purpose to investigate different aspects of static posture, in subjects affected by central <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> It was related to risk of falling and faulty postures, that are pathologically in a long term. CONCLUSIONS: Our study claimed that in stabilometric analysis the differences between patients affected by maculopathy and control group aren't statistically significant...|$|R

5000|$|Children <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> {{sometimes}} have reading delays, but do benefit from phonics-based beginning reading instruction methods. Engaging phonics instruction is multisensory, highly motivating, and hands-on. Typically students are first taught {{the most frequent}} sounds of the alphabet letters, especially the so-called short vowel sounds, then taught to blend sounds together with three-letter consonant-vowel-consonant words such as cat, red, sit, hot, sun. Hands-on (or kinesthetically appealing) VERY enlarged print materials such as those found in [...] "The Big Collection of Phonics Flipbooks" [...] by Lynn Gordon (Scholastic, 2010) are helpful for teaching word families and blending skills to beginning readers <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision.</b> Beginning reading instructional materials should focus primarily on the lower-case letters, not the capital letters (even though they are larger) because reading text requires familiarity (mostly) with lower-case letters. Phonics-based beginning reading should also be supplemented with phonemic awareness lessons, writing opportunities, and lots of read-alouds (literature read to children daily) to stimulate motivation, vocabulary development, concept development, and comprehension skill development. Many children <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> can be successfully included in regular education environments. Parents {{may need to be}} vigilant to ensure that the school provides the teacher and students with appropriate low vision resources, for example technology in the classroom, classroom aide time, modified educational materials, and consultation assistance <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> experts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Students <b>with</b> {{blindness}} or <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> {{are often}} discouraged from full participation in laboratory science classes {{due to the}} inadequacy of current methodological approaches {{and the lack of}} sophisticated adaptive technologies. Consequently, these students rarely go on to pursue advanced studies and employment in the sciences. In response to his own frustrations as a scientist with blindness, Supalo conceived, co-founded, and managed the Independent Laboratory Access for the Blind (ILAB) project for his doctoral research in chemistry. Numerous multisensory tools, technologies, and methodologies for teaching the sciences to students with visual impairments were developed and evaluated by the ILAB team. In 2009 and 2010, these hands-on adaptations were used by students <b>with</b> blindness and <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> from throughout the Caribbean during a chemistry workshop at a one-week summer camp held on the island of Tobago. Led by Supalo during the first-ever Camp Can Do in 2009 and Wohlers during 2010, the chemistry workshop successfully introduced the students to some basic chemical reaction...|$|R

40|$|Background: Socioeconomic {{factors are}} known to be {{associated}} with visual impairment. Being someone who is visually impaired could affect his quality of life. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the quality of life (QOL) in severe <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and blind population in Indonesia in relation to their socioeconomic status. Methods: A cross sectional population-based study was performed in 5 provinces, in Indonesia. Respondents of validation study on blindness data of national basic health survey 2013 (RISKESDAS 2013), who were above 18 years old <b>with</b> severe <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> (BCVA≥ 3 / 60 to 6 / 60) and blind (BCVA 64 years old (64. 9 %) <b>with</b> <b>low</b> education (65. 7 %), illiterate (52. 2 %), low income (71. 6 %), non working (63. 4 %) and living in urban areas (58. 2 %). The blind population has lower VFQ scores than severe <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> (p= 0. 001). Different status of educational level, literacy adequacy, income level and residency did not show significant difference in VFQ scores, but those who have an occupation had better VFQ scores than those who do not (p= 0. 041). Conclusion: Visual related quality of life (VRQOL) of severe <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and blind population was associated significantly with occupational status. Because of culture and characteristics of Indonesian people, VRQOL of severe <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and blind population in Indonesia was not affected by educational level, literacy, income level, and residency. </p...|$|R

The data collection instrument was created with structured questions that were developed from an exploratory study and a previous test based on interviews, and it evaluated the following variables: personal characteristics, use of optical and nonoptical aids, and activities that required the use of optical and nonoptical aids. The study population included 30 subjects <b>with</b> acquired <b>low</b> <b>vision</b> and visual acuities of 20 / 200 - 20 / 400. Most subjects reported the use of some optical aids (60. 0 %).

The majority (63. 3 %) of subjects also reported the use of nonoptical aids, the most frequent ones being letter magnification (68. 4 %), followed by bringing the objects closer to the eyes (57. 8 %). Subjects often used more than one nonoptical aid. The majority of participants reported the use of optical and nonoptical aids during reading activities, highlighting the use of spectacles, magnifying glasses, and letter magnification; however, even after the use of these aids, we found that the subjects often needed to read the text more than once to understand it. During writing activities, all subjects reported the use of optical aids, while most stated that they did not use nonoptical aids for such activities...|$|R
