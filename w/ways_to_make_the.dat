5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
25|$|Breakthroughs in telescope, {{detector}} {{and computer}} technology now allow astronomical surveys to produce {{large numbers of}} images, spectra and catalogues. These data sets cover the sky at all wavelengths, from gamma- and X-rays through optical, infrared and radio waves. Astronomers are developing <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> large amount of data easily accessible. These techniques use the grid paradigm of distributed computing with seamless, transparent access to data through virtual observatories (VOs). As a physical observatory has telescopes with unique astronomical instruments, a VO consists of data centres with unique collections of astronomical data, software systems and processing capabilities. This global, community-based initiative is being developed under the International Virtual Observatory Alliance and in Europe {{as part of the}} EURO-VO project.|$|E
25|$|The next 140 {{years were}} marked by an {{inability}} to take action {{on the part of}} those responsible for the maintenance of the drainage scheme. Once completed, it came under the jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Sewers, and routine maintenance did not take place. In 1811, the Commissioners pinned their hopes on the proposed Bristol to Taunton canal, which would have crossed the drain by an aqueduct, which would have included a new clyse at a lower level than the Dunball outlet, but the canal project came to nothing. The banks continued to slip, and the peat continued to rise up in the bottom of the drain. They asked Robert Anstice to produce a report on the condition of the drain in 1816, but it was 1818 before the report was produced and highlighted the poor state of repair of the system. They also asked for a report on <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> bridges wider, but nothing came of it. Ten years later, they commissioned another report, but the local landowners took matters into their own hands and asked Josiah Easton to inspect the drain.|$|E

500|$|Eloy Mestrelle {{introduced}} milled coinage to England in 1561, {{but their}} production ceased in 1575. On 8 August 1649, the Council of State and the House of Commons opted to summon Peter Blondeau, a Paris Mint engineer, to London to modernise {{operations at the}} Tower Mint. Mint officials opposed Blondeau's techniques, and subjected him {{to a series of}} trials in which the quality of his product would be compared to that made by the Mint. According to a pamphlet published in Blondeau's name, his process is described as [...] "a new invention, to make a handsome coyne... that shall not only be stamped flat on both sides, but shall even be marked with letters on the thickness of the brim," [...] which was intended to prevent clipping. Blondeau described, in a proposition presumably meant for the Committee of the Mint, [...] "two different <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> pieces marked about the thicknesse or edge. One is auncient, knowne to severall men, and according whereunto David Ramage , workeman of the Mint, hath made some bigg pieces; but that way is very tedious, requireth much time, spoyles abondance of stamps and engines, and cannot be done upon the currant money, which is thynne." [...] Blondeau was referring to the type of collar added to the Paris Mint's early coinage presses by Olivier, which were time-consuming to use and caused significant damage to coinage dies and engines. He went on to say [...] "s touching the new way, which is ready and expeditious, and can be based upon the thynne and currant money, I am the inventor of it, and only I know itt, as I can make appeare by experiences, if it be the pleasure of the State to imploy me." [...] Blondeau also argued that his methods would prevent counterfeiting, because the machinery required was too complex to be duplicated by criminals.|$|E

2500|$|Stokowski {{made his}} very first recordings, with the Philadelphia Orchestra, for the Victor Talking Machine Company in October 1917, {{beginning}} with two of Brahms' Hungarian Dances. Other works recorded in the early sessions were the scherzo from Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream incidental music and [...] "Dance of the Blessed Spirits" [...] from Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. [...] He found <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> best use of the acoustical process, until electrical recording was introduced by Victor {{in the spring of}} 1925. He conducted the first orchestral electrical recording to be made in America (Saint-Saëns's Danse Macabre) in April 1925. The following month Stokowski recorded Marche Slave by Tchaikovsky, in which he increased the double basses to best utilise the lower frequencies of early electrical recording. Stokowski was also the first conductor in America to record all four Brahms symphonies (between 1927 and 1933).|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{planned to be}} developed simultaneously with the previous Zero Escape game, Virtue's Last Reward, with the two games being [...] "paired as a set", and with Virtue's Last Reward having a cliffhanger ending. With Zero Time Dilemma, Uchikoshi intended to resolve all mysteries left from the previous game, {{as well as all}} introduced in the third, while also attempting to make the story enjoyable for first-time players. This was used as a [...] "basic framework" [...] to write the story within. In addition to figuring out how to explain the mysteries while avoiding contradictions with Virtue's Last Reward, they added side stories to the narrative to give it [...] "a little extra punch". They also took the time-travel ability some characters in Virtue's Last Reward have into consideration, as it opened up for more narrative possibilities. Uchikoshi worked with two other writers; the three helped each other come up with ideas and figure out the best <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> story work. When coming up with the story, he knew from the start that he wanted Sigma, Phi and Diana to be on one team, and Akane on another; this left open slots in the teams, which were filled with other characters as story development progressed. The script took one year to write. While Uchikoshi had already had an idea for the setting and events of Zero Time Dilemma when writing Virtue's Last Reward, the game structure changed when the time came to implement it. One reason was that characters [...] "take on {{a life of their own}} and make their own decisions" [...] when he writes from their point of view, and that characters might pull the story in a different direction than he had originally planned; most of the time, he would let the story go where the characters want to go rather than forcing it to follow his original plans, leading to changes in story and structure. The budget partly dictated the game's setting in an enclosed space as it required few art assets to develop.|$|E

Their first duty was to hasten the burial, so as {{to prevent the spread}} of contagion, and they went at once their {{different}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> preparations. No form of conventional respect could be used, but it was the three who so deeply loved him who laid him in the rough-made coffin, hastily put together the same evening, with the cross that had served him in his conflict on his breast, and three camellia buds from Viola's tree. Dermot had thought of her and ridden over to fetch them. There had been no disfigurement. If there had been he might have lived, but still it was a comfort to know that the dear face was last seen in more than its own calm majesty, as of one who lay asleep after a mighty conquest. Over the coffin they placed the lion's skin. It had been left in the room during his illness, and must have been condemned, and it made his fit pall when they took it to be buried with him. It was before daybreak that, with good old Richardson's help, they carried him down to a large cart belonging to the potteries, drawn by the two big horses he used to pet, and driven by George Yolland himself. They took him to our own family burial-place in Arghouse churchyard, where the grave had been dug at night. They meant no one to be there, but behold! there was a multitude of heads gathered round, two or three hundred at least, and when the faithful four seemed to need aid in carrying that great weight the few steps from the gate, there was a rush forward, in spite of the peril, and disappointment when no help was accepted.|$|E
