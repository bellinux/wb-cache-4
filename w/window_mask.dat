Regions around pre-classified pixels are presented to train the neural network that learns a sub-optimal set of masks via back-propagation algorithm. Classification performance is evaluated using kappa statistics. The neural classifiers showed almost the same performance for different <b>window</b> <b>mask</b> sizes and training samples. However, the Minkovski-r= 1. 1 error showed a slightly better performance than the others. Best results are obtained when the neural classified image is followed by an erosion process via Median filter.

40|$|Simulations for {{predicting}} resist {{effects in the}} sub 50 nm resolution regime are strongly requested today, {{as well as for}} improvement of present resolution and CD control. Therefore this letter reports about a simulative resist parameter sensitivity analysis with help of calibrated resist models, based on Sigma-C's SOLID software. Target {{of the study was to}} learn about the impact of resist parameters on practical resolution limits and to derive specific process and material change proposals. After resist model calibration for 90 nm design rules, process <b>window,</b> <b>mask</b> error enhancement factor, linearity, line end shortening etc. were investigated. The main influencing resist parameters were determined with two independent methodologies: Single-and multiparameter variation, which showed good agreement. Further, the sensitivity analysis was expanded to feature sizes down to 20 nm halfpitch. To decouple all optical influences from the resist, ideal rectangular aerial images were generated and used for simulation. The simulation reveals that an ArF resist might be capable of 40 nm resolution with sufficient exposure dose latitude, comparable to today's 90 nm design rule. On the other hand even optimized exposure tools can't provide such ideal rectangular aerial images and there is no commercial resist known today that shows a process window at 40 nm resolution today. Therefore, the main key resist parameters, which are responsible for resolution enhancement, were identified out of this simulation study and proposals for improved processes are given...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Radiation-induced single-event upset (SEU) has be-come a key {{challenge}} for cloud computing. The proposed in-troduction of low bandgap materials (Ge, III-Vs) as channel replacement and steep switching devices for low-voltage appli-cations may induce radiation reliability issues {{due to their}} low ionization energy and device architecture. In this paper, the soft-error generation and propagation in Si FinFET, III-V FinFET, and III-V Hetero-junction tunnel FET (HTFET) are investigated using device and circuit simulation. III-V FinFET shows enhanced charge collection compared with Si FinFET, whereas HTFET shows significant reduction of the bipolar gain effect and charge collection. Soft-error rate (SER) evaluation methodology has been proposed for these emerging devices based on the critical LET extraction. SRAM bit flip, electrical masking effect, and latching <b>window</b> <b>masking</b> effect have been analyzed with supply voltage scaling. The SER evaluation of SRAM and logic shows that HTFET-based circuits are promising for radiation resilient ultra-low power applications. III-V FinFET shows increased SER for SRAM for VDD range of 0. 3 – 0. 8 Vand reduced logic SER below 0. 5 V compared with Si FinFET.

TMS research has revealed several time <b>windows</b> of <b>masking</b> relative to visual stimulus onset, most consistently a time window around 100 ms post-stimulus. However, the exact nature of visual processing in this 'classical' time window, e. g. whether it represents the feedforward processing of the visual information, or rather a feedback projection from higher visual areas, remains unclear. Here, we used TMS to mask in the same participants two types of stimuli of different complexities (orientation Gratings and Faces) over different time <b>windows.</b> Interestingly, the <b>masking</b> functions were not the same for both stimulus types. We found an earlier peak masking latency for orientation stimuli, and a slower recovery for Faces. In a second, follow-up experiment, we superimposed both types of stimuli to create one composite stimulus set. Depending on the instruction, participants could then perform orientation or face discrimination tasks on the exact same stimuli. In addition, for each participant, stimuli were calibrated to equate task difficulties. The peak masking latency was now identical for both tasks, but the masking function revealed again a slower recovery during the face discrimination task, suggesting top-down (recurrent) effects {{in the second half of}} the masking function. Hence, rather than this <b>masking</b> <b>window</b> reflecting either feedforward or feedback processing, the early part of what is traditionally considered one <b>masking</b> <b>window</b> may reflect feedforward processing, while the latter part may already reflect recurrent processing.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} how a direct coupling of a lithography simulation {{program and a}} semiconductor device simulation tool {{can be used to}} investigate the impact of lithographic process variations on nano-scaled CMOS devices. In contrast to conventional evaluation criteria such as process <b>windows,</b> <b>mask</b> error enhancement factor (MEEF), or CD (critical dimension) uniformity, the lithography process is regarded in a more holistic fashion as a means to an end. As a consequence, the ultimate figure of merit is determined by the performance of the device. Lithography simulations are conducted using a rigorous EMF solver for the computation of the mask nearfield. TCAD process and device simulations are performed for an ultra thinned body fully depleted silicon on insulator (UTB FD-SOI) nMOSFET, with a physical gate length of 32 run. Electrical parameters such as on- and off-current, threshold voltage, sub-threshold slope, gate-capacitance, and contact resistances are computed and extracted. The impact of lithographic process variations on the electrical behavior of the target device is surveyed and illustrated. Moreover, we present an adjusted lithography process window defined by the electrical behavior of the device. In addition to a discussion of the obtained results, this paper also focuses on the software design aspects of interfacing a lithography simulation environment with a device simulator. The steps involved in extracting parameters and transferring them from one program to the other are explained, and further automation capabilities are suggested.

Important goals were the applicability to any realworld music and speech sound, integrating mutual masking effects between time-frequency components, coping with the time-frequency spread of such an operation, and computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm first determines an estimation of the masked threshold within an analysis <b>window.</b> The <b>masked</b> threshold function is then shifted in level by an amount determined experimentally, and all components falling below this function (the irrelevance threshold) are removed. This shift gives a conservative way to deal with uncertainty effects resulting from removing time-frequency components and with inaccuracies in the masking model. The removal of components is described as an adaptive Gabor multiplier.
