50|$|The {{other end}} of the wire is {{connected}} to the reel, as well as a D-clip on the fencer's jacket to prevent it from disconnecting during a bout. In addition, foilists and saberists must connect their alligator clips to their lamés. Fencers are forced by regulation to attach the lamé clip to their <b>weapon</b> <b>arm</b> side to prevent accidental or intentional removal.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a fencer wears a body cord {{under their}} jacket. The wire is {{threaded}} through {{the sleeve of}} the <b>weapon</b> <b>arm</b> as it is being donned. Most gloves feature a small hole designed around {{the use of a}} body cord. In officially sanctioned tournaments, the plug that fits into the weapon must be secured with an additional device, usually a small clip.|$|E

50|$|The 25 mm {{round can}} be used in both an anti-materiel and anti-personnel fashion. When {{operating}} in the anti-personnel role, a 25 mm <b>weapon</b> <b>armed</b> with HE rounds can effectively kill large numbers of opposing troops either in the open or in light fortifications. When operating in the anti-materiel role, a 25 mm <b>weapon</b> <b>armed</b> with armor-piercing rounds can disable many aircraft and vehicles, including some main battle tanks.|$|R
50|$|A <b>weapon,</b> <b>arm,</b> or {{armament}} is any device {{used with}} intent to inflict damage or harm to living beings, structures, or systems. Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law enforcement, self-defense, and warfare. In a broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary.|$|E
50|$|The RuneQuest {{combat system}} has a {{subsystem}} for hit location. Successful attacks are allocated randomly (or by decision) to {{a part of}} the target's body. In RuneQuest, a lucky hit against a character's leg, <b>weapon</b> <b>arm,</b> or head could have specific effects on the game's mechanics and narrative. This was a unique part of the game's combat system and helped to separate it from the more abstracted, hit-point-based combat of competitors such as Dungeons & Dragons.|$|E
50|$|Ma Gnucci hires Bushwacker {{to capture}} Joan, a {{neighbor}} of the Punisher. The Punisher traces her to the Central Park Zoo, where he rescues her. The next mission occurs in Grey's Funeral Home, at the mob funeral of Bobby Gnucci. The Punisher massacres the funeral party and kills Eddie Gnucci (the other Gnucci son) by throwing Eddie out a window and Eddie is impaled on a gate spike. The Punisher then travels to the Gnucci estate to kill Bushwacker and Ma Gnucci herself. After fighting his way through Ma's remaining men, Punisher then fights Bushwacker who he defeats in a gunfight. To finish off Bushwacker, Punisher rips his <b>weapon</b> <b>arm</b> off and shoots {{him in the chest}} followed by Punisher dropping Bushwacker several stories above the ground. Castle hunts down Ma and kills her.|$|E

The {{article examines}} how the issue of riot control agents has complicated efforts for the United States to enter into and ratify chemical weapons-related arms control agreements. The article provides an overview of chemical weapons, examines the relevant arms control agreements, explores why and how riot control agents influence debates over the merits of these treaties, and explains why riot control agents remain a contentious issue in chemical <b>weapons</b> <b>arms</b> control and foreign policy in the United States...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the extent to}} which international public health has become securitized and what effects this has on global health governance and the biological weapons control regime. Attempts to securitize public health are traced in the two multilateral discursive spaces of greatest relevance to biological <b>weapons</b> <b>arms</b> control and international public health; the community of state parties to the Biological Weapons Convention, and the World Health Organization. The conclusion is that with respect to public health, the identified securitization moves have led to a strengthening of the state as actor in the provision of international public health. For biological <b>weapons</b> <b>arms</b> control, the impact of the identified securitization moves depends largely on the overall development of the biological weapons control regime...|$|R
5000|$|In a flèche, a fencer {{transfers}} his or {{her weight}} onto {{his or her}} front foot and starts to extend the arm. The rear leg initiates the attack, but the ball of the leading foot provides the explosive impulse {{that is needed to}} drive the fencer toward the opponent. Continuing to bring the <b>weapon,</b> <b>arm,</b> and front shoulder forward, he or she picks up his or her back foot, crossing his or her front leg, and landing {{it in front of the}} other foot - as if taking an exaggerated walking stride. It is at this point, when the back foot lands and just after that arm has become fully extended, that the hit should be made. In foil, the attack is considered over when the back foot lands, and the opponent can seize right of Way by initiating an attack.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{simplicity}} of the underlying principles, priority rules are somewhat convoluted, and their interpretation is a source of much acrimony. Much of this acrimony is centered on the definition of attack. According to the FIE rules, an attack is defined as [...] "the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent's target...". This is explained in the USFA Fencing Officials Commission FAQ: Initial refers to which fencer starts the action before his/her opponent does. Offensive indicates moving towards the opponent. Extending indicates that the <b>weapon</b> <b>arm</b> is moving away from the body - right of way does not require a fully extended arm. Continuously indicates that there is no [...] "break" [...] in the attack in which the attacker stops moving forward or holds back his/her arm. Threatening indicates that the attacker is in advance-lunge distance and close enough to hit, and his/her weapon's point (for foil) or blade (for sabre) are approaching the opponent's valid target.|$|E
