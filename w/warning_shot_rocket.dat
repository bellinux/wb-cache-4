The “underlying goal of the Sugar Shot to Space program is to loft a rocket powered by a ‘sugar propellant’ into space.” The goal is for a rocket with a sugar-based motor {{to make it into}} space, or 100 km (62.137 mi) high. The Double Sugar <b>Shot</b> <b>rocket</b> will reach 33 km, or one third of the goal altitude.
