5|$|After its {{discovery}} by Voyager 1, Thebe {{was photographed}} by the Voyager 2 space probe in 1979. However, before the Galileo spacecraft arrived at Jupiter, knowledge about it <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> limited.

5|$|Despite his busy schedule, {{during his}} {{university}} years Bojić spent {{many of his}} nights in cafés and bars, mingling with other artists in Skadarlija, Belgrade's Bohemian quarter. He <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> popular among the writers and artists of his generation.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{measurement}} technique is coherent, it naturally rejects incoherent radiation. Additionally, because the time slice of {{the measurement}} <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> narrow, the noise contribution to the measurement <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> low.|$|R
50|$|Dominance is also {{unrelated}} to the distribution of alleles in the population. Some dominant alleles <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> common, while others <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare. The most common allele in a population may be recessive when combined with some rare variants.|$|R
50|$|This {{activity}} <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> {{dangerous because}} optimum highmark terrain is typically {{in areas where}} avalanche danger <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> high. Snowmobilers <b>are</b> the recreation group {{most likely to be}} killed in an avalanche, largely due to the activity of highmarking.|$|R
5|$|Lux Radio Theatre (CBS, February 1952). A radio {{version of}} the 1951 MGM film {{featuring}} Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, and William Warfield from the film's cast. Jay C. Flippen portrayed Cap'n Andy. This version <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> faithful to the 1951 film adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Room 1 <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> poorly {{preserved}} {{and is the}} southernmost of the rooms. Only one doorjamb and a portion of wall belonging to a rear bench were found during excavations.|$|E

5|$|The 1939 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{ran through the}} summer and fall of 1939. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> unreliable. Most east Pacific storms were of no threat to land. However, 1939 saw a large number of storms threaten California.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the valley between Taegu and P'ohong-dong, the terrain along the line <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> rough and mountainous thanks to the Taebaek Mountains which ran from north to south down Korea's east coast. Northeast of P'ohong-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult. Thus, the UN established the northern line of the Pusan Perimeter using the terrain as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces.|$|E
5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E

5|$|Agrippa <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> influential—as a sigil for {{the artistic}} {{community}} {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
5|$|Although al-Jamri's {{death was}} {{announced}} in the morning, the mourning processions only began after the sunset Maghrib prayer. The funeral course was changed several times. Ultimately, it began at 6:00 in Muqsha village before moving along {{the west side of}} Budaiya highway to Bani Jamra, where al-Jamri was buried at 10:00. The weather <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> cold for Bahrain, yet thousands showed up wearing black mourning clothes and carrying black flags. According to a number of Al-Wasat writers, the funeral was the largest in the modern history of Bahrain.|$|E

She was also the first British ironclad to sail further from Britain than the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|At age twenty-seven, {{he entered}} the Monastery of Stoudios, giving his life over {{completely}} to discipleship to his teacher Symeon the Studite. The elder Symeon was not an ordained priest, but a simple monk who was considered holy by many people. The younger Symeon <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> zealous in his practices and in following his teacher—to {{such an extent that}} the abbot of the monastery insisted that Symeon leave after only a few months.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{his work}} for the 60 Minutes reports plus further {{investigation}} on his own, Thompson wrote A Glimpse of Hell. The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company. Thompson's book <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> critical {{of most of the}} Navy personnel involved in the investigation, concluding that the Navy had orchestrated a cover-up to conceal the true cause of the explosion.|$|E
40|$|The {{distinction}} between {{food and medicine}} may be reduced by producing human pharmaceuticals in food crops. The benefits of such an approach are abundantly clear. Producing biopharmaceutical molecules synthetically, or purifying them from microbial fermentation systems, can <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult and expensive. Plants, on the other hand, especially food crops such as corn, <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> efficient producers of large amounts of protein. This ability could <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> important {{for the production of}} oral vaccines, for example, where large doses are typically required to elicit immunity...|$|R
50|$|The tree <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> {{vulnerable}} to fire, and is damaged by even low-intensity burns. The resinous bark {{is capable of}} igniting quickly, and a crown fire will almost certainly kill the tree. However, populations of Pinus longaeva are known to <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> resilient, and as a primary succession species, {{it is believed that}} populations of the tree would reestablish itself quickly after a fire. That said, large-scale fires <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> uncommon where the species grows, and are not {{a major factor in the}} species' long-term viability.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food {{on the black market}} <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} the Russian forces' morale <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> high. The Russian commanders had ample experience in siege operations; Paskevich himself had captured {{at least six}} fortified cities in his career, including the capture of Erevan and Abbas-Abbad Fortress in the Russo-Persian War of 1826 and the battle of Akhalzic and siege of Kars during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects.
