Elongation growth was completed by late-June when the culm lignin content is approximately half that of mature culms. Thioacidolysis analysis indicated that H units were almost constantly incorporated into lignin polymers during culm development, whereas the ratio of S/G units was variable. The contents of monolignol glucosides peaked during the early stages of lignification, whereas the contents of monolignols peak at later stages of lignification. These details of the variations in lignin structure and the contents of lignin precursors in developing shoots of S. tootsik contribute to our understanding of lignification in bamboo, and <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>to</b> optimize the <b>use</b> of the bamboo biomass.|$|R
