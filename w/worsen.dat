40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{hospitalized with}} acute heart failure may {{experience}} <b>worsening</b> symptoms requiring escalation of therapy. In-hospital <b>worsening</b> heart failure {{is associated with}} worse in-hospital and postdischarge outcomes, but associations between the timing of <b>worsening</b> heart failure and outcomes are unknown. METHODS: Using data from a large clinical registry linked to Medicare claims, we examined characteristics, outcomes, and costs of patients hospitalized for acute heart failure. We defined in-hospital <b>worsening</b> heart failure {{by the use of}} inotropes or intravenous vasodilators or initiation of mechanical circulatory support, hemodialysis, or ventilation. The study groups were early <b>worsening</b> heart failure (n = 1, 990), late <b>worsening</b> heart failure (n = 4, 223), complicated presentation (n = 15, 361), and uncomplicated hospital course (n = 41, 334). RESULTS: Among 62, 908 patients, those with late in-hospital <b>worsening</b> heart failure had higher in-hospital and postdischarge mortality than patients with early <b>worsening</b> heart failure or complicated presentation. Those with early or late <b>worsening</b> heart failure had more frequent all-cause and heart failure readmissions at 30 days and 1 year, with resultant higher costs, compared with patients with an uncomplicated hospital course. CONCLUSION: Although late <b>worsening</b> heart failure was associated with the highest mortality, both early and late <b>worsening</b> heart failures were associated with more frequent readmissions and higher health care costs compared to uncomplicated hospital course. Prevention of <b>worsening</b> heart failure may be an important focus in the care of hospitalized patients with acute heart failure...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: There {{is a need}} {{to define}} and {{validate}} measures of clinical <b>worsening</b> in knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA). The objectives of this exploratory project were: (i) to characterize <b>worsening</b> criteria in knee and hip OA using psychometric methods; (ii) to estimate their sensitivity and specificity; and (iii) to validate and compare these criteria with <b>worsening</b> criteria previously described in the literature. METHOD: An Expert Group reached consensus on 10 sets of <b>worsening</b> criteria to be tested in observational data sets of patients with knee or hip OA who received multimodal conservative treatment. These sets included 219 patients (derivation cohort) and 296 patients (validation cohort). We estimated minimal clinically important <b>worsening</b> (MCIW) values for pain, function, stiffness, and patient global assessment, and tested candidate <b>worsening</b> criteria in the derivation cohort. Finally, using patient judgement, we examined the sensitivity and specificity of literature-based as well as candidate <b>worsening</b> criteria in the validation cohort. RESULTS: Literature-based <b>worsening</b> criteria were found to have high specificity (range 60 - 92 %) but low sensitivity (range 22 - 59 %). Two out of 10 candidate <b>worsening</b> criteria constructed by the Expert Group showed an acceptable combination of sensitivity and specificity in the derivation cohort, which was confirmed in the validation cohort (ranging from 54 % to 65 % and 67 % to 74 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe symptomatic <b>worsening</b> criteria based on expert consensus after examining the performance of candidate criteria derived from the literature applied to data in an observational study.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{predictors of}} <b>worsening</b> symptoms and overall {{health of the}} treated hip or knee joint following 26 weeks of a nonsurgical chronic disease management program for hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to examine the consistency of these predictors across 3 definitions of <b>worsening.</b> Methods: This prospective cohort study followed 539 participants of the program for 26 weeks. The 3 definitions of <b>worsening</b> included symptomatic <b>worsening</b> based on change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Global score (WOMAC-G) measuring pain, stiffness, and function; a transition scale that asked about overall health of the treated hip or knee joint; and a composite outcome including both. Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed for the 3 definitions of <b>worsening.</b> Results: Complete data were available for 386 participants: mean age was 66. 3 years, 69 % were female, 85 % reported knee joint pain as primary symptom (signal joint), 46 % were waitlisted for total joint arthroplasty (TJA). TJA waitlist status, signal joint, 6 -Minute Walk Test (6 MWT), depressive symptoms, pain, and age were independently associated with at least 1 definition of <b>worsening.</b> TJA waitlist status and 6 MWT remained in the multivariate models for the transition and composite definitions of <b>worsening.</b> Conclusion: Participants reporting <b>worsening</b> on the transition scale did not consistently meet the WOMAC-G definition of <b>worsening</b> symptoms. TJA waitlist status was predictive of the composite definition of <b>worsening,</b> a trend apparent for the transition definition. However, variables that predict <b>worsening</b> remain largely unknown.

40|$|SummaryPurposeTo {{determine}} {{the association of}} MRI-assessed <b>worsening</b> of tibiofemoral cartilage damage, meniscal damage, meniscal extrusion, separately and together, with progression of radiographic joint space narrowing (JSN). Method and materialsThe Multicenter Osteoarthitis Study (MOST) Study is a cohort study of subjects with or at risk for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Knees with radiographic OA Kellgren–Lawrence grade 2 at baseline and with baseline and 30 -month 1. 0 T MRIs were selected for reading using the WORMS system for cartilage damage, meniscal damage, and meniscal extrusion. The association of <b>worsening</b> of cartilage damage, meniscal damage, and/or meniscal extrusion with increases in the JSN was performed using logistic regression. ResultsA total of 276 knees (one per subject) were included (women 68. 5 %, mean age 62. 9  ±  7. 8, mean body mass index (BMI) 30. 2  ±  5. 0). <b>Worsening</b> of each MRI feature was associated with any increase in JSN (P <  0. 01). <b>Worsening</b> of cartilage damage was more frequently observed than <b>worsening</b> of meniscal damage and extrusion, and {{was significantly associated with}} both slow and fast progression of JSN. An increasing risk of JSN <b>worsening</b> was associated with increasing number of <b>worsening</b> MRI features (P for trend <  0. 0001). ConclusionWorsening of tibiofemoral cartilage damage, meniscal damage, and meniscal extrusion are independent predictors of JSN progression in the same compartment. <b>Worsening</b> of cartilage damage is more frequently observed in JSN when compared to meniscal <b>worsening.</b> A strong cumulative effect on JSN progression is observed for <b>worsening</b> of more than one MRI feature...|$|R

5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially <b>worsen</b> during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or <b>worsen</b> {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Neurological <b>worsening</b> {{in acute}} ischaemic stroke {{patients}} is common with significant morbidity and mortality. Aims: To determine the {{factors associated with}} early neurological <b>worsening</b> within the first 9 h after onset of acute ischaemic stroke. Materials & methods: The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) {{was used to assess}} stroke severity. Early neurological <b>worsening</b> was defined as NIHSS score increase ≥ 4 NIHSS points within 9 h of symptom onset compared to NIHSS score within 3 h of symptom onset. Patients with early neurological <b>worsening</b> were compared to patients with unchanged or improved NIHSS scores. Results: Of the 2484 patients admitted with ischaemic stroke, 552 patients had NIHSS score within 3 h of symptom onset, and 44 (8. 0 %) experienced early neurological <b>worsening.</b> The median NIHSS on admission was 8. 4 in both groups. Early neurological <b>worsening</b> was associated with low body temperature on admission (P = 0. 01), proximal compared to distal MCA occlusion (P = 0. 007) and with ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis > 50 % or occlusion (P = 0. 04). Early neurological <b>worsening</b> was associated with higher NIHSS day 7 (P < 0. 001) and higher mortality within 7 days of stroke onset (P = 0. 005). Conclusions: Early neurological <b>worsening</b> has serious consequences for the short-term outcome for patients with acute ischaemic stroke and is associated with low body temperature on admission, and with extracranially and intracranially large-vessel stenosis or occlusion. </p...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the angiographic, myocardial perfusion, and wall motion abnormalities {{in patients with}} severe compared with mild <b>worsening</b> of regional function during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for evaluation of myocardial ischaemia. METHODS: 147 patients with significant coronary artery disease and new or <b>worsening</b> wall motion abnormalities during DSE were enrolled. Left ventricular function was evaluated using a 16 segment/ 4 grade score model where 1 = normal and 4 = dyskinesis. Simultaneous sestamibi SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging was performed in all patients. RESULTS: Severe <b>worsening</b> of regional function (an increase in wall motion score of two grades or more in >/= 1 segment) was detected in 37 patients, while 110 patients had mild <b>worsening</b> (an increase in wall motion score {{of no more than}} one grade in >/= 1 segment). Patients with severe <b>worsening</b> of regional function had more stenotic coronary arteries (2. 31 (0. 8) v 1. 97 (0. 8) (mean (SD)) (p < 0. 05), a higher prevalence of left anterior descending coronary artery disease (95 % v 73 %) (p < 0. 05), a higher resting wall motion score index (1. 71 (0. 42) v 1. 51 (0. 40) (p = 0. 01), and more stress perfusion defects (3. 8 (1. 5) v 2. 8 (1. 5) (p < 0. 001) compared with patients with mild <b>worsening.</b> Multivariate analysis identified the number of stress perfusion defects (p < 0. 005, chi(2) = 8. 8) and the number of ischaemic segments on echocardiography (p < 0. 05, chi(2) = 4. 3) as independent variables associated with severe <b>worsening</b> of regional function. CONCLUSIONS: The grade of <b>worsening</b> of regional function during DSE predicts the underlying extent of myocardial perfusion abnormalities. The occurrence of severe <b>worsening</b> of regional function is associated with variables known to predict worse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPatients with fibrotic {{sarcoidosis}} {{can develop}} <b>worsening</b> of pulmonary symptoms for various reasons. We studied acute <b>worsening</b> events defined as episodes treated with limited courses of either antibiotics and or increased corticosteroid doses which resolved within four weeks. The prevalence of acute <b>worsening</b> events {{in patients with}} fibrotic sarcoidosis was investigated. Of 740 sarcoidosis patients seen in our clinic over a four month period, 129 (17 %) had fibrotic sarcoidosis. We noted the age, race, gender, computer tomography (CT) results, and pulmonary function as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), and the FEV 1 /FVC ratio. In a retrospective manner, the fibrotic sarcoidosis patients reported a median of three acute <b>worsening</b> events (range zero to eight) in the prior year. Bronchiectasis was noted on CT imaging in 63 of 129 (49 %) of the fibrotic sarcoidosis patients. Fibrotic sarcoidosis patients reported a higher frequency of acute <b>worsening</b> events (3 (0 – 6)) than those without bronchiectasis (2 (0 – 8), p =  0. 0001). Sixteen patients receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies reported a higher frequency of acute <b>worsening</b> events compared to those not receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies (p =  0. 0297). There was no relationship {{between the number of}} acute <b>worsening</b> events and race, gender, smoking history, or FVC, FEV 1, or FEV 1 /FVC ratio. We conclude that acute <b>worsening</b> events are frequent in patients with fibrotic sarcoidosis patients and are more common in patients with bronchiectasis and those receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody therapies...|$|R
