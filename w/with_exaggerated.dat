5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{entrepreneur}} James Mason Hutchings, artist Thomas Ayres and {{two others}} {{were the first to}} tour the area. Hutchings and Ayres were responsible for much of the earliest publicity about Yosemite, writing articles and special magazine issues about the Valley. Ayres' style in art was highly detailed <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> angularity. His works and written accounts were distributed nationally, and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City. Hutchings' publicity efforts between 1855 and 1860 led to an increase in tourism to Yosemite.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the joyful {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights in dark alleys. The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for vertical movement, allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas dense with activity. The game features high contrast between darks and lights, <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in their windows.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over the hips. Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand and finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E
25|$|For Gavin Langmuir, anti-Judaism is {{concerned}} <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> accusations against Jews which nonetheless contain a particle of truth or evidence, whereas antisemitism reaches beyond unusual general inferences and {{is concerned}} with false suppositions. Thus Langmuir considers the labelling of Jews as 'Christ-killers' is anti-Judaic; accusations of well-poisoning, on the other hand, he regards as antisemitic. In his view, anti-Judaism and antisemitism have existed side by side from the 12th century onwards and have strengthened each other ever since. The blood libel {{is another example of}} antisemitism, though it is based in distorted notions of Judaism.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} examples of erotic depictions are Paleolithic cave paintings and carvings. Some {{of the more}} common images are of animals, hunting scenes and depictions of human genitalia. Nude human beings <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> sexual characteristics are depicted in some Paleolithic paintings and artifacts (e.g. Venus figurines). Recently discovered cave art at Creswell Crags in England, thought {{to be more than}} 12,000 years old, includes some symbols that may be stylized versions of female genitalia. As there is no direct evidence of the use of these objects, it is speculated that they may have been used in religious rituals, or for a more directly sexual purpose.|$|E
25|$|A drag queen is a person, usually male, who {{dresses in}} {{clothing}} {{of the opposite}} sex and often acts <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> femininity and in feminine gender roles for the purpose of entertainment or fashion. Often, they will exaggerate certain characteristics such as make-up and eyelashes for comic, dramatic, or satirical effect. While drag is very much associated with gay men and gay culture, there are drag artists of all sexualities. There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly in dedication, from professionals who have starred in films to people who just try it once, or those who simply prefer clothing and makeup that is usually worn by the opposite sex in their culture. Drag queens can vary widely by class and culture. Other drag performers include drag kings, women who perform in male roles and attire, faux queens, who are women who dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens, and faux kings, who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings.|$|E
500|$|Dark Magus {{features}} four two-part compositions with {{an average}} length of 25 minutes each. The album's music was unrehearsed and eschewed melody for improvisations around funk rhythms and grooves. The rhythms, colors, and keys [...] "would shift and change on a whim from Davis", as AllMusic's Thom Jurek said. The trumpeter eschewed his previous performances' keyboardists {{in favor of a}} three-guitar line-up of Reggie Lucas, Dominique Gaumont, and Pete Cosey, who had a penchant for guitar wails and pedal effects. Davis often stopped the band with hand signals and created empty spaces, which were longer than traditional jazz breaks, and encouraged the soloists to fill them <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> cadenzas.|$|E

500|$|She {{returned}} to the stage while wearing [...] multiple donned braided extensions for [...] "Paparazzi". Gaga was perched atop a railing and from each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. The performance ended with the railing taking Gaga high above the stage, where she faked her death. This was followed by [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] as she descended from the top—which signified her rebirth—amidst white lights and mechanical fog. She wore a giant gyroscope around her, akin to [...] "The Orbit" [...] by Haus of Gaga. The last song of the show was [...] "Bad Romance" [...] which she performed in an '80s-inspired white power suit <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> high shoulders and high-waisted pants.

500|$|... and its sequels collect {{works by}} {{a range of}} artists and {{cartoonist}}s. The work of [...] "every gay cartoonist of note" [...] at the time appeared in the series, including works by Howard Cruse, Jeffrey A. Krell, Brad Parker, John Blackburn, Jon Macy, and Tom of Finland. The contents of Meatmen are generally more explicit and lewd than the more mainstream oriented Gay Comics. Tom of Finland was a prolific fetish artist, specializing in images of men <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> primary and secondary sex traits, such as extreme muscularity and improbably large penises. His drawings frequently feature two or more men either immediately preceding or during explicit sexual activity. Howard Cruse {{has been described as}} [...] "the most important gay cartoonist", and his work explores both pop and gay culture. In addition to being featured in Meatmen and Gay Comics, his LGBT-themed work has been syndicated in publications such as Heavy Metal, RAW, and Village Voice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a robust face {{alignment}} system {{that is capable of}} dealing <b>with</b> <b>exaggerating</b> expressions, large occlusions, and a wide variety of image noises. The robustness comes from our shape regularization model, which incorporates constrained nonlinear shape prior, geometric transformation, and likelihood of multiple candidate landmarks in a three-layered generative model. The inference algorithm iteratively examines the best candidate positions and updates face shape and pose. This model can effectively recover sufficient shape details from very noisy observations. We demonstrate the performance of this approach on two public domain databases and a large collection of real-world face photographs. ...|$|R

During his {{nine years of}} missionary work in Andalusia, crowds packed the churches at all his sermons. However, his strong pleas for reform and his denunciation of the behaviour of the aristocracy meant that he was denounced {{to the office of}} the Inquisition in Seville in 1531, and put in prison in the summer of 1532. He was charged <b>with</b> <b>exaggerating</b> the dangers of wealth and with closing the gates of heaven to the rich. The charges were refuted and he was declared innocent and released in July 1533.|$|R

The performance started with [...] "Bad Romance", with Gaga dancing around the stage and ultimately breaking open a glass door with the microphone stand. It was performed on The Jay Leno Show, where Gaga wore a pair of black sunglasses and a black jacket with shoulder pads that extended above her head. Her male back-up dancers were dressed in black suits and S-inspired headgear. Both [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Speechless" [...] were performed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 25, 2009. Gaga performed [...] "Bad Romance" [...] on the British TV show The X Factor on December 6, 2009. The performance there had her singing inside a 4-m long bathtub and playing the piano while sitting on a toilet. [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was performed as the last song of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. Wearing an 1980s-inspired white power suit <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> high shoulders and high-waisted pants, she performed the song while standing in a human-sized gyroscope.|$|E
500|$|In Roman tradition, {{borrowed}} from the Greeks, literary theatre was performed by all-male troupes that used face masks <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> facial expressions that allowed audiences to [...] "see" [...] how a character was feeling. Such masks were occasionally also specific to a particular role, and an actor could then play multiple roles merely by switching masks. Female roles were played by men in drag (travesti). Roman literary theatre tradition is particularly well represented in Latin literature by the tragedies of Seneca. The circumstances under which Seneca's tragedies were performed are however unclear; scholarly conjectures range from minimally staged readings to full production pageants. More popular than literary theatre was the genre-defying mimus theatre, which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation, risqué language and jokes, sex scenes, action sequences, and political satire, along with dance numbers, juggling, acrobatics, tightrope walking, striptease, and dancing bears. Unlike literary theatre, mimus was played without masks, and encouraged stylistic realism in acting. Female roles were performed by women, not by men. Mimus {{was related to the}} genre called pantomimus, an early form of story ballet that contained no spoken dialogue. Pantomimus combined expressive dancing, instrumental music and a sung libretto, often mythological, that could be either tragic or comic.|$|E
500|$|Wiene {{asked the}} actors to make {{movements}} similar to dance, most prominently from Veidt, {{but also from}} Krauss, Dagover and Friedrich Feger, who played Francis. Krauss and Veidt are the only actors whose performances fully match the stylization of the sets, which they achieved by concentrating their movements and facial expressions. Barlow notes that [...] "Veidt moves along the wall {{as if it had}} 'exuded' him ... more a part of a material world of objects than a human one", and Krauss [...] "moves with angular viciousness, his gestures seem broken or cracked by the obsessive force within him, a force that seems to emerge from a constant toxic state, a twisted authoritarianism of no human scruple and total insensibility". Most of the other actors besides Krauss and Veidt have a more naturalistic style. Alan, Jane and Francis play the roles of an idyllically happy trio enjoying youth; Alan in particular represents the archetype of a sensitive 19th century student. Mike Budd points out realist characters in stylized settings are a common characteristic in Expressionist theatre. However, David Robinson notes even the performances of the more naturalistic supporting roles in Caligari have Expressionist elements, like Hans-Heinz von Twardowski's [...] "strange, tormented face" [...] as Alan. He also cites Feher's [...] "large angular movements," [...] especially in the scene where he searches the deserted fairground. Other minor roles are Expressionistic in nature, like two policemen who sit facing each other at their desks and move <b>with</b> <b>exaggerated</b> symmetry, and two servants who awaken and rise from their beds in perfect synchronization. Vincent LoBrutto said of the acting in the film: ...|$|E
