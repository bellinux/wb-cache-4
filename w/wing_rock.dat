To predict <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> {{characteristics}} and to design airplanes to avoid <b>wing</b> <b>rock,</b> parameters affecting <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> characteristics must be known. A new nonlinear aerodynamic model is developed to investigate the main aerodynamic nonlinearities causing <b>wing</b> <b>rock.</b> In the present theory, the Beecham-Titchener asymptotic method is used to derive expressions for the limit-cycle amplitude and frequency of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> from nonlinear flight dynamics equations. The resulting expressions are capable of explaining the existence of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> {{for all types of}} aircraft. <b>Wing</b> <b>rock</b> is developed by negative or weakly positive roll damping, and sustained by nonlinear aerodynamic roll damping.

Normal and large-amplitude types of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> are distinguished. Onset of normal <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> occurs at a Hopf bifurcation followed by limit cycle oscillations of gradually growing amplitude.

40|$|Flight at high angle-of-attack conditions, {{which range}} beyond wing stall, has {{numerous}} advantages for mission performance; however, that flight regime is often affected by adverse behaviors.

50|$|To {{execute a}} banked turn from flying {{straight}} and level, the <b>rocking</b> <b>wing</b> worked moderately effectively, {{but when the}} aeroplane's lateral equilibrium had been compromised, tipping the <b>rocking</b> <b>wing</b> {{in the opposite direction}} to the down-going wing to right itself had a tendency to yaw the aircraft in that direction. In effect, the <b>rocking</b> <b>wing</b> did not fully assist in correcting conditions of instability since the pilot had no means with which to induce or correct a yawing motion. Another possible reason behind the <b>rocking</b> <b>wing</b> idea not progressing beyond Watson’s experiments was that it could only be applied to relatively light and small aircraft.|$|R

40|$|<b>Wing</b> <b>rock</b> {{phenomenon}} is manifested by a limit cycle oscillation predominantly in roll about the body axis. This self-induced rolling oscillation is highly annoying {{to the pilot}} and poses serious limitation to the combat effectiveness. The maneuvering envelope of an aircraft exhibiting this behavior is also seriously restricted because the maximum angle of attack (AOA) is often limited by the onset of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> before the occurrence of stall. This thesis deals with the control and simulation investigation of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> phenomenon by the five new control schemes for the different assumptions of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> model. First, a variable phase control scheme, {{based on the results}} of energy analysis of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> hysteresis, is developed for <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> suppression. Its main advantage is small control power need. For the tracking control of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> at a fixed AOA, fuzzy PD control is then designed; however, if <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> suffers from external disturbance, fuzzy PD control exhibits a big tracking error. To overcome this disadvantage, variable universe fuzzy PD control is proposed to achieve the precise tracking control. For the tracking control of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> with a time-varying AOA and uncertainties, the NDOFEL scheme, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) combined with a feedback-error-learning (FEL) strategy, is proposed for a class of time-varying nonlinear systems with unknown disturbances, where the nominal model of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> control is assumed available. The proposed NDOFEL not only extends the NDO into time-varying nonlinear systems but also improves the precision of tracking control. Finally, because aircraft at a high AOA operate in nonlinear flight regimes in which the dynamics are very complex, aircraft's <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> model is usually unavailable. A reinforcement adaptive fuzzy control scheme is presented to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system and the convergence of the tracking error. The proposed control schemes emphasize stability, robustness, and simplicity such that they can be applied for on-line learning and real-time control. Numerical cases in each scheme are used to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed schemes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOver the {{configuration}} of a pointed ogive-cylindrical body with 30 ° swept wing, wind tunnel experiments are conducted to investigate the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> motion in pitching-up {{as well as the}} flow structure responsible for it. Results show that <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> would present as a sinusoid like motion during angle of attack 20 °∼ 85 ° in high rate pitching-up. And the evolvement of forebody vortices with angle of attack should be responsible for the sinusoid like motion. Firstly, the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> is triggered by forebody asymmetric vortices at moderate angle of attack (about 30 °). Secondly, the variation of forebody asymmetric vortices with angle of attack sustains the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> during angle of attack 30 °∼ 60 °. At last, the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> after angle of attack 60 ° is a convergent process of rolling due to the breakdown of forebody asymmetric vortices...|$|E
50|$|Any uncommanded {{aircraft}} movements (such as <b>wing</b> <b>rocking)</b> may {{be caused}} by wake. This is why maintaining situational awareness is critical. Ordinary turbulence is not unusual, particularly in the approach phase. A pilot who suspects wake turbulence is affecting his or her aircraft should get away from the wake, execute a missed approach or go-around and be prepared for a stronger wake encounter. The onset of wake can be insidious and even surprisingly gentle. There have been serious accidents where pilots have attempted to salvage a landing after encountering moderate wake only to encounter severe wake turbulence that they were unable to overcome. Pilots should not depend on any aerodynamic warning, but if the onset of wake is occurring, immediate evasive action is vital.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. <b>Wing</b> <b>rock</b> at high {{angle of attack}} is an oscillatory lateral-directional motion phenomenon known to exist in some of today's high performance tactical aircraft. The motion has been consistently characterized as a lightly damped Dutch-Roll oscillation attributable to asymmetric wing stall. However, evidence gathered from wind tunnel simulations {{and at least one}} British study indicate that aerodynamic nonlinearit ies may be the source of <b>wing</b> <b>rock.</b> Regardless of the actual cause of the phenomenon, a study of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> has positive ramifications with respect to gaining a clearer understanding of the aerodynamics associated with high angle of attack flight.

In the wind tunnel test, the roll angle, forces and moments, and limited forebody and wing surface pressures were measured during the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> motion.

40|$|Abstract:- A <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> {{system is}} {{manifested}} by a limit cycle oscillation predominantly as an aircraft operating at subsonic speeds and high angles of attack. The dynamic {{characteristic of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> is nonlinear and the precise dynamic model of the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> is difficult to obtain, so that a model-free design method referred to as hybrid control system is developed in this paper. The design of the hybrid control system contains three parts: an adaptive indirect controller (AIC), an adaptive direct controller (ADC) and a robust controller. A weighting factor, which can be adjusted by the tradeoff between plant knowledge and control knowledge, is adopted to sum together from the AIC and the ADC. Moreover, the robust controller is designed to compensate the approximation error caused by the AIC and the ADC. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid control system can achieve a favorable tracking performance for unknown {{the dynamics of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> systems...|$|E
