5|$|In Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier, a {{case that}} started in Missouri's Eastern District <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> United States Supreme Court in 1988, it was held that public school curricular student {{newspapers}} are subject to {{a lower level of}} First Amendment protection. Another First Amendment case in public schools came up in 1998, when E.D. Mo. heard Beussink v. Woodland R-IV School District. Judge Rodney W. Sippel ruled that the school violated a student's rights by sanctioning him for material he posted on his website. This case has been widely cited in higher courts.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, a {{proposal}} {{for the creation of}} a General Assembly <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Synod, yet the convening of one was delayed due to the necessity of having to write a constitution, a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon. In 1788, the Synod adopted a constitution modeled on the Church of Scotland in which power was centralized in the General Assembly. The constitution also included provisions of the Church of Scotland's Barrier Act of 1697, which required the General Assembly to receive the approval of a majority of presbyteries before making major changes to the church's constitution and doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the Assembly's decision and vacate the governorship. The Republicans in the legislature obeyed Taylor's orders, while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February 21, 1900, Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of Beckham. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, {{at that time the}} court of last resort in the state. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear the case on May 21, 1900. Taylor's only supporter on the court was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{the matter of}} Wemme's estate <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Supreme Court. Joseph accused the {{opposing}} attorney, Thomas Mannix, of collusion with Chief Justice John L. Rand. In the ensuing controversy, Mannix filed disbarment proceedings against Joseph. Joseph then announced his candidacy for Governor of Oregon in the 1930 election, seeking vindication from the people of Oregon.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a second}} series of court cases, {{which were the}} result of the patent office {{interference}} proceeding, had a different outcome. The interference board had also sided with Armstrong, and de Forest appealed its decision to the District of Columbia district court. On May 8, 1924, that court concluded that the evidence, beginning with the 1912 notebook entry, was sufficient to establish de Forest's priority. Now on the defensive, Armstrong's side tried to overturn the decision, but these efforts, which twice <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Supreme Court, in 1928 and 1934, were unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|In a {{child custody}} case {{following}} a divorce, {{a woman was}} denied custody of her children outside of holidays for various reasons, including her membership of Jehovah's Witnesses; {{the court of appeals}} of Nîmes considered that the educational rules applied by the Witnesses to their children were essentially inappropriate because of their hardness, their intolerance, and the obligation for children to practice proselytism. The case <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled that the court should have based its decision on the mother's actual handling of her children and not on abstract, general notions pertaining to the mother's religious affiliation.|$|E

25|$|The {{regulatory}} process for TCPL proved long and arduous. After rejecting proposals twice, Alberta finally granted its permission to export {{gas from the}} province in 1953. At first, the province waited for explorers to prove gas reserves sufficient for its thirty-year needs, intending to only allow exports in excess of those needs. After clearing this hurdle, the federal government virtually compelled TCPL into a merger with Western pipelines. When this reorganized TCPL <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Federal Power Commission for permission to sell gas into the United States, the Americans greeted it coolly. The FPC proved sceptical of the project's financing and unimpressed with Alberta's reserves.|$|E
25|$|This {{lawsuit was}} filed in 1987 by the {{plaintiff}} – Donald Lee McLaughlin – against the County of Riverside (California). He asked the United States District Court (Central District of California) {{to issue an}} injunction ordering that the County stop its policies on warrantless arrests, arguing that the practice may be unconstitutional. Eventually, the County of Riverside appealed {{the case to the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit after the District Court sided with the plaintiff; the Court of Appeals also agreed with the plaintiff’s arguments. This case then <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court justices found that the County of Riverside’s practices in regards to warrantless arrests were unconstitutional and ruled that suspects who are arrested without a warrant must be given probable cause within 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{news that}} El Paso had been {{selected}} to receive major elements of the 1st Armored Division was met with joy, {{but at the same}} time many expressed surprise at the panel's recommendation to transfer the Air Defense Artillery School, 6th ADA Brigade, and its accompanying equipment (including the MIM-104 Patriot Missile Anti-Aircraft/Anti Missile defense system) to Fort Sill. On 25 August officials representing Fort Bliss <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> BRAC Commission to plead their case for maintaining the ADA school and its accompanying equipment at Fort Bliss, citing among other thing the size of Fort Bliss and the history of the ADA school in the region. The BRAC Commission ultimately ruled against Fort Bliss, and the roughly 4,500 affected soldiers were transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The entire transfer of soldiers to and from Fort Bliss was completed no later than 15 September 2011.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand, without Mooney, {{for whom}} Reid deputised as wicketkeeper, and with Rabone unable to bowl, won the toss {{for the first}} time in the series and batted. Sutcliffe and Scott put on 121 for the first wicket, and Wallace passed 50 as well, but the later batsmen were more defensive. The innings lasted into the second day, and then Hutton and Simpson put on 147, and Hutton and Edrich {{followed}} up with a second wicket stand of 218 before Hutton was out for 206. Edrich went on to exactly 100, but from 365 for one the innings subsided. Cresswell took six for 168 with inswingers and leg cutters. Though Sutcliffe made 54, four New Zealand wickets <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> arrears were cleared, but Reid, who made 93, and Wallace, with his second 50 of the match, stood firm and the match was saved.|$|E
25|$|This case is {{the last}} of a trilogy of cases against Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) and their use of race in {{assigning}} students to schools. The first case started in 1998 when five African American high school students sued JCPS to allow them to attend Central High School, a magnet school. The suit alleged that they were denied entrance because they were black. In 2000, Federal Judge John Heyburn, after finding that the JCPS school system {{did not need to be}} under a court-ordered desegregation policy, ruled that race could not be used for student assignment placement in the JCPS school system in regard to their magnet school programs. In 2004, he ruled the same for the traditional schools, but allowed the regular public schools to use race as the admission requirement. It is this part that <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> US Supreme Court as the other two cases were not appealed by JCPS.|$|E
25|$|In 1793, Gallatin won {{election}} to the United States Senate. When the Third Congress opened on December 2, 1793, he took the oath of office, but, on that same day, nineteen Pennsylvania Federalists filed a protest with the Senate that Gallatin {{did not have the}} minimum nine years of citizenship required to be a senator. The petition was sent to committee, which duly reported that Gallatin had not been a citizen for the required period. Gallatin rebutted the committee report, noting his unbroken residence of thirteen years in the United States, his 1785 oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth of Virginia, his service in the Pennsylvania legislature, and his substantial property holdings in the United States. The report and Gallatin's rebuttal were sent to a second committee. This committee also reported that Gallatin should be removed. The matter then <b>went</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> full Senate where Gallatin was removed in a party-line vote of 14–12.|$|E
