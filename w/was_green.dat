5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there <b>was</b> <b>green.</b> According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E
5|$|One day at harvest time, {{according}} to William of Newburgh {{during the reign}} of King Stephen (1135–1154), the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, beside one of the wolf pits that gave the village its name. Their skin <b>was</b> <b>green,</b> they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw broad beans, which they consumed eagerly. The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.|$|E

5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines for standing passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars <b>was</b> <b>green.</b> There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} the Brazilian Grand Prix, reports began to surface {{suggesting}} that Sebastian Vettel's championship was under threat and that Ferrari would be filing a formal protest against the race results. The challenge centred on a pass Vettel made on Jean-Éric Vergne early in the race. At the time, the first sector of the circuit was under yellow flag conditions following the spin and retirement of Pastor Maldonado at Curva do Sol, the Interlagos circuit's third corner, which feeds onto the back straight. Vettel overtook Vergne along the straight, which led to claims that the pass was illegal because of the yellow flags. Intense media speculation suggested that the challenge threatened Vettel's championship because as the race finished behind the safety car, any post-race penalty {{had the potential to}} demote him in the race standings, and Vettel would not have enough points to secure the title. Ferrari wrote to the FIA, requesting clarification on the matter. The FIA reviewed the incident and declared that Vettel's pass was legal as a green flag was being shown by a marshal adjacent to the pit exit, meaning the track <b>was</b> <b>green</b> from that point onward; the confusion had been caused by a digital board showing a yellow flag on the exit of Curva do Sol some one hundred metres before the marshalling post. Both Ferrari and Red Bull Racing announced that they were satisfied with the ruling, thereby preserving Vettel's championship.|$|E

25|$|Before 1987, most {{road signs}} had black {{backgrounds}} – diamonds indicated warnings, and rectangles indicated regulatory actions (with {{the exception of}} the Give Way sign (an inverted trapezium), and Stop sign and speed limit signs (which were the same as today)). Information signs were yellow, and direction signage <b>was</b> <b>green</b> on motorways and black everywhere else.|$|E

25|$|With the win, the Packers {{improved}} to 8–1, which matched the best start to {{a season in}} Brett Favre's career (in 1996 and 2002). This game {{was the first time}} the Vikings had been shut out since 1991, and halted the Vikings’ NFL-record run of 260 consecutive regular-season games with a point. The game <b>was</b> <b>Green</b> Bay's first shutout of the Vikings in 94 games of the rivalry.|$|E

Brigham Young freed Flake in 1854.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} seasons of Agent had a {{distinctive}} way of presenting {{the elimination of}} contestants. At {{the end of each}} episode, the host and the participants sat at a table to have a dinner together. Each of contestants was given an envelope which contained a feather. One by one, participants opened the envelopes, revealing the color of the feather. If it <b>was</b> <b>green,</b> contestant moved on to the next episode. Red feather meant elimination of the player. In the final episode of each season, one of the envelopes contained a black feather, which revealed the identity of the mole.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 30s tastes {{changed and}} heavily {{modelled}} ware came into vogue. The My Garden series issued from 1934 onwards led the way, with small flowers modelled as a handle or base on more rounded shapes. These were fully painted in bright colours – {{the body of}} the ware was covered in thin colour washes – 'Verdant' <b>was</b> <b>green,</b> 'Sunrise' yellow and so on. The range included vases, bowls, jugs, a biscuit barrel, and proved very popular as gift ware. It was produced in more muted colours, right until {{the start of the war}} in 1939.|$|E

25|$|Two {{helicopter}}s, {{one from}} the police, and another {{one from the}} army, flew over the plaza. Around 5:55 P.M. red flares were shot from the nearby S.R.E. (Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations) tower. Around 6:15 P.M. another two flares were shot, this time from a helicopter (one <b>was</b> <b>green</b> and another one was red) as 5,000 soldiers, 200 tankettes and trucks surrounded the plaza. Much of what proceeded after the first shots were fired in the plaza remained ill-defined for decades after 1968. Records and information released by American and Mexican government sources since 2000 have enabled researchers to study the events and draw new conclusions.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} eye motif {{was revealed}} on 12 May 2008, {{on the official}} Big Brother website. This year's eye had a shattered effect, leading to some speculation that Big Brother {{was going to be}} evil. It was later announced that this year's theme was to be 'zero tolerance', which confirmed speculation of a somewhat harsher Big Brother. In 2011, it was ranked the public's favourite Big Brother eye ever. Each Big Brother show shared the same logo but with a different coloured shard to reflect the show; Big Brother's Big Mouth <b>was</b> <b>green,</b> Big Brother Live and Diary Room Uncut were red, Big Brother's Little Brother was orange and Big Brother's Big Ears was purple.|$|E
