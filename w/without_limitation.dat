5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship <b>without</b> <b>limitation</b> or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E

25|$|Adamson v. California, – Adamson {{was charged}} with murder but chose not to testify because he knew the {{prosecutor}} would ask him about his prior criminal record.

25|$|The {{greatest}} problem {{are with}} fares. As the minibuses {{do not have}} fixed fares, routes and timetables, the fluctuations in fares can be quite large. Some routes may reduce their fares to an unreasonable price {{in order to win}} more passengers, but when demand increases (e.g. during typhoons, when regulated buses and minibuses services are suspended), they can make increases in fares <b>without</b> <b>limitation.</b> For example, the route from Aberdeen to Wah Fu Estate could increase from $3 to $30 (probably equivalent to the fare travelled on a taxi), and the route from Jordan Road to Yuen Long could increase to $80, such acts have resulted in complaints from passengers.|$|E

40|$|Mixtures of {{truncated}} exponentials (MTE) potentials are {{an alternative}} to discretization for representing continuous chance variables in influence diagrams. Also, MTE potentials {{can be used to}} approximate utility functions. This paper introduces MTE influence diagrams, which can represent decision problems without restrictions on the relationships between continuous and discrete chance variables, <b>without</b> <b>limitations</b> on the distributions of continuous chance variables, and <b>without</b> <b>limitations</b> {{on the nature of the}} utility functions. In MTE influence diagrams, all probability distributions and the joint utility function (or its multiplicative factors) are represented by MTE potentials and decision nodes are assumed to have discrete state spaces. MTE influence diagrams are solved by variable elimination using a fusion algorithm. ...|$|R

500|$|The United Kingdom law {{relating}} to moral rights has been repeatedly criticised, primarily {{for failing to}} entirely comply with the Berne Convention. Bently and Sherman {{point out that the}} right to object to derogatory treatment uses a far narrower definition of treatment than the Convention, which merely requires that the author be able to object to [...] "any... derogatory action" [...] <b>without</b> <b>limitation.</b> Vaver notes a [...] "grudging attitude toward moral rights, at least if the expression given these rights in [...] is any testament". Article 5(2) of the Berne Convention requires that the exercise of authors' moral rights [...] "shall not be subject to any formality", while the right to attribution requires that the author assert ownership in writing, and is not available to authors by default. In addition, the exclusion of things such as encyclopedias, computer programs and typefaces is [...] "out of step with international practise".|$|E
500|$|In early 2005, the BLM {{discovered}} {{that some of}} the excess wild horses it had sold had been slaughtered. BLM suspended the sales program in April 2005 and resumed it in May 2005 after implementing new requirements to deter buyers from slaughtering the animals. In the fall of 2007, the last three horse slaughterhouses in the United States closed. In January 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that a 1949 Texas law banned the possession, transfer, or sale of horse meat. This ruling forced the two slaughterhouses in Texas to close. In September 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld a similar ban in Illinois, causing the plant located in that state to close. [...] However, BLM procedures do not ban the export of wild horses for sale and slaughter outside the United States. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded BLM was not in compliance with the 2004 amendment, as the department had imposed limitations on the sale of excess horses to help ensure that they were not slaughtered. The GAO also stated that the BLM had a serious [...] "dilemma" [...] in the need to balance their charge to protect and preserve the feral horses with their charge to destroy or sell <b>without</b> <b>limitation</b> excess animals. It recommended that the BLM [...] "develop cost-effective alternatives to the process of caring for wild horses removed from the range in long-term holding facilities and seek the legislative changes that may be necessary to implement those alternatives".|$|E

500|$|Mitchell was {{selected}} by the Philadelphia Eagles {{in the first round}} (25th overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft. He was the fifth wide receiver taken in the draft. He worked out with his new quarterback Donovan McNabb in Arizona and Los Angeles before mini-camp started. Because of NCAA rules regarding graduation, Mitchell was unable to attend the Eagles' mini-camp until after UCLA's senior class graduated. He studied the Eagles' playbook in the meantime. He asked the NFL for an exemption, but the league refused, and he arrived for his first practice on June 18, 2001. Mitchell signed a five-year, $5.5million contract with the Eagles on July 26, in time for the start of training camp. During training camp, Mitchell practiced as a backup behind James Thrash and Todd Pinkston. Special teams coordinator John Harbaugh asked Mitchell if he was willing to practice as a kickoff returner in practice, but Mitchell declined, citing the fracture of his femur on a kickoff return in college. Nonetheless, he still practiced on the kickoff coverage team, and on the punt coverage team as a gunner. Mitchell suffered a hip pointer during the morning session on July 31, but returned for the afternoon session <b>without</b> <b>limitation.</b> A hamstring injury limited him at the end of training camp. Before the start of the 2001 season, head coach Andy Reid said, [...] "Mentally, [...] right there. He's picked everything up, he's a smart kid. He's wide-eyed, ready to learn.
