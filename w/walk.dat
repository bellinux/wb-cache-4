5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random <b>walk</b> {{is known as the}} simple random <b>walk,</b> which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random <b>walk</b> takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random <b>walk</b> is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers.

5|$|The high <b>walk</b> of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the <b>walk</b> of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low <b>walk</b> is similar to the high <b>walk,</b> but without the body being raised, and {{is quite different from the}} sprawling <b>walk</b> of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one <b>walk</b> to the other instantaneously, but the high <b>walk</b> is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low <b>walk</b> before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E

We provide direct computations of the diffusion constants for the time-changed <b>walks.</b> Alternatively, the values of these constants can be derived from martingales associated with the time-changed <b>walks.</b> Using an inverse time-change, the diffusion constants for senile random <b>walks</b> are then obtained via these martingales.
