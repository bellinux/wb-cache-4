5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagle</b> in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E

40|$|The {{historic}} {{persecution and}} decline of European raptor populations precipitated {{the use of}} reintroduction as a species restoration tool {{in the late twentieth}} century. One of the key requirements of the World Conservation Union reintroduction guidelines concerns the need for social feasibility studies to explore the attitudes of local human populations toward restoration and reintroduction proposals. Ahead of any formal proposals to reintroduce <b>white-tailed</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> to Cumbria, United Kingdom, we conducted a baseline public attitudinal survey (n = 300). We identified broad public support for this reintroduction, which transcended differences in the demographic, geographic, and employment profiles of the study cohort. There was public recognition that <b>white-tailed</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> could deliver a broad range of socioeconomic and environmental benefits with few detrimental impacts. Although the value of attitudinal surveys of this nature has been questioned, we would argue that they provide a useful baseline “snapshot” ahead of a more structured and focused reintroduction consultation. These results reinforce the emergence of public interest in the restoration of European raptors in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century...|$|R

40|$|Bone {{composition}} and bone mineral density (BMD) of long bones of two raptor and one owl species were assessed. Right humerus and tibiotarsus of 40 common buzzards, 13 <b>white-tailed</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> and 9 barn owls were analyzed. Statistical {{analysis was performed}} for influence of species, age, gender and nutritional status. The BMD ranged from 1. 8 g/cm 3 (common buzzards) to 2. 0 g/cm 3 (<b>white-tailed</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagles).</b> Dry matter was 87. 0 % (buzzards) to 89. 5 % (<b>sea</b> <b>eagles).</b> Percentage of bone ash was lower in <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> than in buzzards and owls. Content of crude fat was lower than 2 % of the dry matter in all bones. In humeri lower calcium values (220 g/kg fat free dry matter) were detected in <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> than in barn owls (246 g/kg), in tibiotarsi no species differences were observed. Phosphorus levels were lowest in <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> (humeri 104 g/kg fat free dry matter, tibiotarsi 102 g/kg) and highest in barn owls. Calcium-phosphorus ratio was about 2 : 1 in all species. Magnesium content was lower in <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> (humeri 2590 mg/kg fat free dry matter, tibiotarsi 2510 mg/kg) than in buzzards and owls. Bones of barn owls contained more copper (humeri 8. 7 mg/kg fat free dry matter, tibiotarsi 12. 7 mg/kg) than in the Accipitridae. Zinc content was highest in <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> (humeri 278 mg/kg fat free dry matter, tibiotarsi 273 mg/kg) and lowest in barn owls (humeri 185 mg/kg, tibiotarsi 199 mg/kg).

The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore the edible crab and edible oyster are also found, the latter especially in the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs and in 2012 a bed of 100 million flame shells was found during a survey of Loch Alsh.

40|$|We {{analysed}} 120 <b>white-tailed</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> Haliaeetus albicilla {{from eastern}} (Poland and Estonia) and southeastern (Serbian Danube population) Europe for genetic variability and structuring at the mitochondrial control region and seven nuclear microsatellite loci. We combined this new dataset with sequence and genotype data from previous analyses covering Greenland and Eurasia (total sample sizes of 420 and 186 individuals for mtDNA and microsatellites, respectively) {{to address the}} following questions: 1) does the large eastern population in Europe add significantly to the species‘ overall genetic diversity? 2) Do the new sequence data match the clinal distribution pattern (west to east) {{of the two major}} mtDNA lineages? 3) Does the preliminary hypothesis of two nuclear genetic clusters recently found in this species hold for the whole of Europe, and do these clusters show a geographic pattern? Our results confirmed Europe as a stronghold of genetic diversity in <b>white-tailed</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagles,</b> and the east of the continent contributed disproportionately to this, the reason being the admixture of eagles with different genetic background. As hypothesised, both mitochondrial lineages were recovered also in eastern Europe, but the globally more eastern lineage was dominant. The presence of two microsatellite clusters was also confirmed, and these groups, too, show a non-random geographic distribution, with, except for Poland, a high proportion of ‘eastern-type’ eagles in the populations of east–central and eastern Europe...|$|R

50|$|The Ainu hunted {{from late}} autumn to early summer. The {{reasons for this}} were, among others, that in late autumn, plant gathering, salmon fishing and other {{activities}} of securing food came to an end, and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered. A village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor). Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory. The Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a subspecies of sika deer), rabbit, fox, raccoon dog, and other animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu as were salmon. They also hunted <b>sea</b> <b>eagles</b> such as <b>white-tailed</b> <b>sea</b> <b>eagles,</b> raven and other birds. The Ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers, which they used in trade with the Japanese. The Ainu hunted with arrows and spears with poison-coated points. They obtained the poison, called surku, from the roots and stalks of aconites. The recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family. They enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dog's bane, boiled juice of Mekuragumo, Matsumomushi, tobacco, and other ingredients. They also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers. They hunted in groups with dogs. Before the Ainu went hunting, for animals like bear in particular, they prayed to the god of fire and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch, and safe hunting to the god of mountains.|$|R
