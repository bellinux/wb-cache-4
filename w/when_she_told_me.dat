500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure what I was thinking about <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E

60|$|Sophonisba, {{when we were}} on the hill, {{seemed to}} have {{forgotten}} the box, and to be willing that I should forget it also. But this was impossible. <b>When,</b> therefore, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how sweet it was to escape from that terrible woman, and leaned on my arm with all the freedom of old acquaintance, I was obliged to cut short the pleasure of the moment.|$|R
60|$|I had {{a curious}} {{sensation}} of having {{heard the voice}} before. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not to move, she had spoken in a whisper--or, to me, in my dazed state, it had sounded like a whisper--but now she was raising her voice, {{and there was a}} note in it that seemed familiar.

6000|$|... 'I was {{thinking}} of her likewise,' said the Earl. 'She spoke truly <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that he might not}} be what I then wished to make him, but something far better.' ...|$|E

[...] She laughed again, and even now <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> why, her {{laughter}} was very singular to me, for I could not doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed {{too much for the}} occasion. I thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw the thought in my mind, and answered it.|$|R
40|$|The Splink is a rock vein that juts out of {{the cliff}} around the Pismire Gully waterfall, {{creating}} a small, private cove. Marina Gambin writes, My great-Aunt Aggie (Mooney) Singleton, St. Josephs, was almost 100 years old <b>when</b> <b>she</b> died. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that at one time, the Sphinx (as she called it) had carvings of winged animals, winged women, winged boats. She said {{there were lots of}} other pictures carved there, like a house on fire and a gigantic man with legs where arms should be. Who carved this stuff? She was highly offended when I called it the Splink. I guess it was named for the Sphinx in Egypt. The Splink is also known as the Mans Face by younger generations. Erosion has exposed the likeness of a mans face on the ocean edge of the rock vein...|$|R
6000|$|But this, after I {{had searched}} into it, {{as far as}} by Amy's {{relation}} I could get an account of it, did not disquiet me half so much as that the young slut had got the name of Roxana by the end, and that she knew who her Lady Roxana was, and the like; though this, neither, did not hang together, for then {{she would not have}} fixed upon Amy for her mother. But some time after, when Amy had almost persuaded her out of it, and that the girl began to be so confounded in her discourses of it, that she made neither head nor tail, at last the passionate creature flew out in a kind of rage, and said to Amy, that if she was not her mother, Madam Roxana was her mother then, for one of them, she was sure, was her mother; and then all this that Amy had done for her was by Madam Roxana's order. [...] "And I am sure," [...] says she, [...] "it was my Lady Roxana's coach that brought the gentlewoman, whoever it was, to my uncle's in Spitalfields, for the coachman <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so." [...] Amy fell a-laughing at her aloud, as was her usual way; but, as Amy <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> it was but on one side of her mouth, for she was so confounded at her discourse, that she was ready to sink into the ground; and so was I too <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>told</b> it <b>me.</b>|$|R

500|$|On February 18, 1995, Madonna {{arrived in}} Europe to promote Bedtime Stories. During the same day, she {{performed}} [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on German TV show Wetten, dass..?, {{while she was}} also interviewed on the program. Madonna went back to United States and performed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on the American Music Awards of 1995, accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra. Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him: [...] "I was nervous as hell. But you couldn't actually see my legs shaking under the suit. <b>When</b> we finished, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had never been that nervous before. That was crazy to me -- I was thinking, 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At {{the end of the}} performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not till}} the fifth Saturday that her man came, {{with a great}} deal of joy, and gave her an account that he had found out the gentleman; that he was a Dutchman, but a French merchant; that he came from Rouen, and his name was ----, and that he lodged at Mr. ----'s, on Laurence Pountney's Hill. I was surprised, you may be sure, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> came and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> one evening all the particulars, except that of having set her man to watch. [...] "I have found out thy Dutch friend," [...] says she, [...] "and can tell thee how to find him too." [...] I {{coloured}} again as red as fire. [...] "Then thou hast dealt with the evil one, friend," [...] said I very gravely.

6000|$|... "Yes; Jane {{says she}} is sure they will; but yet, {{this is such a}} {{situation}} as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>she</b> had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea, because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I shouldn't wonder," [...] said Maxwell, again swiftly turning upon him, [...] "if you were!" [...] He stopped, as if {{ashamed of}} his abruptness, and said more quietly and persuasively, [...] "Come, Gabriel, if you won't confess to me, I suppose that I must to you. Six months ago I thought you an impostor. Six months ago {{the woman who}} is now your wife charged you with being an impostor; with {{assuming}} a name and right that did not belong to you; in plain English, said that you had set yourself up as Gabriel Conroy, and that she, who was Grace Conroy, the sister of the real Gabriel, knew that you lied. She substantiated all this by proofs; hang it," [...] continued Maxwell, appealing in dumb show to the walls, [...] "there isn't a lawyer living as wouldn't have said it was a good case, and been ready to push it in any court. Under these circumstances I sought you, and you remember how. You know the result of that interview. I can tell you now that if there ever was a man who palpably confessed to guilt when he was innocent, you were that man. Well, after your conduct there was explained by Olly, without, however, damaging the original evidence against you, or prejudicing her rights, this woman {{came to me and said}} that she had discovered that you were the man who had saved her life at the risk of your own, and that for the present she could not, in delicacy, push her claim. <b>When</b> afterwards <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that this gratitude had--well, ripened into something more serious, and that she had engaged herself to marry you, and so condone your offence, why, it was woman-like and natural, and I suspected nothing. I believed her story--believed she had a case. Yes, sir; the last six months I have looked upon you as the creature of that woman's foolish magnanimity. I could see that she was soft on you, and believed that you had fooled her. I did, hang me! There, if you confess to being a fool, I do to having been an infernal sight bigger one." ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{drugs have}} been used by humans since {{earliest}} times, few people realize how important an ef-fect they have had {{on the history of the}} human race. High on the list among drugs that have exerted a profound effect are the salicylates of which the most widely used product, aspirin, is the best known. It, as well as all the other salicylates, are direct descendants of willow bark used by Hippocrates 2, 300 years ago for the relief of pain and fever. The active principle of this bark, known as sali-cin, occurs in many shrubs and trees, but most abundantly in the bark of the willow (Salix). Theophrastus, a student and friend of Aristotle who inherited his teacher's library and botanical garden, listed the willow and plants of the genus Spiraea and other members of the Rosaceae (or rose) family that had these proper-ties. They were also listed by Diodes in his Greek Herbal. Dioscorides, Pliny and Elder, and Galen's pharma-copoeia all mentioned and recom¬ mended willow bark as an effective agent. Knowledge of the value of these plants became worldwide and known to primitive societies. North American Indians were aware of and used trailing arbutus, a member of the heath family (or Ericaceae) for the treatment of rheumatism. A phy¬ sician in rural South Africa wrote a letter to the Lancet in 1876 in which he described the use of willow bark by the then primitive society of Hotten¬ tots. He had examined a woman who, in his words, was [...] . in the cruel bonds of as fierce an at¬ tack of rheumatic fever as I ever saw [...] . I prescribed the usual alkaline mixture, with calomel and Dover's powder at bedtime, and rode away. Some two months after, my former patient entered my surgery, looking remarkably well, and I very natu¬ rally congratulated myself and her that she had recovered so completely. I was quite taken aback <b>when</b> <b>she</b> bluntly <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that my physic hadn't helped her a bit. On inquiring what had helped her, she said that an old Hottentot shepherd had made her a decoction of the shoots of the willows which grew on the banks of the river, and after taking this for a few days she began to get better. In spite of its known efficacy, little in¬ terest seems to have been developed in salicin. It was often confused with Peruvian bark since the quinine pro¬ duced from the latter (the cinchona tree) also had the ability to lower fe¬ ver...|$|R
