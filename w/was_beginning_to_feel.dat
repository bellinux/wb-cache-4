5|$|At {{the time}} of her death, Garza was a second grade teacher; she taught indigent {{students}} at an elementary school {{on the south side of}} McAllen. In a letter that Garza wrote to a friend shortly before her disappearance, Garza described herself as extremely shy, but she expressed fulfillment in her work. Noting that she had recently become secretary of her parent-teacher association, she said that she <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more confident in herself. A member of the Legion of Mary, Garza took her Catholic faith seriously. In her letter, she indicated that was finding comfort in attending Mass and Communion every day.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Takahashi {{talked with}} Hirohide Sugiura, who had {{likewise}} worked at Square and <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> frustrated {{due to a}} lack of creative freedom. After discussing the matter, the two decided to create their own company and pursue projects they wanted to create. When planning their new company, Takahashi and Sugiura decided that they needed a publisher with substantial market presence to help them rather than being an independent studio. Takahashi and Sugiura approached multiple companies for support, but most of the companies they contacted outright rejected their offer as they believed that Monolith Soft should be an independent company. However, Namco were interested in investing into Monolith Soft as a dedicated subsidiary, whilst handling logistics and marketing so that the core staff could focus on game development. An important supporter of Monolith Soft was Namco's founder Masaya Nakamura, who shared many of Takahashi and Sugiura's goals and ideals. Monolith Soft is noted as being one of a group of video game companies—alongside Sacnoth, Love-de-Lic and Mistwalker—founded by Square staff who had worked on notable titles produced during the 1990s. The company was officially founded on 1 October 1999 by Takahashi, Sugiura, and Yasuyuki Honne, who had worked at Square on both the Chrono series and with Takahashi on Xenogears. The company's offices were originally based in Yokohama.|$|E

25|$|In Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum, Sigurd is the {{paternal}} {{nephew of}} the Danish king Harald Wartooth, and presumably (the part of Sögubrot where {{this would have}} been narrated expressly has not been preserved) the son of Randver, who in his turn is the son of Harald's mother Auðr the Deep-Minded and her husband king Raðbarðr of Gardariki. Harald Wartooth <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> old, so he made Sigurd the king of Sweden and Västergötland. Sigurd beat his uncle at the colossal Battle of Bråvalla, and became the ruler of Denmark as well. He made a shieldmaiden the ruler of Denmark (cf. Chronicon Lethrense, below).|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} of touring for Something to Write Home About, the band <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> burned-out, and wished to depart from the upbeat power-pop sound with which they had become associated. They also {{wanted to find a}} new {{producer}} to challenge them creatively, approaching Nigel Godrich and Gil Norton with offers, although both declined. Finally, the band settled on Scott Litt, best known for his work with R.E.M. and Nirvana. The band's third studio album, On a Wire was released on May 14, 2002, debuting a more measured, alternative style. Just as Something to Write Home About alienated some fans with its more produced sound, On a Wire was criticized by fans who were disappointed with the album's softer musical direction. Specifically, the reviewer for Alternative Press wrote [...] "Unfortunately, the visceral energy of their early days is lost in their newfound maturity." ...|$|E

500|$|Luke Thompson of E! Online {{gave the}} film a [...] "B". He called the film's gore [...] "over-the-top" [...] and [...] "in your face" [...] while admitting the film had an [...] "unusual amount of self-parody". He said the central storyline {{of the films}} <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "played out". Rob Nelson of Variety gave the film a {{negative}} review. He called the film [...] "relentlessly repugnant" [...] that would please fans, but offer no surprise. He went on to say, [...] "Apart from these limb-pulling setpieces, tech credits appear fairly shoddy, as do any 3D effects that don't include flying viscera. The editing relies on lazy flashbacks, while the dialogue remains as horrific as the killings." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film two out of five stars, calling it [...] "a step down from last year's much more pointed Saw VI". He criticized the repetition of the plot but thought bringing back Jigsaw survivors was a [...] "nice idea". He closed his review with, [...] "There are a scattering of infallibly cringe-making horrors, {{but on the whole}} Saw 3D could do with more depth".|$|E

Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac received a heavy-handed makeover of the 1957 GM designs.

It also said that Begg had confessed to being part of a plot to spray the Palace of Westminster with anthrax, a plan which had [...] "caused hilarity" [...] among security experts because of its implausibility, but, the article claimed, detainees were not allowed access to a lawyer until they had confessed to a crime.|$|E

2500|$|After the attack, the CIA {{director}} John O. Brennan {{said that}} the attack bore the hallmarks of an ISIL terror attack. It was suggested that Turkey was paying a price for former Prime Minister and now President Recip Tayyip Erdoğan's wilful blindness to ISIL threat, and that Turkey, after previously being a conduit for fighters joining ISIL, <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{the wrath of the}} group for taking a harder line. The Washington Post wrote that [...] "perhaps not by chance, what was merely {{the latest in a series}} of Islamic State attacks inside Turkey came just as its impulsive and increasingly autocratic president was moving to repair his regime’s threadbare foreign relations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burney {{was fifteen}} {{by the time}} her father {{remarried}} in 1767. Entries in her diaries suggest that she <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pressure {{to give up her}} writing, as something [...] "unladylike" [...] that [...] "might vex Mrs. Allen." [...] Feeling that she had transgressed what was proper, she burnt that same year her first manuscript, The History of Caroline Evelyn, which she had written in secret. Despite this repudiation of writing, Frances kept up her diaries and in them wrote an account of the emotions that led up to that dramatic act. She eventually recouped some of the effort that went into the first manuscript by using it as a foundation for her first novel, Evelina, which follows the life of the fictional Caroline Evelyn's daughter.|$|E
2500|$|However, all was {{not well}} within the group.

He later told NME, [...] "'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous. I was just drinking more than I could handle." [...] Meanwhile, Rourke was fired from the band in early 1986 due to his use of heroin. [...] He allegedly received notice of his dismissal via a Post-it note stuck to the windscreen of his car. It read, [...] "Andy – you have left the Smiths. Goodbye and good luck, Morrissey."

2500|$|In 1989 Spin {{magazine}} rated The Queen is Dead as {{number one}} of [...] "The Greatest Albums Ever Made". Spin {{was not alone}} in this designation—numerous periodicals rank the Smiths and their albums, especially The Queen is Dead, high on their best ever lists. NME, for example, has dubbed the Smiths the most important rock band of all time. However, a legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule.

2500|$|During 1985, {{the band}} {{undertook}} lengthy {{tours of the}} UK and the US while recording the next studio record, The Queen is Dead. The album was released in June 1986, shortly after the single [...] "Bigmouth Strikes Again". The record reached number 2 in the UK charts. However, all was not well within the group. A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{the stress of the}} band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. Meanwhile, Rourke was fired in early 1986 for his use of heroin. Rourke was temporarily replaced on bass guitar by Craig Gannon, but he was reinstated after only a fortnight. Gannon stayed in the band, switching to rhythm guitar. This five-piece recorded the singles [...] "Panic" [...] and [...] "Ask" [...] (with Kirsty MacColl on backing vocals) which reached numbers 11 and 14 respectively on the UK Singles Chart, and toured the UK. After the tour ended in October 1986, Gannon left the band. The group had become frustrated with Rough Trade and sought a record deal with a major label, ultimately signing with EMI, which drew criticism from some of the band's fanbase.|$|E
