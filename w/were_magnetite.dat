40|$|Abstract This is a {{study of}} the {{preparation}} and characterization of polymeric-magnetic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles used <b>were</b> <b>magnetite</b> (Fe 3 O 4) and the chosen polymers were alginate and chitosan. Two types of samples were prepared: uncoated magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles encapsulated in polymeric matrix. The samples were analyzed by XRD, light scattering techniques, TEM, and magnetic SQUID. The XRD patterns identified magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) as the only crystalline phase. TEM analyses showed particle sizes between 10 and 20 nm for magnetite, and 15 and 30 nm for the encapsulated magnetite. The values of magnetization ranged from 75 to 100 emu/g for magnetite nanoparticles, and 8 to 12 emu/g for coated with chitosan, at different temperatures of 20 K and 300 K. The saturation of both samples was in the range of 49 to 50 KOe. Variations of results between the two kinds of samples were attributed to the encapsulation of magnetic nanoparticles by the polymers...|$|E
40|$|Polymer nanocomposites with {{response}} under {{magnetic field}} application {{were obtained by}} dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles in polymer matrices by extrusion, which is the preferred industrial method for polymer compounding and processing [1]. These nanostructured materials {{are expected to have}} a wide application range since the polymer technology allows components fabrications with diverse forms and mechanical properties. Applications in fields of sensors [2], magnetic storage [3], electromagnetic absorption and magnetic yielding [4] are usual. Ferromagnetic nanoparticles are very difficult to process, suffering from problems such as sticking of the particles at metallic components of the mixing machine, and to disperse due to their permanent magnetic moment causing strong particle-particle interactions. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles were used instead having the advantage that the thermal energy and the associated thermal fluctuations of the particles at process conditions supersedes the magnetic interparticle interaction but maintaining closely the high magnetic moment of their ferromagnetic counterparts. The superparamagnetic particles <b>were</b> <b>magnetite,</b> synthesised in a wet-chemical process and concentrated to a slurry {{to be used in the}} extrusion process.

40|$|A {{number of}} ceramic {{coatings}} of different compositions containing lead monoxide (PbO) were studied {{to determine their}} relative merits as dry-film lubricants. Lead monoxide {{is known to be}} an effective solid lubricant at elevated temperatures, and this oxide was the main component in all compositions studied. Friction and wear properties were determined at temperatures from 750 to 1250 F, at a sliding velocity of 430 feet per minute, and at a normal load of 1 kilogram. In all of the coatings, PbO was the component primarily responsible for the lubricating properties. Oxides other than PbO had an indirect effect on lubrication by influencing such properties as adhesion, hardness, vitrifying or glaze-forming tendency, melting or softening point, and chemical stability of the coatings. Notable among these oxides <b>were</b> <b>magnetite</b> (Fe 3 O 4.), which had generally a beneficial influence on ceramic- to-metal adhesion, and silica (SiO 2), which inhibited the oxidation of PbO and enhanced the tendency for glaze formation on the sliding surfaces. Several of the compositions studied provided protection against metal-to-metal adhesive wear, galling, or seizure at test temperatures from 750 to 1250 F. Coating friction coefficients ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 37 at 75 F but were around 0. 08 to 0. 20 at temperatures of 1250 F...|$|E

40|$|Ferrofluids are {{a unique}} class of {{colloidal}} liquids made of ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic nanoparticles suspended in a carrier fluid. Ferrofluids have drawn considerable attention {{due to the}} possibility of tuning their heat transfer and flow properties through the application of an external magnetic field. They can also be utilized to improve the performance of an energy harvester, which can supply power and enhance the capability, assertion and lifespan of those devices where batteries or direct electricity are currently used as the primary source of power. Electromagnetic ferrofluid based energy harvesters convert the ferrofluids sloshing movement into electromotive force; therefore, it is necessary to estimate the feasibility, stability and efficacy of ferrofluids through several physicochemical studies. The objective of this work is to prepare a stable polymer coated Fe₃O₄ nanofluid with the aim of applying it in a novel energy harvester device currently under development at the University of Newcastle. The one-step chemical precipitation method was complied with to produce Fe₃O₄/DI-water nanofluids, and thermogravimetric analysis and differential thermal gravimetry have been carried out to determine the chemical and physical changes of ferrofluids due to thermal effect. Besides, X-ray diffraction was employed to identify the crystal structure. The stability and physicochemical properties of Fe₃O₄ particles were also investigated. The synthesized ferrofluids were found to be visually stable for more than 2 months. The results showed that the synthesized nanoparticles <b>were</b> <b>magnetite,</b> and a linear relationship was found among the dosing rate of ammonium hydroxide, nanoparticle size distribution, viscosity and thermal conductivity.

In a model system, adsorption of poliovirus by Ottawa sand was rapid and reached equilibrium within 1 h at 4 °C. Near saturation, the adsorption {{could be described}} by the Langmuir equation; the apparent surface saturation was 2. 5 × 106 plaque-forming units of poliovirus per mg of Ottawa sand. At low surface coverage, adsorption was described by the Freundlich equation. The soils and minerals used ranged from acidic to basic and from high in organic content to organic free. The available negative surface charge on each substrate {{was measured by the}} adsorption of a cationic polyelectrolyte, polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride. Most of the substrates adsorbed more than 95 % of the virus. In general, soils, in comparison with minerals, were weak adsorbents. Among the soils, muck and Genesee silt loam were the poorest adsorbents; among the minerals, montmorillonite, glauconite, and bituminous shale were the least effective. The most effective adsorbents <b>were</b> <b>magnetite</b> sand and hematite, which are predominantly oxides of iron. Correlation coefficients for substrate properties and virus adsorption revealed that the elemental composition of the adsorbents had little effect on poliovirus uptake. Substrate surface area and pH, by themselves, were not significantly correlated with poliovirus uptake. A strong negative correlation was found between poliovirus adsorption and both the contents of organic matter and the available negative surface charge on the substrates as determined by their capacities for adsorbing the cationic polyelectrolyte, polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride...|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} {{involved}} {{the study of}} the magnetic behaviour of small magnetic nanoparticle systems. Due to the reduced size of magnetic nanoparticles they present distinctive properties, such as size and surface effects, that have been analysed in this work, as well as the effect of interactions in such systems. The samples chosen for the study <b>were</b> <b>magnetite</b> particles {{in the form of a}} ferrofluid and Co nanoclusters in a nonmagnetic matrix of Cu. Both systems present very narrow particle size distributions, which facilitates the interpretation of the data. The samples have been subjected to basic characterisation, which includes the determination of the distribution of magnetic particle sizes using the magnetisation curves at room temperatures, TEM microscopy and X-ray diffraction, in the case of the ferrofluid samples. For the nanoclusters, a time of flight spectrometer has been used to obtain the number of atoms per cluster. Many of the measurements have been performed at low temperatures, where thermal effects are minimised. For such measurements the samples have been frozen in a zero applied field, so that they have a random distribution of magnetic moments prior to the measurement. The energy barrier distributions have been calculated via the temperature decay of remanence (TDR). From this study, an effective anisotropy constant has been calculated. For {{the study of the}} interactions, surface and size effects, magnetisation, susceptibility (ZFC), remanence and delta-M curves, as well as the time dependence of magnetisation have been studied. The attempt frequency of the different particle size systems has been calculated using different techniques. The basic magnetic behaviour can be explained on the basis of the Neel blocking model. It has been found that the systems with the smaller particles have significant surface effects, which are enhanced at lower temperatures. Interactions, which are weak due to the low concentration of magnetic material in the samples (< 10 %), have been found to be overall demagnetising and the evolution of the magnetic properties with dilution has been explained. As is the case for the surface effects, interaction effects are stronger at low temperatures due the reduction of thermal effects. The experimental results have been compared with calculations from a Monte Carlo model for fine particles, which includes the effects of concentration, anisotropy, particle size and temperature.

40|$|As {{the size}} of a {{physical}} system decreases toward the nanoscale, quantum mechanical effects such as the discretization of energy levels and the interactions of the electronic spins become readily observable. To understand what happens within submicrometer scale samples is {{one of the goals of}} modern condensed matter physics. Electron transport phenomena drew a lot of attention over the past two decades or so, not only because quantum corrections to the classical transport theory, but also they allow us to probe deeply into the microscopic nature of the system put to test. Although a significant amount of research was done in the past and thus extended our understanding in this field, most of these works were concentrated on simpler examples. Electron transport in strongly correlated systems is still a field that needs to be explored more thoroughly. In fact, experimental works that have been done so far to characterize coherence physics in correlated systems such as ferromagnetic metals are far from conclusive. One reason ferromagnetic samples draw such attention is that there exist correlations that lead to excitations (e. g. spin waves, domain wall motions) not present in normal metals, and these new environmental degrees of freedom can have profound effects on decoherence processes. In this thesis, three different types of magnetic samples were examined: a band ferromagnetism based metallic ferromagnet, permalloy, a III-V diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor with ferromagnetism from a hole-mediated exchange interaction, and magnetite nanocrystals and films. The first observation of time-dependent universal conductance fluctuations (TD-UCF) in permalloy is presented and our observations lead to three major conclusions. First, the cooperon contribution to the conductance is suppressed in this material. This is consistent with some theoretical expectations, and implies that weak localization will be suppressed as well. Second, we see evidence that domain wall motion leads to enhanced conductance fluctuations, demonstrating experimentally that domain walls can act as coherent scatterers of electrons. Third, the temperature dependence of the fluctuations is surprisingly strong, suggesting that the dominant decoherence mechanism in these wires is different than that in similar normal metal nanostructures. The first observation of TD-UCF in diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) is also presented. In contrast to analogous measurements on permalloy samples, we find a surprising suppression of TD-UCF noise in this material at low temperatures, independent of field orientation. We believe this implies that the suppression is not due to an orbital effect, and therefore some of the fluctuations originate with time-varying magnetic disorder. The temperature dependence of the TD-UCF implies either an unusual fluctuator spectrum or a nonstandard dephasing mechanism. Measurements of UCF as a function of magnetic field allow an order of magnitude estimate of the coherence length at 2 K of approximately 50 nm in this material. The last samples examined <b>were</b> <b>magnetite</b> nanocrystals and films. Magnetite has been used in technologies for millennia, from compasses to magnetoelectronic devices, although its electronic structure has remained controversial for seven decades, with a low temperature insulator and a high temperature "bad metal" separated by the Verwey transition at 120 K. A new electrically driven insulator-metal transition below the Verwey temperature in both magnetite films and nanocrystals was observed. The possibility that this was a thermal effect was tested through various methods, and we have shown that the transition is in fact truly electrically driven. This electrically driven transition also showed a great deal of rigidity against external magnetic field and high gate voltages...|$|E
