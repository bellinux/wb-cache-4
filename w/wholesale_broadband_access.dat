5000|$|In May 2008 the [...] "Review of the <b>wholesale</b> <b>broadband</b> <b>access</b> markets" [...] report {{published}} by Ofcom determined that KC was not {{acting in a}} way that would keep out rival companies, and that pricing for wholesale broadband and access to local-loop unbundling was within the market range. The main reason cited by rivals for not providing services in the Hull area was rather one of overall cost effectiveness, given the relatively small number of potential customers (190,000 homes), and the fact that many of these would be likely to remain with the incumbent supplier.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} a {{wholesale}} market may, {{in addition to}} demand- and supply-side substitution at the wholesale level, also be determined by substitution patterns at the retail level. Considering <b>wholesale</b> <b>broadband</b> <b>access</b> markets, {{it is argued that}} each of these forces can be strong enough to render a 5 - 10 % price increase by a hypothetical monopolist at the wholesale level unprofitable and thus may lead to a wider wholesale market definition including, for example, cable networks in addition to DSL. Based on the theory of derived demand elasticities it is discussed under which circumstances this could be the case. The position of the European Commission and the practice of national regulatory authorities are then reviewed in light of these arguments...|$|E
40|$|In Italy, fixed {{telecommunications}} were liberalised 15 years ago, but {{the incumbent}} {{is still the}} dominant operator. The Italian antitrust authority has recently fined Telecom Italia for margin squeeze and technical sabotage, proving that the incumbent still has the incentive {{and the power to}} deploy anticompetitive conducts. This research studies Telecom Italia's anticompetitive behaviours and regulatory interventions from 2004 to 2012, in order to understand and assess how the incumbent's strategies are affected by regulation. Four wholesale markets (local loop unbundling, colocation, <b>wholesale</b> <b>broadband</b> <b>access,</b> wholesale line rental) and two retail markets (directories and non-geographic numbers) have been considered. For each market, both Telecom Italia's strategies and NRA's actions have been analysed and tracked in a timeline to show the interplay between the incumbent and the regulator and to assess the regulation effectiveness in preventing and discouraging anticompetitive conducts...|$|E
40|$|In {{antitrust}} {{cases as}} well as for regulated industries, {{the question of how to}} treat indirect constraint and captive sales correctly has become of major importance in Europe. The (im-) proper treatment of indirect constraints has lead the CFI to overturn the Commission’s decision in the proposed merger of Schneider and Legrand. Moreover, with regards to the definition of <b>wholesale</b> <b>broadband</b> <b>access</b> markets, there is an ongoing controversy between the Commission and some National Regulatory Authorities, centering on the question of whether to incorporate indirect constraints already at the stage of market definition. To inform this debate, we present in this article some of the insights from a detailed formal analysis into markets with indirect constraints and captive sales. We show how indirect constraints are appropriately taken into account through the elasticity of derived demand and comment also on the informative-ness of concentration measures on both the wholesale and retail market. We further derive insights into when indirect constraints may be more or less important compared with direct constraints. Finally, we also discuss the more practical difficulties that are encountered when analyzing (or estimating) market structures where forward integrated firms also sell to other, competing retail firms.

40|$|Nowadays, {{incumbent}} {{operators are}} deploying GPON FTTH access network over {{substantial part of}} the countries in Europe, in a Point-to-Multipoint architecture (P 2 MP). This architecture is characterized by a shared fiber from the Central Office (C. O.) to a certain location where, by means of splitters, individual fibers carry the signal to/from every user. It is preferable for an open market situation, where the competition in prices and services is desirable and also enforced by local governments and administrations, to have different entry options to the market for the many alternative operators (entrants) which may come up and compete with the incumbent. For that reason, this study aims at considering different unbundling options for the Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) in order to provide multioperator access and consider the economical impact for the entrants to deploy such alternatives. The scope of this study primarily covers remedies to be imposed upon operators designated with Significant Market Power (SMP) {{on the basis of a}} market analysis procedure carried out under Article 16 of Directive 2002 / 21 /EC [EUC 02 a]. However, where it is justified on the grounds that duplication of infrastructure is economically inefficient or physically impracticable, the regulator may also impose obligations of reciprocal sharing of facilities on undertakings operating an electronic communications network in accordance with Article 12 of that Directive which would be appropriate to overcome bottlenecks in the civil engineering infrastructure and terminating segments. This work deals with the following issues: • Alternatives for LLU: although there are several methods, the next three have been considered as they are the most feasible in terms of cost, scalability and upgradeability, in the number of clients and operators. [ALC 10 a] [FCE 11 c] [ISD 09 a] [MAS 09 a] [ITU 08 a] [WKC 10 a] o Move the Splitters Back. o Replicate the Access Network. o Upgrading to WDM technologies. • Results / Comparison: both absolute and incremental costs, starting from a P 2 MP deployment for the different unbundling strategies. Alternative operators, some of whom have already deployed their own networks to connect to the unbundled copper loop of the SMP operator, need to be provided with appropriate access products in order to continue to compete in an NGA context. For FTTH these may consist of access to civil engineering infrastructure, to the terminating segment, to the unbundled fiber loop (including dark fiber) or of <b>wholesale</b> <b>broadband</b> <b>access,</b> as the case may be. This work, although aiming to be general, takes the relevant data from the Spanish FTTH case. Where remedies imposed on Market 4 lead to effective competition in the corresponding downstream market, in the whole market or in certain geographic areas, other remedies could be withdrawn in the market or areas concerned. Such withdrawal would be indicated, for instance, if the successful imposition of physical access remedies were to render additional bitstream remedies redundant. Moreover, in exceptional circumstances, the regulator could refrain from imposing unbundled access to the fiber loop in geographic areas where the presence of several alternative infrastructures, such as FTTH networks, in combination with competitive access offers on the basis of unbundling, is likely to result in effective competition on the downstream level.
