Will transferred to Dumas High School when Kelvin accepted a position as the superintendent of the school district. Will, who received offers from forty-five collegiate schools, committed to the University of Arkansas in September 2014 and signed with the institution in December.|$|E

500|$|Critics praised Damon's {{performance}} in the episode. A television reviewer from The Sacramento Bee noted that Damon [...] "did a well-publicized (and very good) gig" [...] on the show. [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented that Damon was [...] "incredibly charming" [...] and funny. Matt Roush of TV Guide, in review of season four, said: [...] "If it weren't for some inspired guest stars — Matt Damon as a straight guy bluffing his way into a gay chorus, Michael Douglas as a gay detective clowning {{it up on the}} dance floor, Glenn Close as a lusty photographer groping both Will and Grace during a shoot — this season would be an awfully sad misfire." [...] Wales on Sundays Wil Marlow called Damon's performance {{one of the most memorable}} guest appearances in the history of the show, and commented that he [...] "held his own well against serial scene-stealer Sean Hayes." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald said the episode [...] "flies with jokes predicated on stereotypes and sexual innuendo", but [...] "Damon is a good sport with all the silliness, though, and seems more at ease here in the sitcom than he has in his last three films." [...] Eric McCormack, who portrays <b>Will,</b> <b>said</b> Damon was [...] "magnificent" [...] in the episode and a [...] "great experience" [...] for the cast of the show. Sean Hayes cites [...] "A Chorus Lie" [...] as one of his favorite episodes. In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Damon's guest spot as their number two most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.|$|E

2500|$|Will {{is among}} those advocating that China needs to focus {{intensely}} on AI. Speaking to government officials and administrators in May, he said {{the first half of}} the internet age—in which companies raced to connect computing machines with people—has finished. [...] "The second half is about artificial intelligence," [...] he said. DiDi has established a big data research center to focus on AI technologies including machine learning and computer vision, which will optimize its dispatch system and route planning. A few hundred scientists work on the deep-learning technologies. At this stage, <b>Will</b> <b>said</b> that the company is investing a lot of resources in research and is keen to recruit and retain top talent to build its self-driving cars and to make itself become one of the top technology companies in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Ammi {{read the}} words of [...] “And they let them have what they asked,” to teach that the Egyptians let the Israelites have their goods against their will. Some {{said that it was}} against the Egyptians' will, while others said that it was against the Israelites' will. Those who said that it was against the Egyptians' will cite [...] “And she who waits at home divides the spoil.” Those who said that it was against the Israelites' <b>will</b> <b>said</b> that {{it was because of the}} burden of {{carrying}} the Egyptians' goods. Rabbi Ammi {{read the words}} of [...] “And they despoiled Egypt,” to teach that they made Egypt like a trap for birds without any grain (as a lure). Resh Lakish said that they made Egypt it like a pond without fish..|$|E
2500|$|At this First Council of Nicaea twenty-two bishops, led by Eusebius of Nicomedia, came as {{supporters}} of Arius. But {{when some of}} Arius's writings were read aloud, they are reported to have been denounced as blasphemous by most participants. Those who upheld the notion that Christ was co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father were led by the priest Alexander. Athanasius {{was not allowed to}} sit in on the Council since he was only an arch-deacon. [...] But Athanasius is seen as doing the legwork and concluded (as Bishop Alexander conveyed in the Athanasian Trinitarian defense and also according to the Nicene Creed adopted at this Council and,) that the Son was of the same essence (homoousios) with the Father (or one in essence with the Father), and was eternally generated from that essence of the Father. Those who instead insisted that the Son of God came after God the Father in time and substance, were led by Arius the presbyter. For about two months, the two sides argued and debated, with each appealing to Scripture to justify their respective positions. Arius argued for the supremacy of God the Father, and maintained that the Son of God was simply the oldest and most beloved Creature of God, made from nothing, because of being the direct offspring. [...] Arius taught that the pre-existent Son was God's First Production (the very first thing that God actually ever did in His entire eternal existence up to that point), before all ages. [...] Thus he insisted that only God the Father had no beginning, and that the Father alone was infinite and eternal. [...] Arius maintained that the Son had a beginning. And he argued that everything else was created through the Son. [...] Thus, said Arius, only the Son was directly created and begotten of God; furthermore, there was a time that He had no existence. [...] He was capable of His own free <b>will,</b> <b>said</b> Arius, and thus [...] "were He in the truest sense a son, He must have come after the Father, therefore the time obviously was when He was not, and hence He was a finite being." [...] Arius appealed to Scripture, quoting verses such as : [...] "the Father is greater than I". And also : [...] "the firstborn of all creation." [...] Thus, Arius insisted that the Father's Divinity was greater than the Son's, and that the Son was under God the Father, and not co-equal or co-eternal with Him.|$|E
