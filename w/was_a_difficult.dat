5|$|On 9 November 1901, {{nine days}} after {{arriving}} back in Britain {{and on the}} King's sixtieth birthday, George was created Prince of Wales. The family moved their London residence from St James's Palace to Marlborough House. As Princess of Wales, May accompanied her husband on trips to Austria-Hungary and Württemberg in 1904. The following year, {{she gave birth to}} her last child, John. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> labour, and although she recovered quickly, her newborn son suffered respiratory problems.|$|E
5|$|After {{one season}} in the Third Division South and {{eighteen}} in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, Palace's stay in the division was to {{last as long as}} the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> division to be promoted from, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Division Three South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth. Palace finished runners-up no less than three times, and when the 1939–40 season ended, Palace were sitting fourth. Unfortunately the season was only four matches old, cancelled with the onset of the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Dermide {{was born}} on 20 April 1798, in Milan, which was then part of the Cisalpine Republic, a puppet state of the First French Republic. He {{was the first and}} only child of his parents, Maria Paola di Buonaparte (known as Pauline) and Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc, a general in the French Army. Dermide's birth <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> one, and its effects would be visible in Pauline's health for many years. He was christened Dermide Louis Napoléon, after a {{character}} in the epic Gaelic poems of Ossian, at the request of his uncle, general Napoleon Bonaparte, who greatly admired Ossian's works.|$|E
5|$|Domestically, Benfica {{began the}} league {{campaign}} with five points in four games, losing {{ground in the}} league race. They improved in subsequent games, but dropped points two more times, including at the official opening of the new Estádio da Luz. January <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> month for Benfica as they lost the Derby de Lisboa with Sporting, and on 25 January witnessed the death of club player—Miklós Fehér—in {{the middle of a}} game. In February and March, the team fluctuated between winning and losing streaks, including knocking out Rosenborg and losing to Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down an {{aircraft}} with an anti-aircraft gun <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the sky with ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E

Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E
5|$|Princess Charlotte <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> {{child and}} {{indifferent}} student, with a nervous disposition. Her {{relationship with her}} demanding mother was strained. As she grew older, Charlotte developed a penchant for spreading gossip and causing trouble. Eager to escape from parental control, at age sixteen, she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen in 1878. Her husband's weak-willed personality {{had little effect on}} her. Known for spreading gossip and her eccentric personality, Princess Charlotte enjoyed Berlin society while frequently leaving her only child, Princess Feodora, in the care of family members. Charlotte and Feodora, in turn, also had a difficult relationship.|$|E
5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties {{in the development of}} the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that he did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E

5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle in}} the nebula <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> {{sequence}} to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E
5|$|Their father, Richard, {{often took}} Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions {{to make more}} money for the family. They offered their discoveries for sale to {{tourists}} on a table outside their home. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time for England's poor; the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.|$|E

5|$|With so {{many people}} involved, {{security}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the Manhattan Project's security issues. By 1943, {{it was clear that}} the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. The most successful Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs of the British Mission. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades.|$|E
5|$|According to Julien Merceron, the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in {{the early}} 2010s, the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 {{while he was in}} the final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII-2. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> period for Square Enix: the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting {{technical}} barriers as it transitioned to open world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle, and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems. Faced with these issues, Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines for their products, including Luminous Studio. Talking about sharing the engine, Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game: this resulted in Luminous Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development, while other major next-generation titles would use other outsourced engines.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} was over, the brigade {{was supposed to}} support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for {{the invasion}}, the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs {{they had not been}} originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation's power grid. It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale. As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.|$|E

5|$|Hart's duties at Sling Camp {{ended in}} July, {{when he was}} {{recalled}} to France to take over command of the 3rd New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade. He led the brigade through the Hundred Days Offensive, which included an action during the Second Battle of Bapaume that impressed his commanding officer, Russell. During the battle, Hart's headquarters was again shelled with mustard gas. After his previous experience of being gassed, Hart found the shelling 'annoying'. The brigade also participated in the capture of Le Quesnoy in November 1918. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> assignment {{for the presence of}} civilians in the walled town meant that artillery could not support the attack. Instead a small party was able to scale the walls and put flight to the Germans defending that section. This allowed the remainder of the attacking force to enter the town, which quickly surrendered. A few days later, the mayor of Le Quesnoy presented Hart with the French flag that was raised over the town on the day it was captured from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Hart {{applied for}} and was {{appointed}} to the position of Administrator of Western Samoa, which was controlled by New Zealand under a mandate from the League of Nations. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> period for the colony as many of its citizens wanted independence. The Mau movement in particular was agitating for self-determination and employed tactics of civil disobedience as a means of opposing the New Zealand administration. After some heavy-handed management of protestors by his predecessor had resulted in several deaths amongst the movement, Hart made progress in improving relationships with the Mau when he took up his position in 1931. He also returned some financial stability to the colony which had struggled during the Great Depression. Hart was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services in Samoa shortly before completing his term as administrator and returning to New Zealand in July 1935.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, she {{was then}} {{cast in the}} epic The Prodigal (1955), {{followed}} by the John Wayne adventure film The Sea Chase (1955), which Turner shot in Hawaii. After starring in the period drama Diane (1956), MGM opted not to renew Turner's contract. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time for Hollywood's major studios because a recent court decision forced them to divest themselves of their movie theaters. In addition, television had caught on in a big way; the public was staying home. Turner {{was just one of}} MGM's star roster to be let go. Her career recovered briefly after she appeared in the hugely successful big-screen adaptation of Grace Metalious's best-selling novel, Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Another few box-office failures followed (Another Time, Another Place, for example) when the 1958 scandal surrounding her daughter's killing of Johnny Stompanato threatened to derail her career completely.|$|E
