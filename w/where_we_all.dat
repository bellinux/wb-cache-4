Tom Smith Interview in 2015 [...] "Birmingham is very important" [...] he explains. [...] "Looking back further it was <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> lived together in the early years, played all those flapper and jug of ale shows, and then got our record deal".

500|$|The Margaritaville blender itself {{served as}} a metaphor for {{consumerism}} and the tendency of Americans to buy luxuries that they do not need. Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.'

2500|$|Showrunner David Chase {{planned the}} series ending {{and the final}} scene during the 21-month hiatus between Seasons 5 and 6, a long break HBO had granted him.

2500|$|Blackwell {{has always}} seen {{herself as an}} {{educator}} {{as well as an}} opera singer, partly because of her roots as a music teacher.
