500|$|Moore {{stated that}} the Dreamcast would need to sell 5 million units in the U.S. {{by the end of}} 2000 in order to remain a viable platform, but Sega {{ultimately}} fell short of this goal with some 3 million units sold. Moreover, Sega's attempts to spur increased Dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses. Instead of an expected profit, for the six months ending September 2000, Sega posted a ¥17.98 billion ($163.11 million) loss, with the company projecting a year-end loss of ¥23.6 billion. This estimate was more than doubled to ¥58.3 billion, and in March 2001, Sega posted a consolidated net loss of ¥51.7 billion ($417.5 million). While the PS2's October 26 U.S. launch was marred by shortages—with only 500,000 of a planned 1 million units shipped due to a manufacturing glitch—this did not benefit the Dreamcast as much as expected, as many disappointed consumers continued to wait for a PS2—while the PSone, a remodeled version of the original PlayStation, was the best-selling console in the U.S. {{at the start of the}} 2000 holiday season. According to Moore, [...] "the PlayStation 2 effect that we were relying upon did not <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>us...</b> people will hang on for as long as possible... What effectively happened is the PlayStation 2 lack of availability froze the marketplace". Eventually, Sony and Nintendo held 50 and 35 percent of the US video game market, respectively, while Sega held only 15 percent. [...] According to Bellfield, Dreamcast software sold at an 8-to-1 ratio with the hardware, but this ratio [...] "on a small install base didn't give us the revenue... to keep this platform viable in the medium to long term." ...|$|E
