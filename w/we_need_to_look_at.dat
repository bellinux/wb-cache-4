The title of the film was borrowed from the book, in which the author describes the [...] "rotten teeth of children, the color of poverty in the country".

This is somewhat counter-intuitive, since for propositional satisability, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for one of 2 n options, while in graph isomorphism, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for one of n! options, and n! ≫ 2 n.
