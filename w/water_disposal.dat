2500|$|There {{are eight}} types of wells {{that may have}} {{received}} a reserved number. [...] These are stratigraphic or core tests, water supply wells, <b>water</b> <b>disposal</b> wells, water or gas injection wells, sulfur wells, underground storage wells, geothermal wells, or prospect tests.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of these resources has led to complacency among consumers, who still assume they will always be supplied with gas at [...] "affordable" [...] prices. Developing these resources can have substantial impacts on the environment through closer well spacing, more intensive infrastructure, additional noise from compression, the challenges of <b>water</b> <b>disposal,</b> NIMBY issues, and other factors. In recent years, changes in production technology (notably horizontal drilling and more advanced systems of hydraulic fracturing or [...] "fraccing") have greatly increased shale gas production. Greater shale gas production in the United States {{has been an important}} factor in reduced Canadian exports to that country.|$|E

2500|$|On {{behalf of}} the German {{government}} KfW development bank provides financing for water and sanitation investments {{in the city of}} Aden {{as well as in the}} towns of Al Shehr/Al Hami in Mukalla District, Mokha, Yarim, Amran, Sa'dah, Zabid, Bajil, Mansouria and Beit al-Faqih, the latter four being located in the Al Hudaydah Governorate. An evaluation of an earlier project for the renewal and expansion of drinking water supply systems in eight provincial towns in Yemen (Bajil, Bait al Faqih, Al Mansouria, Zabid, Mokha, Amran, Yarim und Hajjah), and sanitation measures in three towns (Hajjah, Amran and Yarim) showed that the project largely achieved its objectives related to water supply. The quality of the construction work was rated as high and the collection of bills was considered to be [...] "efficient". However, in Yarim the objective was not achieved due to water shortages. Only [...] "modest improvements" [...] were achieved regarding waste <b>water</b> <b>disposal.</b> Another project to reduce water losses in Taiz and Mukalla was considered a partial failure: On the positive side, the evaluation showed that losses in the rehabilitated areas were reduced significantly. In Mukalla, where 40% of the network was rehabilitated, they were reduced from 22% to 8%. In Taiz, where only 12% of the network was rehabilitated, they fell from 45% to 6%. However, overall losses in the cities remained high at 30% in Mukalla and 47% in Taiz, because only parts of the network were rehabilitated. The cost of the measures was higher than expected due to the poorer than expected state of the network. KfW is now in the process of applying robust, quantitative-based evaluation methods to more accurately assess the health impact of the interventions it supported in Yemeni towns based. This will be done through surveys including both beneficiaries and a control group.|$|E

5000|$|In waste <b>water</b> <b>disposal,</b> treated {{waste water}} is {{injected}} into the ground between impermeable layers of rocks to avoid polluting fresh water supplies or adversely affecting quality of receiving waters. Injection wells are usually constructed of solid walled pipe to a deep elevation {{in order to prevent}} injectate from mixing with the surrounding environment. Unlike outfalls or other direct disposal techniques, injection wells utilize the earth as a filter to further clean the treated wastewater before it reaches the receiving water. This method of waste <b>water</b> <b>disposal</b> also serves to spread the injectate over a wide area, further decreasing environmental impacts.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} days of Adelaide, the Torrens was used for bathing, stock <b>watering,</b> rubbish <b>disposal,</b> <b>water</b> supply and as a de facto sewer and {{drainage}} sump. This led to a range of health issues until finally, in 1839, when a dysentery outbreak killed five children in one day, Governor Gawler forbid bathing, clothes washing and the disposal of animal carcases in the Torrens within [...] of town. The quality of the river's water was not helped by water supply methods. Carters used to drive water carts into the Torrens to refill. To prevent this the State Government built a facility with steam powered pumps and water storage in 1852, from which the carters then filled.|$|R
