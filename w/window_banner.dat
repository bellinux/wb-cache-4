50|$|Prior to {{construction}} of the ARC, the Valpo basketball and volleyball teams competed at Hilltop Gymnasium, which opened in 1939 and is among the first facilities built at the university after it was purchased by the Lutherans. Hilltop had previously been expanded in 1962 to include more seating for basketball and a swimming pool on the first floor. Hilltop Gym was home for Valpo basketball when it competed in the NCAA's former College Division, for smaller schools. Notable individuals to appear in Hilltop include Larry Bird during his collegiate career at Indiana State, and Robert F. Kennedy, who gave a speech in the gym during his presidential campaign. It is now used as a practice facility for the men's and women's basketball teams following a 2005 renovation that included new flooring, lighting, <b>windows</b> and numerous <b>banners</b> celebrating Valpo's basketball tradition.|$|R
5000|$|More {{than fifty}} years later she {{disclosed}} {{that a couple of}} weeks before the party's exclusion from the Hamburg parliament Magda Kelms had collected from the city hall 2,000 Marks in attendance allowances for the Communist Party members, which would be used for the support of comrades continuing to work (now illegally) for the party. On 1 May 1933 a demonstration was organised locally, with red banners improvised from bedding hung from apartment <b>windows,</b> but the <b>banners</b> were hurriedly taken in when Nazi paramilitaries appeared on the scene. On 2 May 1933 the apartment she shared was [...] "occupied" [...] by fascists, but she was nevertheless able to continue with her party work till her arrest in May 1934. [...] She took a leading role in underground distribution of the [...] "Rote Fahne" [...] newspaper and other Communist publications in the Hamburg region.|$|R
5|$|When {{high school}} {{students}} followed the lead of their elders and demonstrated, Diệm had them arrested as well. Two of the detained students were paraded {{at a press conference}} in which they falsely admitted to being communists who had brainwashed their entire school, having been tortured to force their confession. At Trung Vuong, an elite girls' high school, the students hung up banners attacking Diệm and the Nhus, while students from the corresponding boys' schools became violent, smashing school <b>windows</b> and erecting <b>banners</b> that insulted Madame Nhu in explicit language. More than 1000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of public servants and military officers, were sent to re-education camps. The result was that many army officers and senior civil servants had to lobby to have their children or younger siblings released from jail, causing a further drop in morale among government and military officials. In more extreme cases, brawls broke out between police officers arresting students, and the students' parents, many of whom were military officers and/or public servants.|$|R
50|$|In {{the winter}} of 2007, UNB Residential Life & Conferencing Services decided that {{due to a lack}} of {{enrollment}} in residence, they would close Aitken House and attempt to sell it to the University to be turned into an academic building. Although the residence community had seen many buildings come and go throughout its lifetime, the residents and alumni of Aitken House were not ready to let it go without a fight. The majority of the residence community showed their support to keep Aitken House alive through painting red A's in their <b>windows,</b> flying <b>banners,</b> and attending meetings. There were also those who supported ResLife's position and the campus newspaper's letters to the editor section was filled with controversy every week. Throughout the remainder of that academic year, the supporters of Aitken appealed at many meetings to stop the sale of the house. But to their dismay they were unable to stop it along the way. It progressed all the way through to the UNB Board of Governors (BOG) meeting, a step that is usually just a formality. Traditionally only the members of the BOG are allowed to be present during a meeting but they allowed the house to make a presentation as to why the residence building should be spared. As the members of the BOG entered the Wu Center for their meeting, they were greeted by Aitken House residents and supporters mainly from other residences at UNB, all lined up beside each entrance. The meeting went on for hours and everyone went to wait for the final word back at Aitken House. For the first time in UNB BOG's history, a decision was overturned and the House was saved.|$|R

At center, the {{rectangular}} hotel car is seen sitting on tracks near dirt and sand. Thirteen small windows are {{visible on the}} side of the car. Below the windows, the words "Maryland-Virginia" are barely visible. At the front of the car, five windows span the frontal face.

40|$|In {{recent years}} with the {{increasingly}} world-wide introduction of the Internet, the use of online questionnaires has increased dramatically. However in Thailand, there has been only very limited systematic research on web-based design in Thailand, including for Thai undergraduates who are the biggest group of Thai internet users. The particular characteristics of the Thai language (e. g. no capital letters, no break between words, Thai script etc.) present some interesting challenges for online Thai surveys. This experimental study investigated web-based survey design principles based on an English language background trial at a Thai university with individual interviews and focus groups {{with the use of}} think aloud and other research techniques. The findings of two types of web usability tests revealed that the scrolling web-based format was the most suitable for conducting survey s and that such surveys are most likely to attract higher response rates when endorsed by a trusted organization, when instructions are short, simple and specific, when closed and dichotomous questions provide sufficient answer options and when matrix and semantic differential questions are limited. Research also indicates that the font, Ms Sans Serif of size &quot;- 1 &quot; or 14 pixels in Thai, is the most appropriate for the Thai language, as is a simple progression bar, three-point rating scales and an artistically decorated survey form. The approximate ideal length of an effective on-line survey is about 20 questions, taking about 5 - 10 minutes to complete. The short and potentially sensitive demographic questions are best obtained just before respondents complete the questionnaire. Thai undergraduates adequately understand check boxes, option or radio buttons, and drop-down menus; therefore a help section may only be necessary when the survey is more complex than a general survey. The study also examined the most attractive invitation method, comparing pop-up <b>windows,</b> message <b>banners</b> and advertising marquees in a 22 -day trial on a Thai university website where 3, 848 survey forms were completed, representing 22. 7 per cent of those who entered the survey web-site. The characteristics did not differ from the actual university web-users profile - 58 % were female and 32. 8 % were university students. The most effective invitation method was a message box when users clicked on any link on the homepage since it is a new method with no restriction from the browser with an effective grasp on the attention of the users. The most significant reasons influencing participants&# 039; decisions about the questionnaire were the same factors effecting decisions to participate in surveys generally: topic of survey followed by the importance of the survey content. The third reason influencing users&# 039; decisions to participate in this survey was the invitation method. In future, the third factor may become the ben efit accruing to the respondent...|$|R
