40|$|We {{report on}} the {{synthesis}} of CdSe magic-sized clusters (MSCs) and their evolution into 1 D rod and <b>wires</b> <b>retaining</b> {{the diameter of the}} order of MSCs. At the beginning of the reaction, different classes of stable MSCs with band gaps of 3. 02 eV and 2. 57 eV are formed, which exhibit sharp band edge photoluminescence features with FWHM in the order of similar to 13 nm. Reaction annealing time was carried out in order to monitor the shape evolution of the MSCs. We find that magic sized CdSe evolve into 1 D rod and <b>wires</b> <b>retaining</b> the same diameter upon increasing annealing time. We observed the gradual emergence of new red shifted emission peaks during this shape evolution process, which emerge as a result of one dimensional energy transfer within the magic sized clusters during their subsequent transformation into rods and wires. The smallest, the second smallest sized MSC and the wires sequentially act as donors and acceptors during the size evolution from small MSCs to larger ones, and then eventually to wires. Steady-state and time-resolved luminescent spectroscopy revealed Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the MSCs to the rods and wires...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{conductance}} fluctuations are {{investigated in}} disordered 3 D topological insulator quantum wires. Both experiments and theory reveal a new transport regime in a mesoscopic conductor, pseudo-ballistic transport, for which ballistic properties persist beyond the transport mean free path, characteristic of diffusive transport.

These residual stresses are known to be detrimental for the mechanical properties of the wires and their durability in aggressive environments.

The present authors have studied this problem for a number of years and have performed a detailed characterization of the residual stress state inside cold-drawn rods, including both experimental and numerical techniques. High-energy synchrotron sources have been particularly useful for this research. The results have shown how residual stresses evolve {{as a consequence of}} cold-drawing and how they change with subsequent post-drawing treatments.

40|$|We have {{laterally}} patterned {{the narrowest}} conducting wires of {{two-dimensional electron gas}} (2 DEG) material reported to date. The depletion induced by low-energy ion etching of GaAs-AlGaAs 2 DEG structures was used to define narrow conducting channels. We employed high voltage electron beam lithography to create a range of channel geometries with widths as small as 75 nm. Using ion beam assisted etching by Cl 2 gas and Ar ions with energies as low as 150 eV, conducting channels were defined by etching only through the thin GaAs cap layer. This slight etching is sufficient to entirely deplete the underlying material without necessitating exposure of the sidewalls that results in long lateral depletion lengths. At 4. 2 K, without illumination, our narrowest <b>wires</b> <b>retain</b> a carrier density and mobility at least as high {{as that of the}} bulk 2 DEG and exhibit quantized Hall effects.
