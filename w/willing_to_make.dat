5|$|The casting {{approach}} for Carnivàle was {{to cast the}} best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. Carnivàle casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> exceptions such as for Adrienne Barbeau as Ruthie.|$|E
5|$|Aratus took {{advantage}} of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis {{had been sent to}} Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E
5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E

While there, they {{discover}} that Tree Trunks has {{entered into a}} relationship with Mr. Pig (voiced by Ron Lynch). Finn asks Tree Trunks if she would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> apple pie for Princess Bubblegum's musical concert, to which she agrees. Later at the concert, however, Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig arrive, sans apple pie. During the performance, Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks begin to passionately kiss, which makes the entire audience feel uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the meeting, {{confidential}} negotiations took place between Britain and Russia in April and May 1878. The Russians were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> changes to the big Bulgaria, but were determined to retain their new possessions, Bessarabia in Europe and Batum and Kars {{on the east coast}} of the Black Sea. To counterbalance this, Britain required a possession in the Eastern Mediterranean where it might base ships and troops, and negotiated with the Ottomans for the cession of Cyprus. Once this was secretly agreed, Disraeli was prepared to allow Russia's territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk {{that had}} been {{established}} at the Reformation, had been largely united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar, it became divided, partly {{in the search for}} scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as Resolutioners, who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an accommodation with royalism, and more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E

5|$|The casting {{approach}} for Carnivàle {{was to find}} the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. Carnivàles casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. They attended theater showcases, approached smaller agents or hired some actors directly to find people with unique and distinct looks, which was trying as Los Angeles is a stronghold of good-looking actors. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> exceptions for established actors such as Adrienne Barbeau (Ruthie).|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he {{was held}} in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had they not already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E

5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 he {{returned}} to London to attend one of the Lancaster House conferences. There, representatives of KANU and KADU met with British officials to establish {{the nature of a}} new constitution. It was agreed that Kenya would be divided into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but that there would also be a strong central government and both an upper and lower house. At the time, Kenyatta was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> concessions to KADU on issues like regional authority, aware that he would amend these aspects of the constitution when in office. On his return, he accepted a minor post in the coalition government, that of the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs and Economic Planning.|$|E
5|$|No {{immediate}} action {{had been taken}} after the 1880 act authorizing coins, but King Kalākaua was interested and government officials saw {{a way to get}} out of a financial bind by getting coins issued in exchange for government bonds. Businessman Claus Spreckels was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the arrangements with the United States in exchange for profits from the coin production, and contracted with the US Mint to have $1,000,000 struck. Originally, a 12 cent piece was planned and a few specimens were struck, but it was scrapped in an effort to have uniformity between US and Hawaiian coins, and a dime was substituted. The coins were struck at San Francisco in 1883 and 1884, though all bear the earlier date.|$|E

5|$|After the {{execution}} of the King in January 1649, England was declared a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied the country in 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar the Kirk became deeply divided, partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as the Resolutioners, who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an accommodation with royalism, and the more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines, intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The building housed two mortuaries, the LNC's boardroom and funerary workshops, {{and a series of}} separate waiting rooms for those attending first, second and third class funerals. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level above. Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel, on some occasions mourners would not be able or <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church. On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office {{began working}} toward a new stadium, with the city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries, but insisted that the major European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue. On other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E
