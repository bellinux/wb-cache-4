5|$|Article Seven of the {{proposed}} Constitution set the terms by which the new frame of government would be established. The new Constitution would become operational when ratified by at least nine states. Only then <b>would</b> <b>it</b> replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation and would apply only to those states that ratified it.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, <b>would</b> <b>it</b> not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status {{to any of the}} princely states, nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that the states would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements.|$|E

5|$|The Quebec Agreement allowed Simon and Peierls to {{meet with}} representatives of Kellex, who were {{designing}} and building the American gaseous diffusion plant, Union Carbide and Carbon, who would operate it, and Harold Urey's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, the Manhattan Project's centre tasked with {{research and development of}} the process. The year's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly. The corporations were committed to tight schedules, and the engineers were unable to incorporate British proposals that would involve major changes. Nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be possible to build a second plant. Nonetheless, the Americans were still eager for British assistance, and Groves asked for a British mission to be sent to assist the gaseous diffusion project. In the meantime, Simon and Peierls were attached to Kellex.|$|E
25|$|The Federation of the West Indies was not {{the first}} attempt at a British Caribbean {{federation}} (nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be the last). The history of the previous attempts at federations and unions, in part, explains the failure of the 1958 Federation.|$|E
25|$|Technically, {{this article}} {{does not affect}} the states' {{authority}} to legislate on religion, nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> block federal legislation on religion aside from that establishing an official religion of Australia. In practice, though, the government respects these rights and contributes to the generally free practice of religion.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the fresh}} meeting was held, Stancer said, France convened {{a meeting in}} Paris and formed the Union Cycliste Internationale.

25|$|Nation was {{requested}} to write several scripts and {{to influence the}} format of the new series. As before, a story arc was planned. During {{the first half of the}} series, the Liberator crew would search for the missing Blake and in a mid-series climax would discover his grave. Nation was commissioned to write the first two episodes, which would establish the new format and characters. The final story of the series <b>would,</b> <b>it</b> was intended, conclude Blake's 7.|$|E

25|$|The Néstor Kirchner {{administration}} placed Brazil as {{a foreign}} policy priority and relations with Brazil were considered strategic. This was met with reciprocity in Brazil, as Lula da Silva placed Argentina as the main priority of his foreign policy. It should be emphasized, that the first foreign visit of Lula da Silva, as president-elect, was to Argentina in December 2002. From the Brazilian perspective, only with this strategic alliance <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be possible to transform South America into a world power bloc, {{one of the goals}} of Lula da Silva's foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Moncayo in 1958 tangibly {{marked the end}} of the Mexican {{nationalist}} composition school. In the same way that his work without followers surpassed and abolished the innocent use of the Mexicanism theme, his death closed the predominance of a composition style whose imprint marked musical creation in Mexico during more than three decades; although only {{at the beginning of the}} sixties <b>would</b> <b>it</b> be possible to talk about the definitive abandonment of the great Mexican fresco, the oblivion of the epic tone, and the search for new structural factors in composition.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the future}} of the city seemed grim. Before the war (in 1850), the {{population}} had reached 3,824 to become the 3rd largest city in the state (behind Mobile and Montgomery). By 1870 it returned 1,137 residents (with Black residents outnumbering Whites by a margin of 594 to 543); in 1880, 816 residents; by 1890, it had declined to 619, and would bottom out at 562 in 1900. Not until 1950 <b>would</b> <b>it</b> return to having the same population as a century earlier (with 3,813 residents).|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil's main {{thesis is}} that these {{hierarchical}} pattern recognizers are used not just for sensing the world, but for nearly all aspects of thought.
