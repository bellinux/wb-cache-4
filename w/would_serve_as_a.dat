5|$|In {{consolidating}} his power, Muhammad Ali, {{the rebel}} governor of Ottoman Egypt, was modeling his {{rule on the}} bureaucratic organization characteristic of modern European states. Like earlier rulers of Egypt, Muhammad Ali desired to exercise control over greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), both for its strategic value and for its natural resources. In addition to its abundant natural resources, Syria also had a prospering international trading community with well-developed markets. In addition, in Ali's strategy, Syria <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> captive market for goods being produced in Egypt. Moreover, the extension of Egyptian control over Syria was sought because it <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. Ali was attempting to become independent of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

However, these plans never came to fruition, with the studio instead opting to create the film A Good Day to Die Hard.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired shots at a border post near Alytus and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas. At other points the Soviets interrogated Lithuanian border guards and harassed civilians, hoping to provoke a retaliation that <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rationale for a full-scale military attack.|$|E
5|$|A crosstown line via Worth Street <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{branch of}} the IND Eighth Avenue Line's local tracks.

5|$|Arlington was {{established}} in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area became home to projects under the direction of federal relief agencies, including a municipal airport that <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> naval air station during World War II. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington experienced the effects of suburbanization, growing by over 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey Point to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|As the {{northern}} tribal lands gradually opened to white settlement, Indiana's population rapidly increased {{and the center}} of population shifted continually northward. Indianapolis was selected to be the site of the new state capital in 1820 because of its central position within the state. The city founders assumed the White River <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major transportation artery; however, the waterway was too sandy for navigation. In 1825, Indianapolis replaced Corydon as the seat of government. The government became established in the Marion County Courthouse as the second state capital building.|$|E
5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village that <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was {{used to create a}} racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they had to deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke's stuntman.|$|E

5|$|In late 1903, a {{baseball}} column {{suggested that the}} Detroit Tigers were interested in Shay, but he {{was said to be}} happy playing in California. During Shay's tenure in San Francisco, he got married. Shay went to spring training with the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1904 season. He impressed the team, prompting speculation that shortstop Dave Brain would move to third base and third baseman Jimmy Burke <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> utility infielder. Shay played 99 games for the Cardinals in 1904.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E

5|$|Joan of Arc is a 1796 epic poem {{composed}} by Robert Southey. The {{idea for the}} story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford, when Southey realised that the story would be suitable for an epic. The subject further appealed to Southey because {{the events of the}} French Revolution were concurrent to the writing of the poem and <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> parallel to current events. Eventually, Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts of the poem for a 1798 edition. Later editions removed Coleridge's additions along with other changes.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1989, OTA {{approved}} {{a contract to}} transplant approximately 290 live trees {{in the path of}} the turnpike to locations along the edge of the right-of-way. There, the trees <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|Procurement of the Arrow from Canada, {{and setting}} up a {{production}} line in the UK, was studied, the unit price per aircraft built in the UK being estimated at Â£220,000 each for a production run of 100 aircraft, {{as opposed to the}} estimate of Â£150,000 per aircraft for the thin wing Javelin. The CF-105 <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stopgap until the UK's F.155 project came to fruition; however with the F.155 due in 1963 and the Arrow not likely to reach the RAF before 1962, there was little point in proceeding.|$|E

The two buildings were connected by the Barnett Concourse, and two more major galleries were added. This expansion was completed in 1992. In early 2002, the museum {{acquired the}} adjacent Woman's Club of Jacksonville, a Tudor-style residential building which <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> space for programs and events for the museum. The museum also acquired the Jacobsen Gallery of American Art in 2005, and the Mason Gallery in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Bostock {{married his}} Australian fiancÃ©e, Gwendolen Norton, in Southampton on 6March 1919.

Bostock retired from the RAF and {{returned}} to civilian life in Australia that October. In September 1921, he joined the recently formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and was commissioned a flying officer. He became a friend and mentor to Flying Officer (later Air Marshal Sir) George Jones, another World War I veteran, who had flown with the Australian Flying Corps and had joined the Air Force in March. By mid-1922 Bostock had been promoted to flight lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Both the IRFU and WIFU {{suspended}} {{operations in}} 1942 {{due to the}} Second World War. Grey Cup play {{was expected to be}} suspended along with the unions; however, the military felt the game and sport <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> morale booster and organized teams at bases across the country. For the following three years, Grey Cup competition was limited to military teams, and in the 1942 Grey Cup, the Toronto RCAF Hurricanes defeated the Winnipeg RCAF Bombers 8â5 to become the first non-civilian team to win the national championship. Two years later, the St. HyacintheâDonnacona Navy defeated the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, 7â6; no Grey Cup championship since then has featured two eastern teams. The conclusion of the war led to the reformation of civilian teams; the IRFU resumed play in 1945, and the WIFU the following year.|$|E
