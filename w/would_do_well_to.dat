Matters have reached such a pass ... that ... it would ... be well to approach Lord Robert on your Majesty's behalf ...

For Preston's visit to Coventry Road the following weekend, the club applied for a licence to sell alcohol within the ground, as it was the only First Division club without such a licence.

He met with important literary figures {{from around the}} continent and the world, including Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor, Nigerian playwright and poet Wole Soyinka, and US poet-author Langston Hughes. Among the topics of discussion {{was an attempt to}} determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora, or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not [...] "a very significant question", and that scholars <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond.|$|E
500|$|In August 1865 Nelson {{attempted}} to resurrect the institute following the war, and he submitted an advertisement to the Civilian & Telegraph newspaper in Cumberland, Maryland, {{in which he}} billed the institute as [...] "A Male and Female Boarding and Day School".

According to Nelson in the advertisement, [...] "parents desiring for their children a sound English, Classical and Mathematical Education <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> patronize this School."

Latin and Greek each cost $5 additional per quarter. Boarding at the school cost $3 per week; however, laundry, fuel, and lighting {{were not included in}} this fee. Music lessons were also taught [...] "at Professor's charges".|$|E

In The Times, columnist Martin Samuel summarised the situation: [...] "The Germans had never lost at home to an English side and Norwich's expedition was regarded as little more than an exotic day out with a football match attached". This perception couldn't help but reach the players, which was to be significant. According to Norwich player, Jeremy Goss, before the match, [...] "everyone around us was saying we <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>to</b> keep it down to three or four nil". Both camps were to respond to this feeling, in a manner that has subsequently been viewed as contributory to the eventual result.|$|E
