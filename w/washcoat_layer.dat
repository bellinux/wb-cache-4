40|$|The {{external}} and internal mass transfer for a rotating foam stirrer reactor has been studied using the hydrogenation of 3 -methyl- 1 -pentyn- 3 -ol as a model reaction. Catalytic foam stirrers with different number of pores per linear inch (ppi) and washcoating thicknesses are used and their performance are {{described in terms of}} activity and selectivity. The liquid-solid mass transfer does not limit the overall reaction rate when a 20 ppi foam is used. For this catalytic foam stirrer, a kLSaLS value of 0. 2 s- 1 is estimated at 300 rpm. The use of finer pore foam structures is not convenient due to a drastic decrease of catalyst surface refreshment. As a result, the lower kLS value negates the benefit of a larger area (aLS) resulting in a lower liquid-solid mass transfer. The catalyst accessibility is a controlling factor in this fast reaction. The optimal washcoat thickness to avoid diffusion limitations is 5 µm. Gas-liquid mass transfer rate is not a limiting factor. A kGLaGL of 0. 6 s- 1 is measured at 300 rpm by the physical adsorption method. When compared to the conventional slurry reactor, the liquid-solid and the gas-liquid mass transfer rates are 17 and 6 times higher, respectively. However, the intrinsic activity of the foam catalyst is 4. 6 times less than the slurry catalyst prepared with the same palladium loading. This is explained by a difference in palladium dispersion caused by a non homogenous concentration of active sites along the <b>washcoat</b> <b>layer.</b> On the other hand, the less active foam catalyst leads to higher selectivity. The production rate is then increased by mounting more active blades on the stirrer shaft, thus creating more surface area for catalyst deposition while still keeping the high accessibility of a 4 µm <b>washcoat</b> <b>layer.</b> Hence, rotating foam reactors have promising applications for multiphase processes. High mass transfer rates can be easily achieved, catalyst filtering is not longer needed and reusability of the foam catalyst is possible. [...] -...|$|E
40|$|A {{system of}} {{interfaced}} AFM and Raman microscopes {{was used to}} study heterogeneity of complex cat- alytic materials providing information on both the topography and the chemical composition of the surface in one measurement. The catalysts surface was examined at various stages of their preparation: precalcination of steel, washcoating, impregnation and doping. It {{has been shown that}} the surface of the precalcined steel sheets is covered mostly by -Al 2 O 3 although there are places where -Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 are also present. Washcoating of the precalcined sheets gives only partly uniform grain distribution of CeO 2. Impregnation with cobalt leads to formation of uniform coverage of Co 3 O 4.

Ru/Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 /cordierite showed excellent catalytic performance due to the high specific surface area and the large pores of Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 support. The Zr/Al ratio was optimized to be 0. 116 and the excessive amount of ZrO 2 resulted in a decreased specific surface area of the Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 <b>washcoating</b> <b>layer.</b> The preferable calcination temperature is 1373 K for Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 support, at which suitable BET surface area and pore size distribution could be obtained.

40|$|The present work {{demonstrates}} that ceramic foams can be functionalized with homogeneous thin <b>washcoat</b> <b>layers</b> {{by a special}} coating technology which combines dip and spin coating. This technology can also be adapted to other material systems. The washcoat system, developed in {{the scope of this}} work, is built up of three layers. As a consequence of the excellent results from catalytic and long-term stability measurements, manganese impregnated catalyst inserts are suitable for catalytic oxidation of lean gases. The maximum of the reaction temperature in a technical plant should not exceed 1 200 deg C. By using certain catalytic components (e. g. precious metals) it is possible to apply the developed washcoat system for specific catalytic applications, for instance as afterburner in fuel cell systems. However, independent of the application it is necessary to choose a calcination temperature, which is 100 C higher than the operating temperature. This procedure helps to remain the long-term stability of the catalytic system. Further research will be carried out to improve the oxidation stability of the SiC foam carrier by minimizing the micro-porosity.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a kinetic and {{transport}} model for diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) with a satisfactory compromise between accuracy and computational demands for robust simulation of transient full-scale operation. Specifically the model accounts for surface concentrations of key species needed to capture transient features for typical lean exhaust conditions. In addition, the model accounts for transport limitations and distinguish them from reaction kinetics as well as apparent NO oxidation inhibition effects due to reactions. To achieve this, lab scale experiments were performed with DOCs with different platinum loadings and three different washcoat configurations of which two had an inert top layer. Both kinetic parameters for a detailed kinetic model and effective diffusivities were optimized for the experimental data using a single channel catalyst model. The experiments showed a clear effect of increased transport resistance for propene and CO and also that NO 2 plays an important role as an oxidizing agent for preferentially CO at low temperature (< 120 °C). The resulting model showed good agreement with measurement data using O, CO and NO 2 as the only surface species.

40|$|Aqueous phase {{reforming}} of sorbitol {{was carried}} out in a 1 m long, 320 µm ID microchannel reactor with a 5 µm Pt-based <b>washcoated</b> catalyst <b>layer,</b> combined with nitrogen stripping. The performance of this microchannel reactor is correlated to the mass transfer properties, reaction kinetics, hydrogen selectivity and product distribution. Mass transfer does not affect the rate of sorbitol consumption, which is limited by the kinetics of the reforming reaction. Mass transfer significantly affects the hydrogen selectivity and the product distribution. The rapid consumption of hydrogen in side reactions at the catalyst surface is prevented by a fast mass transfer of hydrogen from the catalyst site to the gas phase in the microchannel reactor. This results in a decrease of the concentration of hydrogen at the catalyst surface, which was found to enhance the desired reforming route {{at the expense of the}} undesired hydrogen consuming reactions. Compared to a fixed bed reactor, the selectivity to hydrogen in the microchannel reactor was increased by a factor of 2. The yield to side products (mainly C 3 and heavier hydrodeoxygenated species) was suppressed while the yield to hydrogen was increased from 1. 4 to 4 moles per mole of sorbitol fed...|$|R

The catalytic coatings were characterized measuring their textural properties, adhesion and morphology. These structured catalysts {{have been tested}} in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and compared with a microchannel block presenting perpendicular channels for reaction and cooling. The selectivity depends {{on the type of}} support used and mainly on the thickness of the layer deposited. In general, the C 5 + selectivity decreased at increasing CO conversion for all of the systems (powder, monoliths, foams and microchannels block). On the other hand, the selectivity to methane increased with the thickness of the catalytic layer due to the higher effective H 2 /CO ratio over the active sites resulting from the higher diffusivity of H 2 compared with CO in the liquid products filling the pores. The C 5 + selectivity of the microchannels reactor is higher than that of the structured supports and the powder catalyst. Â© 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceThe {{complete}} preparation procedure of catalytic cordierite monoliths has been studied, from the washcoating with alumina to the deposition of Ni by wet impregnation. The effect of drying (oven, room temperature or microwaves drying) on Ni distribution was investigated by SEM, TEM, XPS and surface area measurements. The use of γ-Al 2 O 3 suspensions of suitable particles size allows a faster alumina loading and the deposition of a <b>washcoat</b> <b>layer</b> with better adhesion properties than those obtained with boehmite precursors. The Ni distribution is {{strongly influenced by}} drying method applied to wet-impregnated monoliths. At a macroscopic scale, the Ni distribution is more homogeneous after microwaves or room temperature drying. At a microscopic scale, there is a surface enrichment of the washcoat in Ni, whatever the drying method applied. In all catalysts, the Ni is present in two forms: it is predominantly incorporated in a Ni-alumina spinel phase, but some large metal particles (10 – 20 nm) are also present, in a larger extent in the monoliths dried by microwaves and oven procedures. All monoliths deactivate slowly with time on stream during ATR of isooctane, but the oven-dried monoliths deactivate more markedly. Amorphous carbon film and whiskers were identified on all catalysts. The deactivation is {{not directly related to}} the total amount of deposited coke, but rather to the type of carbon and to Ni dispersion at both microscopic (large/small Ni particles) and macroscopic (axial Ni distribution in the channels) scales...|$|E

XRD analysis, BET surface area results and H 2 TPR measurements have all revealed the presence of significant interaction between the perovskite and the alumina based support, which becomes very strong upon thermal treatment at 1100 °C. On the other hand, MgO supported samples undergo only sintering processes with reduction of surface area upon treatment at 1100 °C. Catalytic activity measurements in methane combustion have been performed both in fixed bed and in monolithic reactor. The results on powders {{have shown that the}} dispersion on both supports is effective to enhance the catalytic performances of the catalysts treated at 800 °C. A very strong deactivation is observed for the La/Al 2 O 3 supported catalyst when pre-treated at 1100 C, while LaMnO 3 /MgO shows a promising high thermal stability. The chemical nature of the active sites changes by dispersing LaMnO 3 on both supports, even if to a different extent, as revealed by the estimated values of apparent activation energy and reaction orders for methane and oxygen. Structured combustion catalysts have been prepared following well established procedures towashcoat commercial cordierite monoliths with lanthanum stabilised alumina. The subsequent deposition of precursors on the coated monolith has been obtained by deposition precipitation method. Comparison between monolith and corresponding powder sample shows a higher catalytic activity of the former, likely to be attributed to the better dispersion obtained with repeated deposition cycles of active phase on the thin <b>washcoat</b> <b>layer.</b> Moreover, a lower deactivation has been observed on monolith after ageing under reaction at 1050 °C for 2 h, suggesting promising developments of this technique to produce catalytic combustion systems for high temperature application...|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} {{analysis of}} experiments of H 2 fuel-rich combustion over a Rh catalyst—reported in Maestri et al. [2007. Role of gas-phase chemistry {{in the rich}} combustion of H 2 and CO over a Rh/Al 2 O 3 catalyst in annular reactor. Chemical Engineering Science 62, 4992 – 4997]—has been extended using a detailed surface kinetic model coupled with a detailed kinetic scheme for H 2 gas-phase combustion. The model is now able to investigate possible interactions between the surface and homogeneous chemistries. Results suggest that the homogeneous chemistry played a role, especially at high temperatures. In the intermediate range of temperatures, where the experimental conversion data are systematically higher than those corresponding to the diffusive limit, model predictions revealed that a very weak interaction between the gas-phase and surface kinetics occurs. In fact, the fraction of radicals that desorbs from the surface is significantly lower than that {{needed in order to}} partially activate the homogeneous process. Finally, we accounted for the presence of zones upstream and downstream of the main catalytic bed with a low catalytic activity. These sections could be related to non-uniformity of the catalytic washcoat at the boundaries of the catalytic bed, uncertainty of the beginning and ending of the <b>washcoat</b> <b>layer,</b> and possible evaporation and redeposition of the catalyst. We show that such low activity sections could significantly increase the conversion above the diffusive limit and provide a plausible mechanism to rationalize the experimental data. Moreover, dynamic simulations further revealed that under isothermal conditions the ignition of the homogenous process is governed by a build-up of a “radical pool” at the reactor back end followed by upstream propagation: axial diffusivity is crucial in order to model appropriately the experimental data...|$|E

A falling film microstructured reactor (FFMR) was tested in the selective hydrogenation of 2 -butyne- 1, 4 -diol (1) to its olefinic derivative (2). The FFMR plates were coated with Al 2 O 3 or ZnO followed by the deposition of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The oxides were deposited on the microstructured reaction plates using either conventional <b>washcoating</b> or atomic <b>layer</b> deposition (ALD) in the liquid or gas phase, respectively. The Pd-NPs were either formed via impregnation of an organometallic precursor with subsequent reduction, or with pre-fabricated Pd-NPs stabilized in poly(vinyl pyrrolidon) (PVP) with subsequent pyrolysis of the organic matrix and activation in H 2 atmosphere.

The three different dwell periods at 899 °C were 4 hours, 6 hours, and taking a sample out every hour for 4 hours and letting it air cool.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain a deeper {{understanding}} of the performance of a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), techniques are developed which help to bridge the gap in the development of catalyst technology from the laboratory bench-top to an application on a real 2. 0 litre diesel engine. The methodology is illustrated using a full-scale DOC (106 mm diameter; length 114 mm), from which sections are cut and then examined using a variety of techniques, including: optical measurement, SEM, TEM, FTIR, CO chemisorption, pore size and pore volume measurements. These provide valuable information on the characteristics of the Pt catalyst, in the actual form (on supportlwashcoat) that it will be used in a commercial application. In addition, a transient chromatographic technique was tested to measure the effective diffusivity in the <b>washcoat</b> <b>layer.</b> These experiments were performed using sections of v-alumina washcoated (::::: 50 /lm thick) monolith (1 mm channels), which were mounted in a 570 mm long housing - unfortunately this did not work. The technique was improved, and short sections of monolith, with a larger channel diameter (2. 64 mm) and with a thicker washcoat (::::: 475 /lm) were mounted in a 1 m long sleeve - although better results were obtained, this technique still needs to be improved. A methodology was then described, in which a short section of DOC (5 mm long) was cut from the full-scale DOC, and this was connected to a live 2. 0 litre diesel engine. It was shown how experiments (with gas inlet temperatures varying from 150 to 270 QC) can be performed, and in combination with a modelling technique, the information gathered can be used to test the validity of rate expressions. It was shown: (a) that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) form of rate expression is clearly unsuitable for transient simulations, whereas mechanistic forms can provide a better match to the experimental data, and (b) how to tune the coefficients to match points of ignition-extinction in the light-off hysteresis cycle.

40|$|DoctorThree-Way Catalysts (TWCs) {{containing}} noble metals such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh) {{have been}} commonly employed {{for reducing the}} emissions of air pollutants in the exhaust gas stream from conventional automotive gasoline engines. TWCs {{have been designed to}} simultaneously convert all three major air pollutants including CO, HC and NOx into CO 2, H 2 O and N 2 and are highly effective under the stoichiometric exhaust gas conditions. For the development and operation of the effective TWC, the fundamental reaction kinetics of TWC has been developed. Although a variety of kinetic models, including those of Voltz et al. and Subramaniam and Varma, have been developed to reduce the time and resources required for {{the development and implementation of}} catalytic converters with improved emission control performance, more accurate TWC reaction kinetics based on reliable reaction mechanism in realistic exhaust streams is needed to improve the emission performance prediction capability of catalytic converter models. In the present study, the detailed reaction kinetics based on reliable reaction mechanism has been established to predict the TWC performance under realistic feed stream conditions. On the basis of this effort, the monolith reactor models have been developed to simulate the performance of a modern three-way catalytic converter. In order to examine the catalytic activity under the realistic feed conditions, the TWC including Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce aged by an engine-dynamometer from 4 k to 100 k miles has been provided by GM. A molten-salt bath reactor system was designed and built to develop the steady-state reaction kinetics over the TWC under near-isothermal conditions. The Pd catalyst was effective for removing CO and C 3 H 6 at low temperatures, while the Pt/Rh/Ce catalyst was most efficient for NO reduction attributed to Rh existed on the catalyst surface. The light-off temperatures (LOTsT 50) of the simultaneous oxidations of CO, C 3 H 6 and H 2, and NO reduction shifted to higher reaction temperatures as the catalyst mileage increased from 4 k to 100 k miles. As the catalyst mileage increased, the BET surface area and the metal dispersion of the catalyst decreased as determined by the catalyst characterization study. However, no alteration of the activity ranking has been observed in the order of H 2 ≒ NO > CO > C 3 H 6, regardless of the both Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce catalyst and their mileages. The promotional effects of water and hydrogen on the three-way catalytic activity were examined using in-situ surface FTIR for the oxidation reactions over the both Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce catalysts. Water improved the CO oxidation activity by the formation of reaction intermediate including carboxylate and carbonate. Hydrogen also promoted the CO oxidation reaction similar to water. In addition, the presence of H 2 in the feed stream containing NO significantly enhanced the TWC activity mainly due to the H-assisted dissociation reaction of NO. Moreover, a series of variable-composition experiments, in which the feed composition was systematically varied to elucidate the differences in the reactivity of CO, C 3 H 6 and H 2 toward O 2 or NO (partitioning experiment), were conducted to determine and verify the unified kinetic parameters for a given reaction between 300 and 450 oC. Also, by the isothermal experiments, the enhancement and inhibition of CO conversion activity have been examined as key components were added to and removed from the feed under a systematic steady-state isothermal reaction condition at 275 oC for 45 h. Based upon the variety of the kinetic results and the catalyst characterization, a detailed reaction kinetic model to predict the activity of the modern TWC has been developed by incorporating all the important reactions on the basis of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The enhancement effects of H 2 O and H 2 on the oxidation reactions and H-assisted NO dissociation reaction have been included in the kinetic model. In particular, the secondary reactions such as NH 3 oxidation and NH 3 -SCR reactions were also considered for predicting N 2 O and NH 3 as the reaction byproducts formed over the both Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce catalysts. The model predictions adequately describe the general trend of the measured conversions of CO, C 3 H 6, NO and H 2. N 2 O and NH 3 formed during the TWC reaction can also be predicted by the model developed in the present study. Moreover, the decrease in activity of the 100 k mile-aged catalyst can be well described by decreasing the frequency factors of the rate constants estimated for their 4 k mile-aged counterparts, without alteration of the activation energies and the adsorption equilibrium constants estimated under the realistic full feed conditions. The resulting detailed reaction kinetics developed using the powder samples was incorporated into a monolith reactor model to simulate the performance of a commercial modern TWC converter. The reactor model directly employed the kinetic parameters estimated from the present reaction kinetic study without any parameter adjustment. Initially, a one-dimensional (1 D) reactor model developed based on the mass balance for the bulk gas phase and the <b>washcoat</b> <b>layer</b> within the monolith channels was used to predict species concentrations as a function of the average reactor temperature along the monolith reactor length. However, the model was not capable of describing the catalytic performance of the both Pd and Pt/Rh/Ce monolith reactors. To resolve the drawback of the 1 D model, a 2 D non-isothermal reactor model has been developed to more accurately predict the conversion performance and thermal behavior of the catalytic monolith. The 2 D model with the both heat and mass transfers and detailed reaction kinetics well describe the TWC performance, including the gas compositions and the temperature distribution as a function of both axial and radial positions for the single-bed monolith containing either Pd or Pt/Rh/Ce catalyst as well as the dual-bed monolith system including both Pd (front) and Pt/Rh/Ce (rear) catalysts. The model was further validated by predicting the TWC performance of the dual-bed reactor under the steady-state sweep test (st-ST) conditions (A/F= 14. 23 ~ 15. 03) ...|$|E
