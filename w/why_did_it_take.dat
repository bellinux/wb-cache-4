50|$|An {{interesting}} fact is {{that the}} original wiki software was created in 1995, but it took at least another six years for large wiki-based collaborative projects to appear. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> so long? One explanation is that the original wiki software lacked a selection operation and hence couldn't effectively support content evolution. The addition of revision history and the rise of large wiki-supported communities coincide in time. From an evolutionary computation point of view, this is not surprising: without a selection operation the content would undergo an aimless genetic drift and would unlikely to be useful to anyone. That is what many people expected from Wikipedia at its inception. However, with a selection operation, the utility of content has a tendency to improve over time as beneficial changes accumulate. This is what actually happens on a large scale in Wikipedia.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cessation}} of further diversification {{can be attributed}} to developmental constraints, but <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> so long for leaves to evolve in the first place? Plants had been on the land for at least 50 million years before megaphylls became significant. However, small, rare mesophylls are known from the early Devonian genus Eophyllophyton - so development could not have been a barrier to their appearance. The best explanation so far incorporates observations that atmospheric [...] was declining rapidly during this time - falling by around 90% during the Devonian. This corresponded with an increase in stomatal density by 100 times. Stomata allow water to evaporate from leaves, which causes them to curve. It appears that the low stomatal density in the early Devonian meant that evaporation was limited, and leaves would overheat if they grew to any size. The stomatal density could not increase, as the primitive steles and limited root systems {{would not be able to}} supply water quickly enough to match the rate of transpiration.|$|E

We analyze the download latency for pages {{for a variety of}} situations, in which Web browser and server are both within the same country as well as in different countries. Our study examines several sources of latency in accessing Web pages: DNS, TCP, the Web server itself, and the network links and routers. We divide the total download time into four parts: DNS query, connection setup time, time to get the first byte of a Web page, and downloading time. In most cases, roughly half of the time is spent from the moment the browser sends the acknowledgement completing the TCP connection establishment until the first packet containing page content arrives. The bulk of this time is the round trip delay, and only a tiny portion is delay at the server. This implies that the bottleneck in accessing pages over the Internet is due to the Internet itself, and not the server speed (as suggested by another study). The second bottleneck is the 3 -way TCP connection establishment (consuming 1 / 5 to 1 / 4 of the delay). Conclusions are drawn on how to decrease latency...|$|R

Existing data cannot distinguish whether this (1) reflects surprisingly late changes in sensory processing (sensory integration mechanisms in the brain are still developing) or (2) depends on post-perceptual changes (integration in sensory cortex is adult-like, but higher-level decision processes do not access the information) [10].

Similarly, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> us 60 years to discover the conceptually intriguing and easily derivable physical phenomenon of ‘quantum teleportation’? We claim that the quantum mechanical formalism doesn’t support our intuition, nor does it elucidate the key concepts that govern the behaviour of the entities that are subject to the laws of quantum physics. The arrays of complex numbers are kin to the arrays of 0 s and 1 s of the early days of computer programming practice. Using a technical term from computer science, the quantum mechanical formalism is ‘low-level’. In this review we present steps towards a diagrammatic ‘high-level ’ alternative for the Hilbert space formalism, one which appeals to our intuition. The diagrammatic language as it currently stands allows for intuitive reasoning about interacting quantum systems, and trivialises many otherwise involved and tedious computations. It clearly exposes limitations such as the no-cloning theorem, and phenomena such as quantum teleportation. As a logic, it supports ‘automation’: it enables a (classical) computer to reason about interacting quantum systems, prove theorems, and design protocols. It allows for a wider variety of underlying theories, and can be easily modified, having the potential to provide the required step-stone towards a deeper conceptual understanding of quantum theory, as well as it...|$|E
