5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, 2001, with {{consideration}} of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> be decreased.|$|E
5|$|I think everybody's enjoyed {{doing their}} own thing. Sharon and Caroline are young mothers, they have young children. Our {{mother and father}} were really were great parents and they hope to be as good a mother as mine, but Sharon's making her own record and <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> release it at some point. But we (the band) never finished, we'll keep it open.|$|E
5|$|Germany won {{the most}} medals with 18 medals and seven golds. Men's canoe's overall winner was Russia with seven medals (one gold, five silver and one bronze). In men's kayak, {{the big winner}} was Germany with five medals (three golds, one silver and one bronze). Hungary won medals in all nine events of women's kayak. Athlete {{comments}} ranged from disgust over the format adjustment made to the canoe sprint program for the 2012 Summer Olympics to not being upset at all. Paddleability's success at these championships <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> push for inclusion into future Paralympic level events.|$|E

5|$|At {{the closing}} ceremonies of the championships, FIS President Kasper {{expressed}} great {{satisfaction with the}} championships, stating {{that it was the}} first time that a nation without any successful national favorites (The Czech won only one medal, a silver by Bauer in the men's 15km) had organized such a successful championship. According to Kasper, attendance reached between 180,000 and 200,000 in the 12 days of competition. The lack of snowfall concerns prior to the championships were more than made up for with continuous snowfall though that affected spectators and competitors alike. Praise was given by Kasper both to the venue managers and Czech TV for their efforts in their successful championships. 15 different nations reached the podium at the championships noted Kasper. Kasper also state the success of the women's ski jumping event <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> push the International Olympic Committee to include the event for the 2014 Games in Sochi with a possible team event as well. Concerning the Nordic combined 10km mass start, Kasper stated that the event will be thoroughly analyzed as part of an overall season assessment as part of the discipline's current overhaul. Finally, Kasper wished everyone the best and looked forward to seeing everyone at Oslo for the next Nordic World Ski Championships.|$|E
25|$|Bank Negara Malaysia for {{the time}} being, uses {{interest}} rate targeting. The Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is their policy instrument, and is used to guide the short term interbank rates which <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> influence inflation and economic growth.|$|E
25|$|Campo's blunder last Saturday was {{careless}} and costly. But {{few of the}} Australian {{players would}} be satisfied with their performances, including myself. Campo <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> learn by the mistake and the whole team, I am sure, will not only show the tremendous spirit in Australian rugby but will improve on individual performances when matched against the might of New Zealand in August.|$|E
50|$|If I win a title, I {{would use}} my crown to {{influence}} people to adopt their own advocacy. I {{want people to}} be passionate about it—something that is really close to their heart.

25|$|The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, {{directed}} by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the Tokyo University of Science, {{has developed an}} android head called Saya, which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in Yokohama, Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is working at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.|$|E
25|$|The growing {{ability of}} neuroscientists to {{manipulate}} neurons using methods from molecular biology {{in combination with}} optical tools depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioural assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. A combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented {{by the development of}} a robust theoretical predictive framework, <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> lead to a rational understanding of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon, like zolpidem, zopiclone, or eszopiclone, are all {{specific}} agonists at the benzodiazepine GABAA α1 sub-receptor site. It also modulates the GABAA sub-sites, α2 and α3, to {{a lesser}} degree. It has no statistical significance as an anticonvulsant. However, as a pyrazolopyrimidine, zaleplon {{has served as a}} novel chemical platform from which new anxiolytics <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> arise. Much like zolpidem, as an imidazopyridine and also a full agonist at the GABAA α1 sub-receptor site, has been reviewed considerably with some novel contributions. See also: alpidem.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} cloning a {{particular}} farm animal using SCNT is relatively {{the same for}} all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use. The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. This energy <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been recent {{technological}} developments that <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence. Some researchers have begun to use geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology. Brooker et al. utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of sub-Saharan Africa. By relating satellite derived environmental data with prevalence data from school-based surveys, {{they were able to}} create detailed prevalence maps. The study focused {{on a wide range of}} helminths, but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found. As compared to other helminths, hookworm is able to survive in much hotter conditions and was highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range. Hopefully this information along with more detailed prevalence maps can lead to more effective public health measures.|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 2015, the Lightning {{announced}} that forwards Mike Angelidis and Jonathan Marchessault {{had been placed}} on waivers {{for the purpose of}} assigning them to the Syracuse Crunch. Both forwards will have to go unclaimed on waivers for twenty four hours before they are officially assigned the Crunch. The Lightning also provided an update on injured backup goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. Today Vasilevskiy did an on ice work out goalie coach Frantz Jean, facing shots from close range. He is still on blood thinners, which is restricting him from facing shots in the left shoulder area. He has an appointment on October 21, which <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> clear him for a return to full practice. Vasilevskiy stated that he thinks he will need a few games in Syracuse on a conditioning assignment before he is ready to return to the lineup.|$|E

50|$|Another {{example is}} when {{geostationary}} communications satellites {{reach the end}} of their useful lives. Stewardship cessation <b>will</b> occur <b>hopefully</b> in a planned manner, where the operator will move the satellite to a somewhat higher orbit to minimise the risk that the satellite will be a collision hazard to other satellites in the geostationary arc (graveyard burn). Unplanned stewardship cessation will occur if telecommand access to the satellite's systems is cut off due to a failure, for instance in the telecommand receivers.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, the Siberian Tiger Project was founded, {{with the}} aim of {{providing}} a comprehensive picture of the ecology of the Amur tiger and the role of tigers in the Russian Far East through scientific studies. By capturing and outfitting tigers with radio collars, their social structure, land use patterns, food habits, reproduction, mortality patterns and their relation with other inhabitants of the ecosystem, including humans is studied. These data compilations <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> contribute toward minimizing poaching threats due to traditional hunting. The Siberian Tiger Project has been productive in increasing local capacity to address human-tiger conflict with a Tiger Response Team, part of the Russian government’s Inspection Tiger, which responds to all tiger-human conflicts; by continuing to enhance the large database on tiger ecology and conservation with the goal of creating a comprehensive Siberian tiger conservation plan; and training the next generation of Russian conservation biologists.|$|E

In her review of Inhumans: Attilan Rising #2, Emma Houxbois of The Rainbow Hub said, [...] "While [...] had a few chances to shine in the core Inhuman book, her reintroduction (complete with character redesign by Dave Johnson and strong line work by John Timms) packs a real punch. Soule's evolution of her powers and costume <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> also coincide with further opportunities later in the story to learn more about her views on the resistance and reasons for supporting Attilan – solidifying this version of Kamala as a comparatively matured hero forced to make difficult moral choices." ...|$|E
40|$|Age-related hearing {{impairment}} (ARHI), or presbycusis, {{is a complex}} disease with multifactorial etiology. It is the most prevalent sensory impairment in the elderly, and may have detrimental effects on {{their quality of life}} and psychological well-being. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give an overview of the current data on ARHI, focusing mainly on environmental agents and genetic predisposition in animal models and in humans. With improvement of our understanding of ARHI, treatment other than with amplification <b>will</b> be <b>hopefully</b> possible in the long term...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the Sapchari waterfall in the Khagrachari district of Bangladesh as an initiative for harnessing power from micro-hydro. It is found that with the head and flow rate available encircling the year, Sapchari waterfall should be sustainable for micro hydro power plant. The effect on the ecosystem of the area is very less, the ecotourism <b>will</b> increases <b>hopefully</b> and both the way of living and the living standard of this vicinity will be ameliorated after such installation...|$|R

500|$|Windows 10 Home is {{permanently}} set {{to download}} all updates automatically, including cumulative updates, security patches, and drivers, and users cannot individually select updates to install or not. Microsoft offers a diagnostic tool {{that can be}} used to hide updates and prevent them from being reinstalled, but only after they had been already installed, then uninstalled without rebooting the system. Tom Warren of The Verge felt that, given web browsers such as Google Chrome had already adopted such an automatic update system, such a requirement would help to keep all Windows10 devices secure, and felt that [...] "if you're used to family members calling you for technical support because they've failed to upgrade to the latest Windows service pack or some malware disabled Windows Update then those days <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> be over." ...|$|E
500|$|In her {{review of}} the anime's first episode, Meghan Sullivan of IGN praised the visuals and fight choreography, but felt that the story would be {{confusing}} to those not already familiar with the game. She finished by calling the episode [...] "a solid start to what <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> be a memorable anime". Michelle Nguyen of Geek.com, writing following the release of [...] "Sword and Shield", was generally positive about the anime, praising its characters despite her dislike {{for the lack of}} playable female characters in the game itself. Speaking about each episode, she found the first episode to be rather weak, and ranked [...] "Dogged Runner" [...] high for changing Prompto into a more complex character. Andrew Webster, writing for The Verge, said that the anime captured the game's mixture of humor and traditional role-playing story tropes, sharing Nguyen's praise for [...] "Dogged Runner", and saying that the anime made him more eager to play the game itself.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Chris Carabott {{rated the}} premiere 9/10, calling the [...] "peek {{into the life}} of The Others... {{exceptionally}} done" [...] and the non-appearance of the other survivors [...] "a smart move". Carabott also praised Jack's flashbacks, writing [...] "Previously, Jack has been written as the white knight and reluctant hero who everyone looked to in their time of need. The more chinks they show in Jack's armor, the better - the more human he becomes." [...] He called [...] "Juliet... a promising new character who <b>will</b> <b>hopefully</b> add a new dimension to The Others this season" [...] and concluded his review by calling the episode [...] "a solid season opener". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised the opening scene and called the episode [...] "a fine start for a great series" [...] but with reservations. Bianco wished Jack would [...] "win one again for the team", and was fearful that Lost could eventually become like Alias, [...] "a series that became so entranced by its puzzle and its villains that it let the main characters vanish behind them".|$|E
