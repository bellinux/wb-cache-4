5|$|Jonny Santos, who is {{best known}} as the vocalist and {{songwriter}} for the Grammy Award nominated industrial metal group Spineshank was displeased with the direction the band was going in and felt it had 'run its course'. Santos felt it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on and left Spineshank, although he was unsure what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost everything and was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.|$|E
5|$|The rise of African {{nationalism}} {{generated a}} white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right-wing Rhodesian Front winning the December 1962 general election. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. Mugabe met with colleagues at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> towards armed resistance. Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in Dar es Salaam. He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the Tanganyikan city. There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, Julius Nyerere, who also dismissed {{the idea of a}} government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself.|$|E
5|$|The British {{garrison}} at Diego Garcia {{had not yet}} {{learned of}} the state of war between Britain and Germany, and so treated Emden to a warm reception. She remained there until 10 October, during which time her bottom was cleaned of fouling. She then resumed searching for merchant ships in the area west of Colombo. While operating there, Emden picked up Hampshires wireless signals again, and so departed for the Chagos Archipelago on 13 October. Meanwhile, the British had captured Markomannia on 12 October, depriving Emden of one of her colliers. On 15 October, Emden captured a British steamer off Minikoi and sank her the next day. Over the next five days, she captured five more vessels; one was used as a collier, three were sunk, and the fifth was sent to port with the crews of the other vessels. On 20 October, Müller decided it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to a new area of operations.|$|E

25|$|It {{is likely}} that in September 1774, Dawes was {{instrumental}} in helping Boston's militia artillery company secure its four small cannons from British army control. The Massachusetts Provincial Congress certainly sent word to him in February 1775 that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> two of those weapons out of Boston.|$|E
25|$|The {{interlocutor}} {{was responsible}} for beginning and ending each segment of the show. To this end, {{he had to be}} able to gauge the mood of the audience and know when it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on. Accordingly, the actor who played the role was paid very well in comparison to other non-featured performers.|$|E
25|$|Rustin {{believed}} that the African-American community needed to change its political strategy, building and strengthening a political alliance with predominately white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.) to pursue a common economic agenda. He wrote that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from protest to politics. Rustin's analysis of the economic problems of the Black community was widely influential.|$|E

He said, [...] "I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Emmerdale but feel it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on". Speaking about his decision to quit the show, Farrington said: [...] "I originally came to 'Emmerdale' for just six months and I have ended up staying for three years.

25|$|Eugene Nagel {{became aware}} of Pantridge's work in 1967. He {{believed}} that the physician-staffed model of prehospital care {{was not going to}} work for the United States in general or for Miami in particular. Physicians were too expensive to sit around fire stations waiting for calls, and if they had to be picked up in hospitals, it would take too long to arrive at the scene. When Nagel or his colleague James Hirschman, rode on the ambulance themselves they could, of course, defibrillate and provide medications, but they could not be present on all shifts. Nagel became convinced it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from a program using physicians to one staffed by paramedics.|$|E
25|$|General Morgan and his 2,460 handpicked Confederate cavalrymen, {{along with}} 4 {{artillery}} pieces, departed from Sparta, Tennessee, on June 11, 1863, intending {{to divert the}} attention of the Union Army of the Ohio from Southern forces in the state and possibly stir up pro-southern sentiments in the North. Gen. Braxton Bragg, the regional Confederate commander, had intended for Morgan's cavalrymen to provide a distraction by entering Kentucky. Morgan, however, confided to some of his officers that he had long desired to invade Indiana and Ohio to bring the terror of war to the North. Bragg had given him carte blanche to ride throughout Tennessee and Kentucky, but ordered him to under no circumstances cross the Ohio River. On June 23, the Federal Army of the Cumberland began its operations against General Bragg's Confederate Army of Tennessee in {{what became known as the}} Tullahoma Campaign, and Morgan decided it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> northward into Kentucky.|$|E

These specialists {{should be able to}} deal with cancer patients, approach oncological diseases, promote the development of radiopharmacy, understand the biology of radionuclide treatment, apply radionuclide treatments and be able to use molecular imaging such as PET/CT and SPECT/CT for treatment planning and dosimetry. It is mandatory for such specialists to be familiar with different oncologic therapies such as chemotherapy or immune therapy for better collaboration with all other specialties dealing with the treatment of cancer patients, including surgery, oncology, urology, gynaecology, paediatrics and pathology.|$|R

500|$|After {{eight seasons}} in Washington, Stevens felt it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on. The St. Louis Blues courted him {{and offered a}} {{four-year}} deal worth $5.145 million. [...] Since he was a restricted free agent, Washington had the option to match the offer sheet; they declined, however, and received two first round picks plus $100,000 in cash, turning into five first-round picks if the Capitals {{did not have a}} top-7 draft pick in the 1991 or 1992 entry drafts, as compensation (two of these picks would become Sergei Gonchar and Brendan Witt).|$|E

Later that same year, she received her third and final Academy Award nomination for Sudden Fear for RKO Radio Pictures. In 1953, she appeared in her final film for MGM, Torch Song.

500|$|By 2003, guitarist Dimebag Darrell {{and drummer}} Vinnie Paul Abbott were not {{pleased with the}} {{difficulties}} heavy metal band Pantera was experiencing. Abbott described the performance level of Pantera's vocalist, Phil Anselmo, as [...] "hit and miss, depending on what type of chemicals he was on." [...] Following the release of Pantera's 2000 album Reinventing the Steel, Anselmo and bassist Rex Brown started to focus on their side projects and did not discuss or record any further Pantera material, while Darrell and Vinnie wanted to continue to write and play music. They thought it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on and, upon disbanding Pantera, began writing new material.|$|E

500|$|He {{was made}} club captain {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season, and {{continued}} to play regularly during {{the early months of}} the new campaign. He opened his goalscoring account courtesy of free-kick in a 3–3 home draw against Stockport County in October 2012. Shortly after, Nutter admitted that his family struggled relocating to Lincolnshire, and a move down south was a much more suitable location given his personal circumstances. He scored three times in 66 appearances for Lincoln. On his time at Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "Lincoln is a really nice, friendly club with very patient and loyal supporters.

500|$|After being {{replaced}} as starter {{for the final}} three playoff games, Roberto Luongo stated {{he would be willing}} to waive his no-trade clause if asked.

He indicated that he would have no issues returning to the Canucks. Gillis further stated that although he had received several [...] "strong" [...] offers, the Canucks were not having a [...] "fire sale" [...] for Luongo. Doug MacLean on Sportsnet's Hockey Central reported that a deal was in place to send Luongo to the Toronto Maple Leafs. However, Luongo, believing the Florida Panthers, his preferred destination, were going to make a deal for him, refused to waive his no trade clause. Luongo later stated that he never turned down a trade.|$|E

500|$|Simon Leng {{identifies}} a thematic {{link between}} it and other songs in the Harrison canon, notably [...] "See Yourself", from Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976). Leng rates [...] "Run of the Mill" [...] "one of his most successful" [...] compositions, through its acknowledgment that human relationships are [...] "the {{other side of the}} coin" [...] from the spiritual search represented in [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and [...] "Hear Me Lord". Ian Inglis writes that [...] "Its rolling melody and warm vocals give it the texture of a love song, which, of course, it is: a love song to the Beatles." [...] In his book subtitled The Essential Songs of the Beatles' Solo Careers, Andrew Grant Jackson concludes of [...] "Run of the Mill": [...] "Such personal musings would be irrelevant to anyone but the biggest Beatle fans if Harrison hadn't so artfully written the words to be open-ended and applicable to anyone … A touching work of maturity by a little brother who saw more clearly than the others, realizing that he loved them but it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 1996, Clinton {{signed into}} law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines {{marriage}} for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman, allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA [...] "was a political decision that they made {{at the time of}} a re-election". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to [...] "head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states", a possibility he described as highly likely {{in the context of a}} [...] "very reactionary Congress". Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, [...] "the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on and get the president re-elected." [...] Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something [...] "which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that". Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims [...] "historic revisionism". In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, [...] "The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments." [...] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 2009, Digital Spy {{conducted}} a poll asking {{if it was}} [...] "time to move on" [...] from Ianto. However, a week later the website did not immediately publish the results, announcing [...] "unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll {{was the subject of}} a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome". Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans [...] "suggests the answer to the question 'Have people overreacted to Ianto's death?' is quite obvious". Later, a footnote amendment noted that 31.4% said it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on, [...] "while the remainder demanded RTD's head on a plate", a reference to his own wording of the original poll, which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto, or the executive producer's head on a plate. James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as [...] "sickening" [...] and quoted [...] "crazed" [...] fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers. Gareth David-Lloyd stated he was very disappointed in those fans, whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called [...] "completely unacceptable". David-Lloyd added that he [...] "would hope the writers would be able to ignore comments like that". A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article, and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy. In their comments, fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the [...] "ill-conceived, knee-jerk reactions" [...] of a few individuals, and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back, which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show's actors and writers. Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists, and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism, described as [...] "thousands of fans who are raising money for charity, sending polite letters, and doing what we can to be supportive of the character and actor". In 2010, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could: [...] "Not reversing it. Stop asking." [...] In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay, 70% of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one, with 19% responding [...] "indifferent" [...] and only 11% stating that it had been the wrong decision, contrasting with the initial fan response. In response to a question, Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the [...] "scary" [...] fan reaction, maintaining that [...] "a universe in which fictional characters aren't 'allowed' to die is ridiculous and limiting".|$|E
