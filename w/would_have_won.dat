5|$|Boston College (ACC: 3–3) {{could travel}} to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland. Boston College {{eventually}} did just that, and lost to Virginia Tech in the 2008 ACC Championship Game. Florida State (ACC: 4–3) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the Atlantic Division if they beat Maryland, Maryland beat Boston College, and Boston College beat Wake Forest. Under those circumstances, Florida State would have finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to Boston College, which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4–3) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the division if they won their last game against Boston College, and both Florida State and Boston College beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State and Wake Forest would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), and Wake Forest <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|Freedberg and Baron observe spirochetes in autopsies. Freedberg {{abandons}} his research, however, {{after his}} boss advises {{him to move}} to another subject. In 2005, Marshall speculates that Freedberg <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the Nobel Prize in 1951 had he continued his work.|$|E
5|$|Thomas F. Wilson {{was cast}} as Biff Tannen because the {{producers}} {{felt that the}} original choice, J. J. Cohen, wasn't physically imposing enough to bully Stoltz. Cohen was recast as Skinhead, one of Biff's cohorts. Had Fox been cast from the beginning, Cohen probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the part because he was sufficiently taller than Fox.|$|E
50|$|In Week 3 of the 1990 season, the Steelers {{would visit}} the Raiders and get beat 21-3. Both teams <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>winning</b> records (Raiders 12-4, Steelers 9-7) but the Steelers sat {{out of the}} playoffs while the Raiders made {{a trip to the}} AFC Championship only to see {{themselves}} get knocked out by the Bills.|$|R
50|$|For {{him to win}} his bet, Miami <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>win</b> {{the game}} by 4 points or more.|$|R
60|$|Almanz. Then fate commodiously for me has done; To lose mine {{there where}} I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it <b>won.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> a majority in the Electoral College.|$|E
5|$|England {{were largely}} the better team and, {{if not for}} the {{resilient}} batting of Chanderpaul, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> by an even larger margin. The West Indies suffered greatly from his absence in the second Test, losing the match by an innings and 283 runs, their biggest defeat in Test history. England retained the Wisden trophy at Old Trafford by taking an unbeatable 2–0 lead, They ultimately won the series 3–0.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Mortimer {{applied to}} switch to the Netherlands {{national}} team; since her mother is from that country, she has dual citizenship. In June 2014, the Hamilton Spectator reported the change. Although day-to-day funding in the Netherlands {{is similar to that}} in Canada, the former offers prize money; in the 2012 Paralympics, Mortimer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> $60,000 for her gold medals alone. She will train in Amersfoort.|$|E
50|$|If Collingwood <b>had</b> <b>won</b> this match, Essendon <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had {{the right}} to {{challenge}} Collingwood to a rematch for the premiership on the following weekend, because Essendon was the minor premier. The winner of that match <b>would</b> then <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the premiership.|$|R
50|$|And if a bettor took Oklahoma City, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>win</b> {{outright}} or lose by {{less than}} 3 points.|$|R
50|$|If Carlton <b>had</b> <b>won</b> this match, Fitzroy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had {{the right}} to {{challenge}} Carlton to a rematch for the premiership on the following weekend, because Fitzroy had {{the best record in the}} league. The winner of that match <b>would</b> then <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the premiership.|$|R
5|$|On November 22, Kemp came {{in second}} to Ryan Braun in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award. Later, it was {{revealed}} that Braun had tested positive for elevated testosterone and baseball attempted to suspend him, but lost on appeal. A survey of baseball writers revealed that if the MVP vote was retaken, with knowledge of Braun's positive test, then Kemp <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won.</b> Braun was eventually suspended as part of the Biogenesis scandal. Kemp publicly stated that he believed Braun should be stripped of his MVP Award from that season.|$|E
5|$|Out of four Men's Chess Olympiads, Fischer scored +40−7=18, for 49/65: 75.4%. In 1966, Fischer {{narrowly}} {{missed the}} individual gold medal, scoring 88.23% to World Champion Tigran Petrosian's 88.46%, {{even though he}} played four games more than Petrosian, faced stiffer opposition, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the gold if he had accepted Florin Gheorghiu's draw offer, rather than declining it and suffering his only loss.|$|E
5|$|Using MVP voting results, {{historical}} {{surveys and}} sabermetric analysis, historian Bill Deane projected in 1989 that Pierce <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the American League Cy Young Award in 1953 and 1956 {{if it had}} been given at the time; the award was not created until 1956 (when the National League's Don Newcombe won the award by unanimous vote), and awards were not given for both leagues until 1967. In 1988, baseball historian and statistician Bill James chose Pierce as having had the tenth greatest career value among left-handers, ahead of six Hall of Famers.|$|E
50|$|This {{season was}} played under the amended Argus system. If Richmond <b>had</b> <b>won</b> this match, Collingwood <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{had the right}} to {{challenge}} Richmond to a rematch for the premiership on the following weekend, because Collingwood was the minor premier. The winner of that match <b>would</b> then <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the premiership.|$|R
50|$|In Week 2 of the 2002 season, the Raiders {{visited the}} Steelers and won 30-17. Both teams <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>winning</b> records (Raiders 11-5, Steelers 10-5-1) and {{possession}} of the 1st and 3rd seeds of the playoffs and win their divisions. Despite this, neither team played {{each other in the}} postseason as the Steelers were eventually knocked out by the Titans while the Raiders went on to lose against the Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII.|$|R
50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that, had the judges not been {{introduced}} (and thus only the televote been used), Poland <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the competition by 31 points.|$|R
5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he would often hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as rushing {{into the locker room}} and locking his teammates out in the cold while taking a long shower. Although Payton <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of losing her match against her father, Stephanie McMahon {{was forced to resign}} as SmackDown! General Manager. On the SmackDown {{following}} No Mercy, Vince McMahon announced Paul Heyman as the new General Manager. Heyman booked a Handicap match, in which the Undertaker faced Brock Lesnar and the Big Show. Heyman stated that should Undertaker win, he could face anyone he wished at Survivor Series. During the match, there were several opportunities in which the Undertaker <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the match, but Heyman restarted the contest three times. The Undertaker did, however, win the contest, and announced he wanted a Buried Alive match against Vince McMahon. McMahon would go on to win the match with the aid of the Undertaker's half-brother Kane.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Whitlam {{was seen as}} a {{leadership}} contender once the existing Labor leaders exited the scene. Most of the party's major figures, including Evatt, Deputy Leader Arthur Calwell, Eddie Ward, and Reg Pollard, were in their sixties, twenty years older than Whitlam. In 1960, after losing three elections, Evatt resigned and was replaced by Calwell, with Whitlam defeating Ward for deputy leader. Calwell came within a handful of votes of winning the cliffhanger 1961 election. He had not wanted Whitlam as deputy leader, and believed Labor <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> if Ward had been in the position.|$|E
50|$|From 2003 until O'Shea's {{departure}} in 2008, Ohio <b>would</b> <b>have</b> five-straight <b>winning</b> {{seasons with}} at least 19 wins each season. O'Shea was 120-95 in eight seasons in charge.|$|R
50|$|Bungee Jumping: Alaina jumped, but talked Ann-Maree and Crystal-Rose into not jumping, costing $1,000 {{directly}} {{and a potential}} of another $4,000 that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>won</b> if everyone jumped.|$|R
50|$|All American {{shooters}} {{finished in}} top ten position. An individual event <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>won</b> by Morris Fisher followed up by Walter Stokes and the Swedish shooter Hugo Johansson.|$|R
5|$|Cardiff City {{began their}} {{campaign}} for the 1926–27 FA Cup with a home game at Ninian Park in front of around 30,000 fans against Aston Villa. After a goalless first half, Cardiff scored twice via a header by Len Davies and a shot by Ernie Curtis. Aston Villa attempted to save the match, but were unable to score until goalkeeper Tom Farquharson scored an own goal after turning in a shot by Villa forward Arthur Dorrell. In the fourth round, Cardiff played Darlington away. Newspaper reports {{indicated that they were}} the better team, but {{had it not been for}} the success of Darlington's defence then they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> by greater than the two goal margin they achieved. Goals came from George McLachlan and Hughie Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen {{then went}} on to finish second in the Biel Grandmaster Tournament, with 18 points, just one point behind Wang Hao using the 3–1–0 scoring system. As in the Tal Memorial earlier in 2012, Carlsen managed to finish the tournament without any losses (+4−0=6). He also {{defeated}} the winner Wang in both of their individual games. In the exhibition blitz tournament at Biel before the GM tournament, Carlsen was eliminated (+1−2=0) in the first round by Étienne Bacrot. Bacrot deprived Carlsen of a win in the classical tournament by holding him to a draw in the final round. Carlsen <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the classical tournament on the traditional 1–½–0 scoring system, with 7/10.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the World Junior Hockey Championship was a {{round robin}} tournament. The teams {{with the top}} three records won the gold, silver and bronze medals. Finland had {{finished}} their schedule with a 5–1–1 record to lead the tournament. Canada entered {{the game with a}} 4–1–1 record, and had already been assured the bronze medal. A victory against the Soviets would have guaranteed Canada the silver, and a victory by more than four goals <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the gold medal. The Soviet Union, entering the game with a 2–3–1 record, had already been eliminated from medal contention. The match-up between the two squads was deliberately scheduled to be the final game of the tournament as organizers expected {{at least one of the}} teams would be playing for the gold medal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the wider}} definition, 2899 {{of the votes}} for {{candidate}} A are wasted, since A <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>won</b> with only 3101 votes. Therefore, 6700 out of 9801 votes are wasted.|$|R
5000|$|... 399 {{votes for}} A, since A <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>won</b> eight seats with only 5601 votes against 3100 and 701. (With 5600 votes for A, the last seat {{would go to}} C).|$|R
50|$|Had goal {{difference}} {{been the}} deciding factor as it was from 1977 onwards, Arsenal <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>won</b> with +33 to Preston's +25, unlike in 1989 when they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> finished second on goal average. Preston had last been champions in 1890, the second season of the Football League.|$|R
5|$|In the end, Carter won the election, {{receiving}} 50.1% of {{the popular}} vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford. The election was close enough that had fewer than 25,000 votes shifted in Ohio and Wisconsin – both of which neighbored his home state – Ford <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the electoral vote with 276 votes to 261 for Carter. Though he lost, in the three months between the Republican National Convention and the election Ford had managed to close what was once an alleged 33-point Carter lead to a 2-point margin. Ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by Carter.|$|E
5|$|Maryland (ACC: 4–2) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the {{division}} title {{if they had}} either: (1) beaten both Florida State and Boston College; (2) beaten Florida State, while Boston College lost to Wake Forest; or (3) beaten Boston College, while Boston College lost to Wake Forest. That last scenario would have caused a three-way tie between Maryland, Florida State, and Wake Forest. All would have possessed a 5–3 conference record, and no head-to-head tiebreaker would have been possible. In that case, the winner would have been decided by divisional record, of which the Terrapins {{would have had the}} best (ACC Atlantic: 4–1).|$|E
5|$|Musial {{finished}} the 1948 season leading {{the major leagues}} in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702). Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became {{the first player to}} win three NL MVP awards. If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>won</b> the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.|$|E
5000|$|While the August-1975 draw {{against the}} Junior All Blacks in Wellington was a {{surprise}} to the rugby world, the New Zealand experts surmised that, [...] "The Romanians <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>won</b> <b>had</b> they trusted their running rather than their kicking.|$|R
5000|$|According to Richard Bath 2007:"Munro... <b>would</b> <b>have</b> surely <b>won</b> {{many more}} caps {{but for a}} horrendous leg injury. He has made great strides as a coach and is {{currently}} assistant to Sean Lineen at Glasgow." ...|$|R
50|$|In Gaspard's fourth year, {{his team}} would finish the season 35-28 (14-15 SEC). His team <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wins</b> against then ranked #2 LSU, #1 Vanderbilt and #9 Arkansas. In the 2013 Southeastern Conference Tournament they would beat Auburn 6-3, lose to LSU 3-0, beat Ole Miss 7-5, {{and in the}} quarterfinals they would lose a heartbreaker to LSU 3-2. They would get an {{invitation}} {{to play in the}} 2013 NCAA Baseball Tournament. They would go 1-2 and lose to Troy 9-8 in the semifinals. On May, 30 Mitch Gaspard resigned as Alabama's baseball coach.|$|R
