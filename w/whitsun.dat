5|$|The Games {{took place}} on the Thursday and Friday of the week of <b>Whitsun,</b> {{normally}} between mid-May and mid-June. Many 17th-century Puritans disapproved of such festivities, believing them to be of pagan origin, and they particularly disapproved of any celebration on a Sunday or a church holiday such as <b>Whitsun.</b> By the time of King James's death in 1625, many Puritan landowners had forbidden their workers to attend such festivities; the increasing tensions between the supporters of the king and the Puritans resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, bringing the Games to an end.|$|E
5|$|The railway proved very popular, {{and over}} the Bank Holiday weekend carried 20,000passengers. As it relied on the tourist trade for business, it closed {{at the end of}} September. Throughout the 1937, 1938, and 1939 seasons the railway {{operated}} between <b>Whitsun</b> and the end of September each year, closing for the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions of Imogen as a {{small child}} {{indicate}} that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, {{at the age of}} five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Holidays were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual <b>Whitsun</b> Festival in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 {{hoping to}} study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was {{rejected}} as probably lacking the stamina for a dancing career. While studying at home under a governess for six months, at <b>Whitsun</b> 1921 she took {{part as a}} dancer in a production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Dioclesian, a version largely devised by Joseph.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, in {{the wake}} of the {{publication}} of The <b>Whitsun</b> Weddings, Larkin was the subject of an episode of the arts programme Monitor, directed by Patrick Garland. The programme, which shows him being interviewed by fellow poet John Betjeman in a series of locations in and around Hull, allowed Larkin to play a significant part in the creation of his own public persona; one he would prefer his readers to imagine.|$|E
5|$|John {{was one of}} {{the bishops}} that sided with King William against Anselm of Canterbury at the king's <b>Whitsun</b> council in 1097, one of early councils called during the Investiture Controversy in England. During the reign of King Henry I, who succeeded his brother King William in 1100, John along with Robert Bloet, the Bishop of Lincoln, consecrated abbots who had been {{invested}} in office by the king. John attended Anselm's reforming Council of London in 1102, which debated and passed decrees to reform the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Following Samuel Aba's death, Emperor Henry entered Székesfehérvár and {{restored}} Peter. Peter introduced Bavarian law in his realm, {{which suggests that}} Hungary became an imperial fief. He accepted the Emperor's suzerainty on <b>Whitsun</b> 1045, giving his royal lance to his overlord (who returned to Hungary). A number of plots to overthrow Peter indicate that he remained unpopular. Two of King Stephen I's maternal cousins (Bolya and Bonyha) conspired against Peter in 1045, but the King had them arrested, tortured and executed. Bishop Gerard of Csanád invited Vazul's exiled sons to the country. An uprising by pagan commoners ended Peter's second rule in 1046.|$|E
5|$|At <b>Whitsun</b> in 1189, Coutances was {{a member}} of a {{commission}} appointed by the papal legate John of Anagni to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, Richard, who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard's conflict stemmed from Richard's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. Richard and Philip insisted that Richard should be married to Philip's sister Alice, that Henry name Richard as Henry's heir, and that Richard's youngest brother John should go on crusade with Richard. Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor Richard would negotiate, even under the legate's threat of an interdict on France.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{appointed}} Lord Chancellor of England in 1085, and {{was present at}} William I's deathbed in 1087. He continued as Chancellor to William Rufus until 1092; what precipitated his loss of office is unclear. He retained the king's trust, for Rufus employed him in 1095 along with William Warelwast on a diplomatic mission to Pope Urban II regarding Archbishop Anselm receiving the pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority. Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the Antipope Clement III in return for Anselm's deposition and the delivery of Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody, to dispose of as he saw fit. The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by <b>Whitsun</b> with a papal legate, Walter the Cardinal Bishop of Albano, who had Anselm's pallium. The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm's deposition. Rufus resigned himself to Anselm's position as archbishop, and at the king's court at Windsor he consented to Anselm being given the pallium.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, the Marvell Press {{published}} Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived (Listen LPV1), an LP {{record on}} which Larkin recites all the poems from The Less Deceived {{in the order}} they appear in the printed volume. This was followed, in 1965, by Philip Larkin reads and comments on The <b>Whitsun</b> Weddings (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press's record label (though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again the poems are read in {{the order in which}} they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202). As with the two previous recordings, the sequencing of the poems is the same as in the printed volume.|$|E
5|$|There were {{professional}} {{musicians in}} the previous three generations of Holst's family {{and it was clear}} from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by neuritis in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher—a great one, according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at St Paul's Girls' School, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of <b>Whitsun</b> music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|At the {{succession}} of King Henry I, the new king imprisoned Ranulf in the Tower of London on 15 August 1100 on charges of embezzlement. His custodian, William de Mandeville, allowed the bishop to escape on 3 February 1101. Flambard {{was not only the}} first inmate of the prison, but also the first person to escape from it. A popular legend represents the bishop as descending from the window of his cell by a rope which friends had smuggled to him in a flagon of wine. Ranulf gave the wine to his guards, and after they were drunk and asleep, climbed down the rope to escape. His friends had arranged a ship to transport Ranulf, some of the bishop's treasure, and the bishop's elderly mother to Normandy. He took refuge across the English Channel with Henry's brother Robert Curthose, where {{he became one of the}} duke's principal advisors. King Henry dispossessed Ranulf of his lands at <b>Whitsun</b> in 1101, and the new Archbishop of York Gerard deposed him from his bishopric. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm arranged for Flambard's trial in a papal court for simony, and a papal decree was issued against Ranulf.|$|E
5|$|In early 1940 the Allies {{approved}} a naval campaign that was devised {{to seize the}} northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of Narvik, and possibly also to seize the iron mines at Gällivare in northern Sweden from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore. Since the Baltic freezes in winter, the iron ore was sent south by ship from Narvik at warmer times of the year. The Allies planned to begin by mining Norwegian waters, thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then the Allies planned to occupy much of the country. Unforeseen by the Allies, however, Germany had itself planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an invasion of Norway. German troops quickly overran much of the country. The Allies sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal. The Prime Minister's opponents decided to turn the adjournment debate for the <b>Whitsun</b> recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan. After initial anger, Chamberlain determined to fight.|$|E
5|$|The traditions {{established}} in the medieval period continued later. By {{the middle of the}} 15thcentury, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, <b>Whitsun,</b> All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of StEdward. A crown was also displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament. Around this time, three swords– symbols of kingship since ancient times– were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy. Another emerging item of state regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold, which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of HenryVIII in 1509; it would be added to the coronation regalia in the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Gerard became Archbishop of York in December 1100. No source {{mentions}} {{him being}} invested by the king, but as Anselm urged Pope Paschal II to give Gerard his pallium, {{which he would}} have been unlikely to do if Gerard had been invested by Henry, that possibility seems remote. At <b>Whitsun</b> in 1101 King Henry I, with Anselm's support, deprived Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, of the lands of the see of Durham, because Ranulf had defected to Henry's elder brother Robert Curthose, who also claimed the English throne. Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric. Soon after his translation to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long Canterbury–York dispute. At the 1102 Council of Westminster, Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm's. He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope, to whom he presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding investitures. The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced. Their claim was denied by Anselm's representatives and the pope, who excommunicated Gerard until he recanted.|$|E
5|$|Word of William's {{defeat at}} Gerberoi stirred up {{difficulties}} in northern England. In August and September 1079 King Malcolm of Scots raided {{south of the}} River Tweed, devastating the land between the River Tees and the Tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month. The lack of Norman response appears to have caused the Northumbrians to grow restive, and {{in the spring of}} 1080 they rebelled against the rule of Walcher, the Bishop of Durham and Earl of Northumbria. The bishop was killed on 14 May 1080, and William dispatched his half-brother Odo to deal with the rebellion. William departed Normandy in July 1080, and in the autumn William's son Robert was sent on a campaign against the Scots. Robert raided into Lothian and forced Malcolm to agree to terms, building a fortification at Newcastle-on-Tyne while returning to England. The king was at Gloucester for Christmas 1080 and at Winchester for <b>Whitsun</b> in 1081, ceremonially wearing his crown on both occasions. A papal embassy arrived in England during this period, asking that William do fealty for England to the papacy, a request that William rejected. William also visited Wales during 1081, although the English and the Welsh sources differ on the exact purpose of the visit. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that it was a military campaign, but Welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to St Davids in honour of Saint David. William's biographer David Bates argues that the former explanation is more likely, explaining that the balance of power had recently shifted in Wales and that William would have wished {{to take advantage of the}} changed circumstances to extend Norman power. By the end of 1081, William was back on the continent, dealing with disturbances in Maine. Although he led an expedition into Maine, the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal legate.|$|E
25|$|Luton Carnival, {{traditionally}} {{held on the}} <b>Whitsun</b> May bank holiday, is {{the largest}} one-day carnival in Europe.|$|E
25|$|This {{contains}} {{the office of}} the seasons of the Christian year (Advent to Trinity), a conception that only gradually grew up. There is here given the whole service for every Sunday and week-day, the proper antiphons, responsories, hymns, and especially the course of daily Scripture-reading, averaging about twenty verses a day, and (roughly) arranged thus: for Advent, Isaiah; Epiphany to Septuagesima, Pauline Epistles; Lent, patristic homilies (Genesis on Sundays); Passion-tide, Jeremiah; Easter to <b>Whitsun,</b> Acts, Catholic epistles and Apocalypse; <b>Whitsun</b> to August, Samuel and Kings; August to Advent, Wisdom books, Maccabees, Prophets.|$|E
25|$|From 2007 to 2011, Muti was the {{principal}} conductor at Salzburg's <b>Whitsun</b> Festival. He conducted productions of rare Italian operas from the 18th century, and concerts with his Luigi Cherubini Youth Orchestra.|$|E
25|$|With his {{literary}} {{figure of the}} Good-for-Nothing Eichendorff created the paradigm the wanderer. The motif itself had been central to romanticism since Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and Ludwig Tieck undertook their famous Pfingstwanderung (<b>Whitsun</b> excursion) in the Fichtelgebirge in 1793, an event that began the Romantic movement.|$|E
25|$|And {{the same}} day Margaret Cheney, ‘other wife to Bulmer called’, was drawn after them from the Tower of London into Smithfield, and there burned {{according}} to her judgment, God pardon her soul, being the Friday in <b>Whitsun</b> week; {{she was a very}} fair creature, and a beautiful.|$|E
25|$|The second palace fire in 1884 {{spared the}} church, {{as the fire}} was stopped in the {{buildings}} linking it to the palace. However, fate {{finally caught up with}} the church June 7, 1992. The church burned to the ground, probably set ablaze by fireworks set off during the <b>Whitsun</b> carnival.|$|E
25|$|Whit Friday is {{the name}} given to the first Friday after <b>Whitsun</b> in areas of {{northeast}} Cheshire, southeast Lancashire and the western fringes of Yorkshire. The day has a cultural significance in Stalybridge as the date on which the annual Whit Walks were traditionally held. It is also the day on which the traditional annual Whit Friday brass band contests are held.|$|E
25|$|And on the 25 day of May, {{being the}} Friday in <b>Whitsun</b> week, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Stephen Hamerton, knights, were hanged and headed; Nicholas Tempest, esquire; Doctor Cockerell, priest; Abbot quondam of Fountains; and Doctor Pickering, friar, {{were drawn from}} the Tower of London to Tyburn, and there hanged, bowelled and quartered, and their heads set on London Bridge and divers gates in London.|$|E
25|$|The {{destruction}} of this chief sally-port of the Wendish pirates enabled Absalon considerably {{to reduce the}} Danish fleet. But he continued to keep a watchful eye over the Baltic, and in 1170 destroyed another pirate stronghold, farther eastward, at Dziwnów on the isle of Wolin. Absalon's last military exploit came in 1184, off Stralsund at <b>Whitsun,</b> when he soundly defeated a Pomeranian fleet that had attacked Denmark's vassal, Jaromar of Rügen.|$|E
25|$|Buller {{was born}} in Wortley, Leeds, Yorkshire. As a player, he was a {{competent}} wicket-keeper and lower-order right-hand bat. He played for Worcestershire between 1935 and 1946, having played once for Yorkshire in 1930. In 1939, he was severely injured in the car crash that killed Worcestershire opening batsman Charlie Bull, on the Sunday evening of the <b>Whitsun</b> match with Essex, and missed {{the next two months}} of cricket.|$|E
25|$|In 1629, a large {{force of}} {{imperial}} troops {{moved through the}} town, to be followed in 1631 by troops of Lorraine. In 1634, Croatian soldiers plundered Lauffen and two days later the imperial forces returned. In November the last 16 head of cattle were confiscated. At Christmas 1634, Lauffen provided winter quarters for five transiting regiments. At <b>Whitsun</b> 1635, the Mühlheimische Kürassier-Regiment seized the entire winter crop, thus creating a famine which claimed 800 lives.|$|E
25|$|The Twenty20 {{competition}} was abandoned without a match played or a ball bowled in 2007 due to {{adverse weather conditions}} during the <b>Whitsun</b> weekend on which it was scheduled. In the main competition, the Rubies became {{the first team to}} win all their matches during the tournament to finish as winners. Both the leading batsman and bowler were drawn from the Rubies' side; Lydia Greenway's 233 runs led the competition, while the 19 wickets taken by Holly Colvin, at an average of 4.05, was 10 more than any other bowler managed.|$|E
25|$|In {{late spring}} 1166, Becket began to {{threaten}} the king with ecclesiastical punishments {{if he did not}} settle with him. Henry ignored the initial warning letters, but Becket's position was strengthened by the grant to Becket of the status of a papal legate to England, dated on 2 May 1166. On <b>Whitsun</b> 1166, Becket excommunicated a number of Henry's advisers and clerical servants, including John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, Richard de Lucy, and Jocelin de Balliol, among others. A bishop was also excommunicated, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury.|$|E
25|$|Coope made 20 and 58 in {{his first}} match, the <b>Whitsun</b> 1947 County Championship game against Gloucestershire. After this, he played {{regularly}} {{for the rest of}} the season and less than two months after making his debut, he scored 113, his first century and the highest score of his career, as Somerset beat the 1947 season's County Champions, Middlesex for the second time in the season – Middlesex were, however, lacking the prolific Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Jack Robertson, all of whom were playing in the Gentlemen v Players match. The century brought Coope his county cap.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} {{annulment}} was granted, Eleanor became {{engaged to}} the Duke of Normandy, who became King Henry II of England in 1154. Henry was her third cousin and eleven years younger. The couple married on <b>Whitsun,</b> 18 May 1152, eight weeks after the annulment of Eleanor's first marriage, in Poitiers Cathedral. Over the next thirteen years, she bore Henry eight children: five sons, three of whom became kings; and three daughters. However, Henry and Eleanor eventually became estranged. Henry imprisoned her in 1173 for supporting their son Henry's revolt against him. She was not released until 6 July 1189, when Henry died and their second son, Richard the Lionheart, ascended the throne.|$|E
25|$|Barnato {{first went}} motor racing in 1921, when after {{importing}} an eight-litre Locomobile from the United States, he signed-up to race at the Brooklands Easter meeting. Having come {{third in the}} 100-mile Long Handicap, he then swapped to a Calthorpe {{to compete in the}} following <b>Whitsun</b> meeting. For the 1922 season he bought a 1921 chassis Talbot directly from its owner/driver Malcolm Campbell, and for 1923 a Sir Alastair Miller customised-racing Wolseley Racing Moth. At the start of the 1924 season Barnato obtained an eight-litre Hispano-Suiza H6C chassis, which he commissioned Jarvis of Wimbledon to build a suitable racing body for. Barnato then established an eight-litre class racing record for the car.|$|E
25|$|A {{century after}} the 1871 Act, the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, which {{currently}} regulates bank holidays in the UK, was passed. The {{majority of the}} current bank holidays were specified in the 1971 Act: however New Year's Day and May Day were not introduced throughout {{the whole of the}} UK until 1974 and 1978 respectively. The date of the August bank holiday was changed from the first Monday in August to the last Monday in August, and the <b>Whitsun</b> bank holiday (Whit Monday) was replaced by the Late Spring Bank Holiday, fixed as the last Monday in May. In 1978 the first Monday in May {{in the rest of the}} UK, and the final Monday of May in Scotland, were designated as bank holidays.|$|E
25|$|Thirty years before, Henry III had deposed three claimants to the papacy, {{and thereby}} {{rendered}} an acknowledged {{service to the}} Church. When Henry IV tried to copy this procedure he was less successful, as he lacked {{the support of the}} people. In Germany there was a rapid and general feeling in favor of Gregory, and the princes took the opportunity to carry out their anti-regal policy under the cloak of respect for the papal decision. When at <b>Whitsun</b> the king proposed to discuss the measures to be taken against Gregory VII in a council of his nobles, only a few made their appearance; the Saxons snatched at the golden opportunity for renewing their rebellion, and the anti-royalist party grew in strength from month to month.|$|E
