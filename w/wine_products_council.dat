40|$|Product {{bundling}} is {{a widespread}} marketing strategy (Stremersch & Tellis, 2002; Yadav, 1994; Yadav & Monroe, 1993). Part of the attraction of a bundle is that the price {{is less than the}} sum of the prices for each of the products in the bundle. The strategy has been most recently used by large retailers in Australia, particularly liquor retailers who often bundle wine with other liquor products. However, there exists a paucity of research into consumer behaviour regarding <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundles. Hierarchical segmentation analysis via K-Mean cluster analysis was used to examine the nature of consumers’ perceptions of <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundles and commonalities among those consumers. Three clusters of <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundle consumers were identified.

40|$|PURPOSE – Researchers have {{investigated}} product bundles using convenient product categories, {{but there is}} little evidence that <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundles have been studied. Research is fundamental to producing <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundles that will benefit the wine industry rather than hurt it. This research forms an exploratory study as to whether a large scale segment of wine market is likely to be prone to deals that include product bundles. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – Personally administered quantitative questionnaire that pre-tested 25 respondents, with a full research sample of 262 valid responses. The survey was administered at 14 locales around the South Australian metropolitan and outer metropolitan areas. Respondents were filtered to include wine drinkers above the age of 18 years. FINDINGS – Segmentation analysis from the research describes three market segments which offer market intelligence to the wine industry. One wine consumer segment is particularly deal prone, and is also interested in promotions and discounts and purchasing bundles. This segment is predominately younger between the ages of 18 - 39. Other findings included a lack of <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundle awareness and results that indicated, alcohol consumers who did not consider wine to be the most important element in the bundle purchase, also consider the bundle including to be more convenient, better value for money, and were more likely to represent a purchase. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – The Australian wine industry is experiencing difficult economic conditions, low profitability, and consolidation of the retail industry is causing a loss of negotiating power. This research has the potential to provide the wine industry with market intelligence that may uncover a new buying wine consumer segment and provide small to medium wine companies (SME’s) the data to create <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundles that form a unique set of <b>wine</b> <b>products.</b> Christopher Matthews, Steve Goodman, Cullen Habel and Simon Somogy...|$|R

A tourism product club is a product development partnership established and led by the tourism industry stakeholders including small- and/or medium-sized companies. The group pools its resources to develop new marketready products or to increase the value of existing ones. Lodging companies, tour operators, administrators of tourism facilities, tourist associations, government, other companies of the sector and, even, nontourist companies can participate as members of a tourism product club. Following this model, wine tourism can contribute to create a <b>wine</b> tourism <b>product</b> club. In Spain the international promotion of tourist products is carried out through the Turespa&ntilde;a website. The <b>wine</b> tourism <b>product</b> club, The <b>Wine</b> Routes of Spain, is one of the <b>wine</b> tourism <b>product</b> clubs developed by the Spanish government. It is an ambitious project that began in 2001. Nevertheless, other Spanish regions have created more <b>wine</b> tourism <b>product</b> clubs in order to develop their own wine tourism industry such as &ldquo;Divinum vitae &ndash; Where the pleasues are born&rdquo; created in Castilla&ndash;La Mancha in 2006.

40|$|The study {{constructs}} {{a temporal}} model of wine tourist {{behavior on the}} basis of the social psychologist 2 ̆ 7 theory of consumer attitudes and related concepts with regard to past behavior, satisfaction, perceived value, and behavioral intentions. This study proposed that wine festival attendees 2 ̆ 7 intentions to revisit the festival would be affected by their satisfaction with, perceived value of, and past behavior regarding the festival. Past visits, satisfaction and intention to revisit resemble respectively the cognitive, affective and conative components conceptualized in the structural model of consumer attitudes. Perceived value was included to strengthen the measurement of satisfaction. Meanwhile, the model attempts to reflect the temporal nature of wine tourist experience by encompassing the stages of pre-visit, on-site visit and post-visit. More importantly, this study added two variables to this model of intentions to revisit by proposing that satisfaction and perceived value had impact on attendees 2 ̆ 7 intentions (1) to visit a local winery and (2) to buy local <b>wine</b> <b>products.</b> Using a path analysis approach and data collected from the attendees at a regional wine festival, the study examined the above relationships. The study also examined the possible mediating effects of demographic characteristics on the variables included in the hypothesized model. The results of this path analysis can be summarized as: (1) past visits influenced future intention to revisit and the level of perceived value but had no effect on levels of satisfaction; (2) perceived value strongly affected satisfaction; (3) satisfaction had an impact on future intentions to revisit, to visit local wineries, and to buy local <b>wine</b> <b>products,</b> while perceived value only affected the former two intentions; and (4) education had medicating effect on intentions to revisit the festival, to visit local wineries, and to buy local <b>wine</b> <b>products.</b> Age had mediating effect on intentions to visit local wineries and to buy local <b>wine</b> <b>products.</b> Income had a mediating effect on intention to revisit the festival. This research makes unique contributions to the area of consumer research in wine tourism from both the theoretical and empirical perspectives. It is believed that results of the present study will be useful to organizers of wine festivals and/or managers of wineries. ...|$|R
