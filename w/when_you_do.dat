500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> something with your heart, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E
500|$|Wenger apologised for his team’s behaviour: [...] "I feel {{we should}} not have reacted at all. Overall we are sorry for what happened. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not behave like you want to, then you have to apologise." [...] He had no regrets over his team {{selection}} and suggested {{it was part of the}} player's learning process. Wenger said of Walcott: [...] "…he had a very good performance and scored a great goal. That is good for us and good news for England." [...] Gilberto Silva described Arsenal’s defeat as a “sad memory” and wanted to use the loss to motivate the team for their coming matches.|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E

500|$|Barrowman {{spent his}} senior year shovelling coal for an Illinois power company. His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll know that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide what you want to do – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening of}} the episode, in which Bart rushes to do {{everything}} he planned on doing during summer vacation, was originally written and animated for the season fourteen episode [...] "I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can" [...] (2003) but was cut. This episode came in short, and to fill in time, the sequence was added. Burns has said commented the episode [...] "ended up being incredibly short because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> an episode where there's really just one good side of an argument , you don't fill out {{as much time as}} you need to." [...] The opening sequence features a large number of allusions to popular culture, including references to The Natural (1984 film), Happy Days (television sitcom), and Men in Black (1997 film).|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears {{said that}} she had plans to make her film debut. She and her team then created a concept for it, which was later {{developed}} by Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes. Spears commented that she [...] "talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it. It was my little project. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a movie, I {{think you have to be}} really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into." [...] A press conference was held during the Marché International du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale (MIDEM) in Cannes, France, on January 19, 2002, where Spears also premiered the film.|$|E

500|$|... "Steve Burdick" [...] {{scored a}} Nielsen rating of 9.7, equating to {{approximately}} 9.5 million viewers, and a 17 share, meaning that 17% of all television {{sets in use}} during its time period were tuned to the episode. NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} is that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it. And if you choose to do it anyway, you better count on losing money." ...|$|E
500|$|Francis {{characterized}} Genevieve as [...] "harsh", attesting {{this quality}} to her past tragedy. In {{an interview with}} AOL, Francis said that, [...] "Although tragic things have happened to her, she is not tragic." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described Genevieve as an [...] "eerie bitch". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described her as [...] "kooky" [...] and [...] "The Pervy-Odd Mob Mama". The soap opera's official website describes her relationship with Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) as [...] "twisted" [...] and [...] "confusing". Genevieve was considerably [...] "darker" [...] than the role of Laura Spencer on General Hospital, which Francis loved. She said, [...] "It's so freeing to let your dark side shine {{for a minute and}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a scene when you've been really evil, when the scene ends, you laugh. It's just fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Goode, {{a critic}} for Insight on the News, {{considered}} the piece {{to be the}} beginning of the Pop Art movement, labeling the work [...] "a sign of things to come as other artists tackled common yet sacrosanct items, including the American flag". Lichtenstein, reflecting on his work, told reporters, [...] "The idea of counterfeiting money always occurs to you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> lithography". Despite the assessments of critics, Lichtenstein, in an interview with Joan Marter, considered the work to be [...] "a kind of Cubist dollar bill, not a Pop one". He continued, [...] "The fact it was a ten-dollar-bill at all [...] {{there was some kind of}} Pop influence on me that I wasn't aware of so much. They're really not Pop at all. They're more funny, or humorous, or something".|$|E

500|$|... "Acércate" [...] {{was leaked}} onto the Internet {{prior to the}} album's release; a first in Queen's 15-year career. Originally {{entitled}} [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} infringement and included on the album retitled [...] "Acércate". Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. We have no idea who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did." [...] The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revolución (2009) on [...] "Perfecto" [...] which also featured Yaviah.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Spears and {{her team}} {{developed}} a script for a movie where the singer could be the main role. [...] "I talked to [...] and told her what I wanted the movie to be about and she elaborated on it," [...] Spears said. [...] "It was my little project. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a movie, I {{think you have to}} be really passionate about it. I was having a lot of offers, but this is something my heart was into." [...] After finishing the script, the movie, which was later titled Crossroads, had the working titles of What Are Friends For and Not a Girl. [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman", written by Dido, Max Martin and Rami, was originally intended to be included on the movie's soundtrack, but after JIVE Records decided not to release a soundtrack, Spears later decided to use it on her third studio album, Britney (2001).|$|E
500|$|Kolbe {{thought at}} first that casting Robinson was [...] "really off-the-way" [...] but he felt the actor made the episode [...] "bloom". He gave general {{guidelines}} to Robinson about how he could approach the character, but it was Robinson who developed the traits of the character. Kolbe also praised the writing saying that [...] "I wish there was more writing like this for television. I think we'd have a much healthier industry." [...] Robinson said that Garak was a complicated character which required the use of subtext, adding that it wasn't {{a simple way to}} portray a character [...] "but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it well, you really get people's attention". He was told by the producers that they intended to bring him back onto the show, but in a later interview, he said that this was commonplace in the industry and doesn't usually occur. When he was brought back for the second-season episode [...] "", executive producer Ira Steven Behr apologized for not bringing him back sooner.|$|E

500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into {{every nook and cranny}} of the character, in a way you don't get a chance to explore <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Steven Zaillian (writer of Schindler's List) {{was offered}} the chance to write the {{adaptation}} after Tally passed, but he also declined. He explained that [...] "I was busy. And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a sequel." [...] David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to Ridley Scott and the producers, needed major revisions. Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures (a co-production deal was struck between Universal and MGM) said on the rejection of Mamet's screenplay: [...] "There's no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available {{to work on the}} script day-to-day." [...] Mamet was preparing to direct his own film. Zaillian, who had already passed, reconsidered and became involved in the project, saying: [...] "It's hard to say no to Dino once and it's almost impossible to say no to him twice." [...] A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as [...] "stunningly bad" [...] but found Zaillian's rewrite to be [...] "gripping entertainment".|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot from May 23 to 24, 2008 on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, with {{director}} Joseph Khan. American recording artist Britney Spears filmed a cameo appearance for the video on June 4 at the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles. An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly am not so sure. You shoot {{a lot of things}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so I really wish she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future."

500|$|The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster {{was used}} as the {{location}} for the wedding. The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church, which was surrounded by [...] "rough-hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows." [...] Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set. Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled [...] "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we had to be careful that they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then we waited for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set." [...] Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively. Recalling the shoot, Donovan told the Herald Suns Nui Te Koha, [...] "I don't remember that particular day well, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> set ups like weddings it takes a long, long time to put things together." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Radiohead toured {{in support}} of their second album The Bends. Midway through the tour, Brian Eno {{commissioned}} the band to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child. The Help Album was to be recorded {{over the course of}} a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded [...] "Lucky" [...] in five hours with engineer Nigel Godrich, who had assisted producer John Leckie with The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the Help Album session: [...] "Those things are the most inspiring, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album." [...] To promote The Help Album, [...] "Lucky" [...] featured as the lead track on the Help EP, which charted at number 51 after BBC Radio 1 chose not to play it. This disappointed Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, but he later said [...] "Lucky" [...] shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: [...] "'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall." ...|$|E
