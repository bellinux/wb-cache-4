25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
25|$|They <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> good sea boats, {{although}} very wet, {{there was}} a saying that they submerged at the Heads and surfaced down at Gabo Island. We worked mainly four on, four off. Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E

Drums take on a {{different}} role in a three-piece band, {{so it was a}} lot of fun. [...] Radio City was really more spontaneous, and the performances <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> close to live performances." ...|$|E

After impressing during the trial, Haber signed for West Brom {{for an undisclosed}} fee, agreeing to personal terms and passing his medical on January 12, 2010. On joining the club, Haber said that [...] "The club <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> straightforward with me from day one. They said that if I was given the opportunity, they would work to improve me as a young player". He was given a squad number of 40.|$|E
500|$|According to Huntley, [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] is [...] "an all-time favourite" [...] of English singer David Bowie. The latter {{covered the}} song on his 2003 album Reality, co-produced by his {{longtime}} collaborator Tony Visconti. Bowie had {{originally intended to}} record it for a planned follow-up to Pin Ups, his 1973 collection of cover versions. Talking to Rolling Stone shortly before the release of Reality, {{he said of his}} recording: [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> true to the original arrangement, but the overall atmosphere is somewhat different. It's a dense piece." ...|$|E

I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from {{suburbia}} who sings in this band, but someone older might {{have thought it was}} just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are we going if this is music?... But all those songs we sang <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} things [...] tried after {{acquiring}} Bungie, after first attempting to fully assimilate them, was to move Bungie into a standard Microsoft building {{with the rest of the}} game group. [...] But unlike the rest of the teams they'd brought in previously, Bungie didn't move into Microsoft corporate offices – we tore all of the walls out of that section of the building and sat in a big open environment. Luckily Alex and Jason [...] <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> steadfast at the time about staying somewhat separate and isolated.|$|E
500|$|Cole {{initially}} {{looked for}} original songs to {{record for the}} album, but said [...] "the songs being sent <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> bad." [...] A writer from Vibe said Cole's decision to create a covers album was a marketing strategy to breed [...] "a connection between song and interpreter and between singer and audience" [...] and appeal to [...] "fans yearning for {{the good old days}} before they had to hire a sitter to go see a show". Cole later clarified she could not afford to record an album of original material, explaining [...] "we're doing a contemporary urban record on a jazz budget".|$|E

500|$|In the film, Ferris convinces Cameron {{to borrow}} his father's rare 1961 Ferrari GT California. [...] "The insert {{shots of the}} Ferrari were of the real 250 GT California", Hughes {{explains}} in the DVD commentary. [...] "The cars we used in the wide shots were obviously reproductions. There were only 100 of these cars, so it was way too expensive to destroy. We {{had a number of}} replicas made. They <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> good, but for the tight shots I needed a real one, so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{writers have}} {{commented on the}} {{parallel}} between the love darts of snails and the love darts fired by the mythological being Cupid, known as Eros in Greek mythology. It is even possible {{that there is a}} connection between the behavior of the snails and the myth. Malacologist (mollusk expert) Ronald Chase of McGill University said about the garden snail Cornu aspersum, [...] "I believe the myth of Cupid and his arrows has its basis in this snail species, which is native to Greece". He added, [...] "The Greeks probably knew about this behavior because they <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> good naturalists and observers." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{started playing}} and {{learned a few}} songs by other writers to begin with. [...] I started writing originals within a few months. [...] My songs <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> horrendous to begin with. [...] They kept getting better and better. [...] When I graduated, I started playing at open mics in bars in Boston. [...] Eventually {{discovered}} that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while you played. [...] I got involved in that circuit. [...] I think that's why I've become so lyric conscious — because of those listening rooms, where {{you really have to}} rely on words in those situations." ...|$|E

500|$|Flying symbolizes Jim's {{possibility}} and danger of {{escape from the}} prison camp. His growing alienation from his prewar self and society is reflected in his hero-worship of the Japanese aviators based at the airfield adjoining the camp. [...] "I think it's true that the Japanese <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> brutal with the Chinese, so I don't have any particularly sentimental view of them," [...] Ballard recalled. [...] "But small boys tend to find their heroes where they can. One thing {{there was no doubt}} about, and that was that the Japanese were extremely brave. One had very complicated views about patriotism [...] loyalty to one's own nation. Jim is constantly identifying himself, first with the Japanese; then, when the Americans start flying over in their Mustangs and B-29s, he's very drawn to the American." ...|$|E
500|$|Although forty-six {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Martin Truex, Jr. clinched his third pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 26.643. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kurt Busch. Johnson qualified third, Kahne took fourth, and Hamlin started fifth. Biffle, Kyle Busch, Stewart, Casey Mears and Martin completed the top ten positions. The three drivers that failed to qualify were Regan Smith, Kevin Conway and Brandon Ash. After the qualifier Truex said, [...] "(Today) we <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> good in practice. This is a weird track where you go out in practice, then expect to pick up a half-second somehow (in qualifying). We did. It's strange, but it felt good." ...|$|E
500|$|Commentary on {{the album}} has {{discussed}} its sinister, sexual, youthful feel. LeMay wrote that Deal's singing is spooky, and suggests a mythical siren or a young girl hiding a weapon. Steve Albini said that [...] "there was a simultaneous charm to Kim's presentation to her music that's both childlike and giddy and also completely mature and kind of dirty... sort of girlish fascination with things that <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> {{but it was also}} kind of horny. That was a juxtaposition that, at the time, was unusual. You didn't get a lot of knowing winks from female artists at the time." [...] Subjects reviewers have heard in the songs include menstruation ("Iris"), [...] "weird/bad sex" [...] ("When I Was a Painter" [...] and [...] "Only in 3's"), the demise of a lover ("Fortunately Gone"), and a fetus that lives on after an abortion ("Hellbound").|$|E

500|$|Jean and Reiss {{served as}} show runners {{until the end}} of the fourth season in 1993. Since the show had already {{established}} itself in the first two seasons, they were able to give it more depth during their tenure. Jean believes this is one of the reasons that many fans and critics regard season three and four as the best seasons of The Simpsons. Bill Oakley, another writer on The Simpsons, has commented that [...] "Mike and Al are responsible for the best thing that ever appeared on television, which was the third season of The Simpsons." [...] Comedy writer Jay Kogen has said that [...] "those years with Al Jean and Mike Reiss running it <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> darn good. And then the ones after that maybe not so much. Some people ran it better than others." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{was known}} for being {{sometimes}} prickly. [...] Aware of this general impression, he claimed that [...] "If you give me your attention", the misanthrope's song from Princess Ida, was a satiric self-reference, saying: [...] "I thought it my duty {{to live up to}} my reputation." [...] However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. [...] Actress May Fortescue recalled, [...] "His kindness was extraordinary. [...] On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether they <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful. [...] For money as money he cared less than nothing. [...] Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend." [...] The journalist Frank M. Boyd wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Since I Left You" [...] {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} song a positive review, praising it for [...] "allow the sampled performances to truly glisten." [...] Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson also spoke favourably of [...] "Since I Left You", remarking that it [...] "leaves listeners spellbound {{and in a}} summer dreamscape of lushness and simplicity." [...] Matt LeMay of Pitchfork Media wrote that the [...] "beauty" [...] of the song [...] "lies {{in the way that}} the Avalanches turn obvious sonic mismatches into something all their own". Playlouder named [...] "Since I Left You" [...] the twenty-ninth best single of 2001, calling it [...] "shimmeringly gorgeous" [...] and [...] "much greater than the sum of its parts, and the parts <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> good to start with."
