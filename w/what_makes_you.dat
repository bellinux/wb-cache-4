500|$|Their fourth album Four (2014) was {{released}} on 17 November 2014. Payne once again claimed that the album would be [...] "edgier" [...] and that the group had written most of the songs for it; Horan {{came up with the}} name of the album, commemorating {{the fact that it is}} One Direction's fourth record to date and that it has been four years since the band's formation. Signifying a further maturation of their pop sound, the album's first single, Steal My Girl, was dubbed by Billboard as [...] "no <b>What</b> <b>Makes</b> <b>You</b> Beautiful, but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction", and that the band was [...] "not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days". Rolling Stone described the record as [...] "saturated with retro vibes"; its songs [...] "split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Publicly, however, Maddux is {{dismissive of}} his reputation, saying, [...] "People think I'm smart? You know <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> smart? Locate your fastball down and away.

It's that thing between both of your ears we call a brain." ...|$|E
2500|$|On one occasion, Mu'awiya {{ascended the}} minbar and praised Allah. When {{he wanted to}} speak, a lad of the Ansar {{interrupted}} him and said, [...] "Mu'awiya! <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> {{and the people of}} your house more entitled to this wealth than us! We have no wrong action against you that we know of other than our slaying of your uncle Walid, your grandfather 'Uqba, and your brother Hanzala." [...] Mu'awiya said, [...] "By Allah, nephew, you did not kill them. Rather Allah killed them with angels upon angels {{at the hands of the}} sons of their father. That was not a fault nor a loss." [...] The Ansari said, [...] "So where is the fault and loss then?" [...] He said, [...] "You spoke the truth. Do you need something?" [...] He said, [...] "Yes. I look after an old woman and sisters and things have been hard on us." [...] Mu'awiya said, [...] "Take what you can from the treasury." [...] The boy took it and then Mu'awiya resumed his khutba.|$|E

2500|$|CVG listed {{him as one}} {{of their}} two-hundred reasons to [...] "Love PC Gaming", quoting one of his battle cries ("Go for the eyes, Boo!") for their reasoning. He was listed by MSN Entertainment as one of the [...] "Gaming's unsung heroes", saying he [...] "provides great comic relief and is a fondly remembered man." [...] GameDaily named him one of the Most Lovable Lummoxes in video gaming, stating [...] "Every good party of adventurers in a CRPG needs a tank...In Baldur's Gate, the human ranger Minsc is that tank, and a {{valuable}} asset to the player's quest." [...] Dakota Grabowski of GameZone listed Minsc as the top BioWare created teammate, commenting [...] "His voice-acting was hands-down one of the best attributes of the Baldur's Gate series" [...] and that [...] "BioWare will never surpass their creation of Minsc (and Boo!).". Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer considered him {{to be one of the}} best BioWare characters, saying [...] "If you played Baldur's Gate, one character stood out from the pack. ... Strangely enough, this is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> love him all the more." [...] In 2011, Empire ranked him and Boo as the 11th greatest video game character, adding that [...] "Few names bring a wistful smile to the faces of aging PC gamers like that of Minsc and his trusty hamster companion".|$|E
