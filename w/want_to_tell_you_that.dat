[...] Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. [...] He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. [...] She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded [...] "what about you?" [...] Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing [...] "I am not asking you to refrain from your action, but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ...

[...] "I never saw a greater exhibition of end play," [...] said Fielding Yost, referring to Wakefield. The Kingsport Times reported that governor Austin Peay had given Hek praise for his play that day. Thomas Ryan also had a fine game, out-punting the famed Harry Kipke. The Michigan Alumnus attributed this to Ryan's superior line, claiming Kipke was under constant threat of a blocked punt. The Alumnus also said Kipke could not seek to return punts, for fear of fumbling. As soon as he received the ball, Vanderbilt ends Hek Wakefield or Lynn Bomar would crash into him. After the game, the referee McDonald approached guard Tuck Kelly and told him, [...] "You are the first individual I've complimented after {{a game in which}} I officiated, but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I never saw a better guard than you are." [...] Steger was Michigan's best runner that day. [...] The Wolverines' backfield having three men who could pass the ball in Kipke, Steger, and Uteritz, was said to help them throughout the game by vexing Vanderbilt's secondary.|$|E

He left for France in 1977 after 10 years in Israel. He is chairman of Peace Now in France. He said the group seeks to support Israel's long-term future because [...] "as friends, as Jews, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you are going down a wrong path. I think our initiative is actually helping Israel's image in Europe. It is a pretty low image over here these days, because of what happened in Gaza, mainly, and it is commonly believed in Europe that Israel is the provocative, negative side of the conflict—the one that is blocking the peace process." [...] He claimed that [...] "We’re not saying that only Israel is responsible for the problem. As Jews tied to Israel, we speak to the Israelis. So this is a call to the Israelis, but of course [...] have a lot of the responsibility for the continuation of the conflict." [...] He affirmed, on behalf of the membership that [...] "our connection to the state of Israel is part of our identity," [...] but in Europe [...] "Israel is seen as responsible for all the problems [...]" [...] Chemla added that the group's was not a movement as such after the first petition but hoped to become one.|$|E

My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
