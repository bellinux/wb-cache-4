5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{development}} team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the North Star. Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use <b>wire-frame</b> models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E

In the USA Eastman and Weiler were also working on Boundary Representation and in Japan Professor Fumihiko Kimura and his team at Tokyo University also produced their own B-rep modelling system.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} finale was to {{take place}} on the hands of Big Ben with Ratigan eventually falling to his demise. However, layout artist Mike Peraza approached Musker with the idea of restaging the final confrontation so the characters would break through the face of the Big Ben with the grinding clockwork gears providing added menace, in which Musker agreed. Pereza and his team was sent to London for video reference and were granted unprecedented access to the clockworks inside Big Ben. Because the bells would chime at every quarter-hour, the team completed their research in one hour. Back at the Feature Animation building, animators Phil Nibbelink and Dave Gielow spent months designing the interior of Big Ben, with each gear produced as <b>wire-frame</b> graphics on a computer that was printed out and traced onto animation cels onto which the colors and characters were added.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the limited}} success, Nintendo would press ahead with 3D {{development}} into the 1990s. Gunpei Yokoi, {{creator of the}} Game Boy handheld device and popular Metroid video game, developed a new 3D device for Nintendo called the Virtual Boy. It was a portable table-top system consisting of goggles and a controller that used a spinning disc to achieve full stereoscopic monochrome 3D. Released in 1995, the Virtual Boy sold fewer than a million units, spawning only 22 compatible game titles, and was widely {{considered to be a}} commercial failure. Shigeru Miyamoto, known for his work on popular game franchises such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda, commented in a 2011 interview that he felt conflicted about Yokoi's decision to use <b>wire-frame</b> models for 3D and suggested that the product may not have been marketed correctly. The failure of the Virtual Boy left many at Nintendo doubting the viability of 3D gaming. Despite this, Nintendo continued to investigate the incorporation of 3D technology into other products.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Weekly Famicom Tsūshin, Isabella Nagano called Red Alarms {{stereoscopic}} visuals [...] "amazing", and Sawada Noda {{recommended the}} game to all owners of the Virtual Boy. In a more negative review, the publication's Mizu Pin characterized the <b>wire-frame</b> graphics as confusing and frustrating, a criticism echoed by the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly. A GamePro writer under the pseudonym [...] "Slo Mo" [...] found the visuals confusing as well, but felt that players could adjust to them. Slo Mo and Electronic Gaming Monthlys Danyon Carpenter and Al Manuel praised the title's control scheme, and the latter magazine's Andrew Baran summarized Red Alarm as [...] "a nifty show-off game".|$|E

These include collapsible stocks, <b>wire-framed</b> stocks, pistol grips, flash suppressors, shrouded barrels, high-capacity magazines, telescopic sights, reflex 'red dot' sights and other occasionally fanciful-looking hardware, some at a cost greater than the rifle itself. Such accessories often make it impossible to use the original floating stock for storage of modified parts.|$|R

500|$|... is a 1995 shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by T Soft {{and published by}} Nintendo. Released as a Virtual Boy launch game, it requires the player to pilot a space fighter and defeat the army of a malevolent artificial intelligence called [...] "KAOS". The game takes inspiration from the 1993 title Star Fox, {{and it is one}} of the few third-party titles for the Virtual Boy. Unlike most of the console's games, Red Alarm features three-dimensional (3D) polygonal graphics. However, hardware constraints limited the visuals to bare <b>wire-frame</b> models, similar to those of the 1980 arcade game Battlezone. Reviewers characterized Red Alarms graphics as confusing, but certain publications praised it as one of the most enjoyable Virtual Boy titles.|$|E
500|$|Red Alarm was {{published}} by Nintendo and developed by T Soft, {{one of the few}} third-party companies approached to develop for the Virtual Boy. According to the console's creator, Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo tried to [...] "maintain as much control as possible" [...] over Virtual Boy game development so that low-quality releases by outside companies could be avoided. Although T Soft was known for golf video games, the design of Red Alarm was inspired by that of Star Fox, a rail shooter for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This decision was considered by Patrick Kolan of IGN to be [...] "a departure for the team". Unlike many Virtual Boy games, Red Alarm features an engine that displays 3D graphics: the game world is rendered in <b>wire-frame</b> polygonal visuals {{similar to those of the}} 1980 arcade game Battlezone. Because of the console's limited technology, solid 3D graphics were not viable.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} results of car {{collisions}} easier to predict, Reflections implemented simulated physics into Destruction Derby. Director Martin Edmondson believed that the game would otherwise be [...] "completely unplayable", as with [...] "pool when the collisions are all off". Producer Tony Parks noted that the physics were simplified to improve performance and {{to compensate for the}} PlayStation's digital controller, and that the team sought a balance between [...] "realism and playability". Performance was also improved by optimising the game's graphics, and by reducing the level of detail of objects in the distance. Destruction Derbys game engine supports up to twenty cars on screen simultaneously, which no console racing game, other than Daytona USA, had achieved until that time. However, a single <b>wire-frame</b> model, differentiated by texture maps, was used for every vehicle. Damage to vehicles is modelled in real-time, based on the speed and angle of the cars involved. The team made the game's tracks small to [...] "keep the density of the cars on the track very high", which allowed for large-scale wrecks. Plans were made to support up to eight players with the PlayStation Link Cable.|$|E

Because the NES was not as powerful as the arcade hardware, Takeda and his crew realized {{that it would be}} impossible for the NES port to faithfully emulate the arcade graphics. Instead of making the playable boxer <b>wire-framed</b> or transparent in order to see an opponent, they decided to make the playable boxer more short-bodied, so that players could easily see opponents over the large head room of the playable boxer. Other things added to the NES version that the arcade versions lacked were a rough plot, a background music track played during fights, animated cutscenes and a password system for saving progress.|$|R

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its variety {{of weapons and}} enemies. Game Revolution said that each enemy is [...] "unique both in ability, structure, and behavior so that each requires a specific combat approach". Maximum PC reviewer Josh Norem praised the levels for their interesting objectives, stating that the missions [...] "vary widely, ranging from finding lost colleagues to defending strategic structures against enemy assaults". Computer Games Magazine praised {{the fact that the}} developers replaced the <b>wire-frame</b> automaps of previous Descent games with flat-shaded polygons because they [...] "provide more detail and make it easier to recognize where you are and how to get where you want to go". The multiplayer was highlighted positively due to its replay value and variety of game types. Computer Games Magazine also credited its [...] "rock-solid performance on standard dialup modems and easy connectivity", while GameSpot praised it for being [...] "fun and stable". The game was a runner-up for GameSpy's Action Game of the Year and a nominee for GameSpot's PC Action Game of the Year. Despite the positive reviews, the game did not perform well in sales. As a result, Daily Radar awarded the game a [...] "System Shock Award", named after the Looking Glass Studios 1994 game of the same name, implying that Descent 3 is a [...] "game that the critics loved but is over-shadowed by lesser or greater games".|$|E
500|$|The {{visual and}} special effects {{departments}} often overlap, {{such as in}} Mary Winchester's death scene in the pilot episode. Because the character is pinned to the ceiling and burned to death, actress Samantha Smith was required to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a papier-mâché body was ignited on a fake ceiling. When the burning of the titular creature in the episode [...] "Wendigo" [...] was not sufficient using special effects, a <b>wire-frame</b> mannequin wrapped in steel wool was then burned, with the scene being composited into the original footage to draw out the wendigo's death. To make it appear that the Hook Man is invisible as he scrapes his hook along the wall {{for one of the}} scenes in [...] "Hook Man", a wire was placed inside plaster walls and then pulled out; the wire later was digitally removed in post-production. In the episode [...] "Bugs", the cast had to be sealed in a small area with hundreds of bees, and were stung despite wearing special costumes with cuffs sewn into their sleeves and pants. However, the bees did not show up well on camera, so most of them that appear in the final version were added with CGI.|$|E
500|$|For the game's artistic style, {{the team}} drew {{on a variety}} of influences: the work of film {{directors}} David Cronenberg, David Fincher, David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock, along with films similar to the 1990 psychological thriller/horror film Jacob's Ladder, and painters such as Francis Bacon, Rembrandt and Andrew Wyeth. Early in the project, they studied the 1996 video game Tomb Raiders creation of 3D environments. Other influences on the game included the 1992 survival horror video game Alone in the Dark, the first Silent Hill game, and the Japanese comic Whirr by Morohashi. While working on the character designs, Sato and his team sketched human faces and various expressions. To gain a better sense of the characters' facial structures, they drew the characters' profiles from various angles, before creating <b>wire-frame</b> models, each consisting of six thousand polygons; they then completed the model with textures. Data for the character animation was taken through motion capture, and using Softimage, they animated the characters. Masahiro Ito designed the monsters in Silent Hill 2; [...] "soured flesh" [...] was the concept behind their appearance. The monsters were also to incorporate [...] "an element of humanity". For the most part, the monsters reflect the protagonist's subconscious. For example, the monster Pyramid Head was based on the executioners of the town's fictional history and is intended to be a punisher for James. Two exceptions to this theme are the [...] "Abstract Daddy", a reflection of Angela's subconscious and memories, and the [...] "Creepers", which are also seen in the first game.|$|E
5000|$|Richmond {{also contributed}} a key {{counterculture}} fashion accessory. Roger McGuinn and John Sebastian credit Richmond {{with the introduction}} of [...] "granny glasses" [...] in the early 1960s. A well-known photo by John Byrne Cooke shows Richmond wearing his homemade pair in 1963, long before John Lennon popularized the [...] "British welfare glasses". Spectacles like Richmond’s - consisting initially of colored non-prescription glass set into old <b>wire-frames,</b> thus shielding the often-stoned performer's eyes from public view - then became common on the San Francisco rock scene where the Jim Kweskin Jug Band was paired in concert with bands such as The Doors and Big Brother and the Holding Company. Janis Joplin and Jerry Garcia, who also socialized with Richmond, were among those who adopted the colored-lens look.|$|R

To the left were the small bare marble-topped cafe tables and bentwood or <b>wire-framed</b> chairs. A fine meal might begin with Mussels and herbed rice presented in their blue-black shells on a white plate; then a perfectly roasted chicken, a simple salad of Boston Lettuce with a coating of lemon garlic dressing, and completed with a dark brown puff of chocolate soufflé, containers of whipped cream and molten chocolate offered at the side.|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Atlantis: The Lost Empire was notable for using more computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any other Disney {{traditionally}} animated feature. To increase productivity, the directors had the digital artists work with the traditional animators throughout the production. Several important scenes required heavy use of digital animation: the Leviathan, the Ulysses submarine and sub-pods, the Heart of Atlantis, and the Stone Giants. During production, after Matt Codd and Jim Martin designed the Ulysses on paper, Greg Aronowitz was hired to build a scale model of the submarine, {{to be used as a}} reference for drawing the 3D Ulysses. The final film included 362 digital-effects shots, and computer programs were used to seamlessly join the 2D and 3D artwork. One scene that took advantage of this was the [...] "sub-drop" [...] scene, where the 3D Ulysses was dropped from its docking bay into the water. As the camera floated toward it, a 2D Milo was drawn to appear inside, tracking the camera. The crew noted that it was challenging to keep the audience from noticing the difference between the 2D and 3D drawings when they were merged. The digital production also gave the directors a unique [...] "virtual camera" [...] for complicated shots within the film. With the ability to operate in the z-plane, this camera moved through a digital <b>wire-frame</b> set; the background and details were later hand-drawn over the wire frames. This was used in the opening flight scene through Atlantis and the submarine chase through the undersea cavern with the Leviathan in pursuit.|$|E
500|$|In {{previous}} films, Starfleet's {{range of}} capital ships had been predominantly {{represented by the}} Constitution class Enterprise and just five other ship classes: the Miranda class from [...] (represented by the USS Reliant), the Excelsior and the Oberth class Grissom from , and the Galaxy and Nebula classes from The Next Generation. ILM supervisor John Knoll insisted that First Contacts space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet's ship configurations. [...] "Starfleet would probably throw everything it could at the Borg, including ships we've never seen before", he reasoned. [...] "And since we figured {{a lot of the}} background action in the space battle would need to be done with computer-generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway, I realized there was no reason not to do some new designs." [...] Alex Jaeger was appointed visual effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating four new starships. Paramount wanted ships that would look different from a distance, so the director devised multiple hull profiles. Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain Star Trek ship precedents, with a saucer-like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs. The Akira class featured the traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran-style double hull; the Norway class was based on the USS Voyager; the Saber class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer section; and the Steamrunner class featured twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear. Each design was modeled as a three-dimensional digital <b>wire-frame</b> model for use in the film.|$|E
2500|$|When {{designing}} the enemies, each enemy type was sketched on paper, before being {{built as a}} 3D <b>wire-frame</b> model, which would then be placed into the gaming environment. Once the model was in the game it was [...] "generated using texture-mapped polygons and then animated using the information gathered from the motion capture system." [...] For the larger enemies, the polygon structure was so detailed as to allow players to shoot individual body parts, such as legs, arms, and in some cases, even shoot out the eyes of particular enemies.|$|E
50|$|Some {{excavations}} {{took place}} between 1968-73 and the foundation trenches recorded by excavation {{can be seen as}} low, <b>wire-framed</b> and turf-covered earth banks. They revealed that the manor was built in four main phases. The original entrance was across a drawbridge on the south side that led to an early 13th century gatehouse; the drawbridge was replaced by a fixed bridge later in the century. The east range contains the earliest structure, dated around 1180-1200, which housed the domestic apartments. About 1200, a wardrobe and garderobe were added to the northern end of the domestic apartments. The third and most extensive phase took place about 1224-36, completing the north, west and south ranges with the hall, buttery, chapel and bakehouse. The kitchens and service wing were rebuilt around 1300.|$|R
50|$|Although Paramarines {{and armored}} crewmen had been issued the folding stock M55, the weapon's poorly {{designed}} <b>wire-framed</b> stock tended to fold while firing and soon earned the M55 a poor reputation. Moreover, the Reising {{was designed as}} a civilian police weapon and was not suited to the stresses of harsh battle conditions encountered in the Solomon Islands—namely, sand, saltwater and the difficulty in keeping the weapon clean enough to function properly. Tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground and Fort Benning Georgia had found difficulties in blindfold reassembly of the Reising, indicating the design was complicated and difficult to maintain. Many of the parts were hand fitted at the factory; this lack of parts interchangeability was not a problem for a civilian or police firearm, but it was very problematic when Reisings were maintained in the field under combat conditions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: While current CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems {{provide a}} variety of data {{representation}} schemes (e. g. <b>wire-frames,</b> surface, and solid modeling) and data exchange protocols, they fail to address automation issues in retrieval of building information {{to be used in}} different AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) applications. In these CAD systems, topological information (also known as spatial relations) describing the three-dimensional spatial relationships between building components is conventionally represented in a manual fashion into data models. The manual data representation, however, inherently is a complex and challenging task due to the wide variety of spatial relationships. This paper outlines a computer-based building design framework with emphasis on the engine capable of automatically deducing topological information of building components, which support various aspects in building design such as constructability analysis, construction planning, and building code compliance checking...|$|R
