Although {{behavioural}} {{interventions are}} successful in achieving short-term <b>weight</b> loss, most individuals regain {{most or all of}} their <b>weight</b> within a few years. Our aim was to investigate factors that can help in long-term <b>weight</b> maintenance. Design.

Participants were 20 adult volunteers (aged 30 - 67) including lifelong <b>weight</b> maintainers, active <b>weight</b> maintainers who have maintained <b>weight</b> loss, and <b>weight</b> gainers. Thematic analysis was used to highlight differences between <b>weight</b> groups. Results. Successful <b>weight</b> maintainers adopt a staged approach to <b>weight</b> management, including monitoring <b>weight</b> fluctuations and having a clear alarm signal for <b>weight</b> gain that triggers immediate action. They have several behavioural strategies for <b>weight</b> control, comprising relatively small adjustments to diet and/or exercise behaviour and also have clear strategies for coping with lifestyle interruptions.

Further, their coping strategies for <b>weight</b> gain or failed actions are poor. Conclusions. The results suggest that successful <b>weight</b> maintainers, irrespective of current <b>weight</b> band, adopt a staged behavioural approach to <b>weight</b> management that allows them to maintain a fairly stable <b>weight.</b> Encouraging the use of such strategies in those who typically regain <b>weight</b> after dieting may aid them in maintaining <b>weight</b> loss...|$|R

We assessed the prevalence and accuracy of <b>weight</b> comments received by Chinese adolescents from different sources and their relation to <b>weight</b> misperception. Methods In the Hong Kong Student Obesity Surveillance (HKSOS) project 2006 – 07, 22612 students aged 11 – 18 (41. 5 % boys) completed a questionnaire on obesity. Students responded if family members, peers and professionals had seriously commented over the past 30 days that they were "too fat" or "too thin" in two separate questions. The accuracy of the comments was judged against the actual <b>weight</b> status derived from self-reported height and <b>weight.</b> Self-perceived <b>weight</b> status was also reported and any discordance with the actual <b>weight</b> status denoted <b>weight</b> misperception. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odd ratios for <b>weight</b> misperception by the type of <b>weight</b> comments received. Results One in three students received <b>weight</b> comments, and the mother was the most common source of <b>weight</b> comments. Health professional was the most accurate source of <b>weight</b> comments, yet less than half the comments were correct. Adolescents receiving incorrect comments had increased risk of having <b>weight</b> misperception in all <b>weight</b> status groups.

In contrast, underweight and overweight/obese adolescents receiving correct <b>weight</b> comments were less likely to have <b>weight</b> misperception.
