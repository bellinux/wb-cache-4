5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>in?</b> I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E

5|$|In the east, however, Manuel's {{achievements}} {{are more}} ambiguous. He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176 against the Turks. Manuel was marching against Konya, the Turkish capital, when his forces were ambushed; the ensuing defeat has since entered {{the popular imagination}} as a legendary disaster. Exaggerated accounts of the battle often describe {{the destruction of the}} entire Byzantine army, and with it the end of Byzantine power and influence. However, the modern consensus among Byzantine historians is that, while the Battle of Myriokephalon was a serious humiliation for the emperor, it was certainly not a catastrophe. Nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> any way equivalent to the Battle of Manzikert over a century earlier. In fact, much of the emperor's army emerged from the battle without serious damage. Units involved in the battle are well documented as campaigning in Asia Minor the following year. The imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel's reign, a clear indication that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory. In 1177, the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force at Hyelion and Leimocheir in the Meander valley.|$|E

Throughout these years, Rakovsky, was, according to Iosif and Anghel, [...] "continuously bustling; disappearing and appearing <b>in</b> workers' centers, <b>be</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Brăila, <b>be</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Galaţi, <b>be</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Iaşi, <b>be</b> <b>it</b> anywhere, always preaching with the same undaunted fervor and fanatical conviction his social credo".|$|R

500|$|Mosley won {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the FIA on 3 June 2008, with 103 votes in support and 55 against, with seven abstentions and four invalid votes. Several clubs, including the ADAC, AAA and KNAF considered withdrawal from the FIA after the decision. Other formerly critical organisations have since said that they will accept the outcome of the vote and now wish to move on. In July 2008, Mosley won a High Court legal case against the News of the World for invasion of privacy. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Eady, said there was: [...] "no evidence that the gathering on March 28, 2008 was intended to be an enactment of Nazi behavior or adoption of any of its attitudes. Nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> fact. I see no genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the Holocaust." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{analysis}} of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown prior to the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play an extremely popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that {{the middle of the}} 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists, along with a growth in Tarot's popularity. [...] "The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had ever been before or than it has ever been since...." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Endymion had {{repeated}} this maneuver for {{the third}} time, causing considerable loss aboard President, Decatur abruptly turned to starboard to cross Endymions bow. He had mustered boarding parties in case the British were taken by surprise, but Endymion also turned to starboard and the two ships headed south, exchanging broadsides. Decatur {{had no time to}} batter the British vessel into surrender, if he could, as the other three British ships would almost certainly be in range before long; so his gunners fired high into Endymions rigging, seeking to disable her, using chain shot and [...] "dismantling shot" [...] (bars of iron linked by a ring), while the British gunners fired low into the hull of President. However, it was claimed that the shooting was poor on both sides while [...] Presidents powder was defective. Despite this claim, gunfire from the Endymion significantly damaged the Presidents hull. Shot had pierced President below the waterline and 6 feet of water was found in the hold(although some could have been from the grounding). [...] Endymion successfully disabled 6 guns on the President 's starboard broadside by damaging the barrels or shooting them off their carriages. 10 out of the 15 [...] starboard gun ports were hit and the gun crews reduced. Shot [...] from the Endymion was even found inside the President 's magazine. Given the situation, President might have been on its way to sinking. This suggest's that Philip Broke's method of naval gunnery was effectively used in the engagement as <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the engagement between Shannon and Chesapeake 18 months earlier as in both cases the British were able to target the enemy's gun ports. These were remarkably small targets given the accuracy of naval guns of the era and it is likely that Broke's method of using gunsights and degree markings on the deck were the key method in which that such small targets were able to be hit. Meanwhile, President had significantly cut the rigging of Endymion effectively slowing it down.|$|E

2500|$|In {{light of}} these deficiencies, Thomas {{concluded}} that it was [...] "far from obvious" [...] that the actions of these three guards violated the Eighth Amendment. [...] The question Thomas asked was whether in 1995 {{it was obvious that}} the [...] "mere act of cuffing petitioner to the restraining bar... violated the Eighth Amendment." [...] In Thomas's view, no prior litigation involving Alabama's use of the restraining bar would have put a reasonable prison guard on notice that the mere act of attaching a prisoner to it would violate the Eighth Amendment. [...] The three federal district courts in Alabama had all rejected this contention, as well as the idea endorsed by the majoritythat exposure to the elements resulting from an extended stay on the hitching post, coupled with the pain caused by the handcuffedwas the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain. [...] Hope did not allege that the mere act of attaching him to the restraining bar [...] "imposed a substantial risk of serious harm upon him". [...] Nor <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> light of the district courts' conclusion, [...] "obvious" [...] that this act would have caused Hope harm. [...] There was no evidence that these particular guards had read the Department of Justice's report. [...] The Alabama Department of Corrections's regulation specifically authorized guards to use the restraining bar when inmates were disruptive to the work squad. [...] The fact that the guards did not comply with the recordkeeping requirement of the regulation was beside the point, Justice Thomas believed, because Hope never alleged that the guards' failure to do so caused the Eighth Amendment violation. [...] Thomas also read binding Fifth and Eleventh Circuit precedent merely to prohibit [...] "malicious and sadistic" [...] conduct by guards. [...] While handcuffing prisoners to fences for [...] "long periods of time" [...] could be considered malicious and sadistic under these binding precedents, it was not clear to Justice Thomas whether 7 hours counted as a [...] "long period of time" [...] under this precedent. [...] Finally, [...] "deliberate indifference" [...] means that the prison official knew of and then disregarded an excessive risk to health and safety, and {{there was no evidence that}} these guards knew that merely attaching Hope to the restraining bar posed such a risk.|$|E
