40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} Swedish manufacturers of insulated <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and the market forces surrounding the industry between 1945 and 1980. As part of the chain of subcontractors, the <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> industry was linked to all three major electro-technical manufacturers of the time, ASEA, Electrolux and LM Ericsson. The Wallenberg Group’s initiatives to create boundaries for what the manufacturers were to produce also came to influence manufacturers of <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> and their subsequent focus on high- and low voltage current products and systems respectively. Increasing sales of electro-technical products that became the norm in industry {{as well as in}} private homes after 1945 to a great extent created the demand for <b>winding</b> <b>wire.</b> In response to an increasing demand for <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> Ernst Dahrén developed the family company in Jonslund, a predominantly rural area that lacked job opportunities. The specialisation of <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> manufacturing enabled the company to carefully select loyal employees who accepted lower wages and were willing to work in three shifts, thereby creating a competitive advantage for the company. Product pricing was governed by the prices of copper and aluminium as well as costs and discounts for the rod wire used in the production of <b>winding</b> <b>wire.</b> Together with Ernst Dahrén’s entrepreneurial and patriarchal leadership style which highly influenced the company culture, the family’s tendency to re-invest profits became an important foundation for the company’s autonomy and expansion until its acquisition by the ASEA in 1973...|$|R
5000|$|Halfwound strings, ground wound strings, or {{pressure}} wound strings are a {{cross between}} roundwound and flatwound. Such strings are usually made by <b>winding</b> round <b>wire</b> around a round or hex core first, then polishing, grinding (thus the name, ground wound) or pressing the exterior part of the winding until it is practically flat. This results in the flat, comfortable playing feel of flatwounds, along with less squeaking, with a brightness generally between roundwounds and flatwounds. The polishing process removes {{almost half of the}} <b>winding</b> <b>wire's</b> mass; thus, to compensate for it, manufacturers use <b>winding</b> <b>wire</b> of a heavier gauge. Because of the extra manufacturing process involved they are normally more expensive than roundwounds, but less than flatwounds.|$|R

50|$|Copper {{used for}} the {{manufacture}} of transformer windings {{is in the form}} of wire for small products and strip for larger equipment. For small products, the wire must be strong enough to be wound without breakage, yet flexible enough to provide close-packed windings. Strip products must be of good surface quality so that insulating enamels do not break down under voltage. Good ductility is essential for the strip to be formed and packed while good strength is needed to withstand the high electro-mechanical stresses set up under occasional short-circuit conditions. Copper <b>winding</b> <b>wires</b> in transformers are compatible with all modern insulation materials, such as lacquer and enamel. Lacquers permit the close spacing of windings to give best efficiency in the coils.|$|E

The layer is formed {{in such a manner}} that the thermal resistance between the layer and the units is small relative to the resistance of the wire between end windings and the point. An electrically-conducting connection is provided between the layer and electronic components (7, 8). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The electrically-conducting layer is applied to thermally-conducting and electrically-insulating substrates and cooling units (11, 13). USE - Used in an electromagnetic actuator e. g. solenoid and valve drive. ADVANTAGE - The contact point connects the <b>winding</b> <b>wires</b> to the electrically-conducting layer, thus contacting the windings with electronic components in a simple and reliable manner, and achieving thermal isolation of the windings from the electronic components, and hence avoiding entry of harmful heat from the windings to the components.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{high-speed}} fault transducer and, based on it, to create an automated system for monitoring and repairing faulty insulation of <b>winding</b> <b>wires</b> in electrical equipment. The fault transducer under development is based on a gas discharge process that occurs between a high-voltage electrode and a grounded wire conductor in a damaged insulation segment. Oscillographic measurements show that there is a complex signal that appears on the fault transducer when a damaged insulation segment is passed through it. The basic patterns of electrodeposition of dielectric films onto metals were determined. The conditions of this process were optimized. The features of the above-mentioned signal that can be used to monitor the number of faults and lengths of damaged segments, as well as the features of the deposition of dielectric films onto metals were justified.

It consists of two interleaved and electrically isolated sets of wires with uniform tension, which can keep parallel, equidistant, and coplanar over a wide temperature range, making the BNG reliable and robust.

In this paper, we introduced a progressively reduced pretension method, which allows directly and sequentially <b>winding</b> <b>wires</b> on the substrate without using a template. Theoretical analysis shows that by applying proper pretension to each wire when fixing it onto the substrate, the final wire tensions of all wires can be uniform.

It is well recognized that insulating system of low voltage motor fed by converter is exposed to electrical stresses arising from repetitive square waveform of supplying voltage while additional impact of temperature, vibrations and environmental operation conditions are imposed. The implementation of wide bandgap power semiconductors as SiC and GaN in recent years allows to create very powerful converters with high switching speed. On the other hand it leads to a remarkable increasing electro-thermal constraints applied to windings' turn-to-turn insulation of motors fed by such converters. The relevance of new testing methods and test benches is well found by remarkable modern advances in semiconductors technology.

To achieve longitudinal striped fabric spinning machines is necessary to have all tensioning mechanism dispensing rolls which requires their special construction. The homogeneity of the fabric {{from the point of view}} of the warp yarns tension must be ensured by synchronizing operation of the tensioning two cutting mechanisms of the two reels on which the wires are wound with a degree of waving and thus the fuel consumption at the different weaving. It is recommended that the design be adopted average float bonds, such that the wires can be wrapped around more than two final reels. In terms of manufacturing technology with longitudinal stripes fabrics have a more complicated and expensive technology to cross-striped fabrics for the manufacture of which technology is simplified. Cross-striped fabrics containing groups of warp threads those linked to floating average is materially different. Due to this degree of crimping of wires in the stripes with different bonds makes their contract to be different, having a direct influence on the wires consumption. The different contraction of wire weaving makes warp yarn length, contained in a linked reports are so different that it requires <b>winding</b> <b>wires</b> with different bonds also differing on the final rolls...|$|E
