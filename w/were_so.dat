5|$|When 74 Ts {{turbines}} {{were initially}} installed, {{the problems with}} them <b>were</b> <b>so</b> significant that all her power and propulsion machinery had to be rebuilt. She was launched {{for a second time}} on 26 June 1914.|$|E

5|$|According to a Soviet General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts <b>were</b> <b>so</b> successful that German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only}} a vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E
5|$|After a {{training}} camp near Nice in southern France Simpson rode in the one-day Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne in Belgium, finishing second to 's Arthur Decabooter. The conditions <b>were</b> <b>so</b> cold, he only completed {{the race to}} keep warm. Albert Beurick started Simpson's supporters club at the Café Den Engel, raising £250 {{for him in the}} first nine months. In Paris–Nice, his tyre punctured during stage four, losing five minutes and used the rest of the race for training.|$|E

5|$|Arnold, {{convinced}} that Crown Point {{was no longer}} viable {{as a point of}} defense against the large British force, destroyed and abandoned the fort, moving the forces stationed there to Ticonderoga. General Carleton, rather than shipping his prisoners back to Quebec, returned them to Ticonderoga under a flag of truce. On their arrival, the released men <b>were</b> <b>so</b> effusive in their praise of Carleton that they were sent home to prevent the desertion of other troops.|$|E
5|$|At the {{testimonial}} dinner, Heikkinen’s six-year-old brother, Donald Heikkinen, {{was asked}} to name the greatest football {{player in the world}} and responded, “Ralph.” Donald offered that Ralph was best because he used “proper technique,” and found it difficult to choose his older brother’s greatest play because “there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many of them.” Referring to the Ohio State game, Donald noted, “Ralph crushed through and smeared ‘em.” Heikkinen, or “Hike” as he was known to Yoopers, was presented with a purse of $36 representing the No. 36 he wore for Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they <b>were</b> <b>so</b> new that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, there <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many {{uncritical}} and unproven speculations about floral {{mechanisms that}} floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the German bombers were {{touching}} {{down in the}} Pas de Calais. Two <b>were</b> <b>so</b> {{badly damaged}} that they were written off in crash landings, bringing the total losses to eight Do 17s. Almost all bore the scars of battle. One machine had sustained 70 hits, another 200.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{began writing}} Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell in 1992; {{ten years later}} she {{submitted}} the manuscript for publication. It was accepted by Bloomsbury and published in September 2004, with illustrations by Portia Rosenberg. Bloomsbury <b>were</b> <b>so</b> sure of its success that they printed 250,000 hardcover copies. The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on the New York Times best-seller list. It was longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize and won the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Novel.|$|E

5|$|Cope's and Marsh's discoveries were {{accompanied}} by sensational accusations of spying, stealing workers and fossils, and bribery. The two men <b>were</b> <b>so</b> protective of their digging sites that they would destroy smaller or damaged fossils {{to prevent them from}} falling into their rival's hands, or fill in their excavations with dirt and rock; while surveying his Como quarries in 1879, Marsh examined recent finds and marked several for destruction. On one occasion the scientists' rival teams fought each other by throwing stones.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economical to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) vessels.
