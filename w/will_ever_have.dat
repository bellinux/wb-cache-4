25|$|Plato was {{an early}} critic of sexual {{intercourse}} in pederastic relationships, proposing that men's love of boys avoid all carnal expression and instead progress from admiration of the lover's specific virtues to love of virtue itself in abstract form.

500|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, the United States Navy {{had almost}} 500,000 {{officers}} and enlisted {{men and women and}} in terms of personnel was the largest in the world. Younger officers were enthusiastic about the potential of land-based naval aviation as well as the potential roles of aircraft carriers. Chief of Naval Operations Benson was not among them. He tried to abolish aviation in 1919 because he could not [...] "conceive of any use the fleet <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> for aviation." [...] However Roosevelt listened to the visionaries and reversed Benson's decision.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Minogue pledged {{her support}} for a {{campaign}} {{to raise money for}} abused children, to be donated to the British charities ChildLine and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. According to the source, around $93 million was raised. She spoke out in relation to the cause, saying: [...] "Finding the courage to tell someone about being abused {{is one of the most}} difficult decisions a child <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> to make."

500|$|Construction of the {{original}} route through Cajon Pass was overseen by Jacob Nash Victor, who by this time had become General Manager of the California Southern. [...] He operated the first train through the pass in 1885, proclaiming [...] "No other railroad <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> the nerve to build through these mountains. [...] All who follow will prefer to rent trackage from us." [...] Victor's assertion remained true for a while as the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad (which later became part of Union Pacific Railroad) signed an agreement to operate over the California Southern track via trackage rights on April 26, 1905, but Victor was proven wrong eighty years later when SP built the Palmdale Cutoff in 1967 at a slightly higher elevation through the pass. [...] In honor of his work through the pass, the city of Victorville was named after Victor.|$|E
500|$|The {{visual effects}} were {{done by the}} Vancouver-based Image Engine. Before the broadcasting, Atlantis visual effects {{supervisor}} Mark Savela revealed that the episode would have the [...] "biggest effects sequence viewers <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> seen," [...] which involved the epic space battle in {{the climax of the}} episode. Savela intended the visual effects to top the minute-long sequence of the Horizon missiles firing to the Asuran homeworld in the season three finale [...] "First Strike". The sequence was reportedly so complicated {{that for the first time}} in the series, models were used to physically map out the action before creating the initial animatics. Gero later stated that the episode had a battle sequence that [...] "we will not be able to top. It is the greatest special effects sequence that the show has ever done." [...] The episode used an extent of special effects and had one of the highest budgets in the entire series, comparable with the series' pilot episode [...] "Rising".|$|E

500|$|The next {{supernova}} in the Milky Way {{will likely}} be detectable even if it occurs {{on the far side}} of the galaxy. [...] It is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as 2MASS. [...] There is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant, luminous blue variable, or WolfRayet. [...] The chances of the next supernova being a Type Ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova. [...] Again it should be observable wherever it occurs, but it is less likely that the progenitor <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> been observed. It isn't even known exactly what a Type Ia progenitor system looks like, and difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs. [...] The total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be between 2 and 12 per century, although we haven't actually observed one for several centuries.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was again}} praised by Wisden {{in its report}} on the 1948 tour. [...] "Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, {{hard-working}} and always genial," [...] it said. [...] "Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson said {{there had not been}} a discordant note in the party throughout the tour." [...] Flanagan labelled Johnson as [...] "conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy". He {{went on to say that}} [...] "No organization, no body corporate, no individual could ever hope to have a more loyal, a more devoted, or a more conscientious officer...Although to the world in general all the praise and glory for the unequalled triumph the tour proved to be goes to Sir Donald Bradman, only those who travelled with the team <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> a proper conception of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson." [...] Bradman said that Johnson [...] "created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager". On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the memento.|$|E

2500|$|The {{process of}} {{development}} in plants is fundamentally different from that seen in vertebrate animals. [...] When an animal embryo begins to develop, it will very early produce all of the body parts that it <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> in its life. When the animal is born (or hatches from its egg), it has all its body parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature. By contrast, plants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life from meristems located at the tips of organs, or between mature tissues. Thus, a living plant always has embryonic tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Fourthly, plant {{morphology}} {{examines the}} pattern of development, {{the process by which}} structures originate and mature as a plant grows. [...] While animals produce all the body parts they <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> from early in their life, plants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life. [...] A living plant always has embryonic tissues. [...] The way in which new structures mature as they are produced may be affected by the point in the plant's life when they begin to develop, {{as well as by the}} environment to which the structures are exposed. [...] A morphologist studies this process, the causes, and its result. [...] This area of plant morphology overlaps with plant physiology and ecology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} against early {{diagnosis and treatment}} {{is based on the}} logic that many small thyroid cancers (mostly papillary) will not grow or metastasize. This viewpoint holds the overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed (that is, will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if nothing is ever done about the cancer). [...] Including these overdiagnosed cases skews the statistics by lumping clinically significant cases in with apparently harmless cancers. [...] Thyroid cancer is incredibly common, with autopsy studies of people dying from other causes showing that more than one-third of older adults technically have thyroid cancer, which is causing them no harm. [...] It is easy to detect nodules that might be cancerous, simply by feeling the throat, which contributes to the level of overdiagnosis. Benign (non-cancerous) nodules frequently co-exist with thyroid cancer; sometimes, it is a benign nodule that is discovered but surgery uncovers an incidental small thyroid cancer. Increasingly, small thyroid nodules are discovered as incidental findings on imaging (CT scan, MRI, ultrasound) performed for another purpose very few of these people with accidentally discovered, symptom-free thyroid cancers <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> any symptoms, and treatment in such patients has the potential to cause harm to them, not to help them.|$|E

2500|$|Like Fey, Liz {{is a big}} fan of the Star Wars film franchise, often using {{events from}} the {{original}} trilogy to explain her feelings and actions in daily life.

In [...] "The Source Awards", Liz mentions that for the four past Halloweens in a row, she has dressed up as Princess Leia. She has also dressed as the character during jury selection in order to be disqualified from serving. Liz considers [...] to be the worst film of the series.
