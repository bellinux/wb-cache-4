2500|$|Following {{a decade}} of {{droughts}} in the 1930s, Federal and state governments joined with private interest group to saving North America’s rapidly disappearing wetlands. [...] The result {{was the creation of}} many federal and state wildlife refuges. [...] This was especially important along the migratory bird flyways. [...] The Federal Aid to <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Restoration</b> Act of 1937 (also known as the Pittman–Robertson Act) helped finance land acquisition, habitat development, and refuge infrastructure at the Summer Lake Wildlife Area.|$|E
2500|$|The state's {{first game}} {{management}} area opened in 1926, and by 1936 {{the state had}} 46 areas (now called [...] "game preserves") in operation. The first three preservation areas to be set aside were at Snow Creek (along the Missouri River in northern Garfield County), Pryor Mountain (now the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range), and the Gallatin River (in Gallatin County). On September 2, 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the Federal Aid in <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Restoration</b> Act (commonly known as the Pittman-Robertson Act for its two key sponsors, Representative Absalom Willis Robertson ]- and Senator Key Pittman ]-). The law created an excise tax on ammunition, archery equipment, handguns, and hunting firearms, and apportioned the revenue among state wildlife agencies on a matching funds basis (with the provision that each state ban the diversion of hunting and fishing license revenue to other uses). Montana used these funds to purchase its first wildlife management area in 1938 (as of 2005 it had 84). The state used these funds to hire its first wildlife biologist in 1940. Congress passed the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act in 1950 (which was almost identical to the 1937 act, funding its activities through excise taxes on fishing gear and equipment), allowing the Montana Fish and Game Commission to hire fisheries biologists, establish its first fisheries management projects, and initiate the first studies of problems affecting fisheries (such as logging and dams).|$|E
