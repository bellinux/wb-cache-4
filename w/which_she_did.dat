5|$|On 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Sylvia Henry.

5|$|Sayers {{was educated}} {{at home and}} then at the University of Oxford. This was unusual for a woman at the time, as they were not {{admitted}} as full members of the university until 1920 – five years after Sayers had completed her first class degree in medieval French. In 1916, a year after her graduation, Sayer published her first book, a collection of poems entitled Op. I, which she followed two years later with a second, a slim volume titled Catholic Tales and Christian Songs. The same year she was invited to edit and contribute to the annual editions of Oxford Poetry, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> for the next three years. In 1923 she published Whose Body?, a murder mystery novel featuring the fictional Lord Peter Wimsey, and went on to write eleven novels and five collections of short stories about the character.

5|$|Sawicka's {{time at the}} Lucan {{household}} ended late in March 1973. While {{with two}} of the children near Grosvenor Place, she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made wards of court and that she must release them into his custody, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> Frances was collected from school later in the day. Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three months ahead, for June 1973. To defend herself against Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments in camera, on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.|$|E
