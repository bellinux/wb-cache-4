5|$|Wheelchair: The {{earliest}} {{records of}} <b>wheeled</b> furniture are an inscription {{found on a}} stone slate in China and a child’s bed depicted in a frieze on a Greek vase, both dating between the 6th and 5th century BCE. The first records of <b>wheeled</b> seats being used for transporting disabled people date to three centuries later in China; the Chinese used early wheelbarrows to move {{people as well as}} heavy objects. A distinction between the two functions was not made until around 525 CE, when images of <b>wheeled</b> chairs made specifically to carry people begin to occur in Chinese art.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth century, <b>wheeled</b> or wheel-using creatures {{featured}} in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including Clifford D. Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Some of these works address the developmental and biomechanical constraints on <b>wheeled</b> creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic axles, and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.|$|E

50|$|There are two <b>wheels,</b> {{the larger}} driving <b>wheel</b> for {{travelling}} in a forward direction, and a trailing steering <b>wheel</b> and 90 degrees to this one. Both the drive <b>wheel</b> and the steering <b>wheel</b> however are constructed of multiple smaller 'planet' <b>wheels</b> {{that allow the}} <b>wheel</b> to be moved laterally. When moving forward the main <b>wheel</b> will be powered and the smaller planet <b>wheels</b> on the steering <b>wheel</b> will rotate to avoid the steering <b>wheel</b> dragging.

5|$|She {{could carry}} five floatplanes and {{two to four}} regular, <b>wheeled</b> aircraft. The latter would {{have to return to}} land after launch, but the {{seaplanes}} would take off and land in the water alongside the carrier, lifted on and off the ship by the cranes. Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a Short Folder, two Wight Pushers, three Sopwith Type 807 seaplanes and two to four Sopwith Tabloid <b>wheeled</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for <b>wheeled</b> vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than <b>wheeled</b> vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than <b>wheeled</b> vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E
5|$|Air-Cobot (Aircraft Inspection {{enhanced}} by smaRt & Collaborative rOBOT) is a French {{research and development}} project of a <b>wheeled</b> collaborative mobile robot able to inspect aircraft during maintenance operations.

5|$|In August 1945, the Fat Man was {{assembled}} on Tinian by Project Alberta personnel. When {{the physics}} package was fully assembled and wired, it was placed inside its ellipsoidal aerodynamic bombshell and <b>wheeled</b> out, {{where it was}} signed by nearly 60 people, including Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell and Captain William S. Parsons. It was then <b>wheeled</b> to the bomb bay of the B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar after its normally assigned command pilot, Captain Frederick C.

5|$|Seals from Tell Brak and Nabada {{dated to}} the pre-Akkadian kingdom, {{revealed}} {{the use of}} four-wheeled wagons and war carriages. Excavation in area FS recovered clay models of equids and wagons dated to the Akkadian and post-Akkadian periods. The models provide information about the types of wagons used during that period (2350–2000 BC), and they include four <b>wheeled</b> vehicles and two types of two <b>wheeled</b> vehicles; {{the first is a}} cart with fixed seats and the second is a cart where the driver stands above the axle. The chariots were introduced during the Mitanni era, and none of the pre-Mitanni carriages can be considered chariots, as they are mistakenly described in some sources.|$|E
50|$|A {{steering}} <b>wheel</b> is a <b>wheel</b> {{that turns}} {{to change the}} direction of a vehicle. A trailer <b>wheel</b> is one that is neither a drive <b>wheel,</b> nor a steer <b>wheel.</b> Front-wheel drive vehicles typically have the rear <b>wheels</b> as trailer <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{processes}} of evolution, {{as they are}} presently understood, can help explain why <b>wheeled</b> locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} to have been {{equipped}} with two 82m-long hangar decks for <b>wheeled</b> aircraft and a third 128m-long hangar deck for seaplanes; all of the hangars were 18.5m wide. The flight deck would have been 128.5m long and 18.7m wide. All three of the hangars and flight deck were intended to have been mounted above the main structural deck. The ship's designers intended to mount a take off deck on the bow, which would have been 30m long and 10.5m wide. According to naval historian Erich Gröner, the ship was designed to carry either 13 fixed-wing or 19 folding-wing seaplanes, along with around 10 <b>wheeled</b> aircraft. Rene Greger estimated the ship to carry eight to ten fighter aircraft and a combination of fifteen to twenty bombers and torpedo-floatplanes.|$|E
5|$|Using human {{manufacturing}} processes, <b>wheeled</b> {{systems of}} varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, {{and issues of}} power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of embryonic development are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.|$|E

50|$|These {{types of}} engines, that Casey pilots, are very {{different}} and have different <b>wheel</b> arrangements, such as the 4-6-0s having ten <b>wheels</b> (four leading, six driving <b>wheels,</b> and no trailing <b>wheels),</b> and the 4-4-0s having eight <b>wheels</b> (four leading, four driving <b>wheels,</b> and no trailing <b>wheels).</b>|$|R
5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for an {{aircraft}} carrier that could fly off <b>wheeled</b> aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch <b>wheeled</b> aircraft, but {{had no way to}} recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty {{an aircraft carrier}} design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and the company began work on converting the ship.|$|E
5|$|In its {{standard}} configuration the IFV {{would have a}} crew of three and carry a squad of nine. The vehicle could be reconfigured to support casualty evacuation.

Armistead's brigade followed closely behind. As the division <b>wheeled</b> to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery's guns and the front of Doubleday's Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard's Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper's brigade. At about this time, Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled.|$|E
