25|$|The {{interpretation}} of the correlations as fixed size quanta travelling along random walks gives a way of understanding why the critical dimension of the H4 interaction is 4. The term H4 {{can be thought of}} as the square of the density of the random walkers at any point. In order for such a term to alter the finite order correlation functions, which only introduce a few new random <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fluctuating environment, the new paths must intersect. Otherwise, the square of the density is just proportional to the density and only shifts the H2 coefficient by a constant. But the intersection probability of random walks depends on the dimension, and random walks in dimension higher than 4 do not intersect.|$|E

25|$|In Dune, the Bene Gesserit {{breeding}} scheme is, in theory, to {{have come}} to full fruition from the union of an Atreides daughter (planned to be born of the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica and the Duke Leto Atreides) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, nephew of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (himself secretly the natural father of the Lady Jessica). This plan is disrupted when Jessica chooses to conceive an Atreides son rather than the daughter she had been ordered to produce. This son, Paul Atreides, later proves to be the Kwisatz Haderach, born a generation early. Political intrigue results in Paul's rise to power as Emperor of the Known Universe, secured by his stranglehold on the melange supply. A decade later, in Dune Messiah, the Bene Gesserit are frustrated {{to be at the}} mercy of their own creation, but a conspiracy to remove Paul from power fails. He realizes, however, that while prescience grants knowledge, absolute control of outcomes is not possible due to interference patterns caused by their own actions. Despising the religion that has risen up around him and seeing where it will lead, Paul <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> desert seeking death in hopes that he can change the course of the future. Paul's son Leto II is also a Kwisatz Haderach; seeing the same future, Leto decides to do what his father could not. He takes control of both the empire and the Bene Gesserit breeding program in Children of Dune, and begins his own transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid to give himself the time he needs for his Golden Path to be fully realized. Thirty-five hundred years later, his breeding plan produces Siona Atreides, the first in a line of humans who are able to disappear from prescient sight, and Leto allows himself to be assassinated. After 1,500 more years (as chronicled in Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune), the Bene Gesserit have restored their breeding program. However, they are too terrified of the consequences of producing another Kwisatz Haderach, so instead breed for special individuals of great talent and usefulness in order to amplify certain human characteristics and preserve them. Now aware of Leto's Golden Path, the Bene Gesserit widen their goals of advancing humanity and saving it from extinction.|$|E
25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E
