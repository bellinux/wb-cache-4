25|$|Butkus {{recovered}} 27 fumbles in his career, an NFL {{record at}} the time of his retirement. One of his greatest strengths was his ability to rip the ball from a ball carrier's hands. Although back then the statistic was not kept, it has been noted that Butkus <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> one of the all-time leaders in the forced fumbles category.|$|E
25|$|Though Carson's {{program was}} based in Burbank {{beginning}} in 1972, NBC's editing and production services for the program were located in New York, resulting in the requirement that Carson's program be transmitted from Burbank to New York. In 1976, NBC used the Satcom 2 satellite to do this, feeding the live taping (which usually {{took place in the}} early evening) directly to New York, where it would be edited prior to the normal broadcast. This live feed lasted usually from two to two-and-a-half hours a night and was uncensored and commercial-free. During the commercial breaks, the audio and picture would be left on, capturing at times risqué language and other events that <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> edited out later going out over the feed.|$|E
25|$|From one perspective, its {{proximity}} to the kings' tombs, and its simple design, is by some scholars thought {{to indicate that the}} cube was a Zoroastrian temple, and the Naqsh-e Rustam was more than a mere place for grieving of the deceased kings, but a grand festive center where crowds would gather on festive days to observe the king pray to Ahuramazda, and bask in the structure's magnitude while praying to Ahuramazda. This <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> logical as the city was also adjacent to Istakhr, a major religious and cultural center. The concept of the temple being used as a fire sanctuary, is however not likely because there is no general ventilation for smoke and gasses, and also that it differs so drastically, architecturally and aesthetically from other well known contemporary temple sites in Pars.|$|E

25|$|To prevent {{more people}} from dying, Tris offers herself over to Erudite and {{is placed in}} a cell by Peter and, to her shock, Caleb, {{both of whom are}} now working with Jeanine. However, Tobias follows her and ends up {{becoming}} captured, although he states that he has managed to convince Dauntless to ally themselves with the factionless, with the upcoming insurgency scheduled several days afterward. After unsuccessful simulation tests, Jeanine orders for Tris' execution, but Peter, in return for Tris' rescue of him at the Amity sector, has swapped the serum for a paralytic serum beforehand and also frees Tobias, allowing the trio a chance to escape back to the Abnegation sector. There, Tris meets with Marcus, who tells her that Jeanine is withholding the information that Abnegation protected; should the factionless take hold of it, it <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The above {{result may}} or may not be {{perceived}} as surprising. A classical system would display the same property, and a hidden variable theory (see below) <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for the outcome of a measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle. This may certainly be perceived as surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.|$|E
25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

25|$|Egg {{collecting}} {{for food}} {{on a massive}} scale was frequent in the past but is now outlawed. It is to be noted that the sooty terns for example could sustain occasional collection of effectively all of a season's eggs (over 10 million), if given sufficient time to recover and if cats are absent. Even egg collecting on a scale that significantly decreases costly food imports thus in theory could be possible, but not until the cat and rat populations have been brought under control. Poaching remains a concern; with the population rising and spreading out on Kiritimati, formerly remote bird colonies became more accessible and especially the red-tailed tropicbirds and the Sula are strongly affected by hunting and disturbance. Tropicbirds are mainly poached for their feathers which are used in local arts and handicraft; it <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> possible to obtain them from living birds as it was routinely done {{at the height of the}} Polynesian civilization.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Byrne and Mclean's {{findings}} differed {{slightly from}} Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa {{in that the}} drive for thinness was the major cause of purging {{as a way of}} controlling weight. In turn, Byrne and Mclean argued that this makes the individual vulnerable to binging, indicating {{that it is not a}} binge-purge cycle but rather a purge-binge cycle in that purging comes before bingeing. Similarly, Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is not necessarily applicable to every individual and is certainly reductionist. Everyone differs from another, and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to everyone <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> invalid. In addition, the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the Western society. To evaluate, Fairburn et al..'s model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory, as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect, because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa.|$|E

In one interview, Minaj {{rejected}} the comparison, but in another interview, she said that she is inspired by Gaga's creativity.

[...] She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. [...] "If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Howard, though, {{denied that}} Stengel had shouted racial epithets at the Dodgers, and [...] "I never felt any {{prejudice}} around Casey." [...] Al Jackson, a black pitcher with the Mets under Stengel, concurred, [...] "He never treated me with anything but respect." [...] According to Bill Bishop {{in his account}} of Stengel, [...] "Casey did use language that <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> considered offensive today, but was quite common vernacular in the fifties. He was effusive in his praise of black players like Satchel Paige, Larry Doby and Howard." [...] Conscious of changing times, Stengel was more careful in his choice of words while with the Mets.|$|E

[...] On the third, Lincoln had 231½ to Seward's 180 after the roll call, but Ohio changed four votes from Chase to Lincoln, giving the Illinoian the {{nomination}} and starting a small stampede; the nomination was eventually made unanimous.

He wrote that the game provided [...] "a more polished impression" [...] than either The Secret of Monkey Island or [...] The writer stated that its high system requirements were its only drawback, and believed that a Sound Blaster card was required to fully appreciate the game.
