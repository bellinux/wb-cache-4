25|$|One of the {{findings}} of Fortna about <b>where</b> <b>do</b> peacekeepers go is that “peacekeeping is a matter of supply and demand” From the supply side, she observes that there is unlikely a Peacekeeping mission in civil wars on countries close to {{one of the members of}} the Security Council. From the demand side, there is diverse evidence that peacekeeping missions are deployed in the countries who need it the most, this is where the risk of a recurring war is high.|$|E

Although, on the backdrop of russian revolution, he found his thought process very compatible to the philosophy of socialism after he caught his conscience, so only he stood and won very first election of 1951 under the banner of socialist party. After passing high school, he indulged himself in quit India movement on gandhi's call for immediate independence with passive resistance and went to attend the mass meeting held at gowalia tank maidan in Bombay, <b>where</b> <b>Do</b> or Die was coined by gandhi.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{motivation}} {{refers to}} the performance of an activity in order to attain a desired outcome and it is the opposite of intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is <b>where</b> <b>do</b> people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation. Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in a fetal position with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, <b>Where</b> <b>Do</b> We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E

500|$|The first chapter, [...] "Gauguin's Questions", {{poses the}} {{questions}} that {{provide a framework for}} the book. Referring to Paul Gauguin's painting of the same name the questions are: <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> we come from? What are we? Where are we going? Wright defines progress using the Victorian terms [...] "the assumption that a pattern of change exists in the history of mankind...that it consists of irreversible changes in one direction only, and that this direction is towards improvement". Despite the extended time span of the Stone Age, Wright places the first sign of progress as being the ability to create fire. The competition between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals is examined with respect to the conditions that allowed one to out-compete the other.|$|E
500|$|The developers' {{theory is}} that the {{international}} attention gained through large developments and having the world's tallest building will incur gentrification of the country and even be a financial success in the long run. Rory Olcayto, deputy editor of The Architects’ Journal, said [...] "The race to build the highest skyscraper is quite futile – <b>where</b> <b>do</b> you stop? These buildings are a symbol of an old-fashioned way of thinking,” while architect Adrian Smith, the designer of the tower, states, [...] "...this tower symbolizes the Kingdom as an important global business and cultural leader, and demonstrates the strength and creative vision of its people. It represents new growth and high-performance technology fused into one powerful iconic form." [...] However, Bob Sinn, principal engineer at Thornton Tomasetti, stated that the practical challenges of building supertall buildings are greater than the structural challenges.|$|E

500|$|Impressed by Graham's {{performances}} in Northwestern's wins over the Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and {{offered him a}} contract worth $7,500 per year ($ in [...] dollars) in 1945 {{to play for a}} professional team he was coaching in Cleveland in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing, however, and Brown added a monthly stipend of $250 ($ in [...] ) {{until the end of the}} war. It was a large amount of money at the time. [...] "All I asked was, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> I sign?" [...] Graham said later. [...] "Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever." [...] Graham was also drafted by the National Football League's Detroit Lions, but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore {{had always}} professed a dislike of the acting profession, but in 1900 he was persuaded {{by his father}} to join him on stage for a few {{performances}} of a short play, [...] "A Man of the World". He appeared in the same piece again the following year, but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income, {{rather than as a}} possible future career. In October 1901, Ethel was appearing in Philadelphia in Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable. She persuaded the director to allow Barrymore to accept the part of the minor character, and Barrymore traveled from New York, learning his lines on the train. In the first act, he stopped {{in the middle of his}} dialogue, unable to remember the text, and asked the audience and his fellow actors, [...] "I've blown up. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> we go from here?", which led the cast to improvise the remainder of the scene.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Mehldau also {{recorded}} Highway Rider, an album that combined his usual trio with guest musicians and a 28-piece orchestra. Again based compositionally {{on the theme}} of travel or a journey, the album was produced by Brion, and, in critic Mike Hobart's description, [...] "probes the confluence of the arbitrary and non-arbitrary in music, of balancing what is committed to the page with improvisation." [...] This was pursued further in the winter of 2010–11, in public performances of pieces from the album in the US and Europe. Mehldau's trio returned to the studio {{for the first time in}} several years in 2008 and again in 2011, resulting in Ode, an album of the pianist's originals, and <b>Where</b> <b>Do</b> You Start, an album of covers. Down Beat reviewer Jim Macnie commented that, on the former album, [...] "More than ever, Mehldau uses his instrument as a drum, popping staccato notes into the maw of the rhythm section's formidable bustle." ...|$|E

500|$|The role of {{the player}} {{character}} in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of [...] "chosen one", Oblivion would have the player character [...] "find him, protect him, and help him." [...] Aside from that, {{in the opinion of}} Hines, [...] "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel [...] "epic", simply {{because of the way the}} gamespace is designed: with openness in mind. Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to [...] "walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants", but given the scenario where the player asks [...] "'OK, I'm ready to do the next part of the main quest, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> I go?'", the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid [...] "confusion" [...] and [...] "downtime".|$|E
500|$|... "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] was {{produced}} by Eric Foster White. Described by Spears as a [...] "soulful" [...] ballad, it draws influence from teen pop and lasts for five minutes and ten seconds. Chuck Taylor of Billboard noted that the singer [...] "turn toward the sad side" [...] on the track, with its lyrics talking {{about the loss of}} a first love and how breaking up can be hard. As the song begins, Spears declares, [...] "'Never look back', we said / How was I to know I'd miss you so? / Loneliness up ahead, emptyness behind / <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> I go?" [...] During the chorus, she realizes that she has lost her true love, stating, [...] "From the bottom of my broken heart, even though time may find me somebody new / You were my real love, I never knew love, till there was you." [...] According to sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] is composed in the key of G major and is set in time signature of common time with a slowly tempo of 76 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Campbell {{went through}} five {{audition}}s {{for the role}} of Brisco before he was hired. In his first audition with the casting director, Campbell spontaneously did a standing flip. The stunt impressed the casting director so much that during each subsequent audition, Campbell was asked to do the flip again. In his final audition, Campbell assured the network executives that if hired for the role, he would work hard to make the show a success. In an interview, Campbell said, [...] "It's every actor's dream to play a cowboy, so when this opportunity came up, I mean, yeah, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> I sign?" [...] He added that working on Brisco provided him with acting opportunities he would not have otherwise had. Cuse said getting Campbell [...] "was just one of those collisions between an actor and a script that was just perfect... I can't imagine Brisco having ever existed without him." [...] Writing in Auxiliary Magazine, Luke Copping claimed that Brisco was Campbell's [...] "last great" [...] role before the actor fell into [...] "a period of self-parody and overt camp that he did not redeem himself from until joining the cast of Burn Notice".|$|E
