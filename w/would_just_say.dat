It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control."

2500|$|In September 2012, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Young had {{spent much of}} the $34 million salary he earned in the NFL and was facing financial problems after defaulting on a $1.9 million high interest payday loan. Young filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the lender, Pro Player Funding LLC, from enforcing a judgment of nearly $1.7 million with a claim that the loan documents were forged and he did not knowingly execute the loan. However, Young had authorized $1 million in loan payments to Pro Player directly from his Eagles salary prior to defaulting and Young's signatures on loan documents were notarized. Young also filed lawsuits against his former agent, Major Adams, and a North Carolina financial planner, Ronnie Peoples, alleging that they misappropriated $5.5 million of funds. When asked to give a general assessment of Young's finances, Young's attorney, Trey Dolezal, stated [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> that Vince needs a job." [...] Young's financial problems have reportedly been a result of lavish spending and, by his account, the betrayal of trusted advisers.|$|E

"True Romance" [...] was {{recorded}} {{late into the}} process; drums for the entire album had already been recorded and the group's drummer, Tony Thaxton, was to be leaving town on a plane the very next day; he tracked drums two hours prior to his flight. [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] was described as [...] "just a quirky love song {{about a guy who}} doesn't really get it." [...] Cain's guitar solo was written as a joke of sorts, but was eventually kept on the record which Cain later found amusing. [...] "Timelines" [...] is directly autobiographical, covering Pierre's beginnings in Catholic school, a stuttering problem, and losing his virginity at 17. It was developed from an acoustic guitar lick Cain created while on tour; the initial eight bars of the song were recorded and quickly forgotten about. Taylor later found the file when sifting through his computer, and the band tackled the song from there. The influence behind the lyrics came from Pierre's father.

2500|$|The {{album was}} written and rehearsed at David Bowie's home in Haddon Hall, Beckenham, an Edwardian mansion {{converted}} to a block of flats that was described by one visitor as having an ambiance [...] "like Dracula's living room". As Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie at the time, the music was largely arranged by guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist/producer Tony Visconti. Although Bowie is officially credited as the composer of all music on the album, biographer Peter Doggett quoted Visconti saying [...] "the songs were written by all four of us. We'd jam in a basement, and Bowie <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> whether he liked them or not." [...] In Doggett's narrative, [...] "The band (sometimes with Bowie contributing guitar, sometimes not) would record an instrumental track, which {{might or might not}} be based upon an original Bowie idea. Then, at the last possible moment, Bowie would reluctantly uncurl himself from the sofa on which he was lounging with his wife, and dash off a set of lyrics." [...] Despite his annoyance with Bowie's fixation on married life during the recording of The Man Who Sold the World, Visconti still rated it as his best work with Bowie until 1980's Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps).|$|E

Those Spaniards who <b>would</b> not <b>just</b> <b>say</b> le anyway for the reasons explained in the last paragraph are likely to use le in this case.

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of her career until 1990, Graf regularly played doubles events in Grand Slams and other tournaments, winning a total of 11 titles. In 1986, she formed a partnership with rival Gabriela Sabatini. The pair was moderately successful, winning the 1988 Wimbledon Championships [...] together and reaching the finals of the French Open in 1986, 1987 and 1989. The partnership was the subject of much discussion, as the two women, both known to be shy, usually kept communication to a minimum during changeovers and between points, a highly unusual situation in doubles. Sabatini said of the partnership: [...] "doubles is all about communicating with each other, and we didn't communicate that much. We <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> the basic things, but nothing else." [...] The pair played their last major tournament together at the 1990 Wimbledon Championships, losing in the quarterfinals. From 1991 until the end of her career, Graf would only play doubles sporadically, forming short-term partnerships with a variety of players, including Lori McNeil, Anke Huber and her best friends on the tour, Rennae Stubbs, Patricia Tarabini and Ines Gorrochategui. She played her last Grand Slam doubles tournament at the 1999 Australian Open with Gorrochategui, losing in the second round.|$|E
2500|$|The most remembered shot where Davis {{missed the}} fine {{cut into the}} corner pocket was {{unfortunately}} not discussed in detail. Davis states [...] "I was saying to myself, don't hit it thick" [...] and [...] "that's how you bottle it, by hitting it thick." [...] However he did not elaborate on whether {{he was forced to}} use side spin to avoid a possible in off foul stroke into the middle pocket (This would have cost him the match) or whether he played it with centre ball striking. He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever {{came up to me and}} asked if the match was fixed, I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> yeah it was, yeah. It's just not even worth arguing with people like that." [...] Davis allowed himself to joke about the defeat, making a joke about being asked by a petrol station attendant if he wanted glasses (free tumblers) and has now admitted that he will probably be remembered more for the final he did not win in 1985 than for the six he did. But barely months after the final he states [...] "although I lost the match, it was great to be involved in. To be involved in something like that." [...] The programme was later released on DVD as [...] "The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time" [...] by Retro Videos. Both players now commentate on BBC's snooker coverage and are often reminded of that match. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|E

She was given a strong storyline that truly fit with her character's manic energy and she's nailed every scene like a conquering hero. Her hesitance to erase Lundy's name from the case board at the end was great, and so was her realization that focusing on work didn't wind up filling the void in her life; that solving the case didn't bring her any closure.

[...] I'd also like {{to take the time}} to bring up Courtney Ford's Christine Hill. Let's face it.

His theory was that in his childhood it had been a much completer thing, but that the circumstances had broken down in a sort of decadence, and now there was nothing left of it but that scraping in the door-lock, like somebody trying to turn a misfit key. I used to throw things at his door, and once I tried a cold-water douche from the pitcher, when he was very hard to waken; but that was rather brutal, and after a while I used to let him roar himself awake; he would always do it, if I trusted to nature; and before our junior year was out I got so that I could sleep through, pretty calmly; I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> to myself when he fetched me to the surface with a yell, 'That's Melford dreaming,' and doze off sweetly." ...|$|E

Everybody in the connection, I suppose, has taken turns trying to reconcile them, but nobody has succeeded. I don't believe that Romney has ever so much as THOUGHT of any other woman in his whole life, and certainly Lucinda has never thought of any other man. You will notice she still wears Romney's ring.

He's always hanging about where she is--when other people are there, too, that is. He avoids her like a plague when she is alone. That was why he was stuck out in the blue room with us to-day.
