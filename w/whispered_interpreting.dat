50|$|In <b>whispered</b> <b>interpreting</b> (chuchotage, in French) {{sometimes}} called whispering simultaneous, the interpreter does not normally whisper, but simply speaks softly using voiced speech. This necessitates very {{close proximity to}} the target(s) and can be tiring due to the posture adopted.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} of sandwiching {{the translation of}} an unknown expression {{can be carried out}} very discreetly in the tone of an aside, as a kind of <b>whispered</b> <b>interpreting.</b> It should be a central technique as it is the quickest way to make authentic classroom communication possible: statement in L2, restatement in L1 and again in L2; L2 =>L1=>L2.|$|E
40|$|The {{rational}} {{behind the}} selection of papers presented in this volume is discussed as way of introduction. Interpreting with English is a major feature that prevails throughout the eleven chapters which cover genres in as many interpreting scenarios. English is recognized worldwide as being a major lingua franca today in numerous interlinguistic communicative settings and is increasingly being adopted internationally as a language for business, science and international negotiation. Though the principal aim of interpreting to transfer a message from one language to another (be it spoken or signed) remains unchanged, modes of transfer have adapted according to work requirements, from simultaneous interpreting in traditional conference settings, to consecutive, <b>whispering</b> or remote <b>interpreting</b> in various kinds of meeting or public service encounters. Interpreting follows all areas of human activity, thus, interpreters are confronted with an infinite range of linguistic, textual, cultural and generic features in the workplace. Multiple perspectives and research methodologies emerge from chapters covering media, medical, business, political, literary, military and legal genres...|$|R
60|$|The great council-lodge of the Delawares rang with {{savage and}} fiery eloquence. Wingenund paced slowly before the orators. Wise as he was, he wanted advice before {{deciding}} {{what was to}} be done with the missionary. The brothers had been taken to the chief, who immediately called a council. The Indians sat in a half circle around the lodge. The prisoners, with hands bound, guarded by two brawny braves, stood in one corner gazing with curiosity and apprehension at this formidable array. Jim knew some of the braves, but the majority of those who spoke bitterly against the palefaces had never frequented the Village of Peace. Nearly all were of the Wolf tribe of Delawares. Jim <b>whispered</b> to Joe, <b>interpreting</b> that part of the speeches bearing upon the disposal to be made of them. Two white men, dressed in Indian garb, held prominent positions before Wingenund. The boys saw a resemblance between one of these men and Jim Girty, and accordingly concluded he was the famous renegade, or so-called white Indian, Simon Girty. The other man was probably Elliott, the Tory, with whom Girty had deserted from Fort Pitt. Jim Girty was not present. Upon nearing the encampment he had taken his captive and disappeared in a ravine.|$|R
40|$|Spatial and Embodied Aspects of Interpreted Interaction in Court – Abstract This article investigates {{spatial and}} {{embodied}} aspects of face-to-face interaction in court interpreting and discusses {{the implications of}} spatial and seating arrangements for interpreter-mediated communication in the courtroom. In addition, it challenges the public belief that interpreting is a solely verbal phenomenon. The data analyzed is video data from a district court criminal hearing in Finland. The article first analyzes the physical surroundings of the interaction space. It then focuses on bodily resources of interaction such as gaze, gestures and head movements as displayed in interaction fragments. The fragments include examples from consecutive as well as <b>whispered</b> <b>interpreting.</b> Finally, the article makes the claim that interpreting is essentially an embodied form of interaction, since the findings provide strong evidence that visibility and audibility {{play an important role}} in various phases of the interpreted hearing. Additionally, the article questions the requirements of the standard ISO 13611 (2014) ...|$|E
