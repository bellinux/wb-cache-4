50|$|The <b>white-spotted</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos albomaculatus) {{is a type}} of ray. It {{is found}} in the eastern Atlantic from the Gulf of Guinea to Angola. It reaches a length of {{approximately}} 75 cm.|$|E
50|$|Rhynchobatus australiae, {{also called}} the <b>white-spotted</b> <b>guitarfish,</b> white-spotted wedgefish or {{bottlenose}} wedgefish, is a species of fish in the Rhinidae family. It is found from shallow waters {{to a depth of}} at least 60 m in the Indo-Pacific, ranging from the East African coast and the Red Sea, to Taiwan, the Philippines and Australia. It is part of a species complex that also includes the giant guitarfish, the broadnose wedgefish and possibly the smoothnose wedgefish.|$|E
50|$|The giant {{guitarfish}} {{was previously}} believed to range throughout {{a large part}} of the Indo-Pacific, but recent evidence has shown that it, as traditionally defined, actually was a species complex consisting of four different species. In addition to the giant guitarfish, this complex includes the <b>white-spotted</b> <b>guitarfish,</b> the broadnose wedgefish and possibly the smoothnose wedgefish. With these as separate species, the giant guitarfish has a relatively restricted range: It is found only in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and the western Indian Ocean as far south as South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|While fins {{from many}} shark species {{are used in}} the trade, certain shark species have been {{identified}} over the centuries as supplying the tastiest and most succulent fins. The shark-like rays (the sawfishes and shovelnose rays) supply the highest quality fin. As observed by one of the leading treatises on shark trade, [...] "The ... fins ... from the <b>white-spotted</b> <b>guitarfish</b> spp. are considered to be most valuable. The preferred shark species for fins are tiger, mako, sawfish, sandbar, bull, hammerhead, blacktip, porbeagle, thresher and blue shark." [...] The fins from the critically endangered sawfishes [...] "are highly favored in Asian markets and {{are some of the most}} valuable shark fins." [...] Sawfishes are now protected under the highest protection level of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), Appendix I, but given the great volume of the shark fin trade, and that detached shark fins are difficult to identify, it is unlikely that CITES protection will prevent sawfish fins from entering the trade.|$|E
