500|$|While Lennon was [...] "evangelical in {{his enthusiasm}} for the Maharishi", {{according}} to his wife, Cynthia, she herself was [...] "a little more sceptical". [...] Cynthia later wrote that she [...] "loved being in India" [...] and had hoped she and Lennon would [...] "rediscover our lost closeness"; to her disappointment, however, Lennon became [...] "increasingly cold and aloof". The Lennons' room contained a [...] "four-poster bed, a dressing table, a couple of chairs and an electric fire". Lennon played guitar, while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions. After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone. Meanwhile, he walked to the local post office every morning to check for Ono's almost daily telegrams. One of these telegrams read: [...] "Look up at the sky and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> cloud think of me".|$|E

How then {{can you imagine that}} the {{universe}} as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers?

2500|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Walter Addiego stated, [...] "I {{fought hard}} against the emotionalism of In America [...] [...] [...] but I lost. There's no {{questioning}} the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants {{trying to make it}} in Manhattan. It got to me. I'm still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn downâ€” but why not give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? [...] [...] [...] [...] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in your heels. Sometimes it's best just to let yourself be swept away." ...|$|E

5000|$|To {{provide a}} {{possible}} evolutionary explanation of these phenomena, {{the authors of}} the study said that unusual occurrences may be experienced as indicating the presence of potential threats, and that humor may be a way of signalling to others that one has realized that a perceived threat is actually harmless. Westbury said [...] "Strange as it may seem, that same mechanism may be activated <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> unlikely looking word or a highly taboo one - you experience relief as you recognize that it's completely harmless - just a joke." ...|$|R

[...] "We are all red scarfs; {{all the men}} who clambered into Saumur {{through the}} water, are to wear red scarfs till the war is over; and {{they are to be}} seen in the front, at every battle, seige and skirmish.

5000|$|Various {{environmental}} organizations, such as Greenpeace, {{disagreed with}} the introduction of the Amflora genetically modified potato into the market. The lengthy approval process frustrated some supporters of the potato. A BASF scientist said to the New York Times, [...] "it's hard <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> innovative product go through the loops again and again. These decisions are not about science but about politics". After the potato was approved, the European Greens political party and the Italian agricultural minister criticized the approval. The International Peasant Movement La Via Campesina issued a press release on 8 March 2010 also criticizing the decision.|$|R

5000|$|While {{speaking}} about recording an English only album, Royce said; [...] "It's not impossible, but I think it's unfair sometimes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> album that has five songs in English, five songs in Spanish. I think that I prefer to do separate albums for each. Definitely my intention is never to leave Latin music; I have a core audience there. But this English album is something brand new, like {{getting a new}} toy for Christmas. I'm getting the same feeling I got when I released my very first album, so I'm kinda just looking forward to having fun and doing both from here on out." ...|$|R

6000|$|It {{should not}} to be omitted here, that the midshipmen in the English Navy are not {{permitted}} to be quite so imperious as in the American ships. They are divided into three (I think) probationary classes of [...] "volunteers," [...] instead of being at once advanced to a warrant. Nor will you fail to remark, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> English cutter officered by one of those volunteers, that the boy does not so strut and slap his dirk-hilt with a Bobadil air, and anticipatingly feel of the place where his warlike whiskers are going to be, and sputter out oaths so at the men, as is too often the case with the little boys wearing best-bower anchors on their lapels in the American Navy.|$|R

50|$|For {{end-users}} {{the use of}} MPLS is {{not visible}} directly, but can be assumed when doing a traceroute: only nodes that do full ip routing are shown as hops in the path, thus not the MPLS nodes used in between, therefore <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> that <b>a</b> packet hops between two very distant nodes and hardly any other 'hop' is seen in that providers network (or AS) {{it is very likely}} that network uses MPLS.|$|R
