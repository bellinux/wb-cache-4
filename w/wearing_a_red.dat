5|$|The mid-ground shows a crowd scene {{above the}} group of mourners, {{separated}} by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings.

Smith believes this serves to highlight the mourners' emotional and physical separation from the assorted figures gathered in the mid-ground. Art historian Adam Labuda sees these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the panel's dramatic sequence.|$|E
