40|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigations}} described in the article considerably extend the process understanding {{in connection with the}} questions and aspects which {{must be taken into account}} in the case of remote laser beam welding installations and laser beam welding installations with long focal lengths. With respect to weld quality and weld penetration depth, the methods applied here have also yielded practice-relevant knowledge about the interactions between the laser radiation and the welding fumes as well as about the attainable benefits of controlling the air flow in an appropriate way. Experimental investigations and numerical calculations served to adequately identify the influencing factors which are essential for are liable remote laser beam welding process. One challenge is to find optimum parameter constellations for a given configuration of a <b>welding</b> <b>installation.</b> Because of the complexity of the interactions, empirical designing is generally impracticable or insufficient in order to achieve an efficient air flow control. Virtual <b>welding</b> <b>installation</b> models with which the cabin air flow can be simulated may serve as a useful tool for this purpose. In combination with methods of statistical design and evaluation of experiments, it is possible to make a significance assessment of different manipulated variables and to establish functional dependencies between manipulated and target variables on which the optimisation of the air flow control can be based. Using the obtained results, it was possible to elaborate a resource-conserving air flow control concept which can be applied to retrofit many remote laser beam welding installations in a relatively simple and favourable way. The concept is based on the spatial separation of the region above the workpiece which includes the process zone as well as local supply air and exhaust air equipment from the upper region of the processing cabin which accommodates, amongst other items, the beam shaping components, i. e. the laser processing head as well as the relevant peripheral equipment...|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} systems of {{offshore}} <b>installations,</b> <b>welded</b> small-bore side branches can prove vulnerable to high-cycle fatigue failure due to vibrations.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyReeling is {{offshore}} pipeline installation method which delivers fast and cost effective pipeline laying. Each {{of the pipeline}} segment are welded onshore, the long section of pipeline then spooled onto a large diameter of reel. However, reeling installation method causes large plastic strain to the pipeline girth welds. Due to the existing cracks commonly found in the girth welds, the plastic strain will cause possible crack growth. To derive the acceptance criteria for pipeline girth weld defects and sustain the integrity of pipeline during reeling installation, an Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) is required. The objective of this thesis is to perform Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) of pipeline girth <b>welds</b> during reeling <b>installation</b> particularly in spooling on and reeling off stages using LINKpipe and CRACKWISE software and also to perform the ECA for clad/lined pipes using LINKpipe. CRACKWISE {{is one of the}} software {{that can be used for}} the flaw assessment of pipeline girth <b>welds</b> during reeling <b>installation.</b> In order to reduce the conservatism of existing failure assessment methods, SINTEF recently have developed a new failure assessment approach which depends on finite element calculations of pipeline model. LINKpipe is based on four-node ANDES shell elements and a non-linear line-spring element. The software established an efficient and adequately accurate model even for large level of strain, thus it has potential as an alternative ECA tool for pipelines subjected to plastic strains. Moreover, the new bi-metallic shell elements that were developed in LINKpipe making it capable analyzing defect assessments on clad and lined pipes. Based on the analyses performed for the thesis work the influence of misalignment for the critical crack size curve is less significant compared to the effect of residual stress. On the contrary, pipe misalignment in LINKpipe ECA simulations can show the effect of increasing the Crack Driving Force very significantly, which makes the critical crack size, became smaller. Whereas the residual stress showed little influence in the prediction of the critical crack size using LINKpipe. When the maximum possible misalignment (which is 1. 95 mm) along with the residual stress is applied, the critical crack size curves resulted from CRACKWISE and LINKpipe, are relatively close to each other. However, CRACKWISE tends to be conservative for long crack lengths (> 90 mm) compared to LINKpipe, whereas for short crack lengths (< 90 mm) CRACKWISE yields less conservative critical crack sizes...|$|R
40|$|In 1901, GK Chesterton, in a defence of “penny dreadfuls”, the {{commercial}} {{writing of the}} time, criticised a tendency to underestimate “humanity minus ourselves”. This remains a useful blandishment in the 21 st century; debate and struggle around culture and creativity are dogged by {{a sense that the}} ‘other’ is talking about something different entirely. This paper is written with policy-making in mind but also hopes to speak to those on whom policy acts and impacts. It may at times recap thoughts that are, from one perspective or the other, blindingly obvious. When it does, it does so in the immodest hope of facilitating wider understandings. Chesterton’s defence of the “penny dreadfuls” {{more than a century ago}} reminds us that debate around what is currently commonly termed “the creative industries” is not new. Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through The Looking Glass famously asserted in a scornful tone: “When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean – nothing more nor less. ” For policy, which lives as language before it can become action, this is a tempting but dangerous approach. Furthermore, where creativity, imagination and cultural content are concerned, clarity becomes even more challenging as it is necessary to engage with ideas; with intangibles that resist rigorous and unambiguous mapping to any measure. Connecting Creativity, Value and Money sets out to take a snapshot, in particular, of micro-businesses in the creative industries, specifically looking at Scotland. Actor is used in this paper in a sense akin to its (asexual) use in systems reasoning. It is used to identify a component in the creative and cultural ecosystem; as a portmanteau term for those hewing and <b>welding</b> <b>installations</b> and performances, wrangling words, those whose palette is drawn from ones and zeros and pixels, those tunnellers through the cultural substrate, the sign-posters at the top of the populist mountain, the craftsmen and craftswomen, the mendicants and the entrepreneurs whose collective foment makes up the cultural economy and the creative industries that fall within it. Numerical evidence around the scale and shape of the sector has been examined but the emphasis of this paper’s new research has been on the voice of practitioners and entrepreneurs themselves; the actors within the ecosystem, seeking wider applicable insights. In 1967 Roland Barthes asked: “Why does fashion utter clothing so abundantly? Why does it interpose, between the object and its user, such a luxury of words (not to mention images), such a network of meaning?” It turns out that the complexity of language around what we currently consider the creative industries has a long history. In the 17 th century one John Evelyn controversially asserted the idea that the architect verborum, skilled in the use of words and whose job was to interpret architecture, was a crucial and intrinsic part of the architectural process. It is worth recognising that the disproportionate noise around policy and the creative industries, the constant public negotiations of success or failure in the media, the blogosphere and academia, should not be stigmatised as a strictly contemporary challenge. The complexity and constant presence of unsettled debate is itself evidence of the intangible values embedded within private and public constructions of much of what is considered to constitute the creative industries, and the importance our society attaches to them. The presence of intangible values across a range of businesses from large publishing houses to start-up knitting businesses emerges strongly from the interviews conducted for this paper. For those with the ambition to assist these industries effectively, immersion in a matrix of intangibles is inescapable, although perhaps like a baptism, it can be confined to a one-off dip so as not to inhibit action.

These efforts range from 2 D photo-feature extraction to 3 D laser scanners and {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) tags. A multi-sensor data fusion model that utilizes multiple sources of information would provide a better alternative than a single-source model for tracking project progress. However, many existing fusion models are based on data fusion at the sensor and object levels and are therefore incapable of capturing critical information regarding a number of activities and processes on a construction site, particularly those related to non-structural trades such as <b>welding,</b> inspection, and <b>installation</b> activities.
