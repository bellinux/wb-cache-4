25|$|Abaza Hasan's {{promotion}} {{to the major}} governorships of Diyarbakır and Aleppo coincided with another major development in Ottoman history: {{the beginning of the}} Köprülü Era. Köprülü Mehmed Pasha had been given the office of grand vizier on 15 September 1656, and since then began carrying out major reforms of the Ottoman state. Some of these aroused widespread opposition, such as the purges he carried out against the Altı Bölük cavalry regiments (of which Abaza Hasan had once been a member). In particular, after his return to Edirne from the 1657 campaign to reconquer the islands of Bozcaada (Tenedos) and Limni (Lemnos), Köprülü Mehmed ordered a massacre of all the cavalry soldiers he suspected of disloyalty - in the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> historian, strewing the banks of the Tunca River with corpses. Abaza Hasan already had a history of disloyalty toward Köprülü: In 1657 Köprülü had ordered the execution of the governor of Egypt, and Abaza Hasan secretly aided his escape through Aleppo. Thus, when the order was given for the army to assemble for a campaign against Transylvania, Abaza Hasan and his allies chose not to heed the call. Instead, they gathered at Konya with an army of 30,000, and pledged to oppose Köprülü. Their forces included {{a significant portion of the}} Ottoman military, including the governors of Damascus, Anatolia, Raqqa, and Aleppo, which Abaza Hasan himself governed. The rebels were further supported by members of the imperial cavalry regiments who had fled from Köprülü's purges.|$|E

A year later Universal Pictures followed with The Chinese Parrot, starring Japanese actor, Kamiyama Sojin, in the starring role. In both productions, Charlie Chan's role was minimized.

500|$|An {{important}} subset to this deterministic theme, {{related to}} the original worldview idea as well, {{is the lack of}} personal responsibility that those in the underclass accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, [...] "The knife went in", in reference to the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder.

40|$|Abstract. The {{numbers of}} a-points of {{different}} classes of meromorphic functions {{have been widely}} studied for more than 120 years. As a culmination of similar studies, there arose classical Nevanlinna theory (1920 s) and Ahlfors theory (1935). Clearly, further development should touch not only the numbers of a-points but also on their locations. Similar regularities were established nearly 30 years ago: they are the so-called proximity (or closeness) properties of a-points of meromorphic functions which describe mutual locations of a-points and imply simultaneously the key conclusions of Nevanlinna and Ahlfors theories. In the present paper we give a new, essentially simplified <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the main versions of this property. 1...|$|R
