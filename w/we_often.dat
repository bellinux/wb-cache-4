5|$|Truth (satya) implies love, and {{firmness}} (agraha) engenders {{and therefore}} {{serves as a}} synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up {{the use of the}} phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing <b>we</b> <b>often</b> avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha”....|$|E

25|$|Since virtual {{displacements}} {{are automatically}} compatible {{when they are}} {{expressed in terms of}} continuous, single-valued functions, <b>we</b> <b>often</b> mention only the need for consistency between strains and displacements. The virtual work principle is also valid for large real displacements; however, Eq.(f) would then be written using more complex measures of stresses and strains.|$|E
25|$|Since any two stones {{belonging}} to the same chain have the same liberties, <b>we</b> <b>often</b> speak of the liberties of that chain. For example, in the first diagram, the points a, b, c, d and e are the liberties of the lone black chain. In the second diagram, the liberties of the black chain in the lower right are c, d and h.|$|E

After we became intimate <b>we</b> <b>often</b> went to stay with the Walkes at St Hilary, as simple as any monastery in its furnishings.|$|E
25|$|According to the theory, {{accommodation}} is {{the process}} of reframing one's mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, <b>we</b> <b>often</b> fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way the world works, we learn from the experience of failure, or others' failure.|$|E
25|$|Many {{languages}} with ergative marking display what {{is known}} as optional ergativity, where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when <b>we</b> <b>often</b> see optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly optional but is affected by semantics and pragmatics. Note that unlike split ergativity, which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.|$|E

40|$|In practice, <b>we</b> are <b>often</b> {{interested}} in order relations (e. g., when we describe preferences) or equivalence relations (e. g., when <b>we</b> describe clustering). <b>Often,</b> <b>we</b> {{do not have}} a complete information about the corresponding relation; as a result, we have several relations consistent with our knowledge. In such situations, it is desirable to know which elements a and b are possibly connected by the relation and which are necessarily connected by this relation. In this paper, we provide a full description of all such possible and necessary orders and equivalence relations. For example, possible orders are exactly reflexive relations, while necessary orders are exactly order relations. ...|$|R
25|$|To {{develop a}} Bayesian network, <b>we</b> <b>often</b> first develop a DAG G such {{that we believe}} X {{satisfies}} the local Markov property with respect to G. Sometimes this is done by creating a causal DAG. We then ascertain the conditional probability distributions of each variable given its parents in G. In many cases, in particular in the case where the variables are discrete, if we define the joint distribution of X to be the product of these conditional distributions, then X is a Bayesian network with respect to G.|$|E
25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the book is that our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that <b>we</b> <b>often</b> attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern is that our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E

500|$|In many of Shinkai's films, sad endings {{resulting}} from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common. According to Shinkai, his stories {{are intended to}} encourage teenagers as they learn to cope with these commonplace experiences. In an interview, {{he admitted that he}} had been accustomed to being turned down by women, and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters continue to try, despite being unsuccessful at love. The Garden of Words also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as <b>we</b> <b>often</b> assume. Shinkai himself could relate with Yukari in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27, stating, [...] "We're all still just children at age 27," [...] a point that voice actress Kana Hanazawa also agreed with.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the initial}} {{adoption}} of the EagleCash system, it has been augmented by ATM-like kiosks which allow soldiers to add funds to the card without visiting the base's finance office. [...] Originally, this requirement caused long lines to refill cards, reducing {{the utility of the}} system. The conversion to the kiosk system, developed by NCR Corporation, remedied these problems and increased the ability of the system to provide easy cash for soldiers away from home [...] "something <b>we</b> <b>often</b> take for granted, but for soldiers deployed on foreign land, it has always been a challenge". [...] To date, 3.2 million EagleCash and EZpay cards have been issued and used to process 16.5 million electronic transactions valued at over $3.6 billion.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} criticised {{for the use}} of some [...] "sexist dialogues" [...] in the first half which were playing to a certain [...] "new generation" [...] audience. Sowmya Rajendran of Sify criticised the same and stated about one of such scenes in the film, [...] "it is such banter, which <b>we</b> <b>often</b> dismiss with a laugh, that helps {{perpetuate}} rape culture." [...] When asked about this, the director replied, [...] "I firmly believe such conversations are part of our lives. I don't want to elaborate, but it also throws an insight into each character featured in the sequences. Yes, frankly, I was a bit worried how the family audience would react to those scenes. But then I read out that part of the script to a select group of women and they nodded their heads in approval." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1981 Daniel Dennett had {{formulated}} another {{argument against}} the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, {{on the basis of}} the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, <b>we</b> <b>often</b> attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as [...] "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." [...] We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude [...] "I believe I can kick this guy's butt" [...] in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as [...] "desiring to breathe clear air" [...] in a stuffy environment.|$|E
500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to think for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke <b>we</b> <b>often</b> used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, and we thought it was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E
