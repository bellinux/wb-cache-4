5|$|Molecular clock {{evidence}} using DNA {{suggests the}} macaroni penguin split from its closest relative, the royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), around 1.5million years ago. Although {{the two have}} generally been considered separate species, the close similarities of their DNA sequences has led some, such as the Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles, to treat the royal as a subspecies of the macaroni. The two species are very similar in appearance, although the royal penguin has a <b>white</b> <b>face</b> instead of the usually black face of the macaroni. Interbreeding with the Indo-Pacific subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin (E. chrysocome filholi) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987–88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.|$|E
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright <b>white</b> <b>face</b> by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—In a {{study of}} the neural {{components}} of automatic and controlled social evaluation, White participants viewed Black and <b>White</b> <b>faces</b> during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. When the faces were presented for 30 ms, activation in the amygdala—a brain region associated with emotion—was greater for Black than for <b>White</b> <b>faces.</b> When the faces were presented for 525 ms, this difference was significantly reduced, and regions of frontal cortex associated with control and regulation showed greater activation for Black than <b>White</b> <b>faces.</b> Furthermore, greater race bias on an indirect behavioral measure was correlated with greater difference in amygdala activation between Black and <b>White</b> <b>faces,</b> and frontal activity predicted a reduction in Black-White differences in amygdala activity from the 30 -ms to the 525 ms condition. These results provide evidence for neural distinctions between automatic and more controlled processing of social groups, and suggest that controlled processes may modulate automatic evaluation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research was to examine perceiver- and stimulus- driven moderators of preferential attention to racial outgroup versus ingroup faces. Existing research finds that White participants demonstrate preferential attention to Black versus <b>White</b> <b>faces.</b> Importantly, some of this work suggests that perceiver variables, like motivation, and stimulus properties, like color, are associated with preferential attention to race. The first set of studies {{examined the effects of}} expectancies on attention to race in the absence (Study 1) and presence (Study 2) of color cues that were diagnostic of race. Results showed that awareness of race, alone, did not moderate preferential attention to Black versus <b>White</b> <b>faces.</b> However, there was evidence that awareness of race, along with a race diagnostic color cue, was associated with preferential attention to the outgroup color cue. The final study manipulated the visual salience of Black relative to <b>White</b> <b>faces</b> and examined how low-level, visual cues moderate the effects of race on attention (Study 3). We found that greater attention to Black versus <b>White</b> <b>faces</b> emerged more strongly {{over the course of the}} task, even when the Black faces were less visually salient than the <b>White</b> <b>faces.</b> Collectively, the proposed studies aim to provide a broader, more comprehensive understanding of both perceiver- and stimulus-driven processes moderating attention to race...|$|R

25|$|Domestic horses often cope {{well with}} deafness, and deaf horses may go undiagnosed. Some deaf horses are more skittish than normal, {{while others are}} {{distinctly}} calmer. Deafness in horses can be diagnosed by {{brainstem auditory evoked potential}} (BAEP), which is minimally invasive and requires no sedation and minimal restraint. While blue eyes and a <b>white</b> <b>face</b> are often associated with deafness in other species, apron-faced, non-splash horses are not known to be deaf. Nor is the presence of one blue, one normal eye indicative of unilateral deafness. The case horse in Hardland's 2006 case study had one blue eye, while the other was parti-colored, but the horse was bilaterally deaf.|$|E
500|$|Common {{names such}} as [...] "demon owl", [...] "death owl", or [...] "ghost owl" [...] show that traditionally, rural populations in many places {{considered}} barn owls to be birds of evil omen.

These owls don't [...] "hoot" [...] but emit raspy screeches and hissing noises or that their <b>white</b> <b>face</b> and underbelly feathers that are visible as they fly overhead make them look [...] "ghostly".

Two other varieties – pure black and pure white forms – are artificially selected in some South African ranches. Though born with a deep black sheen, adult black springbok are two shades of chocolate-brown and develop a white marking on the face as they mature. White springbok, as the name suggests, are predominantly white with a light tan stripe on the flanks.|$|E
500|$|A further {{inspiration}} {{came from}} a story in Charlie Chaplin's autobiography; while touring with a British musical theatre, he stayed at a tenement home. After dinner, the family took him upstairs to meet their son, pulling him {{out from under a}} bed. The son ("a half man with no legs, an oversized, blond, flat-shaped head, a sickening <b>white</b> <b>face,</b> a sunken nose, a large mouth," [...] according to Chaplin) [...] "flopp around" [...] while they sang and danced. Morgan used this incident within the screenplay, although at Wong's suggestion they changed the character to the boy's mother. It took some time for the concepts to come together into a story; elements first appeared in the second season episode [...] "Humbug", written by Morgan's brother Darin and featuring a cast of circus sideshow performers. The episode incorporated several themes that had an influence on [...] "Home", including the use of a [...] "benign soul trapped in the body of a monster".|$|E

40|$|Despite recent {{social and}} {{political}} advances, most interracial contact is still superficial in nature, and White individuals interact mainly with other Whites. Based on recent mere exposure research, we propose that repeated exposure to Whites may actually increase prejudice. In a series of experiments, White participants were subliminally exposed to <b>White</b> <b>faces</b> or nothing (control) and then completed various explicit and implicit measures of racial attitudes. Exposure to <b>White</b> <b>faces</b> consistently led to more prejudice by making attitudes toward Blacks more negative, rather than by making attitudes toward Whites more positive.

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} exposure to faces can change the perception of normality in new faces, such that faces similar to those at exposure appear more normal.

We collected normality judgments both pre-exposure and post-exposure by showing pairs of images, one with wide-spaced and one with narrow-spaced eyes. Examining {{the difference between the}} pre-exposure and post-exposure judgments revealed that participants selected an increased number of images that were congruent with the faces to which they had been exposed. The change in normality judgments was strongest for <b>White</b> <b>faces,</b> suggesting that representations of <b>White</b> ethnicity <b>faces</b> are more malleable and less robust to adaptation, potentially because of the decreased experience that individuals had with them. A second experiment using the same test stimuli with a sample of White participants revealed equivalent adaptation effects for both Hadza and <b>White</b> <b>faces.</b> These data highlight the role of experience on the high-level visual adaptation of faces...|$|R
500|$|The {{stories of}} Iravan, usually spelled Irawan in Java, {{along with others}} from the Javanese version of the Mahabharata, are told in {{traditional}} Javanese theatre (wayang), as well as shadow-puppet plays known as wayang kulit. As in India, Irawan {{is described as a}} son of Ardjuna (Arjuna) and Ulupi. While in India, Irawan's mother Ulupi is a Naga (serpent), in Javanese legends she is the daughter of the sage Kanwa (Jayawilapa in puppetry) of the Yasarata hermitage. Irawan is born and brought up in the hermitage under the care of his mother and grandfather, away from his father. Irawan and his stepbrother Abhimanju (Abhimanyu) or Angkawijaya are the protagonists of more than 40lakons ("scenes", [...] "dramas" [...] or [...] "plays") set in the Amarta Period, the era of the Pandawas (Pandavas). In these lakons, Irawan is depicted as a lijepan character—"a small, extremely refined, controlled character, whose manner is modest". In the wayang kulit, he is referred to as a bambang ("refined knight"), depicted with a <b>white</b> <b>face</b> and dubbed with a light, floating voice. Irawan is also described as determined and calm.|$|E
500|$|With Robey's {{popularity}} came an {{eagerness to}} differentiate {{himself from his}} music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened {{from the neck down}} with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled top-hat. He applied thick <b>white</b> <b>face</b> paint and exaggerated the redness on his cheeks and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including Sax Rohmer and Bennett Scott. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as [...] "a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he fixed his audience with his basilisk stare." ...|$|E
500|$|Clydesdales {{are usually}} bay in colour, but a roaning pattern, black, grey, and {{chestnut}} also occur. Most have white markings, including {{white on the}} face, feet, legs and occasional body spotting (generally on the lower belly). [...] They also have extensive feathering on their lower legs. [...] Roaning, body spotting and extensive white markings {{are thought to be}} the result of sabino genetics. Some Clydesdale breeders want <b>white</b> <b>face</b> and leg markings without the spotting on the body. To attempt getting the ideal set of markings, they often breed horses with only one white leg to horses with four white legs and sabino roaning on their bodies. On average, the result is a foal with the desired amount of white markings. Clydesdales do not have the SB1 (Sabino 1) gene responsible for causing sabino expressions in many other breeds, and researchers theorise that several other genes are responsible for these patterns. Many buyers pay a premium for bay and black horses, especially those with four white legs and white facial markings. Specific colours are often preferred over other physical traits, and some buyers even choose horses with soundness problems if they have the desired colour and markings. Roan horses are not preferred by buyers, despite one draught-breed writer theorizing that they are needed to keep the desired coat colours and texture. Breed associations, however, state that no colours are bad, and that horses with roaning and body spots are increasingly accepted.|$|E
