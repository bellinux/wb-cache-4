5|$|The {{following}} day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended {{land acquisition}} by air; their plane is {{shot down by}} a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole, and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in crude oil (an apparent reference to Oddjob's murder of Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) in Goldfinger). Bond meets CIA Agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), who discloses Greene and Medrano <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> the Atacama Desert to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's Special Activities Division when they attempt to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Kay County is {{the next}} county US-60 passes through, and the first {{settlement}} US-60 comes to is the city of Tonkawa. Here, US-60 has an interchange {{with one of the}} two interstate highways it <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> Oklahoma, Interstate 35 (I-35). East of I-35, US-60 begins a concurrency with US-77; this interchange is also the western terminus of US-60 Business, which serves downtown Tonkawa. US-177 joins the concurrency at the next interchange, which is also {{the other end of the}} Tonkawa business loop. Further east is an interchange with SH-156, the northern terminus of that route. US-60/US-77/US-177 then reach the outskirts of Ponca City, Kay County's largest city. Ponca City, too, has a business loop from US-60, which begins at the next interchange east. The three U.S. routes mostly bypass the city to the south, only actually entering the city limits at its far southern extent. In Ponca City, US-60 Business reunites with mainline US-60 and ends. This intersection is also where the three-way concurrency between the U.S. routes breaks; US-77 heads north along US-60 Business, deeper into Ponca City, US-177 heads south toward Stillwater, and US-60 heads east to cross the Arkansas River.|$|E

25|$|The tournament format {{since the}} 2013 edition {{was changed to}} a quarterfinal-semifinal playoff format. The top eight teams after a single {{round-robin}} elimination round will advance to the quarterfinals.

25|$|All committees' ballots {{now include}} 10 candidates. While there was {{previously}} a one-year waiting period after elimination from annual BBWAA consideration, {{there is now}} no waiting period. At least one committee convenes each December {{as part of the}} election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that in the next two 5-year cycles, the Today's Game committee (having met in 2016) <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> 2018, 2021, and 2023, while the Modern Baseball committee <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> 2017, 2019, 2022 and 2024. Additionally, the Hall of Fame has modified the criteria under which active executives can be considered for induction. All active executives age 70 or older may now have their careers reviewed as part of the Era Committee balloting process, regardless of the position they hold in an organization, and regardless of whether their body of work has been completed. Previously, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.|$|E

2500|$|Neptūnas {{recovered}} in the LKL, playing very solidly, even splitting the season series with Žalgiris. They defeated the Lithuanian powerhouse twice in two weeks: 67–65 in Klaipeda and 90–86 in Kaunas. Deividas Gailius led Neptūnas during these two games. But they took {{only the third}} spot {{during the regular season}} due to the unfavorable results versus Lietuvos rytas. Neptūnas defeated Dzūkija with the series result of 3–1, losing only once in Alytus 56–65. The semi-finals began unsuccessfully for the team versus Lietuvos rytas. Despite holding up close to the opponents the whole game, Neptūnas lost during the final minutes 88–79 in Vilnius. But Neptūnas, led by Deividas Gailius (22 points) and Arnas Butkevičius (20 points), successfully got revenge in Klaipėda, overcoming Rytas 107–101 after OT. The semi-final series was tied at 1–1. But Neptūnas lost another thriller 96–89 two days later in Vilnius and ended up {{on the edge of the}} precipice. Furthermore, primary Neptūnas center Simas Galdikas suffered a painful leg injury, after stepping on Kšyštof Lavrinovič's feet. Despite that, the team's coach Kazys Maksvytis said that [...] "we <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>in</b> Vilnius again". This promise did not came true following the 87–92 loss at home. Neptūnas lost the semi-final series 3–1 to Lietuvos rytas. And then Neptūnas suffered the biggest fiasco of the season. They shockingly lost to Juventus in the LKL bronze medals series 2–3, including an embarrassing defeat in the decisive game 69–84 in the home arena.|$|E
