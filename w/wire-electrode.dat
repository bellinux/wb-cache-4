40|$|This work {{looks into}} {{electrical}} treeing in cross-linked polyethylene-based materials (XLPE), where {{the ability to}} resist tree development is considered {{as an indicator of}} improved applicability for insulation in high voltage power cables. The thesis presents results of a twin PhD project involving joint work of two students. One of the students (author of this thesis with a background in electrical engineering) concentrated on developing new methodology for testing the resistance to electrical treeing in XLPE modified by addition of voltage stabilising agents, while the design and syntheses of these agents was the domain of the second student, Markus Jarvid (having his background in chemical engineering). The latter work has been published in a separate thesis. In contrast to the traditionally used needle-electrode test objects, a <b>wire-electrode</b> geometry has been introduced for creating the highly divergent electric field distribution in the insulation, necessary for initiation of an electrical treeing process. The <b>wire-electrode</b> object has shown a benefit of producing several trees during each individual test, therefore providing more data for further analyses. These objects also allow for exposing a larger volume of the material and let trees incept in weak-spot locations. How to conveniently analyse the resulting treeing data from performed experiments is further analysed in the thesis. To increase the applicability of the elaborated methodology for testing materials characterised by different degree of transparency, optical observations of the treeing process were complimented by simultaneous detection of partial discharges (PDs). Analyses of the latter have allowed an interpretation scheme practical for measuring resistance to treeing in non-transparent materials. To evaluate how voltage stabilisers influence the resistance to treeing in XLPE, a broad range of stabilisers have been identified and tested. A detailed analysis demonstrates a positive effect imposed by addition of 4, 4 ’-didocyloxybenzil. This compound is thereafter compared with the effect of various other stabilisers, including benzil-, thiaxanthone- fullerene- and melamine-types. Finally the stabiliser efficiencies are correlated with molecular ionisation potential and electron affinity, where it has been found that the stabilising efficiency increases with electron affinity of the added molecules. The results from this twin PhD project opens up a possibility to design new types of practically useful voltage stabilisers and test their suitability for improving the insulation in future high voltage cables...|$|E

Jyothi et al. developed a <b>wire-electrode</b> trap where the ions are ejected while the RF remains on. They observed a strong {{dependence of the}} ion flight time on the RF phase angle {{at the time of}} ejection leading to complex mass spectra which are difficult to interpret if more than one ion species are trapped and ejected [24]. In all of these experiments, the ions are ejected radially from the trap. Seck et al. coupled a LQT to a TOF-MS in which the ions are accelerated along the trap axis into the TOF-MS by applying a potential gradient using the endcaps of the ion trap [25]. The advantage of this setup is the separation of RF and high-voltage electrodes but the mass resolution for heavy ions in multi-component Coulomb crystals seems limited.|$|E
40|$|The {{enhancement}} of heat transfer by active and passive methods {{has been the}} subject of many academic and industrial research studies. Internal flows play a major role in many applications and different methods have been utilized to augment the heat transfer to internal flows. Secondary flows consume part of the kinetic energy of the flow and disturb the boundary layer. Inducing secondary flows is known as mechanism for heat transfer enhancement. Secondary flows may be generated by corona discharge and ion-driven flows. When a high electric potential is applied to a conductor, a high electric field will be generated. The high electric field may exceed the partial break-down of the neutral molecules of surrounding gas (air) and generate a low-temperature plasma in the vicinity of the conductor. The generated plasma acts as a source of ions that accelerate under the influence of the electric field and escape beyond the plasma region and move toward the grounded electrode. The accelerating ions collide with neutral particles of the surrounding gas and impose a dragging effect which is interpreted as a body-force to the air particles. The shape and configuration of the emitting and receiving electrodes has a significant impact on the distribution of the electric body-force and the resulting electrically-induced flow field. It turned out that the certain configurations of longitudinal electrodes may cause a jet-like secondary flow field on the cross section of the flow passage in internal flows. The impingement effect of the corona jet on the walls of the channel disturbs the boundary layer, enhances the convective heat transfer, and generates targeted cooling along the centerline of the jet. The results of the current study show that the concentric configuration of a suspended <b>wire-electrode</b> in a circular tube leads to a hydrostatic condition and do not develop any electrically-induced secondary flow; however, the eccentric <b>wire-electrode</b> configuration generates a corona jet along the eccentricity direction. The generated corona jet exhibits interesting specifications similar to conventional inertia-driven air jets which are among common techniques for cooling and heat transfer enhancement. On the other hand, wall-mounted flat electrode pairs along the parallel walls of a rectangular mini-channel develop a similar jet-like flow pattern. The impingement of the corona jet to the receiving wall causes excessive heat transfer enhancement and cooling effect. The flat electrode pairs were also utilized to study the effect of corona discharge on the heat transfer specifications of the internal flow between parallel plates in fully-developed condition. It turned out that the electrically-induced secondary flow along with a pressure-driven main flow generates a swirling effect which can enhance the heat transfer significantly in fully-developed condition...|$|E

Chemical polishing was adopted to remove impurities {{adhered to the}} surface of Ti foils. The polishing solution consists of hydrofluoric acid (HF, AR), nitric acid (HNO 3, AR), and de-ionized (DI) water, with the volume ratio of 1 : 1 : 2. At last, cleaned Ti foils were dried in nitrogen stream. The TiO 2 -NTAs were synthesized in a two-electrode cell containing a cathode of platinum foil at 60 [*]V with weak magnetic stirring.

40|$|Data {{presented}} are {{the culmination}} of experiments studying the combined effects of polarity, contact and current risetime on wire array z-pinches operated on the 1 MA, 100 - 200 ns Cornell University COBRA pulsed power generator. Data were collected on 16 -wire, 12. 5 mu-m phi aluminum z-pinch arrays in both negative and positive polarity, with soldered and non-soldered contacts, and with slow and fast risetimes (100 ns and 200 ns). A minimum of five shots were collected {{for each of the}} eight cases to obtain statistical significance. The initiation, ablation, implosion and stagnation phases were compared for the various cases. Polarity was modified via a 12 nH bolt-on convolute, rotatable to provide positive or negative polarity with similar inductance in each case, allowing sideby-side comparisons. Contact was modified by applying Pb 60 Sn 40 solder to the cathode <b>wire-electrode</b> contact point or leaving the array unsoldered. The current risetime was varied between a 100 ns "short" pulse and 200 ns "long" pulse by utilizing current-pulse shaping capabilities of the COBRA pulsed power generator. These experiments aimed to build upon previous research by Duselis et al. (2004), which showed that polarity, contact and current risetime have significant impact on energy deposited and uniformity of expansion of single wires under low-current (less than 10 kA) conditions. These low current experiments were designed to mimic the conditions on a single wire of a wire-array z-pinch during initiation, also known as the resistive voltage phase. Experiments presented here aim to build upon this research by establishing {{a better understanding of the}} effects of polarity, contact and current risetime on the initiation, ablation, implosion and stagnation phases of wire array z-pinches, and also to understand the utility of low current, single wire results as they pertain to higher current, wire array z-pinches. The data were collected in two separate experimental runs: a preliminary dataset with only contact and current risetime as the variables (four distinct cases), and a second, full dataset examining polarity, contact and current risetime (eight distinct cases). The first dataset showed a significant improvement to long pulse shots when the wires were soldered to the cathode, but no improvements to short pulse shots. Long pulse, soldered shots from this dataset were also observed to exhibit the "Christmas tree" effect, or time-accelerated pinch dynamics at the cathode and axial flow towards the anode. The second dataset showed that, with short pulses only, operating arrays in positive polarity resulted in a 25 % improvement in deposited energy, 30 % smaller achieved current radius, 20 % improvement in peak x-ray power and a 50 % improvement in x-ray yield when compared to negative polarity arrays. Soldering contacts showed a 10 % improvement in initiation energy deposited in positive polarity only, but no subsequent correlated improvement in x-ray yield. Short pulse shots showed a ten-fold increase in peak x-ray powers and yield over long pulse shots. The two datasets were compared, and recommendations for future work were developed...|$|E
