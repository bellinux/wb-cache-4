50|$|In general, {{the longer}} the {{controlled}} fermentation period, the higher yield of esters produced. During the fermentation process, ethanol is oxidized {{and one of the}} main compounds produced are acetaldehydes, which adds the flavor necessary for the final product of tequila. For example, isovalderaldehyde seems to produce a sweet, cocoa, and chocolate-like flavor. 2 and 3-methylbutanal produce a malty flavor. The agave plant contains many terpenes such as vanillin and syringaldehydes which presents a strong and fruity or herbal aroma. It also contains eugenol which can deliver a hint of spicy flavor to the tequila. Since the production of tequila involves heating, Maillard browning reactions occur, and furans are produced during the thermal degradation of sugar. The most prominent furanic compounds include 2-furaldehyde and 5-methylfuraldehyde, which can contribute to the smoky flavor of tequila. Guaiacol also seems to contribute to Tequila's smoky flavor. Beta-demascenone contributes to the <b>woody,</b> floral <b>taste</b> of tequila.|$|R

Two commercial wines, a varietal wine Touriga Nacional and an assemblage wine composed by Cabernet Sauvignon (60 %), Syrah (30 %) and Alicante Bouschet (10 %) were kept for 12 months in oak barrel. Latter, the samples were coded with three-digit numbers and blind tested in standard crystal tasting glasses, model ISO, in aliquots of 40 mL at 18 °C by an expert panel of ten experts with over five years of experience in sensory wine analysis. Three evaluation sheets (descriptive, score and nonparametric) were used. The assemblage wine was characterized in flavor intensity and floral taste, vegetal and <b>woody</b> <b>taste,</b> and taste intensity. Touriga Nacional wine was more evident due to higher clarity, tone and visual intensity, olfactory persistence, fruity, toasty and woody aromas, bitter taste, fruity spice flavors, body, typicality and quality taste. 201...|$|E
