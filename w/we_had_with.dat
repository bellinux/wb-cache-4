Bush. On leaving the party, Paul remarked: [...] "Ronald Reagan has given us a deficit ten times greater than what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> the Democrats. It didn't take more than a month after 1981, to realize there would be no changes." [...] The Libertarian Party had courted Paul for the previous six years.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2013, guitarist John Petrucci {{began writing}} {{a story for}} a concept album, {{presenting}} it {{to the rest of}} Dream Theater about a year later. The band and the record label were receptive to the idea, with Petrucci recalling, [...] "Everybody had the 'go for it' mentality. And from the very first meeting that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Dave Rath at Roadrunner, when I presented this and even just said the title, he was 100 percent on board. The involvement of everybody at Roadrunner has been absolutely unbelievable, so supportive. It kind of ignited the secret nerd in all of us that loves this sort of stuff, because it's fun, it's different." [...] From its conception, Petrucci envisioned the story as eventually being re-worked into a film, play, or video game.|$|E

She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and a little luck. And that’s what I feel like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} Milan players {{who had played}} in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous. Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: [...] "What {{happened}} then was strange, just six minutes when we played not so good and we paid for that." [...] Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: [...] "The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime, {{but this is a}} different story. It's our turn to celebrate now." [...] Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: [...] "I've scored quite a few times in Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special." [...] Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that [...] "the fortune we lacked in Istanbul <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> us tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{continued}} to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter Frank Barsalona, and generally avoided festivals, but made an important exception with the Woodstock Festival on 16 August. After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500. The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During [...] "Pinball Wizard", Abbie Hoffman took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of John Sinclair before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during [...] "See Me, Feel Me", the sun rose, almost as if on cue. Two weeks later, the group played the second Isle of Wight Festival, {{using one of the}} largest live PAs available. Though media attention was on Bob Dylan playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show. Townshend later said, [...] "We know that the stage act <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> <b>with</b> Tommy in it, would work under any circumstances, because it had worked many times on tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blade Runner sold well, {{but due to}} high {{development}} costs, {{the profit}} margin was low. According to Louis Castle, [...] "The mere fact it was four CDs made it a very expensive game. And the deal <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> the Blade Runner Partnership meant it was not terribly profitable. It didn't {{do as well as}} you might think." [...] Although Virgin were interested in doing a sequel, if a sequel were approved, the Blade Runner Partnership intended to increase the licensing fee. Ultimately, Westwood and Virgin concluded the cost of producing a game to top the original, coupled with the increased cost for licensing, made the prospect of a sequel economically untenable, as such a sequel would have to sell several million units to generate what would be considered an acceptable profit. In 2009, the Blade Runner Partnership offered Gearbox Software the rights to the franchise, but production costs were estimated at $35 million and the project was scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|The Big Sister was, {{according}} to animation supervisor Jeff Weir, {{the first thing}} Jordan Thomas talked about to the animators {{when they arrived at}} 2K Marin. The character challenged the team to convey her backstory and personality through the design. Fix started with descriptive words on a page, moving to thumbnails and silhouette concepts. Early inspiration for the character's design included racing dogs, and the idea of a character that carries itself in a restrained way until it explodes in action. [...] " [...] of her as graceful and yet awkward at the same time, and that’s really the hard challenge that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> her. Actually in terms of design, there were lots of fun things, like at one point she had a sort of 'Fallen Angel' feel to her, like broken wings," [...] Weir recalled. Motion capture sessions were used for inspiration for the alternatingly awkward and fluid motion of the character, though none of it was used in the final product. In developing her visual design, the team tried to balance the design influence of the Big Daddies with a unique look. Soft design elements influenced by the story, like Little Sisters that would ride around in the Big Sister's cage and draw on her armor, were added to complement the harsh metal {{of the rest of the}} character.|$|E
