The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation) was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
