5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of <b>waste</b> <b>a</b> week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of <b>waste</b> <b>a</b> day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E
5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable <b>waste.</b> <b>A</b> widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|Teesside Energy from Waste plant (also {{known as}} Teesside WTE power station or Haverton Hill incinerator) is a {{municipal}} waste incinerator and waste-to-energy power station, which provides 29.2 megawatts (MW) of electricity for the National Grid by burning 390,000 tonnes of household and commercial <b>waste</b> <b>a</b> year. It {{is located on the}} River Tees at Haverton Hill, east of Billingham in North East England. Operated by SITA UK since its conception, the plant replaced the Portrack Incinerator and opened in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The chicks are fed worms, insects, and berries. Waste {{accumulation}} {{does not}} occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of <b>waste,</b> <b>a</b> solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|Until 2009, {{the station}} had two {{operating}} furnace lines, which together {{were capable of}} burning a total of 250,000 tonnes of waste per year, and generated 20MW of electricity. However, in May 2009 a third line was brought into operation. The plant currently burns 360,000 tonnes of <b>waste</b> <b>a</b> year and generates 29.2MW of electricity. This is enough electricity to power 60,000 homes.|$|E
5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to <b>waste</b> <b>a</b> trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the risks of the journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E

5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect <b>waste.</b> <b>A</b> harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable <b>waste.</b> <b>A</b> grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{residential}} development continued {{to expand in}} the watershed of Darby Creek. The automobile replaced railroads as the dominant form of transportation, and it allowed workers to live farther from their places of employment. As a result, the population of Springfield Township more than doubled between 1950 and 1960. The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was established in 1955 after the Gulf Oil Corporation donated a diked impoundment on the creek to the City of Philadelphia. Local resident Jean Diehl started a grassroots campaign to preserve the marsh in 1969, and Two Studies of Tinicum Marsh was published the following year which demonstrated the ecological importance of the marsh. The Folcroft Landfill and the Clearview Landfill operated along the creek between the 1950s and the 1970s before closing in the mid 1970s. The former is {{on the west bank}} of the creek and the latter is on the east bank. They supposedly accepted municipal waste, demolition waste, and medical <b>waste.</b> <b>A</b> number of businesses operated at the site of the Clearview Landfill after its closing.|$|E

25|$|With new {{regulations}} {{in place in}} 1975, Saugbrugsforeningen initiated a process to reduce its emissions.

By 1980 the situation in Iddefjorden had improved, but by 1985 the improvements had stagnated and further measures were required.|$|E

25|$|Tunnels were blasted {{through hard}} rock by {{drilling}} {{holes in the}} rock face by hand and filling them with black powder.

The loosened rock would be collected and hauled {{out of the tunnel}} for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as <b>waste.</b> <b>A</b> foot or so advance on a tunnel face was a typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years.

He had put in a light fuel load in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low {{positions}} tend to do the opposite and go for heavier fuel loads to make one less pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as they do not want to <b>waste</b> <b>a</b> light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles.
