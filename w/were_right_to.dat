5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an industry that grew up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E
5|$|Outside of Trenggalek, Sudirman and {{his group}} were stopped by TNI {{soldiers}} belonging to 102Battalion. These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman– who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding them– was a prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent {{to pick up the}} general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day former club captain Gary McAllister, {{who had been}} captain the last time Leeds won the League Championship, was appointed as the club's new manager with Steve Staunton his assistant. After the New Year, Leeds's form began to slump badly, the team going seven games without a win at one stage, {{and by the end}} of March the team had fallen to mid-table, and their promotion hopes looked to be in tatters. However, an excellent run of seven wins from their last eight games saw them secure fifth place and a play-off spot; without the well-publicised points deduction they would have finished second and earned automatic promotion. The deduction was heavily appealed, but this ultimately failed on 1 May 2008 when an independent arbitration panel ruled that the Football League <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> give Leeds this deduction.|$|E

Richard Preston, blogging for The Daily Telegraph, compared the importance of Griffin's appearance with past infrequent Question Time panellists such as comedians Eddie Izzard, Norman Pace and Jim Davidson, while also expressing confidence that the hour-long show and David Dimbleby would provide enough scrutiny to expose Griffin if he was a 'lightweight' or a 'bluffer'; he suggested that [...] "Britain truly does have problems" [...] if a trio of mainstream politicians did not manage to take him apart.|$|E

It remains to all of you to establish order and to consolidate your institutions."

500|$|While all her contemporaries in Chile {{recognised}} her heroism, and {{the common}} soldiers she served with looked up to her as the [...] "nun of charity," [...] some men said Morales {{had gone too far}} for a woman by taking up a rifle. Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna praised her for her dedication and bravery and for her hatred for those who killed her husband, but in 1881 gave her the free advice that she should not put herself at such risk and should [...] "return quietly to her poor home and restart the life of a real woman in manual labor, in caring for her relatives, in work with the needle and thimble, and exchange, after several years of adventures and passions, the revolver for her honored and beloved sewing machine." [...] She did not follow this advice and remained in the army {{until the end of the}} war, fighting in the Battle of Huamachuco on 10 July 1883, the last battle of the war. Men like Mackenna <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> say she put herself at unusual risk for a woman at the time, for several other Chilean cantinières were killed after being captured by Peruvians during the war.|$|E
500|$|The {{school is}} {{run as a}} democracy, with {{students}} deciding affairs that range from the curriculum to the behavior code. Lessons are non-compulsory. Neill emphasizes [...] "self-regulation", personal responsibility, freedom from fear, [...] "freedom in sex play", and loving understanding over moral instruction or force. In his philosophy, all attempts to mold children are coercive in nature and therefore harmful. Caretakers are advised to [...] "trust" [...] in the natural process and let children self-regulate such that they live by their own rules and consequently treat with the highest respect {{the rights of others}} to live by their own rules. Neill's [...] "self-regulation" [...] constitutes a child's right to [...] "live freely, without outside authority in things psychic and somatic"—that children eat and come of age when they wants, are never hit, and are [...] "always loved and protected". Children can do as they please until their actions affect others. In an example, a student can skip French class to play music, but cannot disruptively play music during the French class. Against the popular image of [...] "go as you please schools", Summerhill has many rules. However, they are decided at a schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote apiece. This does not necessarily mean total cessation to the children, as Neill thought adults <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> bemoan child destruction of property. He considered this tension between adult and child living styles to be natural. Neill felt that most schoolwork and books kept children from their right to play, and that learning should only follow play and not be mixed [...] "to make [...] palatable". Neill found that those students interested in college would complete the prerequisites in two years and of their own volition.|$|E

[...] Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; [...] "the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do." [...] Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, [...] "although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance." ...|$|E

Analysis of captured documents and prisoner interrogations, indicated the strain being imposed on the German army.
