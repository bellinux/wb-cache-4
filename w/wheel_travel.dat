25|$|The 1998 model {{had a few}} minor {{refinement}} {{changes to}} the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased <b>wheel</b> <b>travel</b> (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|E
2500|$|The JLTV {{is based}} around Oshkosh's TAK-4i (i = intelligent) {{independent}} suspension system. [...] Around 26,000 military vehicles are fitted with {{an earlier version}} of the system, these including the Oshkosh Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR), Oshkosh Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), and Oshkosh MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV); the TAK-4 system has also been retro-fitted to the Force Protection Inc Cougar and BAE Systems RG-33 MRAPs. The majority of systems supplied to date have been coil-sprung. The TAK-4i version fitted to the JLTV remains undisclosed, but is not coil-sprung and is of the variable adjustable ride-height type with up to [...] of <b>wheel</b> <b>travel,</b> 25 percent more than the current standard.|$|E
2500|$|Popular Science, in a four-car road test, {{considered}} the Premier {{one of the}} sportiest sedans (by measure of road holding and drive precision) available on the American market. The fully independent suspension on all the wheels made for better ride quality and handling characteristics, as did the {{rack and pinion steering}} design. [...] "The Premier was for its size, the lightest car that Chrysler built at the time , the stiffest (torsionally), and the best riding almost [...] of <b>wheel</b> <b>travel</b> vs. 4.5 for the K-cars that underpinned every Chrysler car then available. It benefited from decades of Renault experience with front-wheel-drive, and a good example will still impress even today." [...] The engineering levels achieved in the Premier are arguably the most refined in a sedan that was then produced by AMC or Chrysler.|$|E

5000|$|Pairs {{of wheels}} are {{attached}} to one another with an axle such that they must have the same rotational speed, but on a curve the distances the outer and inner <b>wheels</b> <b>travel</b> are different. As a result, the wheels must slip along the rails.|$|R

50|$|Motion {{ratio in}} {{suspension}} {{of a vehicle}} describes the amount of shock travel for a given amount of <b>wheel</b> <b>travel.</b> Mathematically it is the ratio of shock travel and <b>wheel</b> <b>travel.</b> The amount of force transmitted to the vehicle chassis reduces with increase in motion ratio.

When the {{measuring wheel}} moves parallel to its axis, the wheel skids without rolling, so this movement is ignored.

When used for equally spaced wheels (i.e., rather than cargo trucks with close-set rear axles) the front two wheels are arranged so that both steer, the rear less so than the leading wheel. The varying track radii mean that when the vehicle drives in a curve on firm tarmac each <b>wheel</b> <b>travels</b> a different distance.

40|$|Abstract: It {{is known}} that railway {{turnouts}} demand more maintenance than {{other parts of the}} railway track network because of large impact loads generated by the variation of wheel–rail con-tact conditions along the turnout and through the crossing. A method usingVAMPIREmodelling to determine the wheel impact forces due to passing turnout has been developed and presented in this article. The simulation shows that both turnout curve and crossing have significant effect on the wheel impact forces; the vertical impact forces from the turnout case are not significantly different from the <b>wheels</b> <b>travelling</b> straight through...|$|R
50|$|The {{paddle wheel}} {{is a large}} steel {{framework}} wheel. The {{outer edge of the}} wheel is fitted with numerous, regularly-spaced paddle blades (called floats or buckets). The bottom quarter or so of the <b>wheel</b> <b>travels</b> underwater. An engine rotates the paddle wheel in the water to produce thrust, forward or backward as required. More advanced paddle wheel designs feature feathering methods that keep each paddle blade closer to vertical while in the water to increase efficiency. The upper part of a paddle wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing.|$|R
