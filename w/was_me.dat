500|$|Rae {{recorded}} most of The Sea in 2009 at Manchester's Limefield Studios. She co-produced {{the record}} mostly with Steve Brown and Steve Chrisanthou, {{both of whom}} had worked on her debut album. Rae pursued a sound more aggressive than on her debut. During the recording process, Rae listened to the 1973 Sly & the Family Stone record Fresh and Curtis Mayfield's There's No Place Like America Today (1975), {{as well as the}} music of Nina Simone and Leonard Cohen. A live band was used in the album's recording, which was also a departure from her debut. [...] "On the first album, it <b>was</b> <b>me</b> and a producer in a basement going though hundreds of snare drum sounds to find the right one", she recalled.

Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That <b>was</b> <b>me.</b> Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E
