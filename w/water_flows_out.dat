5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> <b>out</b> of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the lake}} was fed by the River Westbourne {{entering}} at the Italian Garden at the north-western end of the Long Water. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as the river had become polluted, and so water was then pumped from the Thames. The water is now supplied by three boreholes drilled into the Upper Chalk. The first borehole {{is located at the}} Italian Gardens, the second at the Diana Memorial and the third, drilled in 2012 to a depth of 132m, is within 50m of the Diana Memorial. The Long Water runs south-east from this point to Serpentine Bridge, where the lake curves to the east, following the natural contours of the land. At the eastern end, <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> <b>out</b> of the lake via a sluice in the dam, forming a small ornamental waterfall at the Dell. The outflow has not historically maintained the waterfall, and re-circulation pumps were installed in the Dell, below the dam, to sustain this feature. The restoration work in 2012 restored the flows into the Serpentine and this waterfall is now restored as originally designed. Historically the river flowed due south from this point, marking the boundary between Westminster and Kensington, but since 1850 it has been diverted into a culvert, running underground to reach the Thames near Chelsea Bridge.|$|E

2500|$|The flow {{of water}} into the Tonle Sap is seasonal. In spring, {{the flow of the}} Mekong River, fed by monsoon rains, {{increases}} to a point where its outlets through the delta can't handle the enormous volume of water. At this point, the water pushes northward up the Tonle Sap river and empties into the Tonle Sap lake, thereby increasing the size of the lake from about [...] to about [...] {{at the height of the}} flooding. After the Mekong's waters crest — when its downstream channels can handle the volume of water — the flow reverses, and <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> <b>out</b> of the engorged lake.|$|E
2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of check valve) opens and allows water from a reservoir tank to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped inverted siphon tube mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's siphonic action. The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphonic action ceases and no more <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> <b>out</b> of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E

At {{one of these}} villages is a spring, where <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> <b>out</b> from under a stone, but in no great abundance; and it is conducted by a channel, cut in the ground, to a place outside the town (of Hebron), where they have constructed a covered tank for collecting the water...The Sanctuary (Mashad), stands on the southern border of the town....it is enclosed by four walls. The Mihrab (or niche) and the Maksurah (or enclosed space for Friday-prayers) stand in {{the width of the}} building (at the south end). In the Maksurah are many fine Mihrabs. He further recorded that [...] "They grow at Hebron for the most part barley, wheat being rare, but olives are in abundance. The [...] are given bread and olives. There are very many mills here, worked by oxen and mules, that all day long grind the flour, and further, there are working girls who, during the whole day are baking bread.

2500|$|When {{viscosity}} can be neglected, the outflow rate of {{the water}} is governed by Torricelli's law, or more generally, by Bernoulli's principle. Viscosity will dominate the outflow rate if the <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> <b>out</b> through a nozzle that is sufficiently long and thin, as given by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. Approximately, the flow rate is for such design inversely proportional to the viscosity, which depends on the temperature. Liquids generally become less viscous as the temperature increases. In the case of water, the viscosity varies {{by a factor of}} about seven between zero and 100 degrees Celsius. Thus, a water clock with such a nozzle would run about seven times faster at 100°C than at 0°C. Water is about 25 percent more viscous at 20°C than at 30°C, and a variation in temperature of one degree Celsius, in this [...] "room temperature" [...] range, produces a change of viscosity of about two percent. Therefore, a water clock with such a nozzle that keeps good time at some given temperature would gain or lose about half an hour per day if it were one degree Celsius warmer or cooler. To make it keep time within one minute per day would require its temperature to be controlled within °C (about ° Fahrenheit). There is no evidence that this was done in antiquity, so ancient water clocks with sufficiently thin and long nozzles (unlike the modern pendulum-controlled one described above) cannot have been reliably accurate by modern standards. [...] Note, however, that while modern timepieces may not be reset for long periods, water clocks were likely reset every day, when refilled, based on a sundial, so the cumulative error would not have been great.|$|E
