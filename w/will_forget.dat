He tells her that the Order has deceived Vanille and plans to sacrifice her to destroy {{the souls of the}} dead, so the living <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> their existence and be 'purified' for rebirth in the new world. Realizing that this would result in Serah never being reborn, Lightning decides to stop the ritual, though Cid warns her that she will be defying Bhunivelze's will.|$|E

500|$|Bottomley's last public venture was an {{engagement}} at the Windmill Theatre in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience. Following a health breakdown, {{he lived with}} Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness. He died in the Middlesex Hospital on 26 May 1933, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium a few days later. A large crowd heard the Revd Basil Bourchier express the hope that [...] "no one here today <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> what Mr Bottomley did to revive the spirits of our men at the Front".

[...] Thor Christensen of The Milwaukee Journal wrote that Bart [...] "gets in a few good yuks" [...] in the song, and Walt Belcher of The Tampa Tribune reported that Bart [...] "raps out an amusing story about his misadventures while mowing the lawn". The Orange County Registers Cary Darling noted that [...] "Bart turning his life into a hip-hop autobiography on 'Deep, Deep Trouble' is an absolute joy."

500|$|The {{film was}} a {{tremendous}} critical success, with many reviewers hailing it as a genuine work of art, recommended for both children and adults. Although film histories often state that the animation of the human characters was criticized, more recent scholarship finds that most reviewers praised the realistic style of the human animation, with several stating that audiences <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> that they are watching animated humans rather than real ones. At the 11th Academy Awards, the film won an Academy Honorary Award for Walt Disney [...] "as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field". Disney received a full-size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones, presented to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple. The film was also nominated for Best Musical Score.

500|$|The album's {{opening track}} and lead single, [...] "Control", is an up-tempo {{electronic}} song. Heavily influenced by techno and trance, {{it contains a}} prominent electric guitar riff. [...] "I told Ben [...] I {{wanted to do a}} song that had elements of rock and roll but with a techno vibe and he ran with it, creating a slamming heavy metal guitar intro on an insanely hyper track." [...] The song is about a dominant female who nurses a broken heart as she sings, [...] "Let me kiss it and make it better/After tonight you <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> her". [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] is also an up-tempo techno-trance song with elements of ambient music. It features Spanish guitar and castanets. The lyrics were influenced by and written surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain. The third track, [...] "Good-N-Evil", incorporates elements of industrial music. [...] "Fly" [...] is a mid-tempo song built around a trip hop beat. The album's fifth track and the only ballad on the album, [...] "Distant Land", contains elements of ambient music and features mellow guitar melody.

500|$|... "The Open Boat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} discussed works in Crane's canon, and is regularly anthologized. Wilson Follett included the story in the twelfth volume of his 1927 collection of Crane's work, and it also appeared in Robert Stallman's 1952 volume Stephen Crane: An Omnibus. The story and its subsequent eponymous collections received high acclaim from contemporary critics and authors. Praising the merit of the story and his friend's literary importance, journalist Harold Frederic wrote in his review for The New York Times that [...] "even if he had written nothing else, [...] have placed [...] where he now undoubtedly stands." [...] English poet Robert Bridges likewise praised the story in his review for Life, stating that Crane [...] "has indelibly fixed the experience on your mind, and that is the test of a literary artisan". American Newspaperman and author Harry Esty Dounce praised the story as chief among Crane's work, despite its seemingly simple plot, writing for the New York Evening Sun that [...] "those who have read 'The Open Boat' <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> every technical feat of construction before they forget the long, heartbreaking mockery of the day, with land so near, the bailing, the egg-shell changes of seats, the terrible, steady cheerfulness and brotherhood of the queer little human group".|$|E

Until now, the war that was going on has been a silent war. People did not really know about it. Now what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What about the people who are suffering over there? They are going through what we were going through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E

He also clashes with a replica of Riku created and controlled by another Organization member, Vexen, and believed by both Sora and the replica himself to be the real Riku. Axel, an Organization double agent, releases Naminé and allows her to meet Sora in person. Sora discovers Naminé to be the one manipulating his memories, having been forced to do so by Marluxia, the lord of Castle Oblivion and the figure who lured Sora there, as part of his plan to overthrow the rest of the Organization with Larxene. Sora climbs {{to the top of the}} tower and defeats Marluxia and the other Organization members, after which Naminé puts Sora and his friends into pod-like machines to help them regain the memories they lost in the castle, even though they <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> the events that transpired in the castle. Before they are put to sleep, Sora and Naminé promise to meet again as real friends once he reawakens, Sora firmly believing that his memories of her and the castle will remain in his heart despite being forgotten.|$|E

Not wishing {{to become involved in}} matters, the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara's memories with just a touch. Before they can do so, they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group. The Doctor realises that Clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting. Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory, she <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> {{how to deal with the}} snowmen. The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS. Clara follows him and knocks on the door, but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers. Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer. She learns that Latimer's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead. Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess' body is the only thing still frozen around them. She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny, who takes her to see Vastra. Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word [...] "Pond", which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest.|$|E
500|$|After Serge {{returned}} home, FATE sent Lynx to kill Serge, {{hoping that}} it would release the Arbiter lock. Ten years after Serge drowned, the thief Kid—presumably on Belthasar's orders—went {{back in time to}} save Serge and split the dimensions. FATE, locked out of the Frozen Flame again, knew that Serge would one day cross to Another world and prepared to apprehend him. Lynx switched bodies with Serge to dupe the biological check of Chronopolis on the Frozen Flame. Belthasar then reveals that these events were part of a plan he had orchestrated named Project Kid. Serge continues to the top of Terra Tower and defeats the Dragon God. Continuing to the beach where the split in dimensions had occurred, Serge finds apparitions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca once more. They reveal that Belthasar's plan was to empower Serge to free Schala from melding with Lavos, lest they evolve into the [...] "Time Devourer", a creature capable of destroying spacetime. Lucca explains that Kid is Schala's clone, sent to the modern age to take part in Project Kid. Serge uses a Time Egg—given to him by Belthasar—to enter the Darkness Beyond Time and vanquish the Time Devourer, separating Schala from Lavos and restores the dimensions to one. Thankful, Schala muses on evolution and the struggle of life and returns Serge to his home, noting that he <b>will</b> <b>forget</b> the entire adventure. She then seemingly records the experience in her diary, noting she will always be searching for Serge in this life and beyond, signing the entry as Schala [...] "Kid" [...] Zeal, implying that she and Kid have merged and became whole again. A wedding photo of Kid and an obscured male sits on the diary's desk. Scenes then depict a real-life Kid searching for someone in a modern city, intending to make players entertain the possibility that their own Kid is searching for them. The ambiguous ending leaves the events of the characters' lives following the game up to interpretation.|$|E
