5|$|Although much of {{the upper}} reaches are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on the navigation. 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> the navigation profitable for 150 years.|$|E

Without Brandon, Torquay could not match their high league position of the previous season, and finished 21st, four points above Barnet who were relegated out of The Football League.|$|E

5|$|The 2011–12 season saw Totti {{initially}} receive few starts under Roma's {{new manager}} Luis Enrique, as the club's early struggles continued. Totti sustained an injury on 1 October 2011 {{in the second}} half of a match against Atalanta, <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> him out of action until the 20 November; he returned to the pitch against Lecce, when he came off the bench in the 66th minute, as Roma won the match 2–1.|$|E

5|$|Uncommonly for Indonesian {{literature}} {{during this}} time period, Belenggu chapters were labelled with only a number– other works, such as Abdul Muis' 1928 novel Salah Asuhan (Wrong Upbringing), gave both a number and subtitle to the chapters. According to Taum, this change in style represents a stream of consciousness, {{as opposed to the}} earlier style <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> chapters separate.|$|E
5|$|Using iron {{construction}} for warships offered {{advantages for}} the engineering of the hull.

5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E

In 2003, {{the operations}} of the trams and metro trains were transferred to Oslotrikken (originally named Oslo Sporvognsdrift) and Oslo T-banedrift, respectively. In 2006, Oslo Sporveier was split into the infrastructure company Kollektivtransportproduksjon and a public transport authority, the latter of <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> the Oslo Sporveier name. From 2007, the ownership of the trams and trains was transferred to Oslo Vognselskap. In 2008, Oslo Sporveier merged with its Akershus counterpart, Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, to create Ruter.|$|E
5|$|From {{approximately}} 10−6 {{seconds after}} the Big Bang, during a period {{is known as the}} hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Kinsler hit 20 {{home runs}} (leading all AL second basemen) and was 23-for-25 in stolen base {{attempts}} (a 92% success rate). He {{was one of}} only six batters in the AL to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, along with Alex Rodriguez, Gary Sheffield, Grady Sizemore, B.J. Upton, and Curtis Granderson. He also became the sixth player in franchise history to reach the 20–20 plateau, joining Alfonso Soriano (2005), Iván Rodríguez (1999), Rafael Palmeiro (1993), Bobby Bonds (1978), and Toby Harrah (1975 and 1977). He did it despite his stress fracture, <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> him under 500 at bats. His 23 stolen bases and 96 runs led the Rangers.|$|E
5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it removed a viable population of Santa Cruz sheep from Santa Cruz Island. The sheep {{were in danger of}} being eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E

5|$|Recognizing {{the event}} {{as a serious}} {{radiological}} accident, the OAEP organized an emergency response team to manage the situation, {{in conjunction with the}} local public health and civil defense authorities. They conducted contamination and radiation level surveys and found that there was no contamination, but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv/h near the source, <b>which</b> <b>kept</b> them from getting close enough to determine what the source was. Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E
