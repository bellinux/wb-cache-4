5|$|US 206 was widened in Byram Township to six lanes. This {{construction}} {{follows a}} decade of controversy, including concerns that the widening <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act passed in 2004; an exemption to this act allowed the construction to proceed. The widening is being done in order to eliminate backups on the current two-lane stretch during rush hours. The project was slated to be finished in November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E

In the Department's view, a lethal {{operation}} conducted against a U.S. citizen whose conduct poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States would be a legitimate act of national self-defense that <b>would</b> not <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> assassination ban. Similarly, the use of lethal force, consistent with the laws of war, against an individual who is a legitimate military target would be lawful and <b>would</b> not <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> assassination ban." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{basis for}} TrollSat was an {{agreement}} signed in 2006 between the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Space Centre and Kongsberg Satellite Services. It specified that the Space Centre would install a Kongsberg-built radome, while the Polar Institute would provide power and undertake maintenance. In exchange, they could freely use the earth station {{for their own}} transmission needs. The commercial activities would {{be carried out by}} Kongsberg Satellite Services. A concern was raised regarding if satellite downloading <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic Treaty, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negated. The station started operations on 1 March 2007 and was officially opened by Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the station's {{construction}} {{started in}} the early 1960s and negotiations between ESRO and Norwegian authorities started in 1964, despite Norway's lack of membership in ESRO. An initial disagreement of whether to locate the facility by Ny-Ålesund or Longyearbyen was overcome, and an agreement was signed on 14 December 1964. However, it was followed up by numerous protests from the Soviet Union, which claimed the installation <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> demilitarized zone clause of the Svalbard Treaty, as the station {{had the potential to}} be used for military satellites and intelligence. The protests were rejected by Norwegian authorities, and construction started in May 1965. The Soviet Union attempted several inspections; one resulted in the crash of a Soviet helicopter. Operations commenced in 1967, but the facility was closed in 1974 as the facility was not suitable for new satellites with higher orbits.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{brought his}} {{opposition}} to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos {{in his first two}} months in office. The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons. After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.|$|E

2500|$|Such an {{intention}} <b>would</b> have <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> protocol {{of the code}} duello. When Burr later learned of this, he responded: [...] "Contemptible, if true."

5|$|During {{the rule}} of the {{succeeding}} Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers {{to a greater extent than}} had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, {{and did not}} see much future in India for him or the {{lifestyle}} he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract {{some of the larger}} border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that {{it would be difficult for}} him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> principle of the two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Under the Peerage Act 1963, all Scottish peers {{procured}} {{the right}} {{to sit in the}} House of Lords, and the system of electing representative peers was abolished. Scottish as well as British and English hereditary peers lost their automatic right to sit in the Upper House {{with the passage of the}} House of Lords Act 1999. During the debate on the House of Lords Bill, a question arose as to whether the proposal <b>would</b> <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Union. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the Estates of Parliament, Scotland's old, pre-Union parliament, was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act of 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do.|$|E
25|$|In a 5-4 vote, the Court {{ruled that}} {{suspects}} who are arrested without a warrant {{must be provided}} probable cause within 48 hours of their arrest. Using the precedent set by the Gerstein case – in which the Supreme Court ruled that Florida’s practice of keeping suspects for 30 days without probable cause was unconstitutional – and close interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, {{they found that the}} County of Riverside’s practice of keeping suspects in custody without probable cause determination amounted to illegal detention (or held in custody without being charged). Illegal detention <b>would</b> unquestionably <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> unreasonable search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment; withholding probable cause determination to suspects <b>would</b> also <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Amendment as well.|$|R
