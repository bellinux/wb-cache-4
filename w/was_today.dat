2500|$|On July 31, 2007, Donaire met Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Donaire {{said the}} {{experience}} was, [...] "an overwhelming feeling. It was indescribable. The moment I {{walked up the}} stairs and she was up there and when I looked it was a moment when I couldn't even look at her face. It was a great honor." [...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation <b>was</b> <b>today</b> but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was.

2500|$|In the {{procedure}} of extending his domain and power, Ardashir made many Parthian-dependent local shahs and landlords follow him. In {{the first phase}} of rebellion, Ardashir challenged the Parthians' central power by actions like minting coins and constructing new cities. After all, a sight of victory was not imaginable for Ardashir without a public dissatisfaction and interest in rebellion against the Parthians. For example, according to sources, the governor of a land northeast of Ctesiphon called [...] "Beth Garmai" [...] in Syriac and its center <b>was</b> <b>today</b> Kirkuk, along with the famous Sharat, who was the governor of Adiabene, aided Ardashir in his rebellion against the Parthians. In order to consolidate his power, Ardashir killed some of the important figures in Darabgard; then he invaded Kerman and took it too and took control of whole Pars, including the Persian Gulf shores. At that time, Ardashir constructed a palace and fire temple in Gor (current Firuzabad) that its ruins still remain and is called the Palace of Ardashir. He appointed one of his sons named Ardashir as the governor of Kerman. Artabanus, the Parthian emperor, ordered the governor of Susa to attack Ardashir, suppress his rebellion and send him to Ctesiphon. After Ardashir killed and terminated Shadh-Shapur, the governor of Spahan, after fighting him, headed towards Khuzestan and killed the governor of Susa too and added his domain to the lands under his rule. Then he invaded Characene State in the mouth of Tigris and took it and added it to his kingdom.|$|E

60|$|Later.--By the {{kindness}} of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been permitted {{to look over the}} log book of the Demeter, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men.

60|$|The Arab rode slowly onward, {{unconscious}} of {{the danger}} hovering in the trees behind him. The ape-man made a slight detour and increased his speed until he had reached a point upon the trail {{in advance of the}} horseman. Here he halted upon a leafy bough which overhung the narrow, jungle trail. On came the victim, humming a wild air of the great desert land of the north. Above him poised the savage brute that <b>was</b> <b>today</b> bent upon the destruction of a human life--the same creature who a few months before, had occupied his seat in the House of Lords at London, a respected and distinguished member of that august body.|$|E

"I {{do not say}} that," [...] Beric said; [...] "but see how it <b>was</b> <b>today.</b> The Iceni made no more {{impression}} {{upon the}} Roman column than {{if they had been}} attacking a wall. They hindered themselves by their very numbers, {{and by the time we}} meet the Romans our numbers will be multiplied by five, perhaps by ten. But shall we be any stronger thereby? Will not rather the confusion be greater? Today the Roman horse fled; but had they charged among us, small as was their number, what confusion would they have made in our ranks! A single Briton is a match for a single Roman, and more. Ten Romans fighting in order might repel the assault of a hundred, and as the numbers multiply so does the advantage of discipline increase. I hope for victory, Aska, but I cannot say that I feel confident of it." ...|$|E

60|$|While the Swash {{was making}} the circuit of Jamaica, as described, her captain had little {{communication}} with his passengers. The misunderstanding with the relict embarrassed {{him as much as}} it embarrassed her; and he was quite willing to let time mitigate her resentment. Rose would be just as much in his power a fortnight hence as she <b>was</b> <b>today.</b> This cessation in the captain's attentions gave the females greater liberty, and they improved it, singularly enough as it seemed to Mulford, by cultivating a strange sort of intimacy with Jack Tier. The very day that succeeded the delicate conversation with Mrs. Budd, to a part of which Jack had been an auditor, the uncouth-looking steward's assistant was seen in close conference with the pretty Rose; the subject of their conversation being, apparently, of a most engrossing nature. From that hour, Jack got to be not only a confidant, but a favourite, to Mulford's great surprise. A less inviting subject for tte--ttes and confidential dialogues, thought the young man, could not well exist; but so it was; woman's caprices are inexplicable; and not only Rose and her aunt, but even the captious and somewhat distrustful Biddy, manifested on all occasions not only friendship, but kindness and consideration for Jack.|$|E
