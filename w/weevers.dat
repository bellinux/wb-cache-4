The epigram on Shakespeare is particularly interesting since it follows the typical Shakespearean sonnet form: this may indicate <b>Weever</b> had seen actual examples of Shakespeare's sonnets, which at that date circulated only in manuscript. Many other epigrams however relate to persons <b>Weever</b> knew at Cambridge and presumably were composed while he was still a student there. The book also has commendatory verses by some of <b>Weever's</b> Cambridge friends.|$|R

50|$|<b>Weevers</b> (or weeverfish) are 9 extant {{species of}} fishes of family Trachinidae, order Perciformes. They are long (up to 37 cm), mainly brown in color, and have venomous spines {{on their first}} dorsal fins and gills. During the day, <b>weevers</b> bury {{themselves}} in sand, just showing their eyes, and snatch prey as it comes past, which consists of shrimp and small fish. <b>Weevers</b> are unusual in not having swim bladders, as do most bony fish, and as a result, sink {{as soon as they}} stop actively swimming. With the exception of T. cornutus from the southeast Pacific, all species in this family are restricted to the eastern Atlantic (including the Mediterranean). A tenth, extinct species, Callipterus speciosus, is known from the Monte Bolca lagerstätte of the Lutetian epoch.|$|E
50|$|The {{spotted weever}} {{can be found}} from Portugal to Angola and the Mediterranean. It is of minor {{commercial}} importance. It inhabits the shallow waters to about 100m depth near rocks and sea grass nearby, burrowing in the bottom. Just as other <b>weevers,</b> it feeds on small fishes and crustaceans.|$|E

50|$|The {{lesser weever}} (Echiichthys vipera) is a venomous weever {{of the family}} Trachinidae, in the order Perciformes, and the class Actinopterygii.

Lesser <b>weevers</b> may sting swimmers badly if disturbed in the water, and fishermen when they clean their fishing nets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Weevers</b> are {{sometimes}} erroneously called 'weaver fish', {{although the word}} is unrelated. In fact, the word 'weever' is believed to derive from the Old French word wivre, meaning serpent or dragon, from the Latin vipera.

50|$|Trachinus is a genus of <b>weevers,</b> order Perciformes that {{consists}} of seven extant species. Six of the genus representatives inhabit the waters of Eastern Atlantic Ocean, but only one, Trachinus cornutus, inhabits the South-Eastern Pacific Ocean. Three of the Atlantic species occur near the coasts of Europe. An eighth extinct species, T. minutus, is known from Oligocene-aged strata from the Carpathian Mountains, while a ninth species, also extinct, T. dracunculus, is known from middle-Miocene-aged strata from Piemonte, Italy.|$|E
50|$|Most human stings are {{inflicted by}} the lesser weever, which habitually remains buried in sandy areas of shallow water {{and is thus}} more likely to {{come into contact with}} bathers than other species (such as the greater weever, which prefers deeper water); stings from other species are {{generally}} limited to anglers and commercial fishermen. Even very shallow water (sometimes little more than damp sand) may harbour lesser <b>weevers.</b> The vast majority of injuries occur to the foot and are the result of stepping on buried fish; other common sites of injury are the hands and buttocks.|$|E

50|$|The {{lesser weever}} is {{littoral}} and benthic, living on sandy, muddy bottoms, {{ranging from a}} few meters deep to 150 m (in winter). Resting on the bottom, its position {{can be described as}} with eyes buried and the tip of the first dorsal fin exposed. Because of its venom and its occurrence near beaches, it is considered to be one of Europe's most dangerous weever species. The venom glands are located on its first dorsal fin, which is completely black, and on the gill cover. This species has the most potent toxin of all the <b>weevers.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Alepes {{was first}} created in 1839 by the English naturalist William John Swainson, after he {{initially}} proposed {{it to be}} a subgenus of Trachinus, which he had created to accommodate Trachinus melanoptera, a species he had just described. Trachinus was invalid, however, as it was already in use for a genus of <b>weevers.</b> This makes A. melanoptera the type species of the genus. The other species currently placed in Alepes were not directly classified in the genus, but were transferred from other, often distantly related genera. Many of these species have numerous junior synonyms. [...] "Alepes" [...] comes from the Greek word alepis, 'without scales'.|$|E
50|$|Ada {{died after}} a {{drowning}} {{accident in the}} North Sea. As the political climate in Berlin for Jews {{became more and more}} threatening, he decided to hide his daughter with his non-Jewish sister-in-law in The Netherlands. Hermann moved on to work in Brussels from 1934-1937, and in Paris in 1937-1939, under a false name, and then moved to the south of France where he was hidden in a farmhouse near Toulouse of the French branch of the <b>Weevers</b> family, where he composed three melodies for voice and piano (Ophélie, La Centure, Dormeuse) and a violin/cello sonata. The composition of Ophélie, based on the character of Prince Hamlet’s beloved Ophelia who drowns in a river, may have been inspired by the tragic drowning of Hermann’s wife. He found the solitude of his hidden life on the farm hard to cope with, having lost his wife and far away from his daughter, and used to go out to Toulouse {{from time to time to}} teach and socialize, accepting the risk of being discovered.|$|E

Born on the 23 rd March 1879 at Leusden, Lieven Ferdinand de Beaufort was the son of the {{historian}} and statesman W. H. de Beaufort. Growing up on the beautiful estate “Den Treek”, the country-seat of his father, Lieven Ferdinand de Beaufort showed a great interest in nature from his earliest years. After completing his time at the Secondary School (Hogere Burger School) at Amersfoort and gaining additional qualifications in Latin and Greek, in 1899 he became a student at the University of Amsterdam where Max Weber and C. Ph. Sluiter taught zoology, Hugo de Vries and Ed. Verschaffelt botany, and Eug. Dubois geology and palaeontology. Among his fellow students were Ihle, de Bussy, <b>Weevers,</b> Versluys, Cramer, van Kampen, Docters van Leeuwen, and Johanna Westerdijk, all of them to be wellknown in biological sciences in later years...|$|E
40|$|Pioneers without successors. The {{haphazard}} {{development of}} Dutch plant ecology Dutch botany {{in the nineteenth}} century focussed on the description of the flora of The Netherlands and its colonies. From 1900 onwards plant physiology gained momentum, but field work and laboratory activities were not linked together. Consequently, favourable conditions for the development of plant ecology were lacking. Unlike in the homeland this prerequisite was fulfilled in the Netherlands East Indies. The botanical garden in Buitenzorg under the directorship of Melchior Treub was a well-known international centre for the study of tropical vegetation. However, this did not change the poor linkage between field and experimental botany in The Netherlands. Plant ecological investigations were rare and did not form a coherent discipline. Interesting publications from the pioneer period (1870 - 1954) are discussed here. Most of these plant ecological publications were PhD-theses. The oldest ones were a mixture of descriptions of local floras and plant communities and some aspects of the environmental conditions. Environmental factors, particularly chalk, were discussed or even sampled, but experiments to assess causal relationships were not carried out. In two theses published about 1930 the ecological component was more explicit. Apart from the above-mentioned correlative descriptions these dissertations dealt with the germination and establishment of plants with reference to the factor salt. In addition, this problem was investigated experimentally. Salt plants and their ecophysiology were treated in two theses from about 1940. The. se studies were inspired by Th. <b>Weevers.</b> <b>Weevers</b> was professor of plant physiology {{and at the same time}} a great naturalist. This unusual combination e. xplains why these exceptional specimens of pure ecology in the pioneer period of Dutch plant ecology could occur. L. G. M. Baas Becking published the first textbook of plant ecology in 1934. It is the only broad-scale publication that emphasized fundamental issues of ecology. Advanced plant ecology commenced around the middle of the twentieth century. D. Bakker introduced in his 1951 thesis a multi-dimensional analytical approach in combination with field work. He was the first who practised autecology as a discipline. The Institute for Ecological Research was founded in 1954 and in 1961 Bakker became the first professor of plant ecology...|$|E
40|$|The {{positive}} correlation found in New Zealand between quality of white clover and its hydrocyanic acid content, {{could not be}} confirmed for Dutch white clover in the Netherlands. HCN occurred bound to an incompletely identified glucoside. As <b>Weevers</b> and Treub et al. found the glucoside and HCN contents varying in other plants during the day, the author {{tried to find out}} whether similar variations occur in the 1 ICN content of white clover. The bromometric method of Schulek was modified so that 1 ICN was titrable at a definitely alkaline pH (instead of acid or neutral). The experimental plants were grown under close control: constant illumination, and, within limits, usually constant temperature and air humidity. HCN in Dutch and New Zealand white clover increased rather sharply after sunrise, reaching a maximum rather soon (e. g. after 4 h), then decreasing. This variation only occurred if the weather conditions of the successive days were much alike. Otherwise it was disturbed, often with a second maximum after noon. A maximum must be assumed for the night also. At least 50 leaves must be analysed. These and other results seemed sufficient to start breeding research on HCN content in the Netherlands. <p/...|$|E
