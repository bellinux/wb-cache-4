40|$|In city area, {{electromagnetic}} interference caused by buildings {{is a very}} important problem. For example, a well known ghost phenomenon is caused by interaction between incident and reflected waves caused due to the presence of large and tall buildings. The characteristics of the radio waves absorption have been measured by coaxial-wave-guide unit or curtain wall specimens. But these measurements have some demerits. In this paper, a new measurement technique by panel specimen using parallel <b>wire</b> <b>line</b> is proposed and the accuracy of the this technique is verified. An examination of return loss by the fertile concrete panel specimen is carried out. It was shown that the measurement accuracy using parallel <b>wire</b> <b>line</b> and coaxial-wave-guide are almost equal. However, the parallel <b>wire</b> <b>line</b> technique can measure the characteristics of the radio wave absorption without being effected by the electrical environment around...|$|R

50|$|Currently {{the policy}} being {{set forth by}} the FCC has two {{different}} levels of regulation. One for fixed <b>line,</b> <b>wire</b> <b>line</b> communications {{and the other for}} wireless communications. Their current tenets strictly regulate network neutrality on <b>wire</b> <b>line</b> networks. However the commission is placing as many mandates on wireless communications. This means that wireless telecommunications providers are not permitted to block any website, but they may block applications and services unless they are direct competitors to the provider's content or services. This difference between the two technologies creates a major loophole in telecommunications policy, as most providers have already begun the shift from wired to wireless network infrastructures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For {{designing}} PCBs (printed circuit boards), it is {{very important}} to find out the locations and the frequencies giving large peak values of the voltages. Electrostatic capacity exists between the <b>wire</b> <b>lines</b> of PCBs. The characteristics of the capacitors depend on the distance between the <b>wire</b> <b>lines.</b> From this reason, we have to analyze circuits including nonlinear capacitors. In that case, the frequency characteristics become distorted, compared with linear circuits. If the distortion becomes large, the characteristics has unstable region. In this article, we propose a SPICE-oriented algorithm to analyze frequency characteristics with unstable region and to find the peaks of the frequency characteristics. I...|$|R
