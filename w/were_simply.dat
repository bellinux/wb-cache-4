Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> not able to evacuate in time.

5|$|B ^ The German Shepherd Dog breed {{was renamed}} in the UK by The Kennel Club in 1919 to Alsatian Wolf Dog. During the 1920s, the Wolf Dog {{part of the}} name fell out of use and dogs of this breed <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> known as Alsatians. The name had been reverted in most {{countries}} by 1977 to German Shepherd Dog.|$|E
50|$|Ayer defines {{truth as}} the {{criterion}} by which empirical propositions are validated. To {{say that a}} proposition <b>is</b> true <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> to assert it, {{and to say that}} a proposition <b>is</b> false <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> to assert a contradictory proposition. Thus, truth and falsehood <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> signs of assertion or denial of empirically verifiable propositions.|$|R

5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they <b>were,</b> <b>simply</b> did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the New York game firm of McLoughlin Brothers {{printed and}} {{published}} {{another version of}} The Mansion of Happiness. The McLoughlin version used even better artwork than the Parker Brothers version which makes it more valuable to collectors. The McLoughlin version used a game box with the game board attached to the inside bottom of the box. Implements and spinner <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> placed in the box.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns sits in {{his office}} {{awaiting}} the union leader, who mysteriously disappeared after promising {{to clean up the}} union, so that they can discuss the proposed union contract. While perusing the contract, Mr. Burns becomes disgusted with the union demands and reminisces about simpler times in which disgruntled workers <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> walled up in coke ovens. Mr. Burns then decides to take on the union, and revokes their dental plan.|$|E

5|$|The K'iche' conquest {{appears to}} have taken place around AD1000, some four centuries earlier than had been {{supposed}} using calculations based on the indigenous accounts. After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without pause, and the local styles <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> replaced by styles associated with the conquerors. This suggests that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.|$|E

5|$|Though {{different}} theories abound as to {{the exact}} centuries the kulintang was finally realized, there is a consensus that kulintang music developed from a foreign musical tradition which was borrowed and adapted to the indigenous music tradition already present in the area.

5|$|After his {{graduation}} in 1947, García Márquez {{stayed in}} Bogotá to study {{law at the}} Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he had a special dedication to reading. La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka «in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges» was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited {{with the idea of}} writing, not traditional literature, but a style similar to his grandfather's stories, in which «they inserted extraordinary events and anomalies as if they <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> an aspect of everyday life». His desire to be a writer grew. A little later, he published his first, La tercera resignación, which appeared in the September 13th, 1947 edition of the newspaper El Espectador.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E

5|$|All four ships {{spent the}} {{majority}} of their time in service with the main Italian fleet, alternating between active duty for training exercises and reserve status. In 1897, Goito was converted into a minelayer and Montebello became a training ship for engine room personnel. Monzambano and Confienza <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> sold for scrap in 1901. Goito laid defensive minefields after Italy entered World War I in 1915, but otherwise did not see action during the war. The two surviving vessels remained in the Italian fleet until 1920, when they too were broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E

5|$|Great {{white sharks}} (Carcharodon carcharias) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle. There {{is a record}} of a small {{individual}} caught off Argentina that bore bite marks from a copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) or similar species, but it is uncertain whether the porbeagle {{was the target of}} attempted predation or if the two <b>were</b> <b>simply</b> involved in interspecific aggression. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Dinobothrium septaria and Hepatoxylon trichiuri, and the copepods Dinemoura producta, Laminifera doello-juradoi, and Pandarus floridanus. Natural annual mortality is low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.|$|E
