40|$|A {{method to}} measure the δ 2 H and δ 18 O {{composition}} of pore waters in saturated and unsaturated geologic core samples using direct vapor equilibration and laser spectroscopy (DVE-LS) was first described in 2008, and has since been widely adopted by others. Here, we describe {{a number of important}} methodological improvements and limitations encountered in routine application of DVE-LS over several years. Generally, good comparative agreement and accuracy is obtained between core pore water isotopic data obtained using DVE-LS and that measured on water squeezed from the same core. In complex hydrogeologic settings, high-resolution DVE-LS depth profiles provide greater spatial resolution of isotopic profiles compared to long-screened or nested piezometers. When fluid is used during drilling and coring (e. g., water rotary or <b>wet</b> sonic <b>drill</b> methods), spiking the drill fluid with 2 H can be conducted to identify core contamination. DVE-LS analyses yield accurate formational isotopic data for fine-textured core (e. g., clay, shale) samples, but are less effective for cores obtained from saturated permeable (e. g., sand, gravels) geologic media or on chip samples that are easily contaminated by <b>wet</b> rotary <b>drilling</b> fluid. Data obtained from DVE-LS analyses of core samples collected using <b>wet</b> (contamination by <b>drill</b> water) and dry sonic (water loss by heating) methods were also problematic. Accurate DVE-LS results can be obtained on core samples with gravimetric water contents < 5 % by increasing the sample size tested. Inexpensive Ziploc™ gas sampling bags were determined to be as good as, if not better, than other, more expensive bags. Sample storage in gas tight sample bags provides acceptable results for up to 10 days of storage; however, measureable water loss and evaporitic isotopic enrichment occurs for samples stored for up to 6 months. With appropriate care taken during sample collection and storage, the DVE-LS approach for obtaining high resolution pore water isotopic data remains a promising alternative to study the hydrogeology of saturated and unsaturated sediments.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated rotary percussive drill is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a rotary percussive bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to <b>wet</b> <b>drill</b> a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to <b>wet</b> <b>drill</b> a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface. Typical adhesion test results comparing tensile strength with shotcrete curing age are shown in Figure 4. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011.

40|$|Unexpectedly weak signal levels, in both {{radar and}} cross-hole modes, were {{obtained}} {{during a recent}} VHF borehole radar experiment in an arid, alluvial environment. An investigation revealed that the kaolinitic strata, which hosted the vertical boreholes, were moistened by drilling fluid during site preparation. It was therefore conjectured that the weak received signals were due to attenuation caused by wet, conductive annuli surrounding the boreholes in an otherwise dry medium. To examine this premise, the VHF electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) of representative dry and wet samples from the different strata were measured. These data were then used in a 3 D, electrodynamic Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) code to model different annular configurations of dry and wet strata in and around boreholes of different dimensions. In the model, a 1. 2 m center-fed dipole was placed coaxially in the various boreholes and excited by a Gaussian pulse.

With {{over half of}} the ice sheet believed to be resting on a <b>wet</b> bed, <b>drilling</b> down to this environment must conform to international agreements on environmental stewardship and protection, making clean hot-water drilling the most viable option. Such a drill, and its water recovery system, must be capable of accessing significantly greater ice depths than previous hot-water drills, and remain fully operational after connecting with the basal hydrological system. The Subglacial Lake Ellsworth (SLE) project developed a comprehensive plan for deep (greater than 3000 ?m) subglacial lake research, involving the design and development of a clean deep-ice hot-water drill. However, during fieldwork in December 2012 drilling was halted after a succession of equipment issues culminated in a failure to link with a subsurface cavity and abandonment of the access holes. The lessons learned from this experience are presented here. Combining knowledge gained from these lessons with experience from other hot-water drilling programmes, and recent field testing, we describe the most viable technical options and operational procedures for future clean entry into SLE and other deep subglacial access targets. <br/...|$|R

The sensors consist of a pair of capacitive pressure sensors, inlet/outlet and a microchannel. The main microchannel is 128. 0 mu m wide, 4. 64 mu m deep and 5680 mu m long, and operated under nearly atmospheric conditions where the outlet Knudsen number is 0. 0137.

However, water adverseky affects tri- cone drill bits commonly used in surface drilling operations, causing excessive wear and premature replacement.

An association was observed between the exposure time and VWF stages which included 18 men in Stage 0, three in the intermediate stage of OT/ON, five in Stage 2 and 16 in Stage 3; no men were seen at Stage 1. Among those with VWF in Stage 3, the index, middle and ring fingers were affected in both hands and the little fingers and thumbs were last to be involved. Clinically, on general examination, apart from vibration-induced white finger, the men in the 'vibration ' group were as healthy as those in the 'control ' group. The circumference of the index fingers was not significantly different for the different groups. Neurological tests showed that the ridge test and, to a lesser extent, the two-point discrimination and the light touch tests, could be regarded as useful for the diagnosis of VWF.

40|$|AbstractThe WHO/ILO {{international}} program (1995) on {{the global}} elimination of silicosis, aiming inter alia at characterization of dust and its sources, monitoring and {{evaluation of the results}} for health risk, has put a premium on the determination of quartz in respirable air borne dust, which is known to cause irreversible lung diseases, such as silicosis and cancer. The work presented herein is a study of the quartz content in airborne respirable dust (ARD) generated in coal and metal mines (zinc and manganese) with a view to evaluate the health risk of miners as per mines regulations. Implementation of safety measures to reduce/eliminate risk to contract silicosis in any mine requires monitoring of the emission of quartz in various locations in addition to the ARD concentration for computation of Maximum Exposure Limit (MEL). The direct on-filter method using an FTIR spectrometer has been adopted for the determination of quartz in ARD. Personal air samplers were used to collect ARD from different locations in mines on GLA- 5000 PVC membrane filters. The air samplers were either attached with different workers engaged in the shift or placed in a position near to the dust generation source in the mines to collect suitable amount of dust for analysis. Each dust-loaded filter was then directly scanned by the spectrometer to give the spectrum of quartz, from which the proportion of quartz in the dust was determined from an estimation of the intensity of the doublet at 800 cm- 1 using standard procedure. It has been found that the percentage of quartz in ARD of coal mines, especially in coking coal mines situated in Jharia coalfield, is less than 1 % in almost all the workings, barring a few cases where it has exceeded this value. MEL for workers is, therefore, equal to 3 mg/m 3 in almost all the working places sampled in coal mines. In contrast, for metal mines the situation is different. Quartz determined in ARD exceeds 5 % in many workings. Further, the percentage of quartz is also found to vary from location to location inside the mine, which {{is a reflection of the}} compositional variation of the rock strata in different working zones of the mines.

Water is extensively used for various mining operations, viz., <b>wet</b> <b>drilling,</b> dust suppression, ore processing, washing of heavy earth moving machinery (HEMM). Mine drainage, mine cooling, aqueous leaching and other mining processes has the potential to cause contamination of water bodies both surface and ground by discharging mine effluent and tailing seepage. The ever increasing mining activities pose a serious threat to the water resources. The awareness towards environmental footprint of mining operations is consistently growing, but it often gets little attention. Environmental pollution is the price that we pay for our everyday use of minerals and its products. Contamination of water sources severely affects not only an individual species but the entire ecosystem and all the organisms living in the ecosystem, and also severely affect human health. In the present work, water samples were collected from various sampling sites, followed by laboratory analysis and water quality modelling. Water sampling was done in the area surrounding TRB iron ore mine owned by Jindal Steel & Power Ltd, located in Tensa region of Sundergarh district in Odisha during October 2016. The location of sampling was so selected because of the nearness of mining site to residential areas. In recent years, the surrounding surface and ground water bodies were gradually contaminated due to the mining operations.

The water quality modelling was done using WA-WQI (Weighted Average - Water Quality Index) based on 11 water quality parameters, viz., pH, Conductivity, DO, TDS, Hardness, BOD, Sulphate, Chloride, Nitrate, Calcium and Iron.

Graphical models of all the water quality parameters were created in QGIS (Quantum GIS) software using IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting) method, in which all the water quality parameters were interpolated and displayed for the area surrounding the sampling locations. Finally, a 3 D graphical model of WA-WQI was created, represented as a DEM (Digital Elevation Model), where higher elevation indicates higher values of WA-WQI. Based on the study of the experimental analysis data and the graphical models, it was concluded that turbidity values exceeded the permissible limit (1 NTU according to IS- 10500) in almost the entire study region; pH was below the permissible of 6. 5 in half of the study region; iron, copper and manganese concentrations exceeded the permissible limits (0. 3 mg/l, 0. 05 mg/l and 0. 1 mg/l respectively) in the regions surrounding the sampling sites G 1, S 2 and S 5; BOD value exceeded the permissible limit (5 mg/l) in the regions surrounding the sampling sites G 1 and S 5; and nickel concentration exceeded the permissible limit (0. 02 mg/l) in the regions surrounding the sampling sites S 5. According to the WA-WQI ratings determined for the water samples, only G 2 qualifies for excellent water quality; S 1 and S 3 have good water quality; G 3, G 4, G 5 and S 4 have poor water quality; and G 1, S 2, and S 5 has very poor water quality. Although, it was inconclusive that if ground water sources are more polluted than surface water sources. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing roof support systems in coal mines. When designing the roof support, {{it is necessary to}} account for the uncertainties that are inherently exist within the rock mass and support elements. The performance of a support system is affected by these uncertainties, which are not taken into account in the current design methodologies used in South Africa. This study sets out to develop a method which takes all uncertainties into account and quantitatively provides a risk-based design. Despite the fact that the roof bolting {{is probably one of the}} most researched aspects of coal mine ground control, falls of ground still remain the single major cause of fatalities and injuries in South African collieries. Mainly five different support design methodologies have been used; namely, analytical modelling, numerical modelling, physical modelling, design based on geotechnical rating systems and field testing. As part of this study, it is shown that there are many elements of a support system that can impact the support and roof behaviour in a coal mine and the characteristics of these elements as well as the interaction between them is complex and can vary significantly within a short distance. These variations account for uncertainties in coal mine roof support and they are usually not taken into account in the above design methodologies resulting in falls of ground and/or over design of support systems. The roof and support behaviour were monitored at 29 sites at five collieries. It is found that there was no evidence of a dramatic increase in the stable elevations as experienced in some overseas collieries. A roadway widening experiment was carried out to establish the critical roof displacements. The maximum width attained was 12 m at which stage 5 mm displacement was measured. During the monitoring period no roof falls occurred at any of the 29 sites and road widening experiment site, even where 12 mm displacements were measured. The in situ monitoring programme was continued in additional 26 monitoring stations in 13 sites with the aim of establishing the effect of unsupported cut-out distance on roof and support performances. The results showed that the lithological composition of the roof strata plays a major role in the amount of deflection that was recorded. Bedding separation was seen to occur at the contacts between different strata types. It is concluded that the roof behaved like a set of composite beams with different characteristics. It is also found that the amounts of deflection corresponded with the deflection that would be expected from gravity loaded beams. During this monitoring programme variable nature of roof and support systems are also demonstrated. As many mines use different geotechnical rating systems, an evaluation of the currently used classification techniques were conducted to determine their effectiveness in design of roof support strategies. It is found that currently used systems cannot quantitatively determine the required support system in a given geotechnical environment. Impact splitting tests are found to be the appropriate system for South African conditions. It is however concluded that the roof lithology, stress regime and roof characteristics can change within meters in a production section. Therefore, in order to predict these changing conditions many boreholes are required for a section, which would be costly and time consuming. An in-depth study into the roof support elements was conducted for the purpose of obtaining an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of roof support systems and developing guidelines for their improvement. All of the currently available roof bolt support elements and related machinery were evaluated using in situ short encapsulated pull tests. The results showed that, on average, bond strengths obtained from the roof bolts supplied by different manufacturers can vary as much as 28 per cent. The test results conducted on different resins showed that the strength of resin currently being used in South Africa is adequate. Differences between commonly used bit types were established. It is concluded that the 2 -prong bit outperforms the spade bit in sandstone and shale rock types. In addition, the effect of hole annulus was also investigated as part of this study. The results show that an annulus between 2. 5 mm to 3. 8 mm resulted in the most effective bond strengths. The effect of wet and dry drilling was noted. It is found that bond strengths and overall support stiffnesses are greater with the use of the <b>wet</b> <b>drilling</b> in all resin types. The results from the tests in different rock types highlighted the very distinct differences between bolt system performances. Quality control procedures for compliance with the design, support elements and quality of installation are presented. Recommendations for improving the quality control measures and for developing testing procedures for bolt system components, installation quality and resin performance are provided. Finally, a roof support design methodology that takes into account all natural variations exist within the rock mass and the mining process has been developed and presented. This was achieved by adapting a probabilistic design approach using the well established stochastic modelling technique. This methodology enables rock engineers to design roof support systems with greater confidence and should result in safer and economic extraction of coal reserves.
