He didn't seem to understand. He pleaded guilty to a four-hundred-a-year fee, but told me {{at the same time}} that it cost him a great deal more than that in extra charities. I asked him what pull he got through being in Parliament and how many of his friends he could find places for. All he could do was to smile and tell me that I didn't understand the way things were done in this country. He wanted to make me believe that he was anxious to sit in Parliament there and work day after day just for the honor and glory of it, or because he thought it was his duty.|$|E

I {{had a very good}} relationship with a very prominent executive at Universal. He liked me, and he liked what I was doing with Walter, and the material I was bringing in.I gave him Beetlejuice to read, and I gave it to him on a Friday, and on Monday his assistant called me and said well, he wants to meet with you. My initial reaction was wow! He'd read it. He must have loved it or he wouldn't have wanted to see me so soon. But I went into his office, and he literally said 'what are you doing with your career?''This piece of weirdness, this is what you're going {{to go out into the}} world with? You're developing into a very good executive. You've got great taste in material. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to squander all that for this piece of shit', was basically what he was saying. It goes to show, right?

30|$|When 13 of the {{participants}} (girls n =  8; boys n =  5) tried to obtain a uniform for a sport or for their PE class, the school or organization did not have their size uniform. These experiences made all of them uncomfortable and made them feel like outsiders. Six (girls n =  4; boys n =  2) of the 13 participants explained {{that they had to}} have their size custom-ordered, while the other seven wore the poor-fitting athletic clothes. Sarah had to special-order her PE clothes the first week of school, and then {{had to go to the}} office to pick up her uniform. She explained this made her feel embarrassed: “Like it’s not really a bad thing but sometimes it is because people ask <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to the office and you don’t really want to tell them you have to custom-order”. When asked if she would ever feel comfortable telling anyone that she had to get a different-sized uniform, she quickly responded with a confident “no”. Imani said they did not have her size uniform for volleyball and that she had to special-order it. For this uniform, the kids who needed a larger size had to pay extra, and this was not an option for Imani’s family. She explained that her mom did not have a job at the time and was on unemployment. Darren remembered a time when the baseball organizers did not have his pant size. When asked if it made him feel uncomfortable he explained that he knew other kids were “making a face”. Four children (girl n =  3, boy n =  1) explained that custom-ordering a uniform was not an option, and that they had to wear the wrong size. One participant explained that he wore a football jersey that covered only half of his stomach. He said, “It was really embarrassing at first, but I got used to it after a while”.|$|E
40|$|D. Phil. (Leadership in Performance and Change) Orientation: This thesis {{presents}} {{a model of}} spirituality in the workplace. Spirituality in the workplace has largely been avoided or neglected in the banking sector and is therefore ill understood. It shows little theoretical development and {{could very well be}} the next competitive advantage for business. Research question: A general research question guided the study, namely: "What are the subjective experiences of spirituality of a manager in a South African retail bank and how can these assist scholars in reaching an understanding of spirituality at work?” Research aim and objectives: The aim {{of the study was to}} explore and describe the concrete experiences and views of a branch manager of a retail bank with regard to spirituality in the workplace and to develop a model of it. The key objectives of the study were: · To develop an appropriate qualitative research approach to capture and unravel the experiences and views of the bank manager; · To study the work of prominent scholars in associated study fields in order to infer abstract constructs that could be used as analytic tools to illuminate the world of the bank manager, and · To develop a model of spirituality in the workplace by applying first-order constructs, that is, the concrete experiences and viewpoints of the manager, as well as second-order constructs, that is, the abstract concepts of scholars. Motivation for the study: Knowledge of spirituality in the workplace is in its infancy in the banking sector. Interest in the topic was raised by existential questions such as: Who are you? Where are you going? <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> there? The fact that human beings ask these questions, seek meaning and ask about the purpose of life fascinated me. This fascination was not limited to individuals' personal lives; I wanted to know more about spirituality as it is lived and felt in the workplace where workers spend a third of their lives; I also wanted to know the value of spirituality in the workplace for organisations. This finally led to my submission of a research proposal titled "Towards developing a model for spirituality in the workplace". The model I developed for spirituality in the workplace organises information in such a way that the relationships among the various elements are clarified. This theoretical framework provides an understanding for spirituality in the workplace. Research approach: A modernist qualitative research approach was employed, since I wanted to give my research participant a voice regarding spirituality in the workplace. The interpretive-constructivist research philosophy, and more particularly the assumption that reality is constructed by individuals interacting with their social worlds, underpinned my research. The research data were collected by means of a life history and analysed using Strauss and Corbin’s grounded theory. Regarding data management and storage, I followed Bogdan and Biklen’s (2007, p. 118) advice: pledge to keep your data physically well organised; develop a plan on how to achieve this; ensure that you stick to your plan; create a back-up system; have hard copies of all the recorded data in a manual filing system to secure valuable and often irreplaceable data should your computer become infected with a virus or dysfunctional for some other reason. I also ensured that all the data, whether paper-based or electronic, were kept safe and confidential. The writing style was mainly the scientific tale, but confessional, realist and autoethnographic tales were also used. The entire research process was influenced by symbolic interactionism, that is, seeing meaning as something that arises from the interaction between people, especially when they seek understanding of the world in which they work and live. Meaning was constructed through the researcher’s questions to, and discussions and interactions with the research participant...|$|E

[...] The Ombudsman and the existence of the position itself were later criticized by Ford and became the subject of further debate. In October, Mayor Ford said he wanted to eliminate three watchdog positions: that of the Ombudsman, the Integrity Commissioner and the lobbyist registrar. [...] "You don't need a lobbyist registry, an ombudsman and an integrity commissioner. They have 20 people; they're tripping over themselves. They're trying to make themselves look busy."

5000|$|He {{wrote for}} {{individuals}} who struggle with sin and forgiveness and he began this in Either/Or (1843) and continued through 1851 with a repetition of his theme from his three discourse of 1843 Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins. He sees the spiritual connection between God and the single individual much akin to Luther's idea of the priesthood of all believers. [...] In the brief moments prescribed, let us than speak about these words: Love (Christ’s love) hides a multitude of sins. Is it not true that you have felt the need of this and on this very day you feel the need of a love that can cover sins, your sins-and this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to the Lord’s table today? While it is only all too true, as Luther says, that every human being has a preacher within him-he eats with him, drinks with him, awakens with him, sleeps with him, in short, is always around him, always with him, wherever he is and whatever he does, a preacher who is called flesh and blood, lusts and passions, habits and inclination-so it is also certain that deep within every human being there is a secret-sharer who is present just as scrupulously everywhere-the conscience. A person can perhaps succeed in hiding his sins from the world, he can perhaps be foolishly happy that he succeeds, or yet, a little more honest, admit {{that it is a}} deplorable weakness and cowardliness that he does not have the courage to become open-but a person cannot hide his sins from himself. This is impossible, because the sin that was absolutely unconditionally hidden from himself would, of course, not be sin, any more than if it were hidden from God, which is not the case of either, since a person, as soon as he is aware of himself and in everything in which he is aware of himself, is also aware of God and God is aware of him. *Soren Kierkegaard, Two Discourses at Friday Communion, (Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins 1 Peter 4:7:12 The Bible) from Without Authority, Hong translation 1997 p. 182 ...|$|R

[...] From the very first moment the Kaliyan entered this world I stopped accepting all these things.
