Notwithstanding the importance of looking at donation care as an integrated process, most studies discuss only a few isolated topics or sub-processes. To improve paediatric donation, more research is required on substandard factors and their interactions.

5000|$|Ickes did not {{directly}} address the required level of suspicion for laptop searches because customs officers, in this case, met the reasonable suspicion standard.

Instead, the court ruled that searches of electronic materials are legally equivalent to searches of property.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} a {{comparative}} micro-photoluminescence investigation of ZnO hexagonal nanopillars (HNPs) and the seeding layer grown on the off-axis 4 H-SiC substrate. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) results establish that a thin seeding layer continuously covers the terraces of 4 H-SiC prior {{to the growth of}} ZnO HNPs. Low temperature photoluminescence (LTPL) shows that ZnO HNPs are only dominated by strong donor bound exciton emissions <b>without</b> <b>any</b> deep <b>level</b> emissions. Micro-LTPL mapping demonstrates that this is specific also for the seeding layer. To further understand the recombination mechanisms, time-resolved micro-PL spectra (micro-TRPL) have been collected at 5 K and identical bi-exponential decays have been found on both the HNPs and seeding layer. Temperature-dependent TRPL indicates that the decay time of donor bound exciton is mainly determined by the contributions of non-radiative recombinations. This could be explained by the TEM observation of the non-radiative defects in both the seeding layer and HNPs, like domain boundaries and dislocations, generated at the ZnO/SiC interface due to biaxial strain...|$|R

In the United States and Europe, these efforts are defined within the architectures of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Program and Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) Program respectively. Both programs have identified Airborne Spacing as a critical component, with Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) as a key enabler. Increased interest in reducing airport community noise and the escalating cost of aviation fuel {{has led to the}} use of Continuous Descent Arrival (CDA) procedures to reduce noise, emissions, and fuel usage compared to current procedures. To provide these operational enhancements, arrival flight paths into terminal areas are planned around continuous vertical descents that are closer to an optimum trajectory than those in use today. The profiles are designed to be near-idle descents from cruise altitude to the Final Approach Fix (FAF) and are typically <b>without</b> <b>any</b> <b>level</b> segments. By staying higher and faster than conventional arrivals, CDAs also save flight time for the aircraft operator. The drawback is that the variation of optimized trajectories for different types and weights of aircraft requires the Air Traffic Controller to provide more airspace around an aircraft on a CDA than on a conventional arrival procedure. This additional space decreases the throughput rate of the destination airport. Airborne self-spacing concepts have been developed to increase the throughput at high-demand airports by managing the inter-arrival spacing to be more precise and consistent using on-board guidance. It has been proposed that the additional space needed around an aircraft performing a CDA could be reduced or eliminated when using airborne spacing techniques...|$|R
