5|$|In America, documentaries were {{produced}} in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the Why <b>We</b> <b>Fight</b> propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's The Battle of San Pietro. Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as Mrs. Miniver (1942), which portrayed a British {{family on the}} home front; Edge of Darkness (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters, and The North Star (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Towards {{the end of the}} war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as Guadalcanal Diary (film) (1943), Mervyn LeRoy's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), and John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945).|$|E
