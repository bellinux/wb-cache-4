5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, Monarch {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. Following the outbreak of World War I in August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. On 8 August, Monarch <b>was</b> <b>conducting</b> gunnery practice south-east of Fair Isle when she was unsuccessfully attacked by a submarine-fired torpedo. This was probably a false alarm as the area was too far to the west of the German U-boats' patrol zones to be likely. , however, has been suggested as a candidate for the attack, although the boat was sunk the following day with the loss of all hands and the truth will never be known.|$|E

5|$|Fluor {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy <b>was</b> <b>conducting</b> a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp <b>was</b> <b>conducting</b> his regular inspection of the monument when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E
5|$|Louis Alexander Slotin (1 December 1910– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian {{physicist}} and chemist {{who worked on}} the Manhattan Project. During World War II, Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values. On 21 May 1946, Slotin <b>was</b> <b>conducting</b> a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction, which released a burst of hard radiation. He received a lethal dose of radiation and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later. Slotin was the second person to die from a criticality accident, following the death of Harry Daghlian, who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin. Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident from killing any colleagues. He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol during the experiment.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{an attempt}} to avoid losing large {{quantities}} of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006, that criminalized the melting and export of pennies (which as of 2013 cost 1.83 cents to produce) and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both. The rules were finalized on April 17, 2007. The melt value of a nickel for some time was more than five cents, including nearing over one-and-a-half times its face value in May 2007. Since then, the supply and demand of the coin's composition metals have stabilized. A nickel's melt value fell below its face value from late 2008 through mid-2010, and more recently again from late mid-2012 through the present. In February 2014, it was reported that the Mint <b>was</b> <b>conducting</b> experiments to use copper-plated zinc (the same composition used for the United States 1 cent coin) for the nickel.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade <b>was</b> <b>conducting</b> operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, {{and despite the fact that}} there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E
5|$|The {{blockade}} set by Grenville {{was initially}} {{some distance from}} the town, and did not prevent Blake from sending and receiving messages. The besieging army was reinforced soon after with Goring's infantry and artillery units, and so, with a large force, the attackers closed in on the town, establishing entrenchments within musket-shot of Taunton's defences. Command of the siege passed to Berkeley, though Grenville's troops often failed to follow the new commander's orders, and some of them deserted. Despite Grenville's retirement from the battle due to injury, he and Berkeley clashed; Grenville complained to the Prince of Wales that Berkeley <b>was</b> <b>conducting</b> the siege badly, while Berkeley claimed that Grenville had given his men orders to desert. These disagreements led Hopton, by now the commander of the Royalist forces in the West Country, to be given command of the siege.|$|E
