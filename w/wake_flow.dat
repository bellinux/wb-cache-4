5000|$|A similar effect, {{known as}} the {{magnetic}} draping effect, occurs when a super-Alfvenic plasma flow impacts an unmagnetized object such as {{what happens when the}} solar wind reaches the ionosphere of Venus: the flow deflects around the object draping the magnetic field along the <b>wake</b> <b>flow.</b> The condition for the flow to be super-Alfvenic means that the relative velocity between the flow and object, , is larger than the local Alfven velocity [...] which means a large Alfvenic Mach number: [...] For unmagnetized and electrically conductive objects, the ambient field creates electric currents inside the object, and into the surrounding plasma, such that the flow is deflected and slowed down as the time scale of magnetic dissipation is much longer than the time scale of magnetic field advection. The induced currents in turn generate magnetic fields that deflect the flow creating a bow shock. For example, the ionospheres of Mars and Venus provide the conductive environments for the interaction with the solar wind. Without an ionosphere, the flowing magnetized plasma is absorbed by the non-conductive body. The latter occurs, for example, when the solar wind interacts with Moon which has no ionosphere. In magnetic draping, the field lines are wrapped and draped around the leading side of the object creating a narrow sheath which is similar to the bow shocks in the planetary magnetospheres. The concentrated magnetic field increases until the ram pressure becomes comparable to the magnetic pressure in the sheath: ...|$|E

40|$|Experimentally {{observed}} periodic {{structures in}} shallow (i. e. bounded) <b>wake</b> <b>flows</b> {{are believed to}} appear {{as a result of}} hydrodynamic instability. Previously published studies used linear stability analysis under the rigid-lid assumption to investigate the onset of instability of wakes in shallow water flows. The objectives of this paper are: (i) to provide a preliminary assessment of the accuracy of the rigid-lid assumption; (ii) to investigate the influence of the shape of the base flow profile on the stability characteristics; (iii) to formulate the weakly nonlinear stability problem for shallow <b>wake</b> <b>flows</b> and show that the evolution of the instability is governed by the Ginzburg-Landau equation; and (iv) to establish the connection between weakly nonlinear analysis and the observed flow patterns in shallow <b>wake</b> <b>flows</b> which are reported in the literature. It is found that the relative error in determining the critical value of the shallow wake stability parameter induced by the rigid-lid assumption is below 10 % for the practical range of Froude number. In addition, it is shown that the shape of the velocity profile has a large influence on the stability characteristics of shallow wakes. Starting from the rigid-lid shallow-water equations and using the method of multiple scales, an amplitude evolution equation for the most unstable mode is derived. The resulting equation has complex coefficients and is of Ginzburg-Landau type. An example calculation of the complex coefficients of the Ginzburg-Landau equation confirms the existence of a finite equilibrium amplitude, where the unstable mode evolves with time into a limit-cycle oscillation. This is consistent with flow patterns observed by Ingram & Chu (1987), Chen & Jirka (1995), Balachandar et al. (1999), and Balachandar & Tachie (2001). Reasonable agreement is found between the saturation amplitude obtained from the Ginzburg-Landau equation under some simplifying assumptions and the numerical data of Grubisic et al. (1995). Such consistency provides further evidence that experimentally observed structures in shallow <b>wake</b> <b>flows</b> may be described by the nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau equation. Previous works have found similar consistency between the Ginzburg-Landau model and experimental data for the case of deep (i. e. unbounded) <b>wake</b> <b>flows.</b> However, it must be emphasized that much more information is required to confirm the appropriateness of the Ginzburg-Landau equation in describing shallow <b>wake</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

By using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV), we examined flow behaviour as well as turbulent properties of the <b>wake</b> <b>flow</b> over the critical Reynolds number. Figure 1 a) shows a snapshot of measured two-dimensional velocity field at Re= 5 x 105. In the figure, the result at Re= 6 x 104 (Fig. 1 b)) is also displayed for comparison. Wake width at Re= 5 x 105 is narrower than that at Re= 6 x 104. It was also revealed that turbulent intensities normalised by mean flow velocity in case of the flow at Re= 5 x 105 was about one-half to the flow at Re= 6 x 104. At Re= 5 x 105, vortex marching was limited in narrow region behind the wake and vortex size was small compared to that at Re= 6 x 104.

40|$|Shallow <b>wake</b> <b>flows</b> are flows behind {{obstacles}} {{where water}} depth {{is much smaller}} than the transverse scale of the flow. Limited water depth prevents three-dimensional instabilities and acts as a suppression factor thus limiting growth of perturbations. Hence the development of the shallow wakes is different from the wakes in deep water. Several authors have used the linear stability theory in order to understand when shallow flows become unstable. Two-dimensional depth-averaged Saint-Venant equations are usually used for the analysis under the following assumptions: 1) the independence of the velocity distribution on the vertical coordinate and 2) the independence of water depth h on the spatial coordinates x, y and time t (so-called ”rigid-lid ” assumption).

However, the simple nature of these CML models implies {{that there will be}} unmodeled wake features if a detailed, quantitative comparison is made with laboratory or simulated <b>wake</b> <b>flows.</b> Motivated by a desire to develop an improved CML model, we incorporate self-learning features into a new CML that is first trained to precisely estimate wake patterns from a target numerical simulation. A new convective-diffusive map that includes additional wake dynamics is developed. The new self-learning CML uses an adaptive estimation scheme (multivariable least-squares algorithm). Studies of this approach are conducted using wake patterns from a Navier-Stokes solution (spectral element-based NEKTAR simulation) of freely vibrating cable wakes at Reynolds numbers Re= 100. It is shown that the self-learning model accurately and efficiently estimates the simulated wake patterns.
