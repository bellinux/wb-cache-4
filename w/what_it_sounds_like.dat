500|$|Like many {{contemporary}} alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated {{to the band}} how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central {{to the pursuit of}} his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, [...] "Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> on Planet Pumpkin." [...] This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore (described as [...] "arcane night music" [...] in prerelease promotion) and the Machina albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).|$|E

2500|$|After {{they split}} from Nervous Records, Black Moon became {{entangled}} {{in a legal}} battle with the label over the licensing of their group name, which lasted {{for a number of}} years. The case was finally settled in 1998, with Duck Down receiving permission to license the name through Nervous. After a five-year hiatus, Black Moon returned in 1999 with their second album, War Zone. The album received moderate sales and good reviews, especially when compared to the Camp's three previous efforts. One factor in its positive reception was the return of Da Beatminerz, who produced the entirety of the album. The group recruited a number of fellow New York City emcees for appearances, including Busta Rhymes, Q-Tip and M.O.P. The album's singles [...] "Two Turntables and a Mic" [...] and [...] "This is <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>Like</b> (Worldwind)" [...] received minor commercial success.|$|E

5000|$|Although the cantata is lost, we {{have some}} idea of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like.</b> When Bach wrote for a one-off {{occasion}} such as a birthday, he sometimes recycled the music in another composition. In this case {{there appear to be}} several related works. The numbering of [...] in the standard catalogue of Bach's works, the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, reflects a presumed relationship to extant cantatas, which use variants of Picander's celebratory text.|$|R
50|$|Ekin Cheng (born 4 October 1967) is a Hong Kong {{actor and}} singer. Early in his career, {{he used the}} name Dior as a first name (because that was <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> when his younger sister tried to call him 二哥 in Cantonese). He has also been {{referred}} to as Noodle Cheng, (鄭伊麵) after a popular noodle product with a similar name and his wavy long hair. Currently Ekin is the name used.|$|R

6000|$|He {{lowered his}} head so that the sound would travel, and cried a long, long, [...] "Good hunting"--a midnight call in the afternoon, which was quite awful enough to begin with. Mowgli heard it rumble, and rise, and fall, and die off in a creepy sort of whine behind him, and laughed {{to himself as he}} ran through the Jungle. He could see the charcoal-burners huddled in a knot; old Buldeo's {{gun-barrel}} waving, like a banana-leaf, to every point of the compass at once. Then Gray Brother gave the Ya-la-hi! Yalaha! call for the buck-driving, when the Pack drives the nilghai, the big blue cow, before them, and it seemed to come from the very ends of the earth, nearer, and nearer, and nearer, till it ended in a shriek snapped off short. The other three answered, till even Mowgli could have vowed that the full Pack was in full cry, and then they all broke into the magnificent Morning-song in the Jungle, with every turn, and flourish, and grace-note that a deep-mouthed wolf of the Pack knows. This is a rough rendering of the song, but you must imagine <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> when it breaks the afternoon hush of the Jungle:-- ...|$|E
60|$|As {{will be seen}} later on, Pygmalion needs, not a preface, but a sequel, which I have {{supplied}} in its due place. The English have {{no respect}} for their language, and will not teach their children to speak it. They spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like.</b> It is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him. German and Spanish are accessible to foreigners: English is not accessible even to Englishmen. The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic enthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular play. There have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for many years past. When I {{became interested in the}} subject {{towards the end of the}} eighteen-seventies, Melville Bell was dead; but Alexander J. Ellis was still a living patriarch, with an impressive head always covered by a velvet skull cap, for which he would apologize to public meetings in a very courtly manner. He and Tito Pagliardini, another phonetic veteran, were men whom it was impossible to dislike. Henry Sweet, then a young man, lacked their sweetness of character: he was about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as Ibsen or Samuel Butler. His great ability as a phonetician (he was, I think, the best of them all at his job) would have entitled him to high official recognition, and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject, but for his Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in general who thought more of Greek than of phonetics. Once, in the days when the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph Chamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial importance of his subject. When it arrived, it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only. The article, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight. When I met him afterwards, for the first time for many years, I found to my astonishment that he, who had been a quite tolerably presentable young man, had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal appearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of Oxford and all its traditions. It must have been largely in his own despite that he was squeezed into something called a Readership of phonetics there. The future of phonetics rests probably with his pupils, who all swore by him; but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of compliance with the university, to which he nevertheless clung by divine right in an intensely Oxonian way. I daresay his papers, if he has left any, include some satires that may be published without too destructive results fifty years hence. He was, I believe, not in the least an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he would not suffer fools gladly.|$|E
2500|$|A 1720 {{instrument}} {{is located in}} the Metropolitan Museum in New York. This instrument has been extensively altered by later builders: the soundboard was replaced in 1938, and the 54-note range was shifted by about half an octave, from F', G', A'–c to C–f.

Not wanting {{the music to}} go to waste, he held on to it hoping to hear <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> with vocals. He reconnected with an old high school friend, Dmitra Smith (who was fronting the San Francisco-based band Static People), sending her some of the songs to see if she'd be able to record on top of them. Almost immediately, it became a real collaboration. Soon after, Dmitra's husband, Pascal Faivre, joined on guitar with Dave Place on bass.|$|R
