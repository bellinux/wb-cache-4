40|$|Numerical model – {{development}} and validation Time history analyses of validated wall models – midply and standard, with and w/o slip friction connectors Performance advantages of walls with slip friction connectors BACKGROUND A preliminary numerical investigation into whether {{the performance of}} standard and Midply wood shear walls can be improved by incorporating slotted-bolt, slip-friction hold-down connectors was carried out. Varoglu, Karacabeyli et al., 2006 Background continued Currently wood shear walls, under earthquake loading, dissipate energy by inelastic deformation of the framing to sheathing nail connections – however post-EQ residual damage is permanent – or at least difficult and expensive to repair. By replacing traditional hold-down connectors with slip-friction connectors {{it is hoped that}} inelastic behaviour can be confined to the connectors, with the overall wall system suffering negligible post-earthquake damage. Precast concrete <b>walls</b> with slip-friction <b>connectors</b> (see right) have been tested in North America and have been found to perform well.

40|$|This study {{discussed}} on {{the performances}} of concrete wall panels with grouted sleeve connector under shear and bending test. A substantial fraction of grouted sleeve connector behaviour has been investigated by several researchers from 90 's century. Majority of early researches were specific under direct tensile test on connector only. The results show a few failure modes on grout slippage, sleeve fractured and bar fractured and this is considered as Phase 1 {{in the development of}} grouted sleeve connector. In Phase 2, the satisfied and selected grouted sleeve connectors from prevised research in Phase 1 were used in precast concrete wall panel. This study was conducted to develop a sleeve connector, using no spiral and reinforced bars only. Then, the connector tested under shear and bending test to study the connection's performance between the bonding of grout and precast concrete wall and analysed the types of failure mode occurred. The performance of connections was evaluated based on the ultimate loading capacity, displacement, strain, stress and failure mode where the strain will record from the use of LVDT (Linear Variable Differential Transducers). The results show that the wall specimens using no spiral and reinforced bar <b>connectors,</b> <b>Wall</b> A (1 - connector) achieved satisfactory structural performance with the ultimate shear capacity 36...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Hybrid masonry {{construction}} has relatively recently been {{developed as a}} means to provide a more efficient use of masonry infill walls by designing these walls to function {{as a part of a}} structure's lateral force resisting system, with current applications in low seismic regions (Seismic Design Categories A, B, and C). In regions of higher seismicity (Seismic Design Categories D and greater), there exists a much greater need for a clearer understanding of the mechanics of the interaction between the steel frame of a building and the masonry shear wall as well as the development of specific detailing requirements to provide for a ductile and somewhat predictable response in a seismic event of significant magnitude. The scope of this thesis is the investigation of the connection between the steel beam and the top of the masonry wall for a Type I hybrid masonry system, using a proposed steel connector plate through-bolted to the masonry wall bond beam, in order to provide preliminary guidelines and recommendations for the development of energy dissipating hybrid masonry connector plates. The first portion of this study focused on the development of connector plate designs to determine which provided the most stable, ductile cyclic response. The second portion of this study investigated the strength and limit states of the through-bolted connection to the masonry wall bond beam under shear loading. Based on these experiments, recommendations are provided for the most suitable connector plate designs as well as a general evaluation of the connection to the masonry wall and potential limit states to consider in future design applications. For a "rigid" connection between the steel frame and CMU <b>wall,</b> link <b>connectors</b> with a thickness greater than 0. 5 inches is recommended, whereas fuse Type T was proven to be superior for a ductile, energy dissipating connector plate. ACI 530 - 08 design values for bolt shear yielding and masonry shear failure were determined to be the most appropriate limit states for determining an approximate design values for the thru-bolted CMU wall connections...|$|R
40|$|SectionBuilder is an {{innovative}} finite element based tool, developed for analysis {{and design of}} composite beam cross-sections. The tool can handle the cross-sections with parametric shapes and arbitrary configurations. It can also handle arbitrary lay-ups for predefined beam cross-section geometries in a consistent manner. The material properties for each layer of the cross-section can be defined {{on the basis of}} the design requirements. This tool is capable of dealing with multi-cell composite cross-sections with arbitrary lay-ups. It has also the benefit of handling the variation of thickness of skin and D-spars for beams such as rotor blades. A typical cross-section is considered as a collection of interconnected walls. Walls with arbitrary lay-ups based on predefined geometries and material properties are generated first. The complex composite beam cross-sections are developed by connecting the walls using various types of connectors. These connectors are compatible with the walls, i. e., the thickness of the layers of the walls must match with those of the connectors at the place of connection. Cross-sections are often reinforced by core material for constructing realistic rotor blade cross-sections. The tool has the ability to integrate core materials into the cross-sections. A mapped mesh is considered for meshing parametric shapes, <b>walls</b> and various <b>connectors,</b> whereas a free mesh is considered for meshing the core materials. A new algorithm based on the Delaunay refinement algorithm is developed for creating the best possible free mesh for core materials. After meshing the cross-section, the tool determines the sectional properties using finite element analysis. This tool computes sectional properties including stiffness matrix, compliance matrix, mass matrix, and principal axes. A visualization environment is integrated with the tool for visualizing the stress and strain distributions over the cross-section. Ph. D.
