5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E

25|$|The figures do {{not include}} the cost of {{operating}} military resources deployed to provide aid, and it is unclear how this should be quantified. While some <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> military resources are already paid for and that the relief effort can be regarded as a logistics training exercise, the increased operational costs are an unbudgeted expenditure. Others <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the military resources provide the only infrastructure that will deliver aid in a timely manner to save lives to the hardest hit and neediest areas, and without this quickly deployable infrastructure the other contributions, no matter how large would be useless or arrive too late.|$|E
25|$|An objectivist <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the {{religious}} {{experience is a}} proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how {{it was possible to}} tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.|$|E
25|$|Many historians {{consider}} these {{to be merely}} the immediate causes of the war. They <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the underlying cause was the growing resentment {{on the part of}} Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult {{to come to grips with}} each other.|$|E
5000|$|According to Ilya Prizel, [...] "Today few in Russia would assert Muscovy's role as {{the sole}} {{successor}} of Kievan Rus' but <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> instead <b>that</b> Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia are one people separated due to Tatar and Polish aggression and, thus, are equal heirs to the Kievan legacy.|$|R

50|$|The {{authorities}} {{indicated in}} 2007 that {{the ban on}} frequent flyer points <b>would</b> continue, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the ban on EuroBonus had reduced ticket prices by 30% and boosted competition. SAS Norge, the Norwegian affiliate of SAS, protested, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> {{the extent of the}} fare reduction was exaggerated (claiming 18.4% rather than 30%) and was due to more efficient spending, not the ban on EuroBonus.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the model}} is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three {{different}} types of English— ENL, ESL and EFL, are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes pidgins, creoles and L2 Englishes. Most scholars <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> English pidgins and creoles {{do not belong to}} one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.|$|E
25|$|Still more pacifists <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> a nonviolent {{reaction}} may {{not save}} lives immediately but would {{in the long}} run. The acceptance of violence for any reason {{makes it easier to}} use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.|$|E
25|$|Jones's and Nebel's {{claims were}} first made public in 1976 (in Donald Bain's The Control of Candy Jones, {{published}} by Playboy Press). Nebel apparently accepted his wife's claims, and openly discussed killing Dr. Jensen in revenge. However, Nebel was a prankster and a hoaxer of long standing {{and as he}} was not above hoaxing his radio audience, some of whom doubted the recovered memories of Candy Jones's past were genuine. Later skeptics <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> an alleged false memory syndrome was a more plausible explanation.|$|E
50|$|Some {{commentators}} {{point to}} potential media concentration conflicts due to Communicorp involvement in {{radio and the}} Irish Independent Newspaper as shareholder in receiving competition regulatory approval. However, Boxer {{did not intend to}} produce content, but rather run a platform, so <b>would</b> have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> such concern does not currently arise in its current business model.|$|R

25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that,</b> {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E
25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And I <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the clearest}} example to {{illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} difference between original intent and original understanding is to use the Twenty-seventh Amendment. The Twenty-seventh Amendment was proposed as part of the Bill of Rights in 1791, but failed to be ratified by the required number of states for two centuries, eventually being ratified in 1992. An original intent inquiry might ask what the framers understood the amendment to mean when it was written, though some <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it was the intent of the latter-day ratifiers that is important. An original-meaning inquiry would ask what the plain, public meaning of the text was in 1992 when it was eventually ratified.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{years after}} the fact, Ward Hill Lamon <b>would</b> {{publicly}} <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{there had been no}} plot to assassinate the president in 1861.

Tortures will not shake her when she knows I live. I must prepare.' And he started to his feet.|$|R
50|$|Example: If the {{negative}} team <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> the affirmative plan {{will result in}} nuclear proliferation, it <b>would</b> also <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the status quo will avoid nuclear proliferation. If the Affirmative claims that nuclear proliferation is already occurring, {{the negative}} team could <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> adoption of the plan {{would result in a}} unique increase in nuclear proliferation. If the plan causes no net change in the rate of nuclear proliferation, the disadvantage is not unique to the plan, and therefore not relevant.|$|R
25|$|The {{distinction}} between icastic and phantastic imitation, concepts borrowed from Plato, {{is also important}} in Mazzoni’s work. Icastic imitation refers to the recreation of something based in reality – a simulation of a real person or {{the creation of a}} character based on a real person is icastic imitation. Phantastic imitation is the imitation of something completely the artist’s imagination. This distinction would {{play an important role in}} Mazzoni’s On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante, in which he <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the work, being allegorical and based in a divine vision, was icastic mimesis because it imitates something “real.” This was meant to counter arguments by writers such as Castravilla who dismissed Dante’s work as lacking in verisimilitude and even claimed that the comedy was not poetry at all, as it was simply the recounting of a vision. Under Mazzoni’s definitions, these were not valid criticisms, as poetry was essentially mimesis made “persuasive” by the use of craft or art.|$|E
25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{who initially}} read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of Johannes de Silentio) Fear and Trembling, often {{come to the}} conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a divine command law of ethics. The divine command theory is a metaethical theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by God; instead, he <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> a divine command from God transcends ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up to us as individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must be prepared for the event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the teleological suspension of the ethical. Abraham, the knight of faith, chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of Father of Faith. Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith.|$|E
500|$|After {{one last}} {{interview}} with Feletti—who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath—Carboni {{informed him that}} so {{far as he could}} see, there was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: [...] "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, but I hope that the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion... As for my punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord's hands, but I <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action." [...] The next day Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the [...] "violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family".|$|E
40|$|John {{organized}} a state lottery {{and his wife}} won the main prize. You may feel that the event of her winning wasn’t particularly random, but how <b>would</b> you <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> in a fair court of law? Traditional probability theory does not even have the notion of random events. Algorithmic information theory does, {{but it is not}} applicable to real-world scenarios like the lotter...|$|R
50|$|The general {{applicability}} of the approach has led to some criticisms that it is functionalist, non-emancipatory or supports {{the status quo and}} existing power structures; this is a claim <b>that</b> users <b>would</b> deny, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> the methodology itself can be none of these, it is the user of the methodology that may choose to employ it in such a way.|$|R

500|$|Cecil {{has said}} that the game's fanbase {{believes}} Dan Brown to have been influenced by Broken Sword when writing his novel, The Da Vinci Code, because of the parallels between the two works. Cecil stated that he is flattered by this sentiment, but that he would never claim so himself due to the threat of Brown's [...] "very serious" [...] lawyers. Joao Diniz Sanches of Pocket Gamer said Broken Sword story is a [...] "tale, some <b>would</b> <b>argue,</b> <b>that</b> effortlessly outclasses Dan Brown's similarly themed and tricksy novel." [...] In an article about Broken Sword, Computer and Video Games described the Knights Templar legend as a [...] "great mythology to base a game on", and noted that Broken Sword [...] "came out years before the Da Vinci Code made that sort of thing popular." ...|$|E
500|$|Bridget's {{pregnancy}} {{was nominated for}} [...] "Best Storyline" [...] at the 2009 Inside Soap Awards and fans of the show also voted the storyline {{the most popular of}} 2008 in a poll conducted by the official Neighbours website. The website announced that they had received over 5,500 votes and they added [...] "We all love a bit of drama, and who <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Bridget falling pregnant at the age of 16 and Declan's rebellion against the constraints of fatherhood wasn't the juiciest story of 2008!" [...] Sarah Megginson of website SheKnows included Bridget's death in her [...] "8 Most Memorable Neighbours Moments" [...] feature in October 2009.

500|$|Although {{developers}} billed {{a realistic}} atmosphere, reviewers criticized {{that aspect of}} the game. [...] "I understand the emphasis for this game is on the gameplay. However, a little more effort {{could have been made}} with the visuals and particularly in the audio department. Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but the essence of a football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it’s completely lacking," [...] said Acevedo in his review. The game was also criticized for its lack of play-by-play and poor audio. [...] "There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although some <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from “Boom” by P.O.D. being played during kickoffs (it gets old pretty fast), and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought," [...] added Doug Aamoth of Techland. After the patch, the song only comes up for the first kick-off and the kick-off of the second half.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Shalom Dov Wolpo {{brought up}} the issue in 1984 by {{publishing}} a booklet declaring Schneerson to be the Messiah. Schneerson responded by banning the publication and forbidding Wolpo from involvement with any Messiah related topics. Wolpo <b>would</b> later <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> despite the Rebbe's strong opposition, [...] "everyone must still consider and proclaim the Rebbe as the Messiah" [...] <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> [...] "acceptance of the Messiah must {{be done by the}} people not by the King".|$|R
50|$|Though Cartwright {{has been}} listed among the 17th century dramatists {{known as the}} Sons of Ben, as they were to have been {{influenced}} by Ben Jonson, Cartwright's play The Ordinary {{has been described as a}} second-rate Jonsonian comedy, nothing more than a pale copy of an original. Some <b>would</b> perhaps <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> bad replication does not qualilify Cartwright as a true Son of Ben.|$|R
