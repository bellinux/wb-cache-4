5|$|Tinker {{made up to}} $250,000 in {{his real}} estate business. However, his {{fortunes}} began to change in 1926, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market receded and the 1926 Miami hurricane damaged significant areas of South Florida. During the Great Depression, {{he was forced to}} liquidate most of his real estate holdings. Tinker owned a billiard parlor during the Depression. He opened one of Orlando's first bars after the end of Prohibition. He also returned to baseball. Tinker scouted the Philadelphia Athletics' hitters for the Cubs prior to the 1929 World Series.|$|E

They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs. Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest and improving Germany's international reputation. After the federal election of 1932, the Nazis were the largest party in the Reichstag, holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.|$|E

40|$|When {{weak and}} strong fish stocks {{are caught in}} the same fishery, {{managing}} for the protection of <b>the</b> weak <b>stock</b> may result in foregone economic benefits from harvest of <b>the</b> strong <b>stock,</b> while managing for <b>the</b> strong <b>stock</b> may result in overfishing of <b>the</b> weak <b>stock.</b> A particular complication arises <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> are not easily distinguished in the catch, for example <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> are of <b>the</b> same or a similar species. This paper demonstrates how the partially observable Markov decision process can be used to explore policy options for managing mixed-stock fisheries <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> are imperfectly identified...|$|R

25|$|Since {{many banks}} had also {{invested}} their clients' savings {{in the stock}} market, these banks were forced to close <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market crashed. After {{the stock market crash}} and the bank closures, people were too afraid to lose more money. Because of the fears of further economic challenge, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing and consuming. Thousands of individual investors who believed they could get rich by investing on margin lost everything they had. The stock market crash severely impacted American economy.|$|E

His first great success was as Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest (1936), and {{this led to a}} period of typecasting as a gangster with films such as Angels with Dirty Faces (1938).|$|E
25|$|On-site auctions – Sometimes <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> or {{assets of}} a company are simply too vast or too bulky for an auction house to {{transport}} to their own premises and store, they will hold an auction {{within the confines of}} the bankrupt company itself. Bidders could find themselves bidding for items which are still plugged in, and the great advantage of these auctions taking place on the premises is that they have the opportunity to view the goods as they were being used, and may be able to try them out. Bidders can also avoid the possibility of goods being damaged whilst they are being removed as they can do it or at least supervise the activity.|$|E
25|$|Roach had {{initially}} welcomed the Pacific Mail contracts, anticipating {{that they would}} help establish a sound financial foundation for his new company. Unfortunately, {{in the spring of}} 1873, eight months into construction of the new ships, Pacific Mail reported an inability to meet its payments. Pacific Mail's President, Alden B. Stockwell, had attempted to manipulate his firm's stock price with company funds, depleting cash reserves and borrowing money to meet the company's obligations. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> scheme fell through, Pacific Mail's cash reserves had effectively been substituted with debt. Stockwell and another company director, Richard B. Irwin, then pocketed a loan from Roach and misappropriated about $750,000 in company funds before fleeing the country.|$|E

The new plank road company gave out it shares to their holders on March 8 of that year. However, nothing was constructed, and the company was in the New York State Supreme Court in 1861 suing over the ownership of stock in construction of the new roadway. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> was sold, the agreement stated that the plank road would have the room to extend itself to Clinton Corners. One stockholder, known only as Griffin, wanted the route done on a certain alignment when constructed, but protested that it was contrived differently. The company asked for the shares back from Griffin, who would not give them back.|$|E

The Panic of 1857 completely blindsided the investor, {{who at the}} time was [...] "long", possessing huge amounts of stock, much bought on the [...] "margin" [...] (on loan). Thus <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> prices fell Little was forced into bankruptcy by margin calls, lenders demanding recompense for the fall {{in the value of the}} stocks. This time there was no bouncing back. Little had lost all but everything he held, and did not have the confidence of others on Wall Street needed to obtain their backing.

500|$|The {{growth of}} the venture capital {{industry}} was fueled {{by the emergence of}} the independent investment firms on Sand Hill Road, beginning with Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital in 1972. [...] Located in Menlo Park, CA, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the burgeoning technology industries in the area. [...] By the early 1970s, there were many semiconductor companies based in the Santa Clara Valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies. [...] Throughout the 1970s, a group of private equity firms, focused primarily on venture capital investments, would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms. [...] In 1973, with the number of new venture capital firms increasing, leading venture capitalists formed the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). [...] The NVCA was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry. [...] Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund.

The video shoot had attracted several hundred people, according to a representative for the city's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information. New York City's film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street. Moore had permission to use the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial but did not have a permit to shoot on the sidewalk or the street, nor did he have a loud-noise permit or the proper parking permits. [...] "Michael basically gave us one directorial instruction, [...] "No matter what happens, don't stop playing", Tom Morello recalls.
