2500|$|The Irgun {{issued an}} initial {{statement}} accepting {{responsibility for the}} attack, mourning their Jewish victims, and calling into fault the British for {{what they saw as}} a failure to respond to the warnings. A year later, on July 22, 1947, they issued a new statement saying that they were acting on instructions from [...] "a letter from the headquarters of the United Resistance, demanding that <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> an attack on the center of government at the King David Hotel as soon as possible." [...] The Irgun's radio network announced that it would mourn for the Jewish victims, but not the British ones. This was explained by claiming that Britain had not mourned for the millions of Jews who died in the Nazi Holocaust. [...] No remorse was expressed for the largest group of victims, the Arab dead.|$|E
60|$|But the illegitimacy, or at {{any rate}} the great doubtfulness, of many current {{geological}} inferences, is best seen when we contemplate terrestrial changes now going on; and ask how far such inferences are countenanced by them. If <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> rigorously the modern method of interpreting geological phenomena, which Sir Charles Lyell has done so much to establish--that of referring them to causes like those at present in action--we cannot fail to see how improbable are sundry of the received conclusions.|$|E
60|$|However, we {{obtain a}} new result of {{fundamental}} importance when <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> the analogous consideration for {{a ray of}} light. With respect to the Galileian reference-body K, such a ray of light is transmitted rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can easily be shown that {{the path of the}} same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body K1). From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two respects this result is of great importance.|$|E

60|$|If <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> this {{doctrine}} of strict construction to its legitimate results, we shall {{find that it}} involves a logical absurdity. What {{is the number of}} men whose outraged sensibilities may claim the suppression of a tract? Is the taboo of a thousand valid? Of a hundred? Of ten? Or are tracts to be distributed only to those who will find their doctrine agreeable, and are the Society's colporteurs to be instructed that a Temperance essay is the proper thing for a total-abstinent infidel, and a sermon on the Atonement for a distilling deacon? If the aim of the Society be only to convert men from sins they have no mind to, and to convince them of errors to which they have no temptation, they might as well be spending their money to persuade schoolmasters that two and two make four, or geometricians that there cannot be two obtuse angles in a triangle. If this be their notion {{of the way in which}} the gospel is to be preached, we do not wonder that they have found it necessary to print a tract upon the impropriety of sleeping in church.|$|E

Upon hearing of our coming there, I should advise you and your fellow adventurers to journey straight to London, to gain audience {{with one of the}} ministers, and tell him you have a matter of great importance to communicate to the king himself; and that you should then lay before his majesty an account of what you have done, and pray him to pardon your boldness, which was due to your desire for the honor of the country as much as to wish for profit, and beg him to accept such share of the gold as you may think fit. I shall, of course, when I write let you know about what weight of the metal I have on board. In that way, when the ship comes into port all will be smooth sailing for you; whereas if I come unannounced, there is no saying what share of your profits his majesty may think fit to take." ...|$|E

"I have spoken," [...] the risaldar said, [...] "to {{the three}} {{officers}} of the company to which the soldier Mutteh Ghar belonged; and they all agreed, willingly, to help you to carry out your scheme, and {{think that there is}} very little probability {{of the fact that you}} are a new recruit being noticed. The general discipline of the regiment is in our hands. The British officers direct, but <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> their orders. As the man was only on parade twice and, on neither of these occasions, came under general inspection of the white officers, it is probable that they do not know his face. It is certainly best that you should take Mutteh Ghar's name, as the soldiers will see nothing strange in our placing a young recruit in the ranks, after his cousin had died in the regiment. We are all of opinion, therefore, that you can take your place without difficulty; and that the chance of the change being detected by the British officers is extremely slight. We think, however, that it will be next to impossible for you always to keep up your character, and believe that you will find it so hard to live under the same conditions as the others that you yourself will tire of it." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{the uninitiated}} may wonder {{how it is}} {{possible}} to deal with a number which cannot be counted. It is impossible to count up all the numbers, one by one, because, however many we may count, there are always more to follow. The fact is that counting is a very vulgar and elementary way of finding out how many terms there are in a collection. And in any case, counting gives us what mathematicians call the ordinal number of our terms; that is to say, it arranges our terms in an order or series, and its result tells us what type of series results from this arrangement. In other words, it is impossible to count things without counting some first and others afterwards, so that counting always has to do with order. Now when there are only a finite number of terms, we can count them in any order we like; but when there are an infinite number, what corresponds to counting will give us quite different results according {{to the way in which}} <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> the operation. Thus the ordinal number, which results from what, in a general sense may be called counting, depends not only upon how many terms we have, but also (where the number of terms is infinite) upon the way in which the terms are arranged.|$|E
