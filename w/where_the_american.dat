5|$|Alligator left Matanzas on 18 November escorting her prizes {{back to the}} United States. The {{following}} day, she ran hard aground on a {{coral reef}} in the Florida Keys, which has since been named Alligator Reef. Her crew failed to refloat the vessel, but managed to salvage her guns, papers, and other valuables. Fearing {{that she would be}} salvaged by pirates, they burnt her and she sank. Though it was previously thought that the location of the wreck was known, a 1996 expedition proved this false, and the precise location of Alligator final resting place remains unknown. Allen was regarded by the Navy as a hero for his efforts against the pirates, and his name was used as a rallying cry the following year when USS Galliniper and USS Mosquito engaged and defeated a band of pirates led by Diabolito near the same area <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> lieutenant had been slain.|$|E

The following February, he was given command of the Second Cruiser Squadron, with HMS Drake as his flagship. During a successful two years the squadron visited Greece, Portugal, Canada, and the United States, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> press commented favourably on Prince Louis's courtesy, unassuming manner and democratic nature. After two years {{at the head of}} the Second Cruiser Squadron, and further visits to Spain (where his niece Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg was Queen), he was appointed second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet as acting vice-admiral with HMS Venerable as his flagship.|$|E
5|$|The French and American armies {{marched through}} Philadelphia from September 2 to the 4th, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{soldiers}} announced {{they would not}} leave Maryland until they received one month's pay in coin, {{rather than in the}} worthless Continental paper currency. General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time the men would be paid. It significantly strengthened French and American relations On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse's fleet off the Virginia Capes. De Grasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette, and then sent his empty transports to pick up the American troops. Washington made a visit to his home, Mount Vernon, on his way to Yorktown.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E
5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E

25|$|His {{first such}} work, 1975's Discreet Music (again created via an {{elaborate}} tape-delay methodology, which Eno diagrammed {{on the back}} cover of the LP), is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his Ambient series (Music for Airports (Ambient 1), The Plateaux of Mirror (Ambient 2), Day of Radiance (Ambient 3) and On Land (Ambient 4)).

25|$|Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry {{had earlier}} been {{appointed}} to command on Lake Erie, through lobbying by Jeremiah B. Howell, the Senior Senator from Rhode Island, supplanting Lieutenant Elliot. He arrived at Presque Isle to take command {{at the end of}} March. Having arranged for the defense of Presque Isle, he proceeded to Lake Ontario to obtain reinforcements of seamen from Commodore Isaac Chauncey. After commanding the American schooners and gunboats at the Battle of Fort George, he then went to Black Rock <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> vessels had been released when the British abandoned Fort Erie at the end of May. Perry had them towed by draft oxen up the Niagara, an operation which took six days, and sailed with them along the shore to Presque Isle.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{legality}} issues, {{dogs are}} still commonly used for fighting purposes {{all across the}} continent. The American Pit Bull Terrier {{is the most popular}} breed used for fighting, but foreign breeds, such as the Dogo Argentino (used widely in South America), and to a lesser extent, the Presa Canario are also gaining popularity. The Dogo Argentino is now often seen in dog fight circuits in areas of the United States <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) has been banned. In Miami-Dade County, Florida, where the APBT, American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier (or any other dog that substantially conforms to any of these breeds' characteristics) is banned, the Dogo Argentino has become the main fighting dog of choice, being used at both organized and street level dogfighting.|$|E

50|$|Zero Hour (Stunde Null) is a 1977 West German drama film {{directed}} by Edgar Reitz, starring Kai Taschner and Anette Jünger. The narrative {{is set in}} the summer of 1945 in a small village outside Leipzig, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> have just pulled back and been replaced by Soviet troops. The film follows the inhabitants as they adjust to the new situation, in particular Joschi, a teenage Hitler Youth member who is fascinated by <b>the</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} the statue has always {{protected}} the village and its inhabitants. During the Battle of the Bulge in the Second World War, the Germans were in the nearby forest and were shooting at the village of Hampteau, 1.5 km from Werpin, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> were based. Everyone survived the attack because they hid themselves behind the Virgin of Werpin.|$|R
25|$|Israel {{also took}} {{a series of steps}} to evade the embargo and clandestinely trade with the Arab world. Front {{companies}} in third countries were set up, which imported goods, then re-exported them to Arab countries with false labels and certificates of origin. In other cases, foreign companies would purchase Israeli technology and materials, use them to assemble completed products, and export them to Arab countries while concealing this fact from their customers. Arrangements with American companies were worked out <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> companies would buy goods from Israeli affiliates and export them as American-made goods. Israeli ships were re-flagged as ships of other nations and provided with faked bills of landing so they could directly export goods to the Arab and Muslim world. Greece and Cyprus were particularly popular hubs for smuggling Israeli goods into the Arab world due to their location, multilateral economic connections, large merchant fleets, and Cyprus' corporate and bank secrecy laws.|$|E
25|$|The Surprise sails to the {{farthest}} east point of Brazil, where the bowsprit is burnt by lightning. During the repairs in Penedo, Pullings sees the USS Norfolk pass by. Mrs Horner, the gunner's wife, engages in {{an affair with}} Hollom, and becomes pregnant. Maturin will {{not interfere with the}} pregnancy, so she turns to his assistant, Higgins, who leaves her near death. Maturin saves her life. In the Atlantic, Surprise retakes the packet Danaë, with Lieutenant Lawrence in command. Tom Pullings sails the Danae back to England, after Maturin and Aubrey take possession of a hidden brass box, per instructions to Maturin. Surprise rounds Cape Horn with some losses, and then reaches the Juan Fernández Islands to refit and recover. There, the gunner kills his wife and Hollom, and re-boards the ship. Off Chile, Horner learns that Higgins performed an abortion on his wife; Higgins disappears from the ship and Horner hangs himself in his cabin. In the Pacific, with information from a Spanish merchantman, Surprise retakes the valuable whaler Acapulco with Caleb Gill in command, nephew to the Norfolks captain. Mr Allen negotiates with the agent for the whaler in Valparaiso, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> prisoners are left ashore. Taking the whaler restores the spirit to the crew.|$|E
25|$|In the end, five American battleships were sunk, {{three were}} damaged, and eleven other cruisers, destroyers, and {{auxiliaries}} were sunk or seriously damaged. The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft, while 74 were damaged by anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} ground. The damaged aircraft were disproportionately dive and torpedo bombers, seriously impacting available firepower to exploit the first two waves' success, so {{the commander of the}} First Air Fleet, Naval Lieutenant-General Chuichi Nagumo, withdrew. Yamamoto later lamented Nagumo's failure to seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the US carriers, absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on Oahu. Nagumo had absolutely no idea <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> carriers might be, and remaining on station while his forces cast about looking for them ran the risk of his own forces being found first and attacked while his aircraft were absent searching. In any case, insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves for the carriers to launch and recover a third before dark, and Nagumo's escorting destroyers lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. Much has been made of Yamamoto's hindsight, but, in keeping with Japanese military tradition not to criticize the commander on the spot, he did not punish Nagumo for his withdrawal.|$|E

500|$|Coming from a {{relatively}} Catholic district, Neal {{has a more}} conservative record {{on the issue of}} abortion than other Massachusetts representatives. He said in 2010, [...] "I have always opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. I'd keep Roe v. Wade and restrict it, I've always thought: keep abortion, with restrictions for late-term abortion. [...] the voting pattern I have, both sides would say I'm mixed and guess what? That's <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people are." [...] He voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which made the intact dilation and extraction abortion procedure illegal in most cases. During debate on the House health care reform bill, he voted in favor of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment, restricting government funding of abortion. On other social issues Neal has a moderate record: he supports a proposed Constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, and has twice voted against an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.|$|E
500|$|Arnold also {{realized}} such a flanking maneuver was likely, and petitioned Gates {{for permission to}} move his forces from the heights to meet potential movements, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> skill at woodlands combat would be at an advantage. Gates, whose preferred strategy was to sit {{and wait for the}} expected frontal assault, grudgingly permitted a reconnaissance in force consisting of Daniel Morgan's men and Henry Dearborn's light infantry. [...] When Morgan's men reached an open field northwest of Bemis Heights belonging to Loyalist John Freeman, they spotted British advance troops in the field. [...] Fraser's column was slightly delayed and had not yet reached the field, while Hamilton's column had also made its way across a ravine and was approaching the field from the east through dense forest and difficult terrain. Riedesel's force, while it was on the road, was delayed by obstacles thrown down by the Americans. The sound of gunfire to the west prompted Riedesel to send some of his artillery down a track in that direction. The troops Morgan's men saw were an advance company from Hamilton's column.|$|E
