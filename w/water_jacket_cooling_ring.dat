40|$|Abstract. The two cooling {{styles of}} {{spraying}} <b>cooling</b> and <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> were studied for exhaust gas of engine within water-collecting box (WCB). Based on Eulerian-Lagrangian method, {{the heat and}} mass transfer between exhaust gas and water droplets were solved. By comparing the general characteristic index PK ∆ / of six models with different tubes, the model with bended tubes {{is defined as the}} best model in which the length of outer tube is less than inner one. With the increase of water spraying flux, the gas temperature and the evaporation rate of water droplets tend to decrease. The decrease of gas temperature can be restrained by the phenomenon of “water assembled”, after the spraying flux rise to a certain value with continued increase. Compared with the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling,</b> the spraying cooling has a high heat transfer coefficient and a low cooling water cost, as well as reduces the resistance lost of exhaust gas...|$|R

40|$|Background Obesity and its {{metabolic}} {{consequences are}} {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) utilises glucose and free fatty acids to produce heat, thereby increasing energy expenditure. Effective evaluation of human BAT stimulators is constrained by current standard BAT assessment methods as positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) requires exposure to high doses of ionising radiation. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a potential non-invasive, safe alternative, although direct corroboration with PET-CT has not previously been established. Methods IRT and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (¹⁸F-FDG) PET-CT data from 8 healthy male participants subjected to <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> were directly compared. Thermal images (TIs) were geometrically transformed to overlay PET-CT-derived maximum intensity projection (MIP) images from each subject and the areas of greatest intensity of temperature and glucose-uptake within the supraclavicular regions compared. Relationships between supraclavicular temperatures from IRT (TSCR) and the maximum rate of glucose uptake (MR(gluc)) from PET-CT were determined. Results Glucose uptake on MR(gluc) MIP was positively correlated with change in TSCR relative to a reference region (r² = 0. 721; p= 0. 008).

40|$|The {{torque density}} of {{electric}} motors strongly {{depends on the}} performance of the cooling system. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, cooling inherently occurs through self-ventilation by both rotor discs. Nevertheless, an independent cooling system remains necessary for most applications. In the axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine, the individual stator cores with concentrated windings are potted in the stator housing using an epoxy resin. These epoxy resins are relatively bad thermally conductive, and therefore, limit the heat transfer {{to the surface of the}} machine. Therefore, radially inward heat extraction fins are introduced in this paper. These fins provide an excellent thermal conduction path from the windings to the stator surface, where they can be abducted by conventional cooling techniques such as forced air or <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling.</b> The focus of this paper is on the study of the radially inward heat extraction fins using thermal finite element modelling as well as experimental validation on a 4 kW axial flux yokeless and segmented armature machine stator.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{analyzing}} a novel direct coil cooling approach for electric traction motor. Its thermal performance is compared with conventional <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> concept by using analytical and experimental methods. Results show, the direct coil cooling approach has significant advantage regarding thermal performance, {{which allows the}} electric traction motor more suitable for high load applications. This study is performed on an ODIN switched reluctance prototype machine. For a convincing comparison result, the ODIN prototype is equipped with dedicated cooling circuits for each cooling approach. Based on the design parameters of the prototype, a lumped parameter thermal network (LPTN) model is established for analytical studies. For an accurate representation of heat transfer in the direct coil cooled motor through fluid flow, the key convective boundary is modeled {{based on the results}} of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Studies with the developed LPTN model and experiments for validation are conducted. The results of the model analysis and the experiments both indicate that, through cooling coils directly in the stator slots with oil flows, direct coil cooled motor can effectively dissipate heat in the thermal critical winding areas. Current density in the ODIN prototype can be significantly increased. Thermal resistance from hotspots to coolant can be reduced by up to 80...|$|R
40|$|AbstractITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is {{currently}} in design phase of the nuclear fusion research project, which is the world's largest experimental tokamak reactor. Process of plasma generation in the Vacuum Vessel requires an ultra-high quality of vacuum. To meet those requirements the Vacuum Vessel and adjacent diagnostic systems are exposed to elevated temperature after its assembly to outgas all volatile surface contaminants. The baking temperature peaks at 240 °C for up to 24 hours. On the other side most of diagnostic instruments and detectors adjacent to the Vacuum Vessel, which {{are exposed to the}} same conditions, require much lower temperature during measurement and slightly higher temperature in a stand-by mode. The strictest conditions are defined for liquid scintillators, which require the working temperature around 20 °C and the temperature of destruction several degrees higher. In order to keep diagnostic instruments within required temperature range, a heat shield with a heat removal is necessary. The temperature range is often ± 2 °C or even more narrow in time and space allotted for detectors. Due to space limitations only a thin multilayer solution, including vacuum layers, can be considered. Preliminary calculations indicate that to meet the above defined requirements, only a <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> as the heat shield can be efficient enough to keep detectors at the required temperature level and within defined range. An additional multilayer vacuum insulation can significantly decrease the cooling demand for the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> <b>cooling</b> system. The aim of proposed paper is to find an optimal structure of the insulation thermal shield, based on the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> solution by using the CFD simulation in ANSYS Fluent software. Moreover an extended Parametric Analysis is carried out and discussed. The Surface-to-Surface (S 2 S) model is applied to simulate heat transfer by radiation.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this Master Thesis project {{is the development of}} a new methodology to perform Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) conjugate heat transfer simulations for internal combustion engines, at the Fluid and Combustion Simulations Department (NMGD) at Scania CV AB, Södertalje, Sweden. This new method allows to overcome the drawbacks identified in the former methodology, providing the ability to use the more advanced polyhedral mesh type to generate good quality grids in complex geometries like <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jackets,</b> and integrating all the different components of the engine cylinder in one unique multi-material mesh. In the method developed, these advantages can be used while optimizing the process to perform the simulations, and obtaining improved accuracy in the temperature field of engine components surrounding the <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> when compared to the experimental data from Scania CV AB tests rigs. The present work exposes the limitations encountered within the former methodology and presents a theoretical background to explain the physics involved, describing the computational tools and procedures to solve these complex fluid and thermal problems in a practical and cost-effective way, by the use of CFD. A mesh sensitivity analysis performed during this study reveals that a mesh with low y+ values, close to 1 in the <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket,</b> is needed to obtain an accurate temperature distribution along the cylinder head, as well as to accurately identify boiling regions in the coolant domain. Another advantage of the proposed methodology is that it provides new capabilities like the implementation of thermal contact resistance in periodical contact regions of the engine components, improving the accuracy of the results in terms of temperature profiles of parts like valves, seats and guides. The results from this project are satisfactory, providing a reliable new methodology for multi-material thermal simulations, improving the efficiency of the work to be performed in the NMGD department, with a better use of the available engineering and computational resources, simplifying all the stages of multi-material projects, from the geometry preparation and meshing, to the post-processing tasks...|$|R

40|$|In {{a search}} for {{sympathetic}} premotor neurons subserving thermoregulatory functions, medullary raphé-spinal neurons were studied in urethane-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated, paralysed rats. Extracellular unit recordings were made from a region previously shown to drive the sympathetic supplies to tail vessels and brown adipose tissue. Neurons that were antidromically activated by stimulation across the intermediate region of the upper lumbar cord (the origin of the tail sympathetic outflow) were selected for study. Non-noxious cooling stimuli were delivered to the animal's shaved trunk by circulating cold instead of warm water through a <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> <b>Cooling</b> increased the activity of 21 out of 76 raphé-spinal neurons by 1. 0 ± 0. 2 spikes s− 1 °C− 1 for falls in skin temperature of 3 - 5 °C below a threshold of 35. 0 ± 0. 6 °C. Their responses followed skin temperature in a graded manner, and did so {{whether or not there}} was any change in core (rectal) temperature. Indirect observations suggested that seven of the neurons that were activated by skin cooling were also activated by falls in core temperature (by 2. 1 ± 0. 7 spikes s− 1 °C− 1 below a threshold of 36. 1 ± 0. 7 °C), while the remainder were unaffected by core cooling. An additional 7 / 76 raphé-spinal neurons showed evidence of inhibition (activity reduced by 2. 1 ± 0. 5 spikes s− 1 °C− 1) when the trunk skin was cooled. Cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons were found in the nuclei raphé magnus and pallidus, centred at the level of the caudal part of the facial nucleus. Their spinal axons conducted at velocities between 3. 4 and 29 m s− 1 (median 6. 8). Drug-induced rises in arterial pressure partially inhibited the discharge of 6 / 14 cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons. Weak-to-moderate cardiac modulation (10 – 70 %) was present in arterial pulse-triggered histograms of the activity of 11 / 21 cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons, and 6 / 6 showed evidence of ventilatory modulation (two strongly, four weakly) in pump-triggered histograms. Raphé-spinal neurons responded to cooling in the absence of any change in the electroencephalogram pattern (6 / 6 neurons). Most cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons responded to noxious tail pinch (13 / 21 inhibited, 6 / 21 excited), as did most thermally unresponsive raphé-spinal cells in the same region (19 / 41 excited, 9 / 41 inhibited). It is suggested that these cold-activated raphé-spinal neurons may constitute a premotor pathway that drives sympathetically mediated cold defences, such as cutaneous vasoconstriction or thermogenesis. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that a brainstem reflex, with additional descending input signalling body core temperature, may mediate autonomic responses to environmental cooling...|$|R

5000|$|Released in December 2010, the Traxxas Spartan {{is a new}} {{single drive}} Radio-controlled boat. The Spartan {{represents}} Traxxas' first all-new boat design in several years. Like the Villain series, it is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek [...] "deep V" [...] style hull. Unlike the Villain series, the Spartan is significantly longer (by 9.8 inches) and has a slightly wider beam (by 1.25 inches), which combine to give the Spartan a much sleeker overall profile. The Spartan also has an abundance of modern features which set it apart from earlier Traxxas boats. The most noticeable is Traxxas' new marine version of its Castle Powered Velineon brushless system, consisting of the new VXL-6s brushless ESC, and Velineon 540XL (1410 castle motor)brushless motor. Both the ESC and the motor are water-cooled, with the motor featuring a unique sealed composite <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> that allows <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> to directly contact the motor case, rather than the simple coiled metal tubing <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> used on other Traxxas boats. The drive system is also {{a departure from the}} steerable outdrive system (the prop and rudder are one unit and are steered together) traditionally used on Traxxas boats. Instead, power on the Spartan is routed via direct drive (no reduction gears) to a single fixed surface piercing prop and steering is controlled by an aluminum rudder operated by a high torque waterproof servo. The Spartan is also uses Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system (a first on Traxxas boats) with a 5-channel receiver located inside a watertight box. Other notable features include stainless steel trim tabs and turn fins (which help improve stability and turning performance), Traxxas high current battery connectors, 12 gauge power wire, and stainless steel hex hardware. The claimed top speed is 30 mi/h kn with the included dual 8.4 volt NiMH batteries. However, the top speed rises to 50 mi/h kn with optional double 3S LiPo battery packs, which Traxxas claims as the fastest top speed for any RTR (ready to race) radio controlled boat.|$|R

40|$|The use of plate glass-water thermal {{barriers}} in controlled environment facilities effectively reduces the thermal load within the plant growth chamber. This allows high PPFs {{to be provided}} for plant growth and development studies, adequate simulation of daily light integrals, and simulation of peak PPF's. Further, substantial amounts of incandescent lamp supplementation can be used to achieve simulation of daylight R:FR ratios which are needed to ensure adequate stem development in some species. While the focus in this paper is on the use of entire thermal barriers which separate the lighting enclosure from the plant growth chamber, the same principles apply to the use of <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> for <b>cooling</b> individual lamps (such as can occur with xenon-arc lamps). In this instance, the barrier separating the lamps from the plant chamber can be much simpler (e. g., plexiglass) as the main function of the barrier is to separate the air ventilation of the lamp enclosure from the air system within the plant growth chamber. The main advantage of water as a thermal barrier is the negligible absorption of radiation in the photosynthetically-active and near infrared wavebands. Consequently, plate glass-water barriers typically allow transmission of approximately 90 % of radiation in these regions. While ventilated double and triple glazing systems appear to be attractive alternative to water barriers from an operating standpoint, their significant absorption in the biologically-important wavebands (7 - 12 %) with each glass layer and longer-wave cut-offs (typically 2500 - 4000 nm) makes them a much less attractive alternative. The data presented here demonstrate clearly that measurement of PPF alone is not an adequate representation of the radiation environment being used in a controlled environment study. The amounts and proportions of long-wave and short-wave radiation in a plant growth chamber are dependent on lamp type, lamp combination, presence of a thermal barrier, the type of thermal barrier between the lamps and the plant growing area and the overall construction and design of the chamber. It is important, therefore, in reporting results of controlled environment studies, to adequately describe both the details of the lighting system used and the characteristics of the radiation produced by that system, so results of different studies can be adequately evaluated and compared...|$|R
