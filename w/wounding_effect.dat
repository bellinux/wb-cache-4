5000|$|It {{was also}} widely {{employed}} as a hunting sword in the late 15th century, usually for hunting wild boar, bear and stag, typically from horseback. Although hunting with a sword is less ideal than using a lance or spear, the added element of danger added to {{the thrill of the}} hunt, since using a sword brought the hunter in closer proximity to dangerous animals, as well as bringing more perceived glory onto the hunter. The estoc was useful for this purpose, being a long sword with a strong blade, able to take the shock of meeting with an animal without breaking, while also giving the necessary reach to attack from horseback. However, it also had a very thin, sharp point, designed for penetrating chain mail. This thin point had little immediate terminal <b>wounding</b> <b>effect</b> on a wild boar or bear, unless one was very careful to hit a vital organ, requiring a second man to stand by with a spear to finish the wounded animal off (typically, mastiffs were also brought to chase and hold the animal while the hunter dispatched it). It was also very easy to over-penetrate, bringing the wielder into danger from the animals claws and teeth. Around 1500 AD, a solution was reached by replacing the thin point of the estoc with a standard leaf-shaped boar-spear head, in essence creating a one-handed short spear. To prevent the blade from over-penetrating, most were fitted with a cross-shaft above the blade. To allow the blade to fit into a scabbard, these were typically simple removable pegs of wood or bone, but some examples had spring-loaded shafts that automatically deployed when the blade was drawn. An early image of these [...] "boar spear swords" [...] shows Emperor Maximilian I in a triumphal procession after a successful boar-hunt, the riders proudly carrying their spear-pointed swords upright. These weapons quickly became widely popular all over Europe, and examples can be found in numerous illustrations and descriptions of the time.|$|E
40|$|Upon {{mechanical}} wounding, plants locally induce necrosis, accumulate {{methyl jasmonate}} (MeJA) and acquire systemic resistance in nearby tissues. One-month-old in vitro grown Panax ginseng seedlings {{were treated with}} either 50 ÂµM MeJA or mechanical wounding alone {{or a combination of}} both, to evaluate jasmonic acid (JA) signaling and terpene biosynthetic pathway genes along with terpenoid accumulation. After MeJA treatment, JA pathway genes, such as lipoxygenase (PgLOX), hydrogen peroxidase lyase (PgHPL), allene oxide synthase (PgAOS), and allene oxide cyclase (PgAOC 1), and terpene pathway genes, such as isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (PgIPP) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (PgFPS), were highly expressed and resulted in the accumulation of mono- and sesquiterpenes. During mechanical wounding, PgLOX expression was induced relatively late after 72 h of treatment, however PgAOC 1 was not induced. This resulted in decreased production of MeJA that in turn may have lowered terpenoid production. In contrast, wounding + MeJA treatment increased PgAOC 1 and PgLOX gene expression earlier after 6 h and slowly promoted the production of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Furthermore, we monitored the effect of MeJA upon wounding in in vitro grown 1 -month-old seedlings treated with MeJA + wounding. These result demonstrated that exogenous MeJA is able to promote recovery from the <b>wounding</b> <b>effect</b> by functioning as a long distance signal. Additionally, these results suggest that exogenous MeJA supplied at the time of mechanical wounding prevents necrosis in the ginseng leaves by increasing the production of terpenoids...|$|E

40|$|When {{vascular}} bundles are broken, plants {{undergo a}} process of polar cellular re-differentiation that is hypothesized to be induced by a build up of the plant hormone indole- 3 - acetic-acid (IAA, or auxin). Previous studies have documented the influence of locally increased auxin concentrations on the position of newly formed vascular tissue, suggesting that a positive feedback mechanism drives auxin conductivity along a preferred localized transport route that subsequently differentiates into vascular tissue. Auxin directs cellular re-differentiation by moving in an apical to basipetal direction around the wound in a concentration-dependent manner. Wounding can initiate glycosidase action and increase biosynthesis of the phenolic compounds in non-injured adjacent cells, rapidly increasing the concentration of free flavonoids. The <b>wounding</b> <b>effect</b> putatively causes the partial inhibition of the cellular efflux component of polar auxin transport (PAT) through the influence of PAT inhibitor (PATI) flavonoids. This build up of flavonoids (such as quercetin) is theoretically highly adaptive, serving to direct re-differentiation by increasing auxin concentration around the wound while not affecting auxin transport elsewhere. This research focuses on changes in the extent of re-differentiation of parenchyma cells to xylem cells around a vascular injury in Coleus blumei, following the exogenous application of a synthetic or natural PATIs or non-PATIs {{to the site of}} the wound. I t was found that the application of the PATI quercetin to the vascular wound increases the extent of re-differentiation over a restricted time course that is not apparent in any other PATIs or non- PATIs treatments. These results provide preliminary evidence of a specific developmental phenomenon whereby the inhibition of auxin transport by flavonoids may be physiologically significant to the plant...|$|E
40|$|The Arabidopsis JAR 1 locus encodes a JA amido {{synthetase}} (JAS) that conjugates {{jasmonic acid}} to several amino acids. However, {{the role of}} JAR 1 -like genes from other plant species in wound response was unknown. This study focused on the involvement of JAR 1 in wound response of Arabidopsis and tomato. In wild type Arabidopsis the level of JAR 1 transcript peaked one hour after wounding and {{was accompanied by a}} 25 -fold increase in JA-Ile. Other JA conjugates remained near basal level or were undetected at all times following wounding. The rise in both JAR 1 transcript and JA-Ile occurred at least 3 hr before the appearance of jasmonate-dependent VSP transcript. JA-Ile was about 6 -fold lower in the jar 1 - 1 mutant compared to wild type at all wounding time points and the mutant accumulated significantly less VSP transcript. Evaluation of <b>wounding</b> <b>effect</b> on JA-conjugate synthesis in lie overaccumulating mutant omr 1 revealed that JA-Ile and the level of VSP transcript were also significantly reduced in this mutant. Analysis of the fad 3 - 2 fad 7 - 1 fad 8, opr 3 and coi 1 mutants of Arabidopsis showed that the induction of JAR 1 by wounding was largely independent of JA synthesis, but required the COI 1 signaling component. Characterization of a tomato homologue of Arabidopsis JAR 1 showed that the tomato JAS (LeJAR 1) synthesized a similar spectrum of JA-conjugates in vitro, as did the Arabidopsis enzyme. Leaf wounding induced LeJAR 1 transcript in a JA/ 1 -dependent manner. However, in contrast with Arabidopsis JA-Ile accumulation preceded the increase of the LeJAR 1 transcript following wounding. This suggested that in tomato the initial conjugate synthesis was dependent on factors other than transcriptional induction of LeJAR 1. Nevertheless, increase of both LeJAR 1 transcript and JA-Ile preceded that of defensive proteinase inhibitor II transcript, suggesting JA-Ile may participate in wound response of tomato. An RNAi-mediated silencing of LeJAR 1 resulted in identification of plants that accumulated reduced levels of LeJAR 1 transcript following wounding. These results provide new evidence for the involvement of JA-Ile in modulating wound-responsive defense gene expression in both Arabidopsis and tomato. ...|$|E

60|$|While all ranks {{believed}} alike {{the existence}} of these prodigies, the vulgar were contented to refer them to the immediate interference of the Deity, or, as they termed it, God's revenge against murder. But those, who, while they had overleaped the bounds of superstition, were still entangled in the mazes of mystic philosophy, amongst whom we must reckon many of the medical practitioners, endeavoured to explain the phenomenon, by referring to the secret power of sympathy, which even Bacon did not venture to dispute. To this occult agency was imputed the cure of <b>wounds,</b> <b>effected</b> by applying salves and powders, not to the wound itself, but to the sword or dagger, by which it had been inflicted; a course of treatment, which, wonderful as it may at first seem, was certainly frequently attended with signal success.[A] This, however, was attributed to magic, and those, who submitted to such a mode of cure, were refused spiritual assistance.|$|R

For it there was isolated the chitin from the shell of crabs, the chitosan was obtained for desacetylation and identified by spectrophotometric method (IR), solubility, determining the degree of desacetylatiÃ³n by way of potentiometric qualifications and later the unguent was formulated. For {{the determination of the}} <b>wound</b> healing <b>effect</b> we used the test of wound healing described by Howes and col., for incision wounds; we used 48 female albino mice of the species Mus mÃºsculos of 1 month and a half of age, with a weight inside the range of 25 to 33 g. The samples were administrated every 12 hours for a period of 72 hours., {{at the conclusion of the}} experiment the resistance that the treated wounds were offering, was quantified verifying them with their respective controls and histological cuts were realized to observe the degree of histological evolution of the process of wound healing. The chitosan, obtained by desacetylation from Chitin presents major wound healing activity under the pharmaceutical form of unguent at 0, 25 % (79, 28 % <b>wound</b> healing <b>effect)</b> in comparison with the group control (base of the unguent), it is concluded that under the test conditions chitosan possesses a significant healing <b>wound</b> <b>effect.</b> En el presente trabajo se estudiÃ³ el efecto cicatrizante del quitosano, obtenido por desacetilaciÃ³n a partir de quitina de los caparazones del cangrejo de la variedad Cancer cetosus âCangrejo Peludoâ, bajo la forma farmacÃ©utica de ungÃ¼ento a diferentes concentraciones. Para ello se aislÃ³ la quitina de los caparazones de cangrejos, se obtuvo el quitosano por desacetilaciÃ³n y se identificÃ³ por mÃ©todo espectrofotomÃ©trico (IR), solubilidad y determinando el grado de desacetilaciÃ³n mediante titulaciÃ³n potenciomÃ©trica y posteriormente se formulÃ³ el ungÃ¼ento. Para la determinaciÃ³n del efecto cicatrizante se utilizÃ³ el test de cicatrizaciÃ³n descrito por Howes y col, para heridas incisas, en el cual se emplearon 48 ratones albinos hembras de la especie Mus mÃºsculos de 1 mes y medio de edad, con un peso dentro del rango de 25 a 33 g. Las muestras se administraron cada 12 horas por un periodo de 72 horas, al tÃ©rmino del cual se cuantificÃ³ la resistencia que ofrecÃ­an las heridas tratadas, comparÃ¡ndolas con sus respectivos controles y se realizaron cortes histolÃ³gicos para observar el grado de evoluciÃ³n histolÃ³gica del proceso de cicatrizaciÃ³n. El quitosano, obtenido por desacetilaciÃ³n a partir de quitina presenta mayor efecto cicatrizante bajo la forma farmacÃ©utica de ungÃ¼ento al 0, 25 % (79, 28 % efecto cicatrizante) en comparaciÃ³n con el grupo control (base del ungÃ¼ento) se concluye que en las condiciones de ensayo el quitosano posee un significativo efecto cicatrizante...|$|R
