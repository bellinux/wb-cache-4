5|$|By 1878 Warbrick {{had left}} both St Stephen's and Ponsonby and was {{employed}} as a public servant. The work required him to relocate regularly, and he moved throughout the North Island {{for the remainder of}} his rugby career. By 1879 he was living in Wellington, and represented the provincial team three times that season. He played three further matches for Wellington in 1880, including one against his old province of Auckland. The 1880 match, the first in Auckland for Wellington, was won by the visitors 4–0. Warbrick was renowned for his drop-kicking, and his goal in the match was the only score; many Aucklanders claimed that his performance <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the two sides.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} the venom of four Sistrurus pit viper species found {{significant}} variation in the toxicity to mice. This variation {{was related to the}} proportion of small mammals in the diet of those species. The idea that Sistrurus venom had evolved to accommodate a mammal-based diet was supported by phylogenetic analysis. The researchers suggested that the basis for the difference in toxicity <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in muscle physiology in the various prey animals. Two lineages of elapid snakes, common sea snakes and Laticauda sea kraits, have independently colonized marine environments, and shifted to a very simple diet based on teleosts, or ray-finned fish. A 2005 study found that both these lineages have a much simpler set of venom proteins than their terrestrial relatives on the Australian continent, which have a more varied and complex diet. These findings were confirmed by a 2012 study, which compared the venoms of Toxicocalamus longissimus, a terrestrial species, and Hydrophis cyanocinctus, a marine species, both within the subfamily Hydrophiinae (which is also within the Elapid family). Despite being closely related to one another, the marine species had a significantly simpler set of venom proteins. The venoms of the sea snakes are nonetheless among the most toxic venoms known. It has been argued that since sea snakes are typically unable to prevent the escape of bitten prey, their venoms have evolved to act very rapidly.|$|E

25|$|The second semi-final saw France face England.

And with handling being difficult in the wet and windy conditions, England's superior forward pressure and territorial control forced France to concede a slew of penalties, of which Wilkinson kicked five, also adding three drop goals (two off his less-favoured right boot) - a remarkable display considering that the swirling winds made accurate kicking as difficult as the rain and mud made passing and running.|$|E

25|$|Graeme Smith <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> {{between the}} two teams at Taunton. After Leicestershire had made 330 in the first innings, with wicket-keeper Paul Nixon top scoring with 62 not out, {{it was time for}} the South African captain. Farming the strike exquisitely, he smashed 27 fours and eleven sixes in a career highest score of 311 - while his {{partners}} were sensible enough to not leave him stranded. Thus, Somerset made 566, and Andy Caddick and Charl Langeveldt paired up with good fast bowling to send Leicestershire down to 189 for 6. All-rounder Ian Blackwell then took three tail-end wickets to leave a target of 18 runs with more than a day to spare, and Somerset knocked off the runs inside six overs to win by ten wickets.|$|E
25|$|Chiefs quarterback Steve DeBerg {{completed}} a play-action 11-yard {{touchdown pass to}} wide receiver Fred Jones in the second quarter, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in K.C.'s narrow 10–6 win over long-time rival Los Angeles. K.C. running back Barry Word was arguably the Chiefs' most effective offensive weapon, rushing for 133 yards. This was Kansas City's first postseason win since Super Bowl IV in the 1969 season. The Raiders started rookie quarterback Todd Marinovich over veteran Jay Schroeder. Marinovich, who performed well in a loss to Kansas City the week before, instead threw four interceptions in the wild card rematch, including the one to Kansas City defensive back Deron Cherry that set up DeBerg's touchdown.

25|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of the side-lever engine were {{that it was}} large and heavy, and for inland waterway and coastal service, it was soon replaced by lighter and more efficient designs. It remained the dominant engine type for oceangoing service {{through much of the}} first half of the 19th century however, due to its relatively low centre of gravity which gave ships more stability in heavy seas. It was also a common early engine type for warships, since its relatively low height made it less susceptible to battle damage. From the first Royal Navy steam vessel in 1820 until 1840, 70 steam vessels entered service, the majority with side-lever engines, using boilers set to 4psi maximum pressure. The low steam pressures dictated the large cylinder sizes for the side-lever engines, though the effective pressure on the piston <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the boiler pressure and the vacuum in the condenser.|$|E

25|$|LSU's closest game of {{the season}} was a 7–6 victory over the Mississippi State Maroons, in which a missed extra point <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the score. Persistent rain before the game made the field wet and muddy, which contributed to six lost fumbles between the teams. It was fumbles that led to each team's scoring opportunities. Mississippi State's {{touchdown}} came {{at the start of the}} second quarter, after Donnie Daye fumbled and the Maroons recovered it on LSU's 23-yard line. Quarterback Billy Stacy ran it in from eleven yards out, but the extra point was missed. The Tigers scored their touchdown early in the third quarter after Brodnax recovered a fumble by Gil Peterson at the Maroon 34. Cannon and Brodnax led LSU down to the five, where Rabb passed to Hendrix for the touchdown and Davis kicked the extra point for the winning score.|$|E
25|$|The {{system worked}} by having two dipole antennas instead of one, {{slightly}} offset {{on either side}} of the mounting mast projecting through the middle of the parabolic dish. Being offset, the beams produced by the two dipoles were angled away from each other, to either side of the dish centreline. Normally the signals from both were added together and displayed, producing an output largely identical to the single-dipole case. The dipole shaft was mounted on another motor that rapidly spun them at 800rpm. A switch was placed so that it was triggered by the motor when the dipoles were roughly vertical or roughly horizontal, triggering a second circuit that subtracted the signals from each other instead of adding. The result <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in signal strength, which indicated which of the two dipoles was receiving more energy at that instant. This signal was fed into the scanner motors, driving it in the right direction.|$|E

25|$|The rivalry {{began with}} the teams' first meeting in 1991, with annual {{meetings}} beginning in 2005 when the Knights entered C-USA. Playing in the same division East Carolina and UCF were permanent opponents under the conference's scheduling structure. In recent years, the match between UCF and East Carolina has determined {{the winner of the}} Eastern Division. In 2007, UCF's only conference loss came {{at the hands of the}} Pirates. UCF won the division anyway, and ultimately took the conference title. In 2008, UCF was looking like they were going to ruin East Carolina's dreams of the Eastern Division title like they did to Marshall, but with a late rally, the Pirates won in overtime making the Pirates the first C-USA team to beat UCF in Spectrum Stadium. A loss at East Carolina also determined them as the Eastern Division champions in 2009, while a UCF win at home <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in 2010. In the final scheduled meeting of the two schools in 2012, it would be UCF that would win 40–20, despite falling behind 14–0 early on. As of now, the final count in the series in 9–4 in favor of East Carolina. The rivalry resumed when the Pirates joined UCF in the American Athletic Conference in 2014. UCF won as time expired on a 51-yard Hail Mary pass from Justin Holman to Breshad Perriman, 32–30. This allowed for them to win back to back conference championships. ECU would blow out a winless UCF team the next year, 44-7. One year later, UCF would beat ECU 47-29 under first-year head coach, Scott Frost, against ECU's first-year head coach, Scottie Montgomery.|$|E
25|$|Simpson started solidly in the {{international}} matches, scoring twin half centuries in the drawn First Test in Brisbane, although he was punished with the ball, registering 1/100 from 25 overs. After Australia went 1–0 down in Melbourne, Simpson totalling 52 and going wicketless, Simpson produced a match-winning all round performance in the Third Test {{in front of his}} home crowd in Sydney to help Australia level the series. On a dry surface where almost the entire square was devoid of grass, Simpson took his Test best innings haul of 5/57, removing specialist batsmen Colin Cowdrey and Geoff Pullar after they had been set, and then cleaning up the tail to restrict England to 279. He then scored 91 to help Australia accumulate a first-innings lead of 40. England were then dismissed in their second innings for 104, leaving a victory target of just 65. Simpson made an aggressive unbeaten 34, with English captain Ted Dexter plundered for 27 runs in his three overs. A storm hit the ground and stayed for two days just after Australia reached the target, which could have washed out the match and saved England. As the last two Tests were drawn, this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between Australia retaining and losing the Ashes. Simpson was not prominent in the last two matches. He scored 71 in the second innings of the Fourth Test but made 32 and two ducks in the other innings, and took a total of 2/163 in the last two Tests, conceding more than four runs per over. He ended the series with 401 runs at 44.56 and eight wickets at 46.13. Simpson continued to be prolific away from the Tests, scoring 205 against Western Australia in a Shield match.
