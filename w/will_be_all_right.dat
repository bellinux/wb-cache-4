Locke then appears, carrying cable and saying he is going into the hatch. Soon after, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) follows behind him. While Locke is easing her down the shaft, Kate mysteriously disappears during a sudden burst of light from within the Hatch.|$|E

Your country is connected to us by land, and yet you cross the sea to serve China. Because of this, our great country came to attack you. If you relinquish land to us and establish a tributary relationship, everything <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
500|$|Graham praised {{his opponents}} – [...] "There {{is no need}} to take {{anything}} away from Liverpool because they were terrific," [...] and felt his team could have been more clinical. He described Arsenal's performance as [...] "below par" [...] and was upbeat about the season ahead: [...] "This might have done us the world of good. We <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> by next week – don't worry about that." ...|$|E

60|$|But George felt {{now that}} he did not care who looked at him, who commiserated him. The <b>will</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> He did not at that moment wish it to be other than that the old man had made it. After all their quarrels, all their hot words and perverse {{thoughts}} towards each other, it was clear to him now that his uncle had, at any rate, appreciated him. He could hear the remainder of it quite unmoved.|$|R
500|$|In the {{vignette}} [...] "Abomination" [...] {{featured in}} X-Men: Manifest Destiny, Anole and his Young X-Men teammate Jonas Graymalkin {{have a talk}} where Graymalkin discusses his past and reveals that he too is gay and {{was a victim of}} a near-fatal homophobic attack at the hands of his father. Anole reassures him that he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> and the two form a friendship. [...] Lyle Masaki of Logo's AfterElton.com expressed interest in this development, stating that, [...] "ith the small number of gay superheroes out there, camaraderie between gay characters is as rare as same-sex couples." ...|$|E
500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E
500|$|The afterlife {{experienced}} by the survivors is shown during season six. In [...] "The Substitute", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of European History. In [...] "Dr. Linus", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger (Jon Gries), who is on life support. At school, he is shown to have {{a close relationship with}} his star pupil, Alex, and befriends a substitute teacher, John Locke. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus. [...] Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his affair and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to Yale University will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a recommendation letter. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices Desmond Hume waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him everything <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he was only trying to help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he [...] "has a few things to work out". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a [...] "real good number two", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds [...] "And you were a great number one, Hugo." ...|$|E

2500|$|McCartney {{said he had}} {{the idea}} of [...] "Let It Be" [...] after he had a dream about his mother during the tense period {{surrounding}} the sessions for The Beatles ("the White Album") in 1968. According to McCartney, the song's reference to [...] "Mother Mary" [...] was not biblical. [...] The phrase has at times {{been used as a}} reference to the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, McCartney explained that his mother – who died of cancer when he was fourteen – was the inspiration for the [...] "Mother Mary" [...] lyric. He later said: [...] "It was great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing 'Let It Be'." [...] He also said in a later interview about the dream that his mother had told him, [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> just let it be." [...] When asked if the song referred to the Virgin Mary, McCartney has typically answered the question by assuring his fans that they can interpret the song however they like.|$|E

'The {{doctor told}} my father, and me too, sir, {{that we must}} give up mining, or die of decline: so he came up here, to a sister of his that was married to the squire's gardener, and here he died; and the squire, God bless him and forgive him, took a fancy to me, and made me under-keeper. And I loved the life, for it took me among the woods and the rivers, where I could think of the Brazils, and fancy myself back again. But mustn't talk of that--where God <b>wills</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> And it <b>is</b> a fine life for reading and thinking, a gamekeeper's, for it's an idle life at best.
