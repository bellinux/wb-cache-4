5|$|The ruff (Calidris pugnax) is a {{medium-sized}} <b>wading</b> <b>bird</b> that breeds in marshes and wet meadows across northern Eurasia.

5|$|The {{cattle egret}} was first {{described}} in 1758 by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae as Ardea ibis, but {{was moved to}} its current genus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. Ibis is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white <b>wading</b> <b>bird,</b> the sacred ibis, but was applied to this species in error.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, the maguari stork forages solitarily or in pairs. However, it feeds in larger aggregations outside the breeding season and often also {{in association with}} other <b>wading</b> <b>bird</b> species. The shallowness of these pools concentrates prey items, so that tactile foraging probably operates in this situation.|$|E

25|$|The black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) {{is a tall}} long-necked <b>wading</b> <b>bird</b> in the stork family. It is a {{resident}} species across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia with a disjunct population in Australia. It lives in wetland habitats and certain crops such as rice and wheat where it forages {{for a wide range}} of animal prey. Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white and glossy blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the iris. In Australia, it is sometimes called a jabiru although that name refers to a stork species found in the Americas. It is one of the few storks that is strongly territorial when feeding.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, an {{evaluation}} of the C was submitted to Congress as part of the Water Development Act of 1992. The seven-year report, called the [...] "Restudy", cited indicators of harm to the ecosystem: a 50percent reduction in the original Everglades, diminished water storage, harmful timing of water releases from canals and pumping stations, an 85 to 90percent decrease in <b>wading</b> <b>bird</b> populations over the past 50years, and the decline of output from commercial fisheries. Bodies of water including Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, St. Lucie estuary, Lake Worth Lagoon, Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay and the Everglades reflected drastic water level changes, hypersalinity, and dramatic changes in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The Restudy noted the overall decline in water quality over the past 50years was due to loss of wetlands that act as filters for polluted water. It predicted that without intervention the entire South Florida ecosystem would deteriorate. Water shortages would become common and some cities would have annual water restrictions.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} Water Resources Development Act of 1992, Congress {{authorized}} {{an evaluation}} of the effectiveness of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project. A report known as the [...] "Restudy", written by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, was submitted to Congress in 1999. It cited indicators of harm to the system: a 50% reduction in the original Everglades, diminished water storage, harmful timing of water release, an 85 to 90% decrease in <b>wading</b> <b>bird</b> populations over the past 50years, and the decline of output from commercial fisheries. Bodies of water including Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, St. Lucie estuary, Lake Worth Lagoon, Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, and the Everglades reflected drastic water level changes, hypersalinity, and dramatic changes in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The Restudy noted the overall decline in water quality over the past 50years was caused by loss of wetlands that act as filters for polluted water. It predicted that without intervention the entire South Florida ecosystem would deteriorate. Canals took roughly [...] of water to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico daily, so there was no opportunity for water storage, yet flooding was still a problem. Without changes to the current system, the Restudy predicted water restrictions would be necessary every other year, and annually in some locations. It also warned that revising some portions of the project without dedicating efforts to an overall comprehensive plan would be insufficient and probably detrimental.|$|E

30|$|Foraging {{success of}} long-legged <b>wading</b> <b>birds</b> (Ciconiiformes) {{depends largely on}} prey {{availability}} (Bancroft et al. 2002, Gawlik 2002). Water depth is a primary determinant of prey availability since <b>wading</b> <b>birds</b> are limited to foraging in water no deeper than their leg length (Powell 1987, Gawlik 2002). Emergent vegetation density also plays an integral role in prey availability in two important ways. Dense vegetation can impede access to prey, but may also increase prey density by improving cover to hide from predators. Thus, sparse vegetation may be preferred by <b>wading</b> <b>birds</b> compared to dense or no emergent vegetation (Lantz et al. 2011), and edges may be preferred over open water (Stolen 2006).|$|R
