40|$|Companies {{typically}} {{plan for}} <b>warranty</b> <b>costs</b> through {{creation of a}} reserve fund. Most researchers assume that the warranty reserve is set based on the expected total <b>warranty</b> <b>costs.</b> However, companies rarely keep reserves to cover their liabilities for the whole life of their products, since maintaining excess reserves would cause opportunity cost. We propose an optimal policy rule based {{on the amount of}} cash additions/subtractions {{at the beginning of each}} period and the amount to contribute to the reserve after each sale. We model the warranty reserve problem as a single period inventory problem. We have shown that when there is no contribution after each sale the optimal policy resembles a 'base-stock' policy. When contribution after each sale is permissible, the optimal reserve level decreases as <b>warranty</b> <b>costs</b> can be covered by accruals. However, this kind of 'pay-as-you-go' system also increases the uncertainty in net flows from the fund. decision analysis; risk management; base stock policy; warranty reserve; optimisation; warranty costs; reserve funds. ...|$|R

General Motors currently uses RedX, a systematic design of experiments methodology, to try to reduce <b>warranty</b> <b>costs.</b> Although this approach has reduced <b>warranty</b> <b>costs,</b> it has not done so neither fast nor sufficiently as high costs remains. The General Motors' warranty system was mapped and diagnosed. Interviews were conducted with all involved parties with the warranty system. Competitors warranty systems were compared and contrast to General Motors' warranty system. Other factors considered were new quality methods. The major factors limiting General Motors goals to reducing warranty are time to discover the failure and the time the fix the failure once it is discovered. Another factor is the culture and the lack of team environment within the warranty organization. General Motors should use telematics, onboard diagnostics, signature analysis, and a systemic approach which involves integrating the design and warranty organizations to predict and quickly eliminate defects from its manufacturing facilities. This approach will either eliminate failures quickly or prevent them from even becoming failures in the first place. by Jelani H. Ellington. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{warranty}} {{has its own}} {{priority in}} business strategy for a manufacturer to protect their benefit {{as well as the}} intense competition between the manufacturers. In fact, warranty is a contract between manufacturer and buyer in which the manufacturer gives the buyer certain assurances as the condition of the property being sold. In industry, an accurate prediction of optimal warranty period and warranty costs is often counted by the manufacturer. A warranty period may be unprofitable for the manufacturers if the choice of duration given is either too short or too long. Same thing goes to <b>warranty</b> <b>cost</b> which is an underestimation or overestimation of the <b>warranty</b> <b>cost</b> may have a high influence to the manufacturers. This paper presents a methodology to adapt historical maintenance warranty data with neuro-fuzzy approach. The main motivations for conducting this paper are simplicity and less computational mass of the neuro-fuzzy based on previous studies on this method compared to single method such neural network and fuzzy logic.
