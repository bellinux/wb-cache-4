40|$|International audienceNuclear {{decommissioning}} {{takes place}} in several stages due to the radioactivity in the reactor structure materials. A good estimation of the neutron activation products distributed in the reactor structure materials impacts obviously on the decommissioning planning and the low-level radioactive waste management. Continuous energy Monte-Carlo radiation transport code TRIPOLI- 4 has been applied on radiation protection and shielding analyses. To enhance the TRIPOLI- 4 application in nuclear decommissioning activities, both experimental and computational benchmarks are being performed. To calculate the neutron activation of the shielding and structure materials of nuclear facilities, the knowledge of 3 D neutron flux map and energy spectra must be first investigated. To perform this type of neutron deep penetration calculations with the Monte Carlo transport code, variance reduction techniques are {{necessary in order to}} reduce the uncertainty of the neutron activation estimation. In this study, variance reduction options of the TRIPOLI- 4 code were used on the NAIADE 1 light <b>water</b> <b>shielding</b> benchmark.

There are healthy populations of at least eight species of frogs: wood frogs, leopard frogs, spring peepers, American toads, gray treefrogs, mink frogs, green frogs and bull frogs. [...] The earliest to call each year are usually wood frogs and spring peepers, often when ponds still have areas of ice. Wood frogs are rapid breeders in small temporary ponds, also known as vernal ponds; mating and egg laying are completed {{in just a few}} days. Gray Tree frogs, on the other hand, have a much longer calling period. They call from the trees before moving to water, they call from the water while mating, and then they call while leaving the pond for the forest. Bullfrogs are the last to call, usually during the hot evenings of July and August. Other amphibians include spotted, blue spotted and red-backed salamanders. There are also populations of snapping turtles and painted turtles, with recorded sightings of Blanding’s turtles; several south-facing slopes are actively used by nesting turtles. As noted above, there are frequent sightings of wetland mammals including otters, muskrat, beavers and ermine. There is a rich wetland flora typical of ponds on the Canadian shield, such as yellow water lilies and <b>water</b> <b>shield.</b> There are also less-common species including green arrow arum [...] and purple-fringed orchid.

He had won in these early times more than 25 national and international awards, that can be proved by press and certificates. The historic material of these years is not even regrounded. But as you can see, the most of all the procedures Helmut Tollmann is using until today in his artistic work, posterisation, lithographic films and developers, solarisation and reprographic use of photographic techniques {{can be found in}} his works until now, especially in his multi-layer-technique. [...] 2. new ways and techniques 1970-1974 Beginning in the early seventies Helmut Tollmann was principally involved in paintings of architecture and landscapes, deeply impressed by the work of Max Ernst. The proximity of Helmut Tollmann’s early paintings to Max Ernst is no coincidence. Max Ernst invented a lot of procedures and techniques in modern painting (the frottage, for example) and so did Helmut Tollmann. Always looking for new media and procedures useful for artistic utilization. In this period he painted his so-called “soft landscapes”. They look like silk paintings. Helmut Tollmann’s artistic expression based on the study of Max Ernst. And so did the architectural paintings too. [...] 3. Bringing painting, reprography and printing technique together 1974-1985 In these days Helmut Tollmann and a lot his friends (for example Andy Warhol) and colleagues were using reprographic and photographic techniques, especially in Pop-Art. But Helmut Tollmann tried something one can estimate maybe not before today. He brought the squeegee from silk screen printing into painting years before others. In these paintings you can also find elements of technical and electronic processes, which go together more and more with his art the coming years. [...] 4. Technology and the soul in world and mankind - “Soul of Chip” 1985-1997 The painting media were changing more and more. Using new colors and the canvas of his work is changing to copper plates, printed circuit boards and so on. All corresponding to the main theme in Helmut Tollmann’s works of that time “soul of chip”, a registered trade mark of Helmut Tollmann until today. How does the world of information and the men in it rock? Portraits of local, national and international status such as Trude Herr a local hero of Cologne theater or Albert Einstein join in Helmut Tollmann’s artistic work of these days. Multimedia, illumination and information technology mixed in multi-layer artwork. [...] 5. Links - the connecting aspect between technology and mankind 1998-2007 In this shift of emphasis from searching for the “soul of chip” to the use of media the new theme in Helmut Tollmann’s work was showing up: Links. The chance to join apparently disparate projects like: Wirkbetrieb 1, a projects of T-Systems and “Together” a project of the initiative tolerance under the patronage of Joschka Fischer former minister of foreign affairs. In this time new portraits of people from the music history (Beethoven-Superstar, Wagner, Berlioz…) and the social, political and economical life were painted. [...] 6.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that there is a {{difference}} in oil recovery between slim tube and core flooding experiments, although both are conducted under the same pressures and temperatures. The slim tube contains no water and has a highly permeable bead pack. The presence of water in core floods is one possible reason for the observed difference in CO 2 performance between slim tube and core flooding experiments. The presence of water may make oil less accessible to CO 2 and most of the injected CO 2 interacts with the water. To our knowledge, the effects of <b>water</b> <b>shielding</b> on the performance of SC-CO 2 injection as a miscible process in tight limestone rocks has not been investigated before. Therefore, different core flooding experiments were conducted using composite cores to investigate the effect of <b>water</b> <b>shielding</b> on the performance of SC-CO 2 flooding. SC-CO 2 was injected in different composite cores having oil saturations of 30, 50, and 79  % with a descending order of permeability, as shown in Table  3.

All runs were conducted at 250  °F and 4, 000  psia, a condition adopted in this work to ensure that the CO 2 is at supercritical conditions and miscible with the employed oil.|$|R
