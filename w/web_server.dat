5|$|Python {{can serve}} as a {{scripting}} language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache <b>web</b> <b>server.</b> With <b>Web</b> <b>Server</b> Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.|$|E

5|$|PHP code may be {{embedded}} into HTML or HTML5 markup, {{or it can}} be used {{in combination}} with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the <b>web</b> <b>server</b> or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The <b>web</b> <b>server</b> software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{designed}} to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting, and it is similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a <b>web</b> <b>server</b> to a client, such as Microsoft's Classic ASP, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD).

5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a <b>web</b> <b>server.</b> Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E

5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from <b>web</b> <b>server</b> records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by manga artist and writer Hato Moa—author of the series Vairocana and a former Dengeki Comic Grand Prix honoree—under her dōjin circle PigeoNation Inc. As she had no experience with game development prior to Hatoful, Hato initially wanted {{to start with a}} visual novel, as she believed it was an easier game type for amateur developers to make; the format also allowed visuals to easily accompany her stories, something that she, as a manga artist, was accustomed to and viewed as being necessary in her work. She first came up with the concept for Hatoful as a 2011 April Fools' Day joke: despite her lack of familiarity with the genre, she initially intended to create a parody of otome game stereotypes. Birds in particular were used as a theme due to Hato's fondness for pigeons; however, this was also partially due to Hato's prioritization of writing over illustrating, as the use of bird photographs instead of hand-drawn sprites allowed her more freedom to focus on the script. The first incarnation of the game was created over the course of half a day and posted as a browser game made with Adobe Flash; but due to strong word of mouth from social media it was taken down after immense traffic caused the <b>web</b> <b>server</b> it was hosted on to crash on two separate occasions. Following the unexpected popularity of the Flash game, development began on a longer visual novel using the FamousWriter game engine.|$|E

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{studies on}} Web document caching consider Web proxies. The {{focus of this}} paper is caching in primary <b>Web</b> <b>servers.</b> This type of caching decreases request response time and server load.

Unfortunately, like most dynamic content providers, their form-based queries and responses cannot be cached by today's web proxies.

40|$|Broadband {{connectivity}} and {{the great}} variety of services offered over the Internet have made it {{an important source of}} information and entertainment and a major means of communication. In 2008, users are more connected than ever. With connectivity to the Internet, however, come security threats. Because the Internet is a global network, an attack can be delivered anonymously from any location in the world. In 2003, a study was published that compared vulnerabilities in <b>web</b> <b>servers</b> from various countries. It showed that web sites in the New Zealand domain were one of the most vulnerable to Google hacking attacks. Vulnerable <b>web</b> <b>servers</b> lead to compromised <b>web</b> <b>servers,</b> which do not only pose a risk to operators of these <b>web</b> <b>servers,</b> but also to their users or customers, because the attackers might insert client-side attacks that trigger upon interaction with such a compromised server. As part of work commissioned by InternetNZ, Victoria University of Wellington has gathered intelligence on the threat from malicious servers across different country domains (. au,. com,. nz, and. uk) In this study, it was assessed whether the <b>web</b> <b>servers</b> located in the nz domains would show an elevated percentage of malicious <b>web</b> <b>servers</b> in line with their vulnerability independent by Nehring [4].
