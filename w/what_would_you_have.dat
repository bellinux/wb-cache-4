2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the campaign, Dion had an {{interview}} with CTV Halifax's anchor Steve Murphy, where Dion asked the host three times to restart the interview because he didn't understand the mixed tense and timing of a question about the economy: [...] "If you were Prime Minister now, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done about the economy and this crisis that Mr. Harper has not done?" [...] Murphy initially agreed not to air it but network executives decided to release it, generating controversy. On election night, Dion angrily refused to speak to the CTV reporters scrumming around him, saying [...] "The last one I want to speak first [...] is CTV - you understand that?".|$|E

2500|$|Since these criticisms are {{concerned}} {{not with the}} validity of the Wager itself, but with its possible aftermath—namely that a person who has been convinced of the overwhelming odds in favor of belief might still find himself unable to sincerely believe—they are tangential to the thrust of the Wager. What such critics are objecting to is Pascal's subsequent advice to an unbeliever who, having concluded that the only rational way to wager is in favor of God's existence, points out, reasonably enough, that this by no means makes him a believer. This hypothetical unbeliever complains, [...] "I am so made that I cannot believe. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> me do?" [...] Pascal, far from suggesting that God can be deceived by outward show, says that God does not regard it at all: [...] "God looks only at what is inward." [...] For a person who is already convinced of the odds of the Wager but cannot seem to put his heart into the belief, he offers practical advice.|$|E
2500|$|The footage shows {{interviewer}} Steve Murphy asking Dion the question: [...] "If {{you were}} the Prime Minister now, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done about the economy, and this crisis, that Mr. Harper has not done?". [...] Dion had difficulty in understanding the question, repeatedly asking Murphy to clarify if he meant if Dion was Prime Minister now, next Tuesday on election day, last week, last month, 60 weeks ago, or {{two and a half}} years ago. [...] Eventually, after three start overs to the interview, Dion responded with what he would do if elected Prime Minister in the future. CTV initially agreed to restart the interviews and not air the false starts but changed their minds and announced that they felt it was their responsibility to show it. Harper responded to the clips by saying that [...] "When you're running a trillion-and-a-half-dollar economy you don't get a chance to have do-overs, over and over again" [...] and [...] "What this incident actually indicates very clearly is Mr. Dion and the Liberal Party really don't know what they would do on the economy", and when told that the difficulties were in part due to English being Dion's second language, Harper said: [...] "I don't think this is a question of language at all. The question was very clear. It was asked repeatedly".|$|E
