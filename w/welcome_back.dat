She earned a nomination for the Best Actress – Telugu award at the 63rd Filmfare Awards South ceremony for her performance in Srimanthudu.

She played the role of a young college lecturer with a slightly stern approach towards her students. The remake gained positive critical reception, and earned average returns.
