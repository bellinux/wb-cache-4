The immediate past location of the school, on Howard Street in downtown Baltimore, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On April 24, 2007, the building was designated a Baltimore City landmark, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> building's exterior cannot be altered without approval of the city Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation. On June 21, 2007, the school's Alumni Association received a historic preservation award from Baltimore Heritage for its leadership role in preserving the building as an historic Baltimore landmark.|$|E
5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} {{spaces are}} frequently {{used in the}} theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with discontinuities, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sample functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.|$|E

5|$|The bowfin is an {{actinopterygii}} <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{pectoral girdle}} is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In {{this group of}} fishes the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral girdle of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the pectoral girdle.The pectoral girdle {{is attached to the}} skull. The pectoral girl is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are nearly ideal gases under {{standard}} conditions, but their {{deviations from the}} ideal gas law provided important clues {{for the study of}} intermolecular interactions. The Lennard-Jones potential, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by John Lennard-Jones from experimental data on argon before the development of quantum mechanics provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from first principles. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> interaction between the atoms is independent of direction, or isotropic.|$|E
5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities {{a certain degree of}} independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E
30|$|Another {{benefit of}} being {{resource}} efficient is that challenging theoretical hypotheses could be tested more easily.

Numerical experiments might therefore yield in more hypotheses testing in fire science, which in turn can result in more progress in the field.|$|R

5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|Most of the monarchies in Europe are {{constitutional}} monarchies, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monarch {{does not}} influence {{the politics of}} the state: either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so, or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by convention. The exceptions are Liechtenstein and Monaco, which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on politics, and the Vatican City, which is a theocratic absolute elective monarchy. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see monarchism and republicanism) in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them (e.g. the political organisation Republic in the United Kingdom). Currently seven of the twelve monarchies are members of the European Union: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true external zone, which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization. These do not have a third layer, but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the eggshell originally had a three layers since the external layer can easily separate from the rest of the eggshell. These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E

5|$|The {{restoration}} {{then was}} carried out between 1907 and 1911, using the principles of anastylosis and led by Theodor van Erp. The first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing Buddha heads and panel stones. Van Erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas. Along the way, Van Erp discovered more things {{he could do to}} improve the monument; he submitted another proposal, which was approved with the additional cost of 34,600 guilders. At first glance, Borobudur had been restored to its old glory. Van Erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chhatra (three-tiered parasol) pinnacle on top of the main stupa. However, he later dismantled the chhatra, citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original design of Borobudur's pinnacle is actually unknown. The dismantled chhatra now is stored in Karmawibhangga Museum, a few hundred meters north from Borobudur.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{isolated}} {{nature of the}} site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to be generally damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments.

5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive {{and there are some}} remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are compared as in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme.|$|E
40|$|Tribological {{properties}} of commercially available silicone-based ceramizable composites were studied. Friction forces {{of three different}} types of ceramizable composites were measured against three different-shape steel samples. Each friction pair contact was loaded with 15, 30, 45 or 60 N. Conducted studies reveal that tribological behavior of the composites vary considerably depending on the composite type and friction contact. However, friction force was increasing with an increase of <b>the</b> load, <b>which</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> composites behave accordingly to the classic friction theory...|$|R

5|$|The {{vertebral}} column in bowfin is ossified and {{in comparison to}} earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the {{vertebral column}} allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a homocercal tail, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|There are six known genetic {{disorders}} in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia {{of the affected}} animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three {{are thought to be}} autosomal recessive conditions, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flawed gene is not sex-linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance. Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, American Saddlebred, Appaloosa, Miniature horse, and Belgian.|$|E
5|$|From 1805 to 1867, Egypt {{remained}} legally {{a nominal}} Ottoman province {{governed by a}} Wāli {{on behalf of the}} Ottoman Sultan, although it was de facto virtually independent, with its wālis styling themselves as Khedives. Despite their legally subservient status, Egypt's wālis enjoyed far more political power than their descendants, who were to rule the country as nominally independent sultans and kings decades later. Throughout the 19th century, the legal fiction of Ottoman suzerainty was nonetheless symbolically maintained through Egypt's payment of an annual tribute. Moreover, although the Muhammad Ali Dynasty became a hereditary monarchy in 1840, each new ruler had to receive a firman (Arabic word for decree) from the Ottoman Sultan appointing him as Wāli in order to be formally invested with his office. Until 1866, Egypt's laws of succession followed the principle of agnatic seniority, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reigning wāli always had to be the eldest male member of the dynasty. Rulers thus inherited the throne based on their age, not on their degree of proximity. This explains why none of Ibrahim Pasha's successors was directly succeeded by his own son.|$|E
