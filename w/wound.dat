He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to {{dislodge}} a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing.

The reduction in diameter growth of <b>wounded</b> beech trees was only observed in the breast height DBH range below 55  cm. The diameter growth of <b>wounded</b> trees was 8.1  % lower than in unwounded trees. The vertical distance from the ground of <b>wounding</b> was {{a significant factor in}} diameter growth. <b>Wounds</b> that were larger than 200  cm 2 in area significantly reduced diameter growth of beech trees. Whether <b>wounds</b> were closed or open <b>wounds</b> had no significant effect on diameter growth but decayed <b>wounds</b> reduced diameter growth by 15.3  %.|$|R
5|$|In {{some parts}} of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, are used as surgical sutures. The <b>wound</b> is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the <b>wound</b> in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the <b>wound.</b> The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E
5|$|The bat’s saliva, {{left in the}} victim's {{resulting}} bite <b>wound,</b> has a key {{function in}} feeding from the <b>wound.</b> The saliva contains several compounds that prolong bleeding, such as anticoagulants that inhibit blood clotting, and compounds that prevent the constriction of blood vessels near the <b>wound.</b>|$|E

Davis is listed as a second lieutenant in Mexican War Veterans: A Complete Roster of the Regular and Volunteer Troops ... By William Hugh Robarts (1887) who notes that he was <b>wounded</b> in the Battle of Churubusco.

5|$|Fly larvae {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} <b>wound</b> care and treatment. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy <b>wound</b> healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E
5|$|Hess was {{promoted}} to platoon leader of the 10th Company of the 18th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment, which was serving in Romania. He was wounded on 23 July and again on 8 August 1917; the first injury was a shell splinter to the left arm, which was dressed in the field, but the second was a bullet <b>wound</b> that entered the upper chest near the armpit and exited near his spinal column, leaving a pea-sized entry <b>wound</b> and a cherry stone-sized exit <b>wound</b> on his back. By 20 August he was well enough to travel, so {{he was sent to}} hospital in Hungary and eventually back to Germany, where he recovered in hospital in Meissen. In October he received promotion to Leutnant der Reserve and was recommended for, but did not receive, the Iron Cross, first class. At his father's request, Hess was transferred to a hospital closer to home, arriving at Alexandersbad on 25 October.|$|E

5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture <b>wound</b> that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed <b>wound.</b> When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} the French army had {{completely}} evacuated Russian territory by December 1812 but their defeat sparked anti-French sentiments in Germany and Prussia joined the Russians, forming a Sixth Coalition. Hostilities thus continued in early 1813 but Nansouty's <b>wound</b> did not yet allow {{him to return to}} action, so he was offered the prestigious position of Colonel-General of dragoons (16 January), in replacement of General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers, who had just died of exhaustion. Nansouty's <b>wound</b> was very serious but he had been very lucky: the bullet that pierced his knee only tore through flesh, leaving his kneecap intact. Having missed {{the first part of the}} campaign, General Nansouty was recalled to a field command once his knee <b>wound</b> was cured, towards mid-1813. He accepted to take the helm of the Guard cavalry, with a complement of 5,000 sabres, and including Guyot's Grenadiers-à-cheval, Letort's Dragons, Lefebvre-Desnouettes Chasseurs-à-cheval and Édouard Colbert's Chevau-légers lanciers.|$|E
