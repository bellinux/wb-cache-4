It agrees with experiment in the few tests that can be made, but the whole edifice is not physics. Instead of using observations to test that model, I derive a simple empirical model of elementary physics and cosmology from the observations. The observations imply {{that the universe is}} a finite cellular automaton; that there is no curved space; that fundamental particles are massless; that "massy" particles, including electrons, are composed of fundamental particles; that gravitational mass is inertial mass; that black holes are made from neutrons compressed into bosons; that the universe was produced from cold compressed particles, not radiation; and that the universe is not expanding.
