However, shaken by the September 11 attacks, she stopped writing {{for a few weeks}} in the autumn, saying, [...] "It's deeply unsettling when you're writing about a fictional catastrophe and then a real one happens". However, with the looming questions of the end, Atwood finished the novel for release in 2003. These questions in Oryx and Crake, Atwood explained, are [...] "simply, What if we continue down the road we're already on? How slippery is the slope? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> saving graces?

A tiny blood vessel bursting on the brain, will make us in one moment paralytic, helpless, babblers, and idiots. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of the world?

That <b>is</b> <b>our</b> policy. You ask, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> aim? I can answer in one word: Victory. Victory at all costs—Victory in spite of all terror—Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.|$|R

60|$|She looked pitiably {{small and}} thin in her deep mourning. If I {{attached}} any serious importance {{to such a}} perishable trifle as personal appearance, I might be inclined to add that hers {{was one of those}} unfortunate complexions which always suffer when not relieved by a border of white next the skin.

Nor did they ever fail to succor the sick and unfortunate. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> toils and perils compared to theirs?

60|$|I purpose, {{in return}} for the honour you do us by coming to see <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> {{proceedings}} here, to bring before you, in the course of these lectures, the Chemical History of a Candle. I have taken this subject on a former occasion; and were it left to my own will, I should prefer to repeat it almost every year--so abundant is the interest that attaches itself to the subject, so wonderful are the varieties of outlet which it offers into the various departments of philosophy. There is not a law under which any part of this universe is governed which does not come into play, and is touched upon in these phenomena. There is no better, there is no more open door by which you can enter into the study of natural philosophy, than by considering the physical phenomena of a candle. I trust, therefore, I shall not disappoint you in choosing this for my subject rather than any newer topic, which could not be better, were it even so good.|$|E
6000|$|Now I'll warrant {{there are}} hosts of my readers ready {{at once to}} lift up their hands and eyes, with that virtuous indignation with which we {{contemplate}} the faults and errors of our neighbors, and to exclaim at the preposterous idea of convincing the mind by tormenting the body, and establishing the doctrine of charity and forbearance by intolerant persecution. But, in simple truth, {{what are we doing}} at this very day, and in this very enlightened nation, but acting upon the very same principle in our political controversies? Have we not, within but a few years, released ourselves from the shackles of a government which cruelly denied us the privilege of governing ourselves, and using in full latitude that invaluable member, the tongue? and are we not at this very moment striving our best to tyrannize over the opinions, tie up the tongues, and ruin the fortunes of one another? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> great political societies but mere political inquisitions--our pot-house committees but little tribunals of denunciation--our newspapers but mere whipping-posts and pillories, where unfortunate individuals are pelted with rotten eggs--and our council of appointment but a grand auto-da-fe, where culprits are annually sacrificed for their political heresies? ...|$|E
