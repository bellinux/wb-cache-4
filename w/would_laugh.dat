5|$|Medium Alison {{writes a}} letter to her parents but does not mention Joan or her recent {{realization}} she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison {{to put on a}} dress, but she would rather wear a jean jacket. Bruce tells her that she would be the only girl without a dress and that the other children <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> at her; she leaves on the dress ("Party Dress"). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written {{a letter to}} her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself (beginning to wonder if she's asexual) until Joan kisses her. That night, she is excited and joyful at having had sex with Joan ("Changing My Major").|$|E
5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E
25|$|Later in life, Groucho would {{sometimes}} note to talk show hosts, not entirely jokingly, {{that he was}} unable to actually insult anyone, because the target of his comment would assume that it was a Groucho-esque joke, and <b>would</b> <b>laugh.</b>|$|E

60|$|I was the Attic shepherd's trysting place, Beneath {{my shadow}} Amaryllis lay, And round my trunk <b>would</b> <b>laughing</b> Daphnis chase The timorous girl, till tired out with play She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair, And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such {{delightful}} snare.|$|R

25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
500|$|In one scene, Orpheus's head is {{attached}} to a scarecrow body. [...] According to Matthew Chamberlain, the actor who portrayed Orpheus, he was told to jump on a horse while wearing the scarecrow costume. [...] Chamberlain said he [...] "just gave the horse a quick pat before hopping on" [...] but found himself [...] "getting tugged the other way as the horse was munching away on the straw poking out of the end of my sleeve!" [...] An animatronic version of Chamberlain's head which operated by remote control was used in some scenes. [...] Some of the actors had to only pretend to look at the animatronic head during their scenes, because if they looked at it while it responded, they <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> and break character.|$|E
60|$|<b>Would</b> she <b>laugh?</b> <b>Would</b> {{she take}} it as a joke? All eyes met her with a glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to her seat, and took it in silence.|$|R

500|$|Ryo {{found it}} {{difficult}} at first to write [...] "tenderhearted" [...] lyrics for songs meant to be sung by young women. When describing the lyrics for his songs using Hatsune Miku as the vocalist, Ryo felt that writing without hesitation based on his initial ideas with minimal editing was best, because the singer, as a computer program, would not feel embarrassed about singing the lyrics. He admitted that his friends <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> when he played the songs, but he thought that [...] "if a 16-year-old girl {{is supposed to be}} singing...it is best if she sings about romance." [...] When writing lyrics for human singers, Ryo takes more care in writing lyrics that singers would not be embarrassed to sing. When Ryo receives an offer to compose theme music, he writes lyrics that tie in with the theme and mood of the given work, such as the ending themes [...] "Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari" [...] for the anime Bakemonogatari, and [...] "Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni" [...] for the visual novel Mahōtsukai no Yoru.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} shot in April 1995 and {{directed}} by Michael Lessac. Although set in Cleveland, the show was actually filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. Helford had noticed that the cast {{did not look at}} each other while saying their lines and he tried to encourage them to look at one another, so they <b>would</b> <b>laugh.</b> Helford told Lessac to bring the cast in on a weekend, where there was no pressure, so they could [...] "goof around" [...] and relax. Drew's job required him to work from a cubicle and Helford stated that no one had really done a show dealing with that situation, as producers and networks felt it was too confined. Helford disagreed and had a set where an accessible cubicle was the centerpiece designed and built. The Memphis Plaza Lounge in Old Brooklyn was the inspiration for the show's bar The Warsaw Tavern. The owner of the Lounge refused to sell the naming rights to Warner Bros, but he did agree that they could film the front of the building. The crew shot the building in 1995 and temporarily replaced The Memphis Plaza Lounge sign with their own Warsaw Tavern one. The sign was hung in the front window for two years before Warner Bros. took it down.|$|E
500|$|Using a large cast of characters—a wide {{assortment}} of personalities and cultures—allows Lat {{to comment on}} {{a wider range of}} topics than is possible {{with a small group of}} characters. [...] Malaysian comics scholar Muliyadi Muhamood commented that the humour in Lat's cartoons is evoked through graphical and textual means; [...] "short, compact dialogues" [...] and puns form the text while [...] "facial expressions and actions" [...] of the characters help to bring out the funny side of things. [...] Muliyadi further stated that Lat's works offer many levels of interpretation; one reader <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> at Lat's cartoon for its slapstick, while another would find the same work hilarious for its subtle critique of society. [...] As an example, Muliyadi referred to a Keluarga Si Mamat strip published in 1972. [...] Malaysia was facing a shortage of qualified physical education teachers then, and such duties were often placed on the shoulders of teachers of other faculties. [...] Lat illustrated an obese teacher who conducted a physical education session to his eventual collapse. [...] Muliyadi suggested that the cartoon could be interpreted as a simple tease of the teacher's plight, a suggestion to examine the curriculum taught (change physical education to an informal session), a remark on the shortage of teachers, or more extremely, a criticism of the government's failure to prevent the situation from happening.|$|E
60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. That {{is where}} you are wrong, my child. If those two loathsome things had been rag dolls, {{they would have been}} amusing and lovable. The Newly Born here would have played with them; and you <b>would</b> all have <b>laughed</b> and played with them too until you had torn them to pieces; and then you <b>would</b> have <b>laughed</b> more than ever.|$|R

60|$|Some {{men would}} have slapped {{him on the}} back, and pledged him in a bumper of the currant wine, {{though it had been}} the sharpest vinegar--aye, and liked its flavour too; some would have seized him by his honest hand, and thanked him for the lesson that his simple nature taught them. Some <b>would</b> have <b>laughed</b> with, and others <b>would</b> have <b>laughed</b> at him; of which last class was Martin Chuzzlewit, who, unable to {{restrain}} himself, at last laughed loud and long.|$|R

2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} A Chef's Tale, Pierre Franey relates how when Voronoff dined at Le Pavillon in the 1940s, waiters would remark how [...] "he {{looked like a}} monkey himself, with his exceptionally long fingers and slouching walk. They <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> {{at him in the}} kitchen and imitate his walk for those of us (in the kitchen) who couldn't witness it ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|This episode {{contains}} the first Seinfeld reference to Superman, {{which would be}} a recurring feature in later episodes in the series. An earlier draft of the episode featured Jerry arguing that in a nuclear holocaust, when everyone is very depressed, Superman could cheer everyone up with his [...] "super humor". George responded by saying that no-one <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> because they would blame Superman for not stopping the holocaust in the first place.|$|E

2500|$|On March 16, 2011, {{discussing}} the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, Coulter, citing research into radiation hormesis, wrote {{that there was}} [...] "burgeoning evidence that excess radiation operates {{as a sort of}} cancer vaccine." [...] Her comments were criticized by figures across the political spectrum, from Fox News' Bill O'Reilly (who told Coulter, [...] "You have to be responsible ... in something like this, you gotta get the folks out of there, and you have to report worst-case scenarios") to MSNBC's Ed Schulz (who stated that [...] "You <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> at her if she wasn't making light of a terrible tragedy.") ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{there were}} several sounds that Genie did not use as initial or final consonants. In particular, before 1973 Genie frequently, but not always, deleted final consonants without any {{discernible}} pattern. Researchers suspected this was the reason Genie did not usually use plural forms, possessive markers, and past tense or third person singular conjugations. If someone imitated her deletion of a final consonant she <b>would</b> <b>laugh,</b> reply, [...] "Silly", gesture, and then repeat her utterance with both the final consonant and any other sounds she had initially deleted, causing Curtiss to speculate that Genie simply was {{not paying attention to}} how her speech sounded.|$|E
2500|$|Radner battled bulimia {{while on}} the show. She had a {{relationship}} with SNL castmate Bill Murray, with whom she worked at the National Lampoon, and that ended badly. Few details of their relationship or its end were made public. In It's Always Something, this is the one reference Radner made to Murray in the entire book: [...] "All the guys [...] liked to have me around because I <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> at them till I peed in my pants and tears rolled out of my eyes. We worked together {{for a couple of years}} creating The National Lampoon Show, writing The National Lampoon Radio Hour, and even working on stuff for the magazine. Bill Murray joined the show and Richard Belzer..." ...|$|E

6000|$|Human justice! What is justice? See {{how it can}} err! Was {{there ever}} such a boundless, {{unlimited}} blunder in the whole annals of penny fiction? Probably not. I remember nothing like it in all the learned pages of the London Journal and the Family Herald. Mrs. Henry Wood and Miss Braddon never dreamed of aught like this. Philippa must be told. It was too good a joke. <b>Would</b> she <b>laugh?</b> <b>Would</b> she be alarmed? ...|$|R
2500|$|Accounts {{from various}} parents and school staffers {{describe}} bullying {{at the school}} as [...] "rampant." [...] Nathan Vanderau, a friend of Klebold, and Alisa Owen, Harris's eighth-grade science partner, reported that Harris and Klebold were constantly picked on. Vanderau noted that a [...] "cup of fecal matter" [...] was thrown at them. [...] "People surrounded them in the commons and squirted ketchup packets all over them, laughing at them, calling them faggots," [...] Brooks Brown says. [...] "That happened while teachers watched. They couldn't fight back. They wore the ketchup all day and went home covered with it." [...] In his book, No Easy Answers: The Truth Behind Death at Columbine, Brown wrote that Harris was born with mild chest indent. This made him reluctant to take his shirt off in gym class, and other students <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> at him.|$|E
2500|$|The judge {{added that}} if the {{offences}} had taken place after the law was changed in 2003, several of the offences of which Clifford was found guilty would have been tried as rape, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. One of Clifford's victims explained to the court that Clifford's assault on her (at age 15) had prevented her from having her first sexual relationship with a partner her own age, while another {{said that in the}} years following the assault she had cried whenever she saw Clifford on television, and had feared that the police <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> at her. Clifford dismissed his victims as [...] "fantasists" [...] and [...] "opportunists". The judge concluded that Clifford had caused an [...] "additional element of trauma" [...] to his victims by his [...] "contemptuous attitude" [...] during the trial.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1996, the Spokane Court of Appeals {{were to come}} to a {{decision}} whether 15-year-old Barry Loukaitis should be tried as an adult or juvenile. On July 2, three members of the Spokane Court of Appeals convinced Judge Evan Sperline to allow court-appointed psychiatrist Joan Petrich to present a testimony based on Loukaitis' mental health. The trial was later moved to Seattle, Washington due to media publicity. Loukaitis had pleaded insanity on all charges against him, and claimed that [...] "mood swings" [...] were the cause of his violent actions. During his trial, Joan Petrich testified that Loukaitis had been experiencing delusional and messianic thoughts before the shooting. She had stated, [...] "He felt like he was God and <b>would</b> <b>laugh</b> to himself. He felt he was superior to other people, and then those feelings were later replaced by hate, disdain, and not measuring up." ...|$|E
