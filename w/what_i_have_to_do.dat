25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E

"Rehearsals sap my pep," [...] Bow {{explained}} in November 1929, {{and from the}} beginning of her career, she relied on immediate direction: [...] "Tell me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and I'll do it." [...] Bow was keen on poetry and music, but according to Rogers St. Johns, her attention span did not allow her to appreciate novels. Bow's focal point was the scene, and her creativity made directors call in extra cameras to cover her spontaneous actions, rather than holding her down.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Sir,' {{said the}} little man, rising, 'I wish <b>to</b> address <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{say to you}} and not to our worthy {{chairman}}, because our worthy chairman is in some measure--I may say in a great degree--the subject of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say, or <b>I</b> may say to--to--' 'State,' suggested Mr. Jingle.|$|R
60|$|GUNNER. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>to</b> say to it! Well, I call it scandalous: thats <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{close the}} door," [...] said Regina maliciously. [...] "Everybody {{in the house}} is welcome <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Bishop of Sion {{could not}} have made truth clearer to the sinner than yourself, Signor Sigismondo! Your manner leads me to ask <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} sure <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to-morrow," [...] she answered, [...] "but I think that I would rather that you came here. We'll meet sometime, anyhow. Good-bye!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It really MUST be true,' thought Petru. 'Now I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I {{shall have}} to go on putting that question, and getting boxes on the ear, till both eyes laugh together.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you want}} <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say to Mr. Deronda?" [...] said Gwendolen, whose own pride {{required}} her {{to account for}} her conduct.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Deerslayer," [...] Judith continued, [...] "you see <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lighted the lamp, {{and put it}} in {{the cabin}} of the Ark. That is never done with us, unless on great occasions, and I {{consider}} this night as the most important of my life. Will you follow me and see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> show you--hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
60|$|POTHINUS. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say is {{for your}} ear, not for the Queen's.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{to see me}} then, so soon as <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> permits," [...] said I; and the {{remembrance of}} Alan rolling in again upon my mind, I made haste to say farewell.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{and must}} do; God knows its throuble enough. Do {{you go and}} do the same; even that, bad as it is, is better than amusing my sister by {{laughing}} at me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! what {{a dreadful}} business. That is what comes of taking to magic. Well, Nombe, I am afraid I {{have nothing to}} suggest, nor, {{to tell you the}} truth, can I see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the matter." ...|$|E
60|$|McCOMAS (nettled). I {{hope you}} intend <b>to</b> take <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say seriously.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Tenbruggen waited <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say, scornfully insensible to Miss Jillgall's well-meant interruption.|$|R
60|$|The child {{being the}} child of a man like you, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say will lie in small compass.|$|R
6000|$|Grant made {{a little}} gesture. [...] "I don't think I have quite {{deserved}} that, sir. I owe you a good deal, and it makes <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> harder still. Can't you remember {{that there was a}} time when you were kind to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{much care}} and anxiety. The visitation has done its worst in our house. We have {{got into the}} lull after the storm, and you need not be anxious about me. There is peace in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now. It is {{gathering}} the salvage after the wreck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not a bit. It {{would not}} have suited <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in town. I cannot tell you why. The affair is complex. I have to settle it, if I can, so that neither Logan nor any one else--except the body-snatcher and polite letter-writer--shall ever know how I managed it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who was it? Why that jealous jade, Rebecca Taylforth, of course, {{who must}} have read my note and {{come out in the}} other's cloak and hat <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say to her. The cursed fool!" ...|$|R
60|$|The singing went on upstairs. Major Fitz-David still waited impenetrably <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say--to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{resolved}} {{on doing}} next.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say, stumblingly and badly, and baldly. But I am sick of {{tearing up}} letters and hopeless of getting <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say better said. It {{would be easy}} {{enough for me to}} write an eloquent letter about {{something}} else. Only I do not care to write about anything else. Let me put the main question to you now that I could not put the other afternoon. Will you marry me, Ann Veronica? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What can she do, puir thing?" [...] {{said the}} dame. [...] "She maun keep {{the company that}} her brother keeps, for she is clearly dependent.--But, {{speaking}} of that, I ken <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and that is no little, before it darkens.

6000|$|Alton {{glanced at}} him a moment, and then laughed a little. [...] "I suppose you can't help being foolish, Charley, but you should know I've no time to think of {{anything}} beyond <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> just now," [...] he said.

6000|$|... "My dear Bullen, you {{may argue}} forever, {{but if you}} think that you can {{transform}} me into a bustling, hustling fellow like yourself, I can tell you that you are mistaken.

6000|$|... "Ten minutes will {{perhaps be}} {{sufficient}} for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] the other promised. [...] "You don't know me, then, Mr. Ware?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{father is}} very weak and low, but not worse, I hope, than might be expected. I am {{going home to}} dine with the children.

6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{make any}} about that, for {{it would come}} natural to me; and I'd a deal sooner be doing that, than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to-morrow night.
