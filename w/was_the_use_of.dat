5|$|A key {{ingredient}} to the Hammond organ's success <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> dealerships {{and a sense}} of community. Several dedicated organ dealers set up business in the United States and there was a bi-monthly newsletter, The Hammond Times, mailed out to subscribers. Advertisements tended to show families gathered around the instrument, often with a child playing it, as an attempt to show the organ as a center-point of home life and to encourage children to learn music.|$|E
5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> detached towers, called Albarrana towers, {{around the perimeter}} {{as can be seen}} at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} benefit of Operation Dragoon <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the port facilities in Southern France, especially the large ports at Marseille and Toulon. After Operation Cobra and Operation Dragoon, the Allied advance slowed {{almost to a}} halt in September due to a critical lack of supplies. The ports were quickly brought back into service, together with the railroad system in Southern France. Thereafter, large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease the supply situation. In October, 524,894 tons of supplies were unloaded, which was more than one third of the Allied cargo shipped to the Western front.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|Another idea <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> split screens, {{which was}} {{born out of}} the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{have been}} useful for retrospective studies. Bird collections offer {{the potential for}} current and future researchers to make in-depth morphological and molecular study of past avian diversity. One of the earliest and most famous examples of this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> egg collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries in determining that the pesticide DDT was producing eggshell-thinning in raptors. The ornithologists who collected the eggs could never have known that their work would one day help establish causes for declines and help in making conservation strategies to save bird such as peregrine falcons from possible extinction.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of}} which each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily life <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting {{without having to}} lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined {{with the creation of}} the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.|$|E

5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} of Kanye West's planned four education-themed studio albums. Following the major success of The College Dropout, the album reveals his {{progression}} in writing lyrics and an incorporation of {{a wider range of}} musical styles. At the time, the focal point of West's production style <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, {{due in part to the}} acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E

Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or {{as an expression of}} masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, {{one of which}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork {{of the car to}} replace conventional water and oil radiators. This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car’s race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.|$|E
5|$|The Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) {{was from}} a British point of view a {{preemptive}} attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population in order to seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet. But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} version to {{incorporate}} changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, {{which was designed}} to run on 100 octane fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger. The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.|$|E
5|$|The main {{flaw in the}} Japanese plans <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> midget {{submarines}} for {{the primary}} attack. Midget submarines were originally intended to operate during fleet actions: they would be released from modified seaplane carriers to run amok through the enemy fleet. This concept went out of favour as changing Japanese naval thinking and experience led to recognition that naval warfare would centre around carrier-supported aerial combat. As a result, the midget program's focus changed to the infiltration of enemy harbours, where they would attack vessels at anchor. This concept failed completely during the attack on Pearl Harbor, where the midgets had no effect, and tying up 11 large submarines for six weeks in support of further midget submarine attacks on Sydney and Diego Suarez proved a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|The non-redox {{roles of}} NAD(P) are a recent discovery. The {{first of these}} {{functions}} to be identified <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> NAD as the ADP-ribose donor in ADP-ribosylation reactions, observed in the early 1960s. Later studies in the 1980s and 1990s revealed the activities of NAD and NADP metabolites in cell signaling– such as the action of cyclic ADP-ribose, which was discovered in 1987. The metabolism of NAD has remained an area of intense research into the 21st century, with interest being heightened after {{the discovery of the}} NAD-dependent protein deacetylases called sirtuins in 2000, by Shin-ichiro Imai and coworkers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|$|E
