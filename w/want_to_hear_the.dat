500|$|The {{movie and}} Close were praised by The New York Times: [...] "Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that {{a touch of}} desperation lies in Nellie's cockeyed optimism." [...] The review also commented that the movie [...] "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" [...] and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't ever want to put this disaster in your player, unless you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sound of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close {{is up to the}} material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. [...] A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent." ...|$|E

500|$|Amidst these drastic changes, large {{proportions}} of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, {{the quality of the}} music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, [...] "The director doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas band, he wants to hear the Aggie Band." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{said that the}} song was [...] "Perfectly acceptable, though {{not in the same}} class as 'Who's That Girl'." [...] Christian Wright from Spin called the song celebratory. Camille Paglia, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that Madonna's command of massive, resonant basslines impressed her. She wrote: [...] "I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's 'Causing a Commotion', which opened her dreadful movie Who's That Girl. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> essence of modernity, listen to those chords, infernal, apocalyptic, and grossly sensual. This is the authentic voice of fin de siècle." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] and [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] were not among Madonna's best singles.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Angels Cry" [...] {{is about}} {{maintaining}} {{hope that a}} fading relationship can be salvaged because true love only happens once. Carey sings [...] "I’m willing to live and die for our love/Baby {{we can get back}} that shine." [...] However, the lyrics [...] "Super natural love conquers all" [...] could also be interpreted as feeling God's love. Adam Holz of Plugged In thought that the lyrics were [...] "depressing," [...] while Lauren Murphy of Entertainment IE felt that the lyrics [...] "When you and I say goodbye, I felt the angels cry" [...] were too sentimental. Although Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times thought that the song had a [...] "sad" [...] tone, she praised its production. Bill Lamb of About.com placed [...] "Angels Cry" [...] in his list of the album's best tracks. Michael Cragg of musicOMH was critical of the song, writing that it is a [...] "limp ballad" [...] which he thought was trying too hard at recreating some of Carey's previous material, and concluded by writing that it [...] "ultimately ends up making you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> original version more than anything". A reviewer for DJ Booth commented that the song sounded as thought it could have been released in 1994.|$|E

500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A lot of people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on October 17, 1984 by Jive Records. The group had a developed a large following in Britain and Europe prior {{to the release of}} Escape, although success in the United States had initially been limited. [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] and [...] "Freaks Come Out at Night" [...] became their first legitimate hits in their home country. According to the New York Times, these could be [...] "heard almost constantly in New York dance clubs, as well as on local urban-contemporary radio stations." [...] Ecstasy said that audiences were finally ready for hip-hop music, and Whodini were [...] "just beginning to break through on radio. Rather than listening to Stevie Wonder or someone do an inferior version of rap, people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> real thing, with the original complexity to it. This is the most complex, interesting stuff going on in black music today, and the radio's just beginning to discover that the public eats it up." [...] By December 1984, the 7- and 12-inch singles [...] "Friends" [...] and [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] were approaching sales of 350,000, and received more airplay than the [...] "Magic's Wand" [...] and [...] "Haunted House of Rock" [...] from Whodini's first album. Billboard reported the airplay, noting that despite the increased play, the songs were unreported and often played during the night. The month before Escape release, Whodini appeared at the 1984 Swatch Watch New York City Fresh Fest as part of the first national tour featuring hip-hop groups. The 27-date tour featured Run–D.M.C., Kurtis Blow, The Fat Boys and Newcleus, and grossed $3.5 million.|$|E

2500|$|The {{omission}} of commonly played {{songs such as}} [...] "Run to the Hills" [...] and [...] "The Trooper" [...] from the 2010 setlist led to some criticism, with the Calgary Herald suggesting that [...] "...striking a more even balance between that new material and the unsinkable, ironclad battleships of yesteryear, would have made an incredibly satisfying show that much greater". Speaking in defence of the band's choice of setlist, Mike Portnoy (then of Dream Theater) said: [...] "I can understand that fans <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> hits, but I can understand that Maiden don't want to be stuck playing the same songs {{for the rest of}} their lives. They put out new music so they want to play the new music." [...] Interviewed for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 14 July, Janick Gers responded to criticism of the setlist: ...|$|E
2500|$|Delysia {{returned}} to musical comedy in 1932 in the London production of The Cat and the Fiddle, by Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach, presented by Cochran at the Palace Theatre. Her co-stars were Peggy Wood and Francis Lederer. What Pimlott Baker calls her last big London success was in 1933, in Mother of Pearl, presented by Cochran at the Gaiety Theatre. It was adapted for the English stage {{as a vehicle}} for Delysia by A. P. Herbert from Oscar Straus and Alfred Grünwald's 1932 operetta, Eine Frau, die weiß, was sie will. Delysia played Josephine Pavani, an ageing actress who loses her lover to her daughter, Pearl, and who later manoeuvres to save Pearl from an unwelcome suitor. Delysia's song [...] "Every woman thinks she wants to wander'" [...] was a big hit. The Times commented, [...] "How refreshing in a musical piece to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> author's words! How delightful, when Mme. Delysia is singing, to hear them!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Brannigan {{was born}} in Annitsford, near Newcastle, Northumberland, {{the son of the}} local church organist (of Irish descent), in whose choir he sang as a boy. In 1929, he moved south to look for work. He worked as a joiner in Slough, and in his spare time he {{appeared}} with the Windsor Operatic Society. In 1934 he enrolled as a night student at the Guildhall School of Music while working days as a government clerk, and in 1938 was appointed as a bass singer at Westminster Cathedral. After a Guildhall performance of Ruddigore, by Gilbert and Sullivan, in which he played a member of the chorus of ghosts depicted in a picture gallery, he was singled out by Sir Landon Ronald: [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> third portrait from the left", and was offered a scholarship to continue his studies full-time. He later earned positive reviews for his performance in a student production of La Vie parisienne, by Jacques Offenbach, in 1939. He won the Guildhall's Gold Medal in 1942.|$|E
2500|$|As {{shown in}} the first legs of the tour, the first four songs are always the same. The concert begins with footage of Brooks' {{silhouette}} while singing the opening lines to [...] "Man Against Machine". He then appears via elevator through {{the floor of the}} stage, pauses, and [...] The bridge and final chorus are omitted and it transitions to [...] "Rodeo", followed by [...] "Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House", and [...] "The Beaches of Cheyenne". Next, depending on the venue, other songs such as [...] "The River", [...] "Two Pina Coladas", [...] "Papa Loved Mama", and [...] "Ain't Goin' Down ('Til the Sun Comes Up)". [...] "Unanswered Prayers" [...] follows, with the audience singing the entire song with little accompaniment from Brooks. Additional songs, including [...] "That Summer", [...] "The Thunder Rolls", and [...] "We Shall Be Free" [...] may follow. Excluding the opening, Brooks only performs one song from Man Against Machine, his new album (either [...] "People Loving People" [...] or [...] "All American Kid"; occasionally [...] "Mom"). When questioned on his lack of new songs in the setlist, he remarked, [...] "I'm just like you... I see the guys I like and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> old stuff." ...|$|E
