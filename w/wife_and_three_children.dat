5|$|Hancock {{retired from}} the Air Force in May 1965 after {{completing}} his term as CAS, which the government had extended for twelve months beyond its original three years. Having followed two fellow Royal Military College graduates—McCauley and Scherger—in the role, he was succeeded by another former Duntroon cadet, Alister Murdoch. Hancock's name was put forward as a successor to Scherger when the latter's term as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee completed in May 1966, but Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies preferred General Sir John Wilton for the position. Later the same year, Hancock took over as Commissioner-General for Australia at Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, following {{the sudden death of}} the previous appointee, Vice Admiral Sir Hastings Harrington. In 1975, prompted in part by the fall of Saigon in April that year, Hancock co-founded the Australia Defence Association as an independent think tank for defence matters, and chaired its Western Australian chapter. He was also active in the Royal Commonwealth Society, and published an autobiography, Challenge, in 1990. Hancock continued to fly in retirement, joining his cousin Lang, also a pilot, in promoting the Pilbara mining district. Val Hancock died in Perth on 29September 1998, and was survived by his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>children.</b> He is commemorated by Sir Valston Hancock Drive at Evans Head.|$|E
5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Okello had given orders to kill no whites, the Americans living in Stone Town {{fled to the}} English Club, where the point for {{evacuation}} was. Those travelling in the car convoy to the English Club were shocked to see the battered bodies of Arab men lying {{out on the streets}} of Stone Town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths. As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed with knives, spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find. The American diplomat Don Petterson described his horror as he watched from his house as he saw a gang of African men storm the house of an Arab, behead him in public with a panga, followed by screams from within his house as his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>children</b> were raped and killed, followed by the same scene being repeated at the next house of an Arab, followed by yet another and another. After taking control of Stone Town on the first day, the revolutionaries continued to fight the Manga for control of the countryside for least two days afterwards with whole families of Arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} poisonings resulting in death from {{the consumption of}} A.bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>children</b> consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning {{is characterized by the}} following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (blood clotting disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E
