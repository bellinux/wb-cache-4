5|$|The {{ceremony}} {{was preceded by}} a week of oral catechism and several days of fasting. The actual ceremony involved pouring <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> segregated groups of men and women, although {{it is possible that}} their heads were immersed instead, and anointed with the chrism.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring boiling <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> grave {{or complete}} incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire {{could also be}} killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|The god Vishnu and his consorts Lakshmi and Bhudevi {{should be}} {{represented}} as taking {{the place of}} Parvati's parents in the ceremony. The four-armed Vishnu should be shown in the background in between Shiva and Parvati; {{in one of his}} front hands is a golden pot from which he pours <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> hands of the couple, symbolizing giving away the bride to the groom. He holds his usual attributes, the sudarshana chakra (discus) and a shankha (conch), in his back arms. Vishnu's wives, dressed in royal finery, stand behind Parvati and hold her waist, symbolizing the handing over.|$|E

5|$|The ship's crew {{consisted}} of ten officers and 122 enlisted men. She carried {{a number of}} smaller boats, including two pinnaces, two cutters, and one dinghy. Arminius was not a particularly successful design; she suffered from severe, fast rolling, especially in heavier seas. She also shipped {{a great deal of}} <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bow and was unbalanced in steering. The ship turned rapidly to starboard but was sluggish in turning to port. Indeed, the ship was required to have the rudder at 15degrees to port in order to remain on a straight course. It was also impossible to control the ship with only sail power.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{geologic}} {{forms on}} the planet to suggest the presence of <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past billion years. However, {{there is no reason}} to suppose that Venus was an exception to the processes that formed Earth and gave it its water during its early history, possibly from the original rocks that formed the planet or later on from comets. The common view among research scientists is that water would have existed for about 600million years on the surface before evaporating, though some such as David Grinspoon believe that up to 2billion years could also be plausible.|$|E
5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they eat, {{and are able to}} survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E

5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly {{disguised}} as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of three hours. Adams never revealed whether {{he went to the}} wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the people had to defend their constitutional rights.|$|E

25|$|The scallop {{shell is}} also an allusion to the Sacrament of Holy Baptism.

Guests then walk under fountains which spray streams of <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> guest's heads.|$|E

25|$|The {{laminar flow}} of polymer {{solutions}} is exploited by {{animals such as}} fish and dolphins, who exude viscous solutions from their skin to aid flow over their bodies while swimming.

25|$|There are no {{reliable}} data on actual {{investments in the}} sector. It has been estimated in 2006 that the water sector requires annual public investments of US$82 million to reach the MDGs, compared to US$67 million annually that have been “planned”. According to the World Bank, in 2007 Mozambique’s delegated private sector management approach has attracted about US$350 million to urban <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> previous six years.|$|E
25|$|Open- or substrate-brooding {{cichlids}} {{lay their}} eggs in the open, on rocks, leaves, or logs. Examples of open-brooding cichlids include Pterophyllum and Symphysodon species and Anomalochromis thomasi. Male and female parents usually engage in differing brooding roles. Most commonly, the male patrols the pair's territory and repels intruders, while the female fans <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> eggs, removing the infertile and leading the fry while foraging. However, both sexes are able to perform {{the full range of}} parenting behaviours.|$|E

25|$|When {{the bow of}} Haudaudine {{collided}} with the coral reef, the ship swerved around and her stern hit the reef several times, flooding the aft compartments. Within three hours the stern had settled down and the captain gave an order to abandon ship for the crew of 25 and three passengers. After the lifeboats had been launched, Haudaudine heeled to port, capsized and sank on the reef with seven feet of <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> starboard side. The lifeboats reached Port Moneo and Bourail in the following morning.|$|E
25|$|The cadaver dogs {{searched the}} woods around Vortex Spring without success. Assisted by helicopters, they searched the swamps along the spring's outflow into Blue Creek and Sandy Creek to the Choctawhatchee River. Thirty {{separate}} {{tests of the}} <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next several months {{showed no sign of}} an increase in the bacteria that would indicate the presence of a decomposing human body. Taran, who said he had let Ben into the cave despite knowing he lacked certification to dive in it, passed a lie detector test of his account.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} aspect of project design {{is likely to be}} managing the logistics of operating from a boat and of managing diving operations. The depth of <b>water</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the Mary Rose have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.|$|E
