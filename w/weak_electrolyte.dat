50|$|Two cases {{should be}} distinguished: strong <b>electrolytes</b> and <b>weak</b> <b>electrolytes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Weak electrolytes. A <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> is {{one that}} is not fully dissociated. As such it has a {{dissociation}} constant.

50|$|An {{electrolyte}} {{refers to}} a substance that contains free ions {{and can be used}} as an electrically conductive medium. Most of the solute does not dissociate in a <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> whereas in a strong electrolyte a higher ratio of solute dissociates to form free ions.|$|E
50|$|Typical weak {{electrolytes}} {{are weak}} acids and weak bases.

50|$|For strong electrolytes, {{a single}} {{reaction}} arrow {{shows that the}} reaction occurs completely in one direction, {{in contrast to the}} dissociation of <b>weak</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> which both ionize and re-bond in significant quantities.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{degree of}} {{dissociation}} of a <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> {{is proportional to the}} inverse square root of the concentration, or the square root of the dilution.

50|$|Ostwald's law of dilution, {{which gives}} the {{dissociation}} constant of a <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> {{as a function of}} concentration, can be written in terms of molar conductivity.

50|$|A strong {{electrolyte}} is a solute {{that exists in}} solution completely or nearly completely as ions. Again, the strength of an electrolyte {{is defined as the}} percentage of solute that is ions, rather than molecules. The higher the percentage, the stronger the electrolyte. Thus, even if a substance is not very soluble, but does dissociate completely into ions, the substance is defined as a {{strong electrolyte}}. Similar logic applies to a <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> Strong acids and bases are good examples such as HCl, and H2SO4. These will all exist as ions in an aqueous medium.|$|E
50|$|The common ion {{effect is}} {{responsible}} for the reduction in the solubility of an ionic precipitate when a soluble compound containing one of the ions of the precipitate is added to the solution in equilibrium with the precipitate. It states that if the concentration of any one of the ions is increased, then, according to Le Chatelier's principle, some of the ions in excess should be removed from solution, by combining with the oppositely charged ions. Some of the salt will be precipitated until the ion product is equal to the solubility product. In short, the common ion effect is the suppression of the degree of dissociation of a <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> containing a common ion.|$|E

A uniform set of permeability data including both weak acids and weak bases was obtained only when it was assumed that the pH in the surface fluid layer was equal to that in the bulk phase, and it was concluded that these studies do not support the concept of a microclimate of distinctive pH at the epithelial surface as a determinant of <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> transport...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} ion {{substitution}} and inhibitors on {{the transport of}} two representative weak electrolytes, benzoic acid and amphetamine, across short-circuited rat jejunum in vitro have been studied. The spontaneous asymmetries in the transport of the weak electrolytes were not dependent {{on the presence of}} either bicarbonate or chloride in the incubation medium. Net transport of the weak electrolytes was abolished when choline was substituted for sodium in the fluid bathing the mucosal surface of the tissue, but <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> transport was independent of the presence of sodium on the serosal side. <b>Weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> transport was inhibited by ouabain and by orthovanadate.

40|$|A new frontal electroelution {{approach}} {{that can be}} used for the preconcentration of amino acids in in-line solid-phase extraction–capillary electrophoresis (SPE–CE) has been developed. A single capillary was employed featuring a short monolithic SPE column created inside the capillary via photo-initiated, free-radical polymerisation of 3 -sulfopropyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate monomers. A <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> of dilute H 2 SO 4, pH 2. 9, was found to promote adsorption of the amino acids onto the SPE column. Elution of the amino acids was achieved using a dual solvation/ion-exchange transient boundary mobilised via EOF by using a strong electrolyte containing 62. 5 mM ethylenediamine, pH 2. 9 with H 2 SO 4 and 40 % (v/v) acetonitrile. Using these two electrolytes, tryptophan was adsorbed onto the SPE column in <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> and eluted via a frontal electroelution mechanism in the strong electrolyte. Injections up to 20 min, corresponding to over 14 column volumes (or 1400 % of the capillary volume) of sample provided quantitative extraction of tryptophan from the <b>weak</b> <b>electrolyte</b> and were eluted without any loss in efficiency.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>weak</b> and strong <b>electrolytes</b> on the enzymatic {{activity}} of Candida rugosa lipase are explored. <b>Weak</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> used as buffers, set the pH, while strong electrolytes regulate the ionic strength. The interplay between pH and ionic strength has been {{assumed to be}} the determinant of enzymatic activity. In experiments that probe activities by varying these parameters, {{there has been little}} attention focused on the role of specific electrolyte effects. Here we show that both buffers and the choice of background electrolyte ion strongly affect the enzymatic activity of Candida rugosa lipase. The effects here shown are dramatic at high salt concentration; indeed, a 2 M concentration of NaSCN is able to fully inactivate the lipase. By contrast, Na 2 SO 4 acts generally as an activator, whereas NaCl shows a quasi-neutral behavior. Such specific ion effects are well-known and are classified among the “Hofmeister effects”. However, there has been little awareness of them, or of their potential for optimization of activities in the enzyme community. Rather than the effects per se, the focus here is on their origin. New insights into mechanism are proposed. ...|$|R
