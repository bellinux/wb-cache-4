25|$|As a {{teenager}} and an army cadet, Gordon {{was known for his}} high spirits, a combative streak and tendency to disregard authority and the rules if he felt them to be stupid or unjust, a personality trait that held back his graduation by two years <b>when</b> <b>teachers</b> decided to punish him for flouting the rules.|$|E
25|$|Improvement {{in writing}} {{can also be}} seen <b>when</b> <b>teachers</b> {{implement}} a guided writing aspect to their literacy based lessons. Gibson notes that providing immediate instructional scaffolding to specific groups of students increases performance.

Regardless of subject matter, students who are taught and then grouped according to need and re-taught based on their needs commonly show improvement.|$|E

30|$|Another example {{within the}} {{behavior}} management dimension is teacher’s proactivity. A low score in proactivity is assigned <b>when</b> the <b>teacher</b> is reactive and monitoring is absent or ineffective.

25|$|All {{examination}} scripts {{are shipped}} to the Ministry of Education for processing, which then sends them to other teachers in Singapore on a random basis for marking. Part of this procedure is to prevent possible bias in marking, either intentional or unintentional, that may result <b>when</b> <b>teachers</b> mark examination scripts of students from their own schools. Also, {{the names of the}} students are not attached to the scripts when the scripts are sent for marking, the scripts are labelled by the student's PSLE index number. The multiple choice questions are graded by a machine in the Ministry of Education, which reads the optical answer sheets.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory, in an {{academic}} environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students {{must be able to}} look at a word, form an image of that word in their minds and be able to recall the appearance of the word later. <b>When</b> <b>teachers</b> introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E

25|$|In the US, Latino/as who {{identify}} as LGBTQ face scrutiny {{not just from}} their community at home but within their community at school as well, especially within a {{high school or college}} preparation experience. While facing scrutiny by family and community to maintain gender normality in order to prosper in the US, they also must face scrutiny from their fellow peers, mentors and administration in the educational environment. One such scrutiny that they face is a lack of acceptance and recognition as a separate educational entity within sexual educational programs, provided by many high school education districts. Lesson plans that are developed for the high school learning environment put emphasis on Heteronormativity of the and Latino students. Latinas are viewed as needing to have less interest in sexual education, while Latinos were told to maintain focus and to take the education seriously. <b>When</b> <b>teachers</b> are prompted to explain more about sexual education for lesbians or gays, the teachers or educators assume the student body to be heterosexual and refuse or regard the questions as immature and outside the scope of their teaching.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Rouse {{sold his}} {{interest}} in One Liberty Place to Japanese insurance company Chyoda. Also, in 1995, {{the owners of the}} Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which included Rouse, defaulted on its US$64 million loan. After a sheriff's auction on December 4 of that year, the creditor, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, took ownership of the property. The hotel again changed ownership in 1996 <b>when</b> <b>Teachers</b> Insurance and Annuity Association agreed to sell all its hotel properties to Starwood Lodging Trust. In 1999 One Liberty Place, Two Liberty Place, and the Shops of Liberty Place were put up for sale. At the time, One Liberty Place was owned by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and Chyoda. Two Liberty Place was owned by a partnership led by Willard Rouse called 1650 Market Associates and the Shops of Liberty Place was owned jointly by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and 1650 Market Associates. One Liberty Place and the Shops at Liberty Place were sold later that year to Sunbelt Management a Palm Beach Gardens, Florida firm owned by German businessman Hugo Mann. Sunbelt acquired the property for a bargain price of US$250 million. The bargain price was a result of One Liberty Place being 99.9 percent leased {{at the time of the}} sale and the majority of long-term leases signed when the real estate market was depressed. Rents for One Liberty Place were around US$10 lower than competing office buildings. Two Liberty Place was struggling to find a buyer because it was uncertain Cigna would renew its lease which would expire in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Standardized {{testing is}} a very common way of {{determining}} a student's past academic achievement and future potential. [...] However, high-stakes tests (whether standardized or non-standardized) can cause anxiety. [...] <b>When</b> <b>teachers</b> or schools are rewarded for better performance on tests, then those rewards encourage teachers to [...] "teach to the test" [...] instead of providing a rich and broad curriculum. In 2007 a qualitative study done by Au Wayne demonstrated that standardized testing narrows the curriculum and encourages teacher-centered instruction. As a result, standardized testing has become controversial in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools (1992), the U.S. Supreme Court {{held that}} private {{citizens}} could collect damage awards <b>when</b> <b>teachers</b> sexually harassed their students. In Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser (1986) the courts ruled that schools {{have the power}} to discipline students if they use [...] "obscene, profane language or gestures" [...] which could be viewed as substantially interfering with the educational process, and inconsistent with the [...] "fundamental values of public school education." [...] Under regulations issued in 1997 by the U.S. Department of Education, which administers Title IX, school districts should be held responsible for harassment by educators if the harasser [...] "was aided in carrying out the sexual harassment of students by his or her position of authority with the institution." [...] In Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, and Murrell v. School Dist. No. 1, 1999, schools were assigned liability for peer-to-peer sexual harassment if the plaintiff sufficiently demonstrated that the administration's response shows [...] "deliberate indifference" [...] to [...] "actual knowledge" [...] of discrimination.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{correlational}} study, Katz and Shahar used {{a series}} of questionnaires and Likert-style scales and gave them to 100 teachers to see what makes a motivating teacher. Their results indicate that teachers who are intrinsically motivated to teach and believe that students should be taught in an autonomous style are the types of teachers that promote intrinsic motivation in the classroom [...] Deci, Sheinman, and Nezlek also found that <b>when</b> <b>teachers</b> adapted to an autonomous teaching style, students were positively affected and became more intrinsically motivated to achieve in the classroom. [...] However, while the students were quick {{to adapt to the}} new teaching style the impact was short-lived [...] Thus, teachers are limited in the way they teach because they’ll feel a pressure to act, teach, and provide feedback in a certain way from the school district, administration, and guardians , [...] Furthermore, even if students do have a teacher that promotes an autonomous teaching style, their overall school environment is also a factor because it can be extrinsically motivating. Examples of this would be posters around school promoting pizza parties for highest grade point average or longer recess times for the classroom that brings more canned food donations.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a case study}} that explored relationships {{between theory and practice}} in a teacher candidate's learning to teach. Using a personal, narrative style, it explores one teacher-candidate's reflections about her learning with a Grade 4 student. The study was part of an innovative, inquiry-driven collaboration between school and university, and occurred during a course about teaching language and literacy in the early years (kindergarten to Grade 4) at the University of Manitoba. The student’s comments suggest how the integration of theory and practice can be facilitated <b>when</b> <b>teacher</b> education makes theory explicit, and <b>when</b> a <b>teacher</b> candidate has opportunities to reflect, experiment and dialogue actively about theory in action...|$|R

30|$|Finally, the {{combined}} behavior of disinterest + indiscipline is triggered <b>when</b> the <b>teacher</b> is at {{a short distance}} from the students; when they are not in possession of material; when there are no groupings, i.e. when the activities are performed by students individually; and <b>when</b> the <b>teacher</b> is observing and/or recording the tasks being performed by the students, or joins with them in counting the task scores out loud.|$|R
30|$|It {{has also}} been noted that indiscipline is linked to another {{significant}} group of behaviors.

Furthermore, in relation to the actions of the teacher, we have identified a significant link between indiscipline and circumstances <b>when</b> the <b>teacher</b> does not have eye contact with the students engaging in said behavior, <b>when</b> the <b>teacher</b> is far away from the students, and <b>when</b> the <b>teacher</b> is preparing, collecting or handing out material.|$|R
