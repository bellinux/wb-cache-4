40|$|In {{the article}} {{we present a}} unique {{analytical}} tool for the characterization of conjugated polymers – SEC-DAD (Size Exclusion Chromatography – Diode Array Detector). The chromatographic separation is performed in a conventional SEC mode which provides narrow molecular-weight fractions of the analyzed polymer. The uniqueness of the SEC-DAD combination comes out with the utilization of DAD for the monitoring the absorption characteristics of particular fractions along the molecular <b>weight</b> distribution. <b>If</b> <b>applied</b> in the characterization of the conjugated polymers, SEC-DAD helps to reveal the dependencies of (i) the extent of conjugation and (ii) covalent and configuration structure of the polymer on the molecular weight. © 2016 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R
30|$|<b>If</b> {{different}} <b>weight</b> elicitation {{methods can}} be used within the same modelling framework, the research question arises whether different methods yield significantly (in statistical sense) different results in terms of weights. This in turn would {{have an effect on}} the resulting ranking of the alternatives. This type of investigation is helpful to detect behavioural biases. If we set up an experiment and find that the differences in the results obtained with the different methods are statistically significant, we are in a position to predict how the results are likely to differ using different <b>weighting</b> methods <b>if</b> we <b>apply</b> the multi-criteria analysis to new problems.|$|R
40|$|Thiouracil is a thyrostat {{inhibiting}} {{the thyroid}} function, resulting in fraudulent <b>weight</b> gain <b>if</b> <b>applied</b> in the fattening of livestock. The latter abuse is strictly forbidden and monitored in the European Union. Recently, endogenous sources of thiouracil were identified after frequently monitoring low-level thiouracil positive urine samples and a "recommend concentration" (RC) of 10 ∼g/L was {{suggested by the}} EURL to facilitate decision-making. However, the systematic occurrence of urine samples exceeding the RC led to demands for international surveys defining an epidemiologic threshold. Therefore, six European member states (France, Poland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Norway, and Belgium) have shared their official thiouracil data (2010 - 2012) collected from bovines, porcines, and small livestock with 95 and 99 % percentiles of 8. 1 and 18. 2 ∼g/L for bovines (n = 3894); 7. 4 and 13. 5 ∼g/L for porcines (n = 654); and 7. 4 ∼g/L (95 % only) for small livestock (n = 85), respectively. Bovine percentiles decreased with the animal age (nonadults had significantly higher levels for bovines), and higher levels were observed in male bovines compared to female bovines. </p...|$|R
40|$|In 1943, Miura {{worked on}} the {{nutritional}} study of Japanese navy sailors. From these old data., we picked up the daily requirement of protein from food, especially nitrogen balances. A middle age sailor (34 years old, weighing 60. 5 kg) showed the nitrogen equilibrium of 77 g per day. Two other sailors (20 years and 15 years old) showed positive nitrogen balance; thus we could not get nitrogen balance data. As a simple calculation of nitrogen balance from body weight, there are two methods: The old one is 1. 2 g × body <b>weight</b> (kg). <b>If</b> we <b>applied</b> the old one the nitrogen balance of the sailor is 73 g. As the present Japanese adult has ca. 70 kg of body weight more than 100 g of food protein might not be absorbed from the intestine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{technique}} for estimating the word slant {{that is based on}} analyzing the nonhorizontal parts of the characters. We calculate the orientation, the height of the bounding box that includes all non-horizontal parts as well as their location related to the word. We estimate the non-horizontal parts orientation weighted according to the height of the corresponding bounding box. An additional <b>weight</b> is <b>applied</b> <b>if</b> the fragment is outside of the core-region of the word, which indicates that this fragment {{is probably one of the}} strokes that should be, by definition, vertical to text orientation. Extensive experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method. Keywords- word slant estimation; core-region information; document image pre-processing; I...|$|R
