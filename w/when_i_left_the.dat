500|$|Tom Outridge Sr, {{winner of}} the inaugural Sandover Medal, {{said that one of}} his {{outstanding}} memories was of Harold Oliver, stating that {{when he was a boy}} he was [...] "taken by his father to see Port play at Kalgoorlie in 1913; The memory of Oliver's brilliant game is as vivid in my mind today as it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> ground that day. He was a wonderful player." ...|$|E
500|$|Pound {{arrived in}} Naples in July 1958, {{where he was}} photographed giving a fascist salute to the waiting press. When asked {{when he had been}} {{released}} from the mental hospital, he replied: [...] "I never was. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> hospital I was still in America, and all America is an insane asylum." [...] He and Dorothy went to live with Mary at Castle Brunnenburg, near Merano in the Province of South Tyrol, where he met his grandson, Walter, and his granddaughter, Patrizia, for the first time, then returned to Rapallo, where Olga Rudge was waiting to join them.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Barnet {{was very}} well <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> home,' <b>the</b> other {{answered}} constrainedly, exchanging his meditative regard of the horse for one of self-consciousness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Cheyne. [...] "He {{was coming}} round <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> him. <b>The</b> blow {{might have been}} a {{dangerous}} one; but I had a suspicion he had more than that to contend with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'These foreigners!' he said scornfully. 'Come here, fat man,' {{he called}} to the innkeeper. 'Tell me how Count Girolamo and the gracious Caterina are progressing? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Forli <b>the</b> common people {{struggled}} to lick the ground they trod on.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "My {{fraternity}} {{did something}} for me when I was in school. It helped me {{to learn to live}} with others and to develop my own personal, moral, and social attributes, so that I could fit better into the society which I found <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> University. The services of fraternity supplemented those of my family, my church and my teachers. For this reason I am willing to continue to work for my fraternity -- so long as my fraternity is working to serve its individual members." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror Taylforth commented further on her decision to leave the serial: [...] "I left EastEnders because after 13 years I felt I really needed a break. I wanted {{to do other things}} and I knew I wasn't getting any younger. But throughout everything that has happened in my life I have had tremendous support from the people in EastEnders. I love them so dearly. I still keep in touch with some of them, and my line <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> show was, 'I won't say goodbye, just au revoir', and that is how I feel. It is nice that they have left the door open for Kathy to return." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{in another}} half-hour we shall all know. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> <b>the</b> judge {{was just going}} to sum up.|$|E
60|$|Those words {{instantly}} reminded me, {{not only}} of Doctor Dormann's mysterious suspicions {{at the time of}} the illness, but of Jack's extraordinary question to me, on <b>the</b> morning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Frankfort. <b>The</b> doctor saw that I answered him with some little embarrassment.|$|R
60|$|To be sure, I felt badly {{enough that}} day in October <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> it. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> train <b>left</b> Valleyfield <b>I</b> just cried like a baby.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{perfectly}} you are succeeding! They {{are quite}} new to me, recollect. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Melbourne, <b>the</b> art had hardly risen there above guinea portraits of bearded desperadoes, a nugget {{in one hand}} and a Â£50 note in the other: but this is a new, and what a forward step for science!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Menlove,' {{said the}} lady, 'did you notice if any gentleman {{observed}} and followed me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> hotel {{to go for}} a walk this evening?' ...|$|E
60|$|Down in {{the office}} I {{explained}} the situation to the clerk <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> key, and he promised to attend to matters if anything unusual happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't remember," [...] Dick {{replied with}} an angry flush. [...] "Of course, I see where you're leading, but I was quite sober <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> hall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm doubtful; {{the thing}} would be difficult," [...] Clarke {{answered}} in a significant tone. [...] "He hadn't returned <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> and <b>the</b> country he meant to cross is rugged and covered deep with snow all winter. Food is hard to get and the temperature varies from forty to fifty degrees below." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But I couldn't help that. You {{brought me}} out here, and saved my life. I know what I owe you. Mescal meant to marry your son <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> for <b>the</b> range last fall. But she's a true woman and couldn't. August Naab, {{if we ever}} find her will you marry her to him--now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Eustacia started up, and said, [...] "Ah, Charley--you have {{followed}} me. You {{did not think}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> home in <b>the</b> summer that I should come back like this!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I had possessed that {{knowledge}} I should have returned and found it. I have reasons for believing {{it was in}} my pocket-book <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> factory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The divil a {{doubt on}} earth about that!" [...] replied Colligan. [...] "I tell you, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> room {{he was on}} his back among the chairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{must have}} {{climbed into the}} cart <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> town," [...] he said; [...] "but waken her, wife, and we will hear {{what she has to}} say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, all I know is,' replied Miss Sally, 'that it's {{not to be}} found, {{and that}} it {{disappeared}} one day this week, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> it on <b>the</b> desk.' ...|$|R
60|$|Peter had {{at first}} tormented me mercilessly about the affair, but <b>when</b> he saw <b>I</b> {{did not like}} his chaff he stopped it. Peter was always a good fellow. He {{realized}} that I regarded the matter seriously, and he saw me off <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> for <b>the</b> east with a grin tempered by honest sympathy and understanding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two feet of {{snow and}} ten below zero <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> and <b>the</b> beauty of them {{is not for the}} tongue to tell, but for eyes to see. It's even whiter magic than you have shown me this night, and I am not going to spoil it by trying to tell what it is like," [...] replied Pat.|$|R
6000|$|Oh Lady! <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> shore, [...] The distant shore {{which gave}} me birth, [...] I hardly thought to grieve once more, [...] To quit another spot on earth: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It all ended. They were loading {{her with}} wool <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> ship, {{but even the}} stevedores kept the picture clear to the last. The eyes of the demons scared them, I {{honestly}} believe.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Molly McEachern {{gave it to}} me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Abbey. She keeps a {{shelf of}} books for her guests when they are going away. Books that she {{considers}} rubbish, and doesn't want, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{took her}} hand in mine, and we {{went out of the}} ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>left</b> <b>the</b> forge, so the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of {{tranquil}} light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "They have {{secured the}} whole gang with the {{exception}} of him. He has given them the slip. Of course, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> country {{there was no one to}} cope with him. But I did think that I had put the game in their hands. I think that you had better return to England, Watson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Going strong <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> her. <b>The</b> Roman Catholic Missions are {{adopting}} the unclaimed babies {{to turn them}} into little priests; the Basil Mission is taking some, and the mothers are taking the rest. You should hear the little beggars howl when they're sent away from William. She's pulled down a bit, but so are we all. Now, when do you suppose you'll be able to move?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I am, sir," [...] replied Will, finding {{words at}} last, and bowing to the lady; [...] "but from what star have you dropt? for, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> village, {{there were none}} but savages in it!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{burst out}} laughing, {{with the air}} of a woman who {{thoroughly}} enjoyed a good joke. I looked back <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> room, and saw the friend of Father Time in the easy chair opening our newspaper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> North, my new {{mistress}} {{took me to}} Canada. Talk about air! If {{there was}} anything in it, {{the people in that}} air ought to live to be a hundred. I liked Canada." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brown {{returned}} to Cronulla for the 2015 season, saying, [...] "I've lived here my whole life, I've never moved, I just travelled. I've been a Sharks supporter since I can remember and I {{was born in}} Sutherland Hospital so I'm a Shire boy through and through. I've always supported the Sharks and I always {{wanted to come back}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left.</b> I'm <b>the</b> only local junior apart from Anthony Moratis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She was {{in great}} form <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> her. <b>The</b> Roman Catholic Missions are {{adopting}} the unclaimed babies {{to turn them}} into little priests; the Basil Mission is taking some, and the mothers are taking the rest. You should hear the little beggars howl when they're sent away from William. She's pulled down a bit, but so are we all. Now, when do you suppose you'll be able to move?' ...|$|R
60|$|She frowned with impatience and her {{disappointment}} {{was greater}} than necessary. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> her at <b>the</b> corner of the lane I felt a sting of her deep reproach in my mind. I always felt the reproach when she had gone.|$|R
