50|$|The Mosallah {{is another}} {{remarkable}} monument {{to see in}} Na'in. Its vast garden {{used to be a}} popular recreational area until a few years ago.The mausoleum inside the Mosallah was a pilgrimage site for visitors. The dome of the Mosallah is opposite the dome of the shrine of Emamzadeh Sultan Seyyed Ali and these two are connected by a street.There is a water reservoir {{on one side of the}} garden, which can be accessed by people inside and outside the garden through a stairway on each side. Water in this reservoir was cooled by two wind towers. The water reservoir (Persian: ab-anbar) was in use until a few years ago.The architectural style of Na'in's Mosallah is characteristic of the Qajar dynasty and a number of literary, political and religious figures are buried at this site. “Mosallah” is an Arabic word for a place of prayer but, no one knows if any praying was ever done at this location. The Mosallah is an octagonal mausoleum of dervishes and Qajar and Pahlavi political figures.It is encompassed by a Qajar-era military fort with a high <b>wall</b> <b>thick</b> enough for a horse to be ridden along the top.

A comprehensive Italian nationwide survey {{study was conducted to}} explore changes in cardiac status and renal allograft function in Fabry patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Methods. This study was designed as a cross-sectional sur-vey study with prospective follow-up.

40|$|PURPOSE: To analyze microscopically {{the effects}} of {{different}} concentrations of oxygen in the lungs of rats. METHODS: There were 20 rats distributed in three experimental groups (concentration of oxygen to 40 %, 70 % and 100 %) and a control group. The animals {{were exposed to the}} oxygen in a chamber of acrylic during three days and after exposition, the animals were submitted to median thoracotomia to remove the lungs. The lung tissue of all of the animals was analyzed as regards presence of acute and chronic inflammation, capillary congestion, alveolar <b>walls</b> <b>thick,</b> interstitial and alveolar edema, alveolar hemorrhage, denudation capillary and alveolar endothelium areas and atelectasis. RESULTS: The analysis histopathologic revealed significant statistics difference for acute and chronic inflammation, capillary congestion, alveolar <b>walls</b> <b>thick,</b> interstitial and alveolar edema, alveolar hemorrhage, denudation capillary and alveolar epithelium areas. CONCLUSIONS: Exposition to the oxygen during 72 hours in the concentration of 40 % does not produce significant histopathologic alterations in the lung tissue; in the concentration of 70 %, can promotes the alveolar <b>walls</b> <b>thick</b> and capillary congestion and in the concentration of 100 % can cause death and originate diffuse pulmonary lesion...|$|R

40|$|To inhibit {{damage and}} limit the {{probability}} of penetration of the Space Station pressure wall by micrometeoroids and orbital debris, a shield placed {{away from the wall}} is used to form a double wall. To determine shield effectiveness and assess impact damage, existing test data were reviewed and additional testing was performed for Space Station double wall designs. Empirical spallation and penetration functions derived from the data show that shield thickness and impact angle affect the damage to the <b>wall.</b> <b>Thick</b> shields reduce wall damage for low angle impacts but increase damage for oblique impacts. Multilayer insulation between the shield and wall reduces impact damage to the wall. A relationship between impact velocity and spall damage to the wall is demonstrated.

40|$|Basing {{on their}} {{favorable}} attributes aluminum nitride ceramics {{are able to}} replace alumina which is the dominant insulator-material in different fields of electronics so far. The advantages of aluminum nitride are: Very good thermal conductivity in combination with high electrical resistance and low {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} at high electrical breakdown strength, low dielectric loss at high frequencies and good resistance to thermal shock including a low specific weight. The possibility of an efficient manufacture of parts with a broad variety of shapes {{is one of the most}} important preconditions for the development of new application fields.

40|$|The {{veins of}} the lower limb are {{commonly}} divided in deep and superficial ones according to their position {{with respect to the}} Muscular Fascia (MF). Anatomical textbooks affirm that all superficial veins are thin walled vessels that run in a yielding layer of fat. Accordingly, no differences between saphenous Veins (SVs) and their tributaries (TVs) are reported by physiologists and pathophysiologists. On the contrary, the SVs do not correspond to the classic anatomic, physiologic and clinical descriptions of the "superficial" veins. In fact, the SVs: 1) are not superficial because they course between the SF and the MF; 2) they are not thin vessels, being their <b>wall</b> <b>thick</b> and rich in muscular cells; 3) they actively contribute to the complex mechanisms of venous return from the lower limbs; and finally, 4) they are quite resistant to hypertension and usually afflicted with limited varicose changes. As a consequence, the SVs should not be longer considered "real" superficial veins and the venous bed {{of the lower}} limb would be better represented by a three-layered model...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to determine useful CT findings for differ-entiating cholangiocarcinoma from periductal fibrosis in patients with hepatolithiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. CT images of 30 patients with hepatolithiasis and pathologically proven cholangiocarcinoma (n = 14) or periductal fibrosis (n = 16) were retro-spectively reviewed. Helical CT scans were obtained before, 30 seconds after, and 65 seconds af-ter the start of contrast material injection. Analysis of CT findings included evaluation for the presence of periductal soft-tissue density, bile duct wall thickening at the stricture site, ascites, portal vein obliteration, lymph node enlargement, and a duct stone; assessment of the degree of ductal dilatation; and evaluation of the enhancement pattern of periductal lesions, thickened duc-tal wall, and hepatic parenchyma. The CT attenuation coefficients of the thickened ductal wall and adjacent normal-looking bile duct were measured on images obtained during each phase. Among these findings, statistically significant variables were determined using the Fisher’s exact test and Student’s t test. Sensitivity and specificity values of the CT criteria were also calculated. RESULTS. The presence of periductal soft-tissue density (p = 0. 002), higher enhancement of the duct than adjacent bile duct on portal venous phase images (p = 0. 008), ductal <b>wall</b> <b>thick...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} wood anatomy of 29 species {{belonging}} to 10 genera {{of the tribe}} Detarieae, subfam-ily Caesalpinioideae and compare them with tribe Caesalpinieae. Detarieae is the largest of four tribes of Caesalpinioideae, with 84 genera, only eleven occur in Venezuela with species of timber importance. The speci-mens were collected in Venezuela and include wood samples {{from the collection of}} the Laboratorio de Anatomía de Maderas de la Facultad de Ciencias Forestales y Ambientales de la Universidad de Los Andes, Venezuela, and of the Forest Products Laboratory of the USDA Forest Service in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The terminol-ogy and methodology used followed the iAWA List of Microscopic Features for Hardwood identification of the iAWA Committee, 1989. Measurements from each specimen were averaged (vessel diameters, vessel element lengths, intervessels pit size, fibre lengths and ray height). The species of Detarieae can be separated using a combination of diagnostic features. Wood characters that provide the most important diagnosis and may be used in systematics of Detarieae include: intercellular axial canals, rays heterocellular, rays exclusively or predomi-nantly uniseriate, prismatic crystals common in ray cells, irregular storied structure and fibre wall thickness. For comparative anatomy between Detarieae and Caesalpinieae: intercellular axial canals, heterocellular rays, rays exclusively or predominantly uniseriate, prismatic crystals common in ray cells (in Detarieae) and regular storied structure, fibres septate, fibre <b>wall</b> <b>thick</b> or very thick, rays homocellular, multiseriate rays and silic...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of microstructure, texture and mechanical properties of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V joints produced by inertia friction welding is addressed in this thesis. Axis-symmetric tubular welds of different wall thicknesses were produced using different welding parameters. In the present study, there are two thin wall welds and three <b>thick</b> <b>wall</b> welds. A martensitic transformation occurred in the thin wall welds, resulting from the fast cooling rate, whereas it is prevented in the <b>thick</b> <b>wall</b> welds. The acicular microstructure in the Centre Weld Zone is finer and plastic deformation in the Thermal Mechanical Affected Zone is more severe with a higher energy input. In <b>thick</b> <b>wall</b> welds, prior β grain boundaries and grain boundary α are more clearly observed. Based on the reconstruction of prior β grains, the average β grain size {{can be related to}} the exponential of the forged pressure over the average input power density. The mechanical behaviour of both thin <b>wall</b> and <b>thick</b> <b>wall</b> welds for the varied welding parameters is also investigated, including tensile tests, fracture toughness tests, low cycle fatigue and fatigue crack growth resistance tests...|$|R
