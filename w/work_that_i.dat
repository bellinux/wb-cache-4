[...] "I can just manage, with not infrequent pauses, to walk {{about a third of}} a mile," [...] he wrote to Felix Frankfurter. [...] "My feet get very numb and my back painful. The truth is that 86 is too long." [...] Soon, he was obliged to use crutches, but he remained mentally sharp and continued to hear cases. In 1960, he worked briefly on President Dwight Eisenhower's [...] "Commission on National Goals", but he resigned because [...] "it involved more work than in the present state of my health I care to add to the judicial <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am still trying to do".|$|E

They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Orwell is {{best remembered}} for his {{political}} commentary as a left-wing anti-totalitarian. As he explained in the essay [...] "Why I Write" [...] (1946), [...] "Every line of serious <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it." [...] To that end Orwell used his fiction {{as well as his}} journalism to defend his political convictions. He first achieved widespread acclaim with his fictional novella Animal Farm and cemented his place in history with the publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four shortly before his death. While fiction accounts for a small fraction of his total output, these two novels are his best-selling works, having sold almost fifty million copies in sixty-two languages by 2007—more than any other pair of books by a twentieth-century author.|$|E

2500|$|Yet Orwell [...] "had felt what {{socialism}} {{could be}} like" [...] and, according to Bowker, unlike the writer John Dos Passos for example, [...] "who {{also had a}} friend killed in custody by the SIM (Servicio de Investigación Militar/Spanish Secret Police) in Spain, and reacted by deserting the Communists and shifting decidedly to the right, Orwell never did abandon his socialism: if anything, his Spanish experience strengthened it." [...] In a letter to Cyril Connolly, written on 8 June 1937, Orwell said, [...] "At last I really believe in Socialism which I never did before". A decade later he wrote: [...] "Every line of serious <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, as I understand it." ...|$|E

[...] Rodden refers to the essay [...] "Why I Write", in which Orwell refers to the Spanish Civil War as being his [...] "watershed political experience", saying [...] "The Spanish War and other events in 1936–37, turned the scale. Thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for Democratic Socialism as I understand it."

I have been very unjustly treated by these writers, and my friends are coming to the front in defense, as all the missions have done the same things, and all believe they are right. So also does Mr. Conger, who is our good friend. Do not be disturbed by anything you see in the papers.

When his life was endangered in Pakistan in 1986, Robert Runcie, then the Archbishop of Canterbury, arranged for his refuge in England. Nazir-Ali said, [...] "the reason behind some of the difficulties I was facing was removed when General Zia was killed - unfortunately for him, and I am now not doing the <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was doing at the time with the very poor". He became an assistant to the Archbishop at Lambeth and assisted with the planning of the 1988 Lambeth Conference; he was General Secretary of the Church Mission Society 1989-1994 and concurrently an Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Southwark. He was appointed Bishop of Rochester, England in 1994, and in 1999 entered the House of Lords as one of the [...] "Lords Spiritual" [...] because of his seniority in episcopal office, the first religious leader from Asia to serve there. He was one of the final candidates for Archbishop of Canterbury, though Rowan Williams was appointed by the British prime minister, Tony Blair.|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish Civil War {{played the}} most {{important}} part in defining Orwell's socialism. He wrote to Cyril Connolly from Barcelona on 8 June 1937: [...] "I have seen wonderful things and at last really believe in Socialism, which I never did before." [...] Having witnessed the success of the anarcho-syndicalist communities, for example in Anarchist Catalonia, and the subsequent brutal suppression of the anarcho-syndicalists, anti-Stalin communist parties and revolutionaries by the Soviet Union-backed Communists, Orwell returned from Catalonia a staunch anti-Stalinist and joined the Independent Labour Party, his card being issued on 13 June 1938. Although he was never a Trotskyist, he was strongly influenced by the Trotskyist and anarchist critiques of the Soviet regime, and by the anarchists' emphasis on individual freedom. In Part 2 of The Road to Wigan Pier, published by the Left Book Club, Orwell stated: [...] "a real Socialist is one who wishes– not merely conceives it as desirable, but actively wishes– to see tyranny overthrown." [...] Orwell stated in [...] "Why I Write" [...] (1946): [...] "Every line of serious <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it." [...] Orwell was a proponent of a federal socialist Europe, a position outlined in his 1947 essay [...] "Toward European Unity," [...] which first appeared in Partisan Review.
