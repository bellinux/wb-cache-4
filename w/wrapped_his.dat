25|$|Vincent Preissnitz {{was the son}} of {{a peasant}} farmer who, as a young child, {{observed}} a wounded deer bathing a wound in a pond near his home. Over the course of several days, he would see this deer return and eventually the wound was healed. Later as a teenager, Preissnitz was attending to a horse cart, when the cart ran him over, breaking three of his ribs. A physician told him that they would never heal. Preissnitz decided to try his own hand at healing himself, and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> wounds with damp bandages. By daily changing his bandages and drinking large quantities of water, after about a year, his broken ribs had been cured. Preissnitz quickly gained fame in his hometown and became the consulted physician.|$|E
25|$|The gangsters drove Kilroy {{through the}} back {{streets of the city}} and past an {{industrial}} area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out as they drove Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a dirt road that stretched between two corn fields. When they got to the private ranch known as Santa Elena, they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and fed him bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Contanzo and his men came to see him. They <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> face and mouth with duct tape and walked him through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match of}} the event {{featured}} Ricky Steamboat defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Ric Flair. Terry Funk, Pat O'Connor and Lou Thesz were the special judges in the match in case the match went to the full 1-hour time limit. Flair started the match by performing a Shoulder Block. Flair and Steamboat competed for longer than half hour and exchanged momentum throughout the match. In the final moments of the match, Steamboat delivered a Superplex to Flair and applied a Double Chickenwing but Flair <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> legs into the ropes. Flair was smashed into the turnbuckle and Steamboat climbed the top rope. Flair fell into the ropes and Steamboat fell {{down on the floor}} which hurt his leg. Flair suplexed Steamboat back into the ring and began attacking his injured knee. Flair applied a Figure Four Leglock until Steamboat caught the ropes. Flair tried to attack Steamboat's knee but Steamboat delivered a Karate Chop and an Enzuigiri. Steamboat tried to pick Flair to perform a Scoop Slam but his leg was hurt, allowing Flair to pin Steamboat with an Inside Cradle to win the title. After the match, Flair showed respect to Steamboat by shaking hands with him. One of the judges of the match, Terry Funk challenged Flair for the title but Flair turned down the title match, causing Funk to attack Flair and perform a Piledriver on him through the judges table.|$|E

500|$|Walker is {{best remembered}} {{for a pair}} of one-handed catches he made in 2001. [...] Prior to the 2002 NFL Draft, Baltimore Ravens Senior vice {{president}} of football operations, Ozzie Newsome referred to Walker's collegiate catches as some of the best catches he has seen in college in a long time. [...] One of the one-handed catches was a touchdown catch {{in the back of the}} end zone against the Iowa Hawkeyes football team in a 32–26 comeback from a 21–7 deficit on October 27, 2001. [...] The Post-Standard, Walker's hometown newspaper, described his grab in the Iowa game this way: [...] "There he was in the corner of the end zone, as two Iowa defensive backs stalked him like [...] [...] The ball, delivered high and wide, seemed an improbable stretch, an impossible goal. [...] And yet, as it spiraled toward him, Marquise Walker leaped and lifted his right arm. [...] His fingertips grazed the leather and tipped it skyward. [...] And then, as he tumbled back to earth, he <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> hands around the ball and caressed it to his chest. [...] Touchdown Michigan." ...|$|E
500|$|Lépine {{then walked}} up an {{escalator}} {{to the third}} floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to [...] "get out," [...] shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform {{at the front of the}} classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help; Lépine unsheathed his hunting knife and stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> coat around his rifle, exclaimed, [...] "Ah shit," [...] and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack. About sixty unfired cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen other people, including four men.|$|E
500|$|At 05:00 on 5 April, the Japanese {{launched}} an {{attack from the}} north. This was followed almost simultaneously by a stronger attack from the south-west. For the next 80 minutes, 900–1,100 Japanese from the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments attacked the small Australian force in waves. They overwhelmed the Australian forward positions, but finding their way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking any equipment {{to deal with them}} the Japanese attack stalled. Quickly, the situation was turned back in favour of the Australians, and the Japanese were cut down by heavy defensive artillery fire and by well-sited machine guns. A further attack was launched by a smaller force along the Buin Road and aimed at two of the forward companies positioned there. This attack was beaten back also. After regrouping, the surviving members of the 13th Infantry Regiment began preparing for a final charge, determined to fight to the last man. Their commander, Muta, in a final act of defiance <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> unit's banner around his waist and armed himself with a grenade with which to blow himself up during the assault. Elsewhere, the remaining officers of the 23rd Infantry made a pact to hurl themselves against the Australians one last time in a suicidal charge. Nevertheless, Akinaga, realising that further assaults were futile finally dispatched the order to cancel the attack. [...] At around 08:30, the Australians realised that the Japanese had decided that they had had enough. Just after midday, two tanks were dispatched from the 'B' Echelon perimeter, escorted by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion, arriving on the knoll by 13:45 where they were used as fire support as the Australians began to carry out mopping up operations, flushing out small groups of survivors all around the position.|$|E

2500|$|The {{day before}} he died (sometime in 1877), Kamiakin was baptized a Catholic and given the name [...] "Matthew." [...] On the year anniversary of his death, {{according}} to his people's customs, his son (Tesh Palouse Ka-mi-akin) opened his father's grave and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> remains in a new blanket. Several years later, when Kamiakin's body was exhumed {{in order to be}} reburied elsewhere, it was discovered that [...] "the head and shoulders had been cut off and removed", probably for [...] "public exhibition" [...] as a curiosity." [...] Historian Clifford Trafzer states that friends of Kamiakin were upset and retrieved these relics. In any case, what was left of his remains were interred at Nespelem, Washington, a village he had founded.|$|E

After his mother <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> hand in a towel, Garcia's father drove him over 30 [...] miles to the nearest hospital. A few weeks later, Garcia — who had not looked at his finger since the accident — was surprised to discover most of it missing when the bandage he was wearing came off during a bath. Garcia later confided that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood.|$|E
