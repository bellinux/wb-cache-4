Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path {{was to become a}} chemical engineer. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat for the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926. He then went to the University of Göttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{he was going to do}} just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E

500|$|... "Alive" [...] is a downtempo ballad {{recorded}} by American singer Jennifer Lopez. It {{was written by}} Lopez, Cris Judd, and Cory Rooney for the Michael Apted-directed thriller, Enough (2002). Lopez stars in the film as Slim, a waitress who marries a wealthy contractor, and flees with their young daughter as he becomes increasingly abusive. While on the run, Slim, who discovers that her husband is following her, [...] "trains herself for a final, violent confrontation". The producers of Enough wanted her to write a new song for film, however, Lopez {{felt as if it}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> could be forced. In October 2001, while on their honeymoon, Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano.

She incorporated the hardships that Slim went through in the film, as well as her own personal struggles, into the song's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The book {{consists}} of 18 chapters, each covering roughly {{one hour of}} the day, beginning around about 8a.m. and ending sometime after 2a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure {{represents one of the}} book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature. The use of classical mythology as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters are others. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, [...] "I may have oversystematised Ulysses," [...] and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer. Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. [...] It was only when Stuart Gilbert published his critical work on Ulysses in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.|$|E
500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of [...] "Lexmas", then Lana {{would have been able to}} truly love him.|$|E

In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms.

500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Holly Williams of Contactmusic.com, who was {{extremely}} {{disappointed with the}} track. Williams felt a rapid decline {{in the quality of}} music with the title track, which she believed should have been [...] "climactic, inventive and a little bit trippy with such a title" [...] but found its tempo to be slow and mundane. Maura Johnson from Spin felt that lyrics like [...] "I just love the music, not the bling" [...] appeared insincere on Gaga's behalf since her career graph showed that the singer was more infatuated with Fame in the 21st century. [...] "Not the deepest statement, but also not that unique to the new millennium," [...] Johnson concluded. Los Angeles Timess Mikael Wood believed that the line <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> worked in a pop record and believed that along with first single [...] "Applause", Gaga's ideas seemed unattainable and not exciting. John Walker from MTV News rated it two out of five stars, calling it boring. Chris Bossman from Consequence of Sound compared the composition of the track to a [...] "dying, old school war dialer". Melinda Newman from HitFix called the song [...] "too quirky" [...] and felt that it could only be successful if remixed properly. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy believed that the chorus line [...] "My artpop could mean anything" [...] made the concept of the album all the more confusing, instead of simplifying Gaga's brash statements about her musical outputs. Ericka Welch from The Huffington Post called the song as [...] "pretentious" [...] and the least interesting endeavor on the album. She believed that [...] "Artpop" [...] failed to embody the concept of the album and was plagued with the same inconsequential lyrics that was visible during her Born This Way era. She concluded by giving the example: [...] "Like a mad scientist trying to create life, Gaga's experiment to fuse ART and POP sometimes results in overly ambitious deformities with six legs." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{just written}} the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft was {{determined}} to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French revolution she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay, an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay despite not being married, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was considered acceptable behavior from a [...] "respectable" [...] British woman at the time. Whether or not {{she was interested in}} marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealized portrait of the man. While Wollstonecraft had rejected the sexual component of relationships in the Rights of Woman, Imlay awakened her passions and her interest in sex. Wollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned by what she saw in France, writing that the people under the republic were still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the government remained [...] "venal" [...] and [...] "brutal". Despite her disenchantment, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "I cannot yet give up the hope, that a fairer day is dawning on Europe, though I must hesitatingly observe, that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce, which seems everywhere to be shoving aside the principle of honor of the noblesse. For the same pride of office, the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation, that, fearing to return to obscurity, after having but just acquired a relish for distinction, each hero, or philosopher, for all are dubbed with these new titles, endeavors to make hay while the sun shines." [...] Wollstonecraft was offended by the way that the Jacobins refused to grant Frenchwomen equal rights, denounced [...] "Amazons", and made it clear the role of women was to conform to Rousseau's ideal of as a helper to men. On 16 October 1793, Marie Antoinette was guillotined with one of the charges that she been convicted of being she had committed incest with her son. Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen, she was troubled by the way that the Jacobins had made Marie Antoinette's alleged perverted sexuality that had caused her to engage in an incestuous relationship with the Dauphin one of the central reasons for why the French people should hate her. On 31 October 1793, most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined, which caused Wollstonecraft to faint when Imlay broke the news to her.|$|E

However, this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Thiệu agreed with. In April 1975, as South Vietnam {{was on the}} verge of being overrun, Thieu resigned. A week later, Minh was chosen by the legislature and became president on 28 April 1975. It was thought that Minh would be able to negotiate a cease-fire due to his policy stance, but the communists were on the verge of gaining absolute power, so they pushed on. Saigon fell two days later on 30 April, and Minh ordered the surrender to prevent bloody urban street fighting. Minh was spared the lengthy incarceration meted out to South Vietnamese military personnel and civil servants, and lived quietly until being allowed to emigrate to France in 1983. He later moved to California, where he died. He remains a controversial figure among supporters of South Vietnam due to his decision to surrender rather than fight to the death.|$|E
2500|$|The {{case of the}} Charlotte Three <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{was entirely}} unique; rather, as {{historian}} John Schutz argued, it was the ordinary in the mid 1900s South. By persecuting [...] "black leaders for conventional crimes", the state could follow [...] "civilized" [...] methods that would instead of cause violence, put the leader in jail where {{he could no longer}} do any more leading. Expert Raymond Michalowski believes these persecutions of blacks were {{similar to those of the}} KKK or other [...] "night riders of decades past" [...] but instead of illegal henchmen carrying out the attacks, legal judges and prosecutors were doing so in the courts. By charging the leaders with crimes, the state was able to make it seem like the leaders were not as viable as they claimed to be. This helped to mute some of the public support the leaders may have originally garnered. Though the South seemed to have overtly fixed its race problem after the passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964-65, it was covertly persecuting Black revolutionary leaders. The persecutions were not taking place out on the streets through public lynching as in times past, but instead through illegal backdoor deals supported by the judicial system.|$|E
