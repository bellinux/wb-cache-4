5|$|The <b>waxwings</b> are a family, Bombycillidae, of short-tailed stocky {{birds with}} soft plumage, a head crest and distinctively {{patterned}} wings and tails. There are three species, the Bohemian, cedar, and Japanese <b>waxwings.</b> DNA studies and shared {{features such as}} a relatively large size, grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the Japanese and Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> are most closely related within the genus. Although only the cedar and Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> normally have red tips on their wing feathers, this feature is occasionally shown by the Japanese waxwing, suggesting that this was originally a whole-family characteristic that has been lost in one species, rather than an indicator of a close relationship. DNA analysis confirms that the cedar waxwing diverged early from {{the other members of}} the family. Outside the genus, the closest relatives of the <b>waxwings</b> are believed to be the silky-flycatchers, the palmchat, and the grey hypocolius, all of which have sometimes been included in the Bombycillidae.|$|E
5|$|<b>Waxwings</b> can eat {{huge numbers}} of berries, each bird {{sometimes}} consuming several hundred a day, more than double its own weight. One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. <b>Waxwings</b> travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds. <b>Waxwings</b> forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|The <b>waxwings</b> are a {{group of}} birds with soft silky plumage and unique red tips {{to some of the}} wing feathers. In the Bohemian and cedar <b>waxwings,</b> these tips look like sealing wax and give the group its name. These are {{arboreal}} birds of northern forests.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{released}} a self-titled 7" [...] single for Henry's Finest Recordings before signing with Second Nature Recordings. The band released their debut full-length, For Madmen Only, in 1999 and {{released a}} follow-up in 2000, titled One for the Ride. In this time, the band's {{profile in the}} Seattle music scene had grown substantially. Rocky had released several solo albums containing material he'd written that didn't fit <b>Waxwing's</b> style while Cody's other band, The Blood Brothers, had gained significant popularity.|$|R
500|$|The Bohemian <b>waxwing's</b> call {{is a high}} trill sirrrr. It is less {{wavering}} and lower-pitched {{than that}} of the cedar waxwing, and longer and lower-pitched than the call of the Japanese waxwing. Other calls are just variants of the main vocalisation; a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents, and courtship calls, also given during nest construction, have a particularly large frequency range. Although not a call as such, when a flock takes off or lands, the wings make a distinctive rattling sound that can be heard [...] away.|$|R

5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. <b>Waxwings</b> often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E
5|$|The silky-flycatchers are a {{small family}} of {{passerine}} birds which occur mainly in Central America. They are related to <b>waxwings</b> and most species have small crests.|$|E
5|$|The soft, dense {{feathers}} {{are kept}} in good condition by preening. The red waxy tips are the extended and flattened ends of feather shafts, pigmented with astaxanthin and enclosed in a transparent sheath. A study of the cedar <b>waxwings</b> showed that the red tips are few or absent until {{the third year of}} life for that related species. All adult <b>waxwings</b> have a complete moult annually between August and January. Juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers.|$|E
5|$|Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> {{start their}} {{return from the}} {{wintering}} grounds in February or March, but northern breeders do not reach their breeding areas until April or early May. This monogamous species nests mainly from mid June to July.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that have}} no long-distance migratory relatives, such as the <b>waxwings</b> Bombycilla, are {{effectively}} moving in response to winter weather {{and the loss of}} their usual winter food, rather than enhanced breeding opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The silky-flycatchers are a {{small family}} of {{passerine}} birds which occur mainly in Central America. They are related to <b>waxwings,</b> and like that group have soft silky plumage, usually gray or pale-yellow.|$|E
5|$|The <b>waxwings</b> are a {{group of}} {{passerine}} birds characterised by soft, silky plumage and unique red tips to some of the wing feathers. There are three species worldwide, one of which has been recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic mites include Syringophiloidus bombycillae, first {{identified}} on this species, and the nasal mite Ptilonyssus bombycillae. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma species, and a Leucocytozoon first {{identified in this}} waxwing. Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> may carry flatworms and tapeworms, but levels of parasitic worm infestation are generally low.|$|E
5|$|The silky-flycatchers are a {{small family}} of {{passerine}} birds which occur mainly in Central America, although the range of one species extends to central California.

5|$|Sometimes {{circumstances}} {{such as a}} good {{breeding season}} followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range. Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> Bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000. Red crossbills Loxia curvirostra too are irruptive, with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251, 1593, 1757, and 1791.|$|E
5|$|<b>Waxwings</b> {{can be very}} tame in winter, {{entering}} {{towns and}} gardens in search of food, rowan berries being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Other hazards include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows. The Bohemian waxwing's high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> are not brood {{parasitised}} by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its English name. The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese <b>waxwings,</b> it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the Bohemian waxwing {{overlaps}} those of both {{the other members of}} the genus. The cedar waxwing is smaller than the Bohemian; it has browner upperparts, a white undertail and a white line above the black eye patch. Adult cedar <b>waxwings</b> have a yellowish belly, and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian waxwing. The Japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives; it has a red terminal band to the tail, the black mask extends up the rear of the crest, and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Waxwings</b> are {{primarily}} fruit eaters, but also consume insects during the breeding season. Mosquitoes and midges {{are the most}} common prey, but many other insects and some spiders are eaten. They are caught mainly by flycatching from an open perch, but some may be picked off vegetation. Fruit is normally picked from trees, sometimes from the ground, and is usually swallowed whole. In the summer, Vaccinium and Rubus species and Canada buffaloberry are important items of their diet, while cotoneaster, juniper, haws, rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season. Rowan berries are a favourite food, and are eaten whenever available.|$|E
5|$|<b>Waxwings</b> are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian <b>waxwings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bombycilloidea – <b>waxwings</b> and allies, {{included}} in the Muscicapoidea if Sittoidea/Certhioidea are also included there, omnivores but strongly prefer juicy fruit and nectar, Laurasian, essentially limited to the Northern Hemisphere, mid-sized and typically fairly inconspicuous except for their habit of roaming around in noisy flocks, plumage typically grey-hued and with silk-like texture, but many have a conspicuous black face and/or yellow ornaments, several melanic lineages, sexual dimorphism slight if any. Hylocitrea might be included here as monotypic family.|$|E
25|$|Records {{show that}} her visiting guests were entertained with the {{following}} fowl: <b>waxwings,</b> fieldfares, snow bunting, hazel grouse, partridges, black grouse, capercaillies and the forest game: loach, trouts, grayling, salmon fresh and smoked, flounders, salted herring, lampreys in vinegar, oysters, snails, and Genoese pâté, not to mention fresh fruit and chestnuts. French and Italian wines were served, as well as mead and local beers. The dishes were made only according to French recipes. The royal court with all its innovations exerted a broad influence {{over the rest of}} aristocratic residences and noble palaces across Poland. French cuisine was in fashion and many families willingly employed French cooks and pâté makers. In the mid-18th century on Polish tables appeared the French champagne. Also, among the most influential in that period were Lithuanian, Jewish, German and Hungarian cuisine, not to mention Armenian, which arrived in Poland before the 17th century along with many settlers especially in the south-eastern part of the Commonwealth. Signature dishes of the Western Asia reached Polish tables thanks to the Armenian trade and cultural exchange with Poland's neighbor - the Ottoman Empire. Rare delicacies were brought to royal court as gifts from sultans and royal envoys. The strongest influences were noted in the cities of Lwów, Kraków, Kamieniec Podolski and Zamość due to many Armenians living there permanently. Also, because of the close contact with the Ottoman Empire, coffee (kawa) and boza became popular.|$|E
500|$|<b>Waxwings</b> are preyed upon by {{birds of}} prey {{including}} rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian sparrowhawks, prairie falcons, and great grey shrikes. Merlins attack winter flocks, including those in cities. When alarmed, Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> [...] "freeze" [...] with bill and neck pointing upwards. If this fails, they fly, calling noisily.|$|E
500|$|In the past, {{the arrival}} of <b>waxwings</b> {{sometimes}} coincided with epidemics of cholera or plague, {{and led to the}} old Dutch and Flemish name Pestvogel, [...] "plague bird". The juniper berries on which they fed were thought to offer protection, and people consumed the fruit and burned branches to fumigate their houses.|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} coniferous forests, usually near water. The pair build a lined cup-shaped nest {{in a tree}} or bush, often close to the trunk. The clutch of 3–7 eggs is incubated by the female alone for 13–14days to hatching. The chicks are altricial and naked, and are fed by both parents, initially mostly with insects, but thereafter mainly fruit. They fledge about 14–16days after leaving the egg. Many birds desert their nesting range in winter and migrate farther south. In some years, large numbers of Bohemian <b>waxwings</b> [...] well beyond their normal winter range {{in search of the}} fruit that makes up most of their diet.|$|E
500|$|In some years, this waxwing irrupts {{south of}} its normal {{wintering}} areas, sometimes in huge numbers. The fruit {{on which the}} birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year, and in poor years, particularly those following a good crop the previous year, the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies. They will stay until the food runs out and move on again. In {{what may be the}} largest ever irruption in Europe, in the winter of 2004–2005, {{more than half a million}} <b>waxwings</b> were recorded in Germany alone. This invasion followed an unusually warm, dry breeding season. In 1908, an American flock [...] wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over.|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} mature conifers, often spruce although other conifers and broadleaf trees {{may also be}} present. More open, wet areas such as lakes and peat swamps with dead and drowned trees are used for feeding on insects. Lowlands, valleys and uplands are used in Eurasia, although mountains tend to be avoided. However, the North American subspecies nests in Canada at altitudes between [...] Outside the breeding season, the waxwing will occupy {{a wide range of}} habitats as long as suitable fruits such as rowan are available. It may be found by roads, in parks and gardens or along hedges or woodlands edges. It shows little fear of humans at this time. In winter, <b>waxwings</b> roost communally in dense trees or hedges, sometimes with American robins, fieldfares or other wintering species.|$|E
