5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{nurse was}} due to arrive at 9:00 the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat, but {{eventually}} gained access {{with the help of}} a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's first exile {{was to be}} a short one. In early July 1307, Edward I {{fell ill}} while once more campaigning in the north, and lay dying at Burgh by Sands near the Scottish border. According to one chronicle, he {{gathered}} some of his most trusted men around him, including Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; and Aymer de Valence, soon to be Earl of Pembroke. Edward entrusted the magnates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of his son, and instructed them particularly to prevent the return of Piers Gaveston from exile. Nevertheless, when the King died on 7 July, one of Edward II's first acts as king was to recall his friend. Gaveston returned almost immediately, and the two were reunited by early August.|$|E

5|$|Thirty-one brass cannon {{were moved}} to the north-facing crenellated terrace of the fort from nearby Cumberland Lodge in the early 19th century. The cannon were made by Andrew Schalch at the Royal Brass Foundry in Woolwich in 1729–1749. The cannon were fired for King George IV's birthdays and other royal birthdays until 1907, with the cannonfire being {{answered}} by a miniature frigate situated on Virginia Water {{in the early years}} of their operation. The last Bombardier situated at the fort was Master Gunner Turner of the Royal Artillery. The Bombardier was entrusted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of the guns and lived in Bombardier's Cottage, connected to the main house by an archway. The cannon would have been melted down as part of the war effort in 1943 had it not been for the intervention of the head of the Tower Armoury, J. G. Mann. Four guns were removed from the terrace in 1930 and placed in two pairs at the entrances to the fort.|$|E

25|$|The {{dedication}} is {{an unusual}} one, ordinarily local to Chester, where Werburgh is the patron saint.

25|$|Court {{bonds are}} those bonds {{prescribed}} by statute and {{relate to the}} courts. They are further broken down into judicial bonds and fiduciary bonds. Judicial bonds arise out of litigation and are posted by parties seeking court remedies or defending against legal actions seeking court remedies. Fiduciary, or probate, bonds are filed in probate courts and courts that exercise equitable jurisdiction; they guaranty that persons whom such courts have entrusted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of others’ property will perform their specified duties faithfully.|$|E
25|$|Inversely, {{within a}} Negative Senescence Theory R.D. Lee (similarly J.W. Vaupel) {{considered}} positive group effects performing a selection force directed to survival beyond {{the age of}} fertility. Often also postreproductive individuals make intergenerational transfers: bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales guard their grandchildren; there is cooperative breeding in some mammals, many insects and about 200 species of birds; sex differences in the survival of anthropoid primates tend to correlate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> to offspring; or an Efe infant is often attended by more than 10 people. Lee developed a formal theory integrating selection due to transfers (at all ages) with selection due to fertility.|$|E
25|$|While {{civilian}} communities {{had organized}} {{ways to deal}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> and transportation of the sick and dying {{as far back as}} the bubonic plague in London between 1598 and 1665, such arrangements were typically ad hoc and temporary. In time, however, these arrangements began to formalize and become permanent. During the American Civil War, Jonathan Letterman devised a system of mobile field hospitals employing the first uses of the principles of triage. After returning home, some veterans began to attempt to apply what had they had seen on the battlefield to their own communities, and commenced the creation of volunteer life-saving squads and ambulance corps.|$|E

25|$|Detained in Southern California while {{attempting}} to obtain passage to China, Wilson decided to remain there.

Wilson was made Justice of the Peace for the Inland Territory and was entrusted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of Native American affairs. He was also commissioned {{to deal with the}} hostile Ute tribe over their cattle rustling and other crimes against the ranchers.

25|$|By a {{comparison}} with the Hospitaller rule {{it is clear that}} the first twenty-five chapters of the Altopascian rule correspond to the first nineteen chapters from the Hospitaller rule of Raymond du Puy (from 112553). Chapters 3037, which deal with the proper burial of deceased brethren, are probably adapted from the additions made by Jobert of Syria to the Hospitaller rule between 1177 and 1181. Chapters 3945 are concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> for the sick and were added to the Hospitaller rule by Roger de Moulins in 1181 or 1182. Chapters 4752 and 76 are derived from the later usances (customs) of the order of Saint John, with chapters 4952 prescribing the ceremonies for the initiation of brethren and confrati (affiliated persons). Chapters 5375 are a selection of later Hospitaller esgards (judgements), probably chosen for their relevance to the Altopascian situation. They deal primarily with crime. Chapters 2629, 38, 46, and 7796 are not based on the Hospitaller rule.|$|E
25|$|Many {{counseling}} {{preparation programs}} include courses in human development. Since children {{often do not}} have the ability to articulate thoughts and feelings, counselors will use a variety of media such as crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling (books), toys, board games, et cetera. The use of play therapy is often rooted in psychodynamic theory, but other approaches such as Solution Focused Brief Counseling may also employ the use of play in counseling. In many cases the counselor may prefer to work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> taker of the child, especially if the child is younger than age four. Yet, by doing so, the counselor risks the perpetuation of maladaptive interactive patterns and the adverse effects on development that have already been affected on the child's end of the relationship. Therefore, contemporary thinking on working with this young age group has leaned towards working with parent and child simultaneously within the interaction, as well as individually as needed.|$|E
