25|$|Pius XI was {{the first}} pope to {{directly}} address the Christian ecumenical movement.

25|$|Sikhism {{emerged in}} the Punjab during the Mughal period. Conflict between early Sikhs and the Muslim power center at Delhi reached an early high point in 1606 when Guru Arjan, the fifth guru of the Sikhs, was {{tortured}} and killed by Jahangir, the Mughal emperor. After {{the death of the}} fifth beloved Guru his son had taken his spot Guru Hargobind <b>who</b> <b>basically</b> made the Sikhs a warrior religion. Guru ji was the first to defeat the Mughal empire in a battle which had taken place in present Sri Hargobindpur in Gurdaspur After this point the Sikhs were forced to organise themselves militarily for their protection. Later in the 16th century, Tegh Bahadur became guru in 1665 and led the Sikhs until 1675. Teg Bahadur was executed by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb for helping to protect Hindus, after a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits came to him for help when the Emperor condemned them to death for failing to convert to Islam. At this point Aurangzeb had instituted forceful conversions for which they would charge citizens with various accusations granting them to have charges and execution waved off if they converted this led to a high increase of violence between the Sikhs and Hindus as well as rebellions of Aurangzeb's empire. This is an early example which illustrates how the Hindu-Muslim conflict and the Muslim-Sikh conflicts are connected. After which Guru Gobind Singh and the Sikhs helped the next successor of the throne of India to rise who was Bahadur Shah Zafar for certain period of time good relations were maintained somewhat like they were in Akbar's time until disputes arose again. The Mughal period saw various invaders coming into India through Punjab with which they would loot and severely plunder. Better relations have been seen by Dulla Bhatti, Mian Mir, Pir Budhu Shah, Pir Bhikham Shah, Bulleh Shah.|$|E
500|$|Vladimir Bukovsky, {{well known}} for his {{struggle}} against political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union, explained that using psychiatry against dissidents was usable to the KGB because hospitalization {{did not have an}} end date, and, as a result, there were cases when dissidents were kept in psychiatric prison hospitals for 10 or even 15 years.

After pleading with him to stay, the wife unleashes her frustrations upon him, {{and in a moment}} of inspiration reveals her desire to live a fearless, sexually liberated life without him. According to at least one film historian, [...] this was the motion picture that inspired other films centering upon sophisticated female protagonists, who stayed out late, had affairs, wore revealing gowns, and <b>who</b> <b>basically</b> destroyed the sexual double standard by asserting themselves both within society and in the bedroom. From The Divorcee onward, there developed [...] "a trend toward a sophistication in women's pictures that would continue unabated {{until the end of the}} Pre-Code era in mid-1934.|$|E
500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline.

[...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that there might be some way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to understand him and even begins to see things the way he does." ...|$|E
500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have {{to stay home and}} mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who were thought to be easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, <b>who</b> <b>basically</b> does not have a life. I want someone who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E

500|$|Cuse and Lindelof {{admitted}} they took some {{inspiration from the}} final episode of , [...] "", where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames. The Lost writers compared Minkowski's role to Q, as [...] "someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist". Faraday, on the other hand, was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction—as Lindelof put it, [...] "He's our Doc Brown here, <b>who</b> <b>basically</b> is gonna tell the protagonist to go and find him in the past". Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write, [...] "The Constant" [...] took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories. Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Losts rules. [...] Michio Kaku claimed that [...] "the show's producers did their homework". [...] According to Kaku, [...] "there's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel—just a lack of know-how… {{it would take a}} very advanced civilization to really do this". [...] Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility". [...] "The Constant" [...] was the first episode set on the Kahana, but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting just to give new information—Lindelof has declared that [...] "you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were {{in a constant state of}} crisis". According to Lindelof, Desmond's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter's crew.|$|E
