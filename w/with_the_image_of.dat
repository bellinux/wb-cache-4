5|$|According to Hindu legend Ramanuja (1017–1137), {{the leading}} expounder of Vishishtadvaita philosophy, visited the temple. One of his disciples placed Ramanuja's sandals along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Varadarajar. Ramanujar became furious at this, {{for which the}} disciple {{explained}} that for Ramanuja Varadarajar is god, but for him, Ramanuja is supreme. Thiruvellarai is the birthplace of Uyyakondar, a disciple of Nathamuni. Swami Engalazhwan {{is believed to have}} taught Sri Bhasyam to Nadadhoor Ammal in the temple.|$|E
5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died at {{the feet}} of the Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear. According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra merged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Vithoba in a form of marriage—something that Kanhopatra longed for. Other theories suggest that she killed herself, or that she was killed for her rebelliousness.|$|E

The book cover was made of silver and decorated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Jesus. It was made by Andrija Izat, who was a famous goldsmith from Kotor.|$|E

5|$|The {{material}} of the Philomela myth {{has been used}} in various creative works—artistic and literary—for the past 2,500 years.

5|$|Homdong Khangtsang, also spelt ‘Kamcuns’ in Tibetan language, are {{the main}} {{dwelling}} units or dormitories which house the monks of the monastery; there are thirty-three Kamcuns surrounding the central courtyard. The size of the Kamcuns varied, depending {{on the strength of}} monks housed. Monks of the same village are housed together; however each monk is given a separate cell. Each Kamcun also has a prayer hall for exclusive study of Buddhist doctrine and also has annexed tea house. However, the main assembly hall here had minor images of Tsongkhapa, Choyi Gyeltsen, Shakhyamuni Buddha, Three Deities of Longevity, and two inner chapels – the Jampakhang with ‘speaking’ image of Tara (protector of the springs in Sera) and Lama Tubten Kunga (who renovated Sera Me) and Gonkhang chapel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the protector deity Gyelchen Karma Trinle.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the dog's body lying {{in the center of}} the training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, 1493, Cairano was {{tasked with}} the {{decoration}} of {{the exterior of the}} Palazzo della Loggia with the delivery of capita 5 imperatorum romanum, or five busts for the beginning of a cycle of thirty Caesars, which would become among the finest achievements of his career. The production of these busts can be traced, in general, to a contemporary reworking of ancient portraiture. In the oldest busts, i.e., those facing the piazza, there are similarities <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Bartolomeo Colleoni in the memorial by Andrea del Verrochio in Venice, with an evoking of an effigy of Antoninus Pius and a portrait of Nero, all famous images at the time and here revived in three dimensions.|$|E

"They also possess <b>images,</b> some <b>of</b> them painted, {{and others}} formed from {{different}} kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them.

5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity. One reason for including this color final was, according to Tarkovsky, {{to give the}} viewer some rest and {{to allow him to}} detach himself from Rublev's life and to reflect. The film finally ends <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life was the source of all of Rublev's art.|$|E
5|$|The medical faculties of Charles University in Prague {{also have}} a pelican as their emblem. The symbol of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a pelican, {{and for most of}} its {{existence}} the headquarters of the service was located at Pelican House in Dublin, Ireland. The heraldic pelican also ended up as a pub name and image, though sometimes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the ship Golden Hind. Sir Francis Drake's famous ship was initially called Pelican, and adorned the British halfpenny coin.|$|E

5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
