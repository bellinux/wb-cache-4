500|$|Heading {{the cast}} of Doppelgänger is Roy Thinnes {{in the role of}} Colonel Glenn Ross of NASA. Anderson, who {{perceived}} a likeness to fellow American actor Paul Newman, cast Thinnes as the male lead after viewing his performance in the television series The Invaders (1967–68). In the Andersons' draft script, Ross's first name is Stewart, and he {{is said to have been}} the first man to walk on Mars. In a 2008 interview, Thinnes said, [...] "I thought [...] was an interesting premise, although now <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> isn't another planet on the other side of the Sun, through our space exploration and telescopic abilities. But at that time it was conceivable, and it could have been scary." [...] To conform to the script's characterisation of Ross, and to the detriment of his respiratory health, Thinnes ended up smoking many packets' worth of cigarettes in the course of the production. Reporting on Thinnes' intention to demand a non-smoking clause in his next film contract, in September 1969 Australian newspaper The Age stated, [...] "He smokes about two packets a day, but the perpetual lighting up of new cigarettes for continuity purposes was too much." ...|$|E

2500|$|The weaker {{form of the}} theorem can {{be proven}} from the undecidability of the halting problem as follows. Assume {{that we have a}} {{consistent}} and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers. Then we can build an algorithm that enumerates all these statements i.e. an algorithm N that, given a natural number n, computes a true first-order logic statement about natural numbers, such that for all the true statements {{there is at least one}} n such that N(n) is equal to that statement. Now suppose we want to decide whether the algorithm with representation a halts on input i. [...] By using Kleene's T predicate, we can express the statement [...] "a halts on input i" [...] as a statement H(a, i) in the language of arithmetic. Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an n such that N(n) = [...] H(a, i) or there is an n such that N(n) = ¬ H(a, i). [...] So if we iterate over all n until we either find H(a, i) or its negation, we will always halt. This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem. Since <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> cannot be such an algorithm, it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false.|$|E
2500|$|It is the Soviet Union {{that runs}} against {{the tide of}} history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep {{economic}} difficulty. The rate {{of growth in the}} national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule – 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 1981 in Poland. But the struggle continues in Poland. And <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are even those who strive and suffer for freedom {{within the confines of the}} Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people. And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO even as we move forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads." ...|$|E
2500|$|After it was {{confirmed}} that Taylforth {{was returning to}} EastEnders, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: [...] "It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a man named Gavin, who Kathy went off with to South Africa. So there's Gavin, Kathy—and lots of Phil [...] involved." [...] Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption [...] "He's on his way...". The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it {{was confirmed}} that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline. Nicholas said of his role: [...] "I am delighted to be joining the wonderful cast of EastEnders for {{what is going to be}} an exciting time ahead. I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed to join our cast to play Gavin. So many British television viewers have grown up with Paul Nicholas so it's brilliant to have him back on our screens, playing a major part in Kathy's explosive return to the Square, while also holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets." [...] Nicholas later said it was [...] "great" [...] for him to join a [...] "brilliantly produced and very well acted" [...] show, but said it was [...] "quite daunting" [...] as he had not acted in a soap opera before. He said that when he joined the cast, he met the writers who explained the character to him and gave him a [...] "really good insight into where they wanted it to go" [...] and added, [...] "It is nice to be involved in something so successful and that people actually watch." [...] Two days after Nicholas's casting was announced, Nicholas and Taylforth were seen filming on location at King's Cross station, for Gavin's introduction scene that aired on 21 August 2015, and on 30 June, on-location photos emerged of Nicholas, Taylforth, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and Samantha Womack (Ronnie Mitchell), filming at an airfield in Essex, for Gavin's third episode, broadcast on 11 September 2015.|$|E
