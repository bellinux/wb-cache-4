Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E
5|$|Ueland was {{unanimously}} fired as CEO by NSB's {{board on}} 29 June. Immediately afterwards his deputy Randi Flesland resigned, {{after she had}} rejected the board's proposal for her to become acting CEO. The same day, Adtranz assumed full responsibility for the defects, and guaranteed that they would cover NSB's costs. In a report, Adtranz stated that the axles should be examined every , which would mean weekly inspections. They stated that they hoped further inquiries <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to have less frequent inspections. This was rejected by NSB, who would not have sufficient trains to run the schedules with such a tight inspection scheme. Instead, Adtranz and NSB agreed to a new programme which would involve inspection every three weeks.|$|E

They also were fearful that if Wu Zetian died, Wei <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to execute them, and therefore accused Wei and Gao Jian (高戩), an official favoured by Princess Taiping, of speculating on Wu Zetian's old age and death. They initially got Wei's subordinate Zhang Shuo to agree to corroborate the charges, but once Zhang Shuo was before Wu Zetian, he instead accused Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong of forcing him to bear false witness. As a result, Wei, Gao, and Zhang Shuo were exiled, but escaped death.|$|E

Shortly before the robbery, Donati was seen at a nightclub with a sack of police uniforms. Donati worked under Boston crime boss Vincent Ferrara, and visited him in prison in the early 1990s.

[...] She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb {{said he did not}} understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.” Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix {{would not have been able}} to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Evert {{made her}} first {{semifinal}} at The Wimbledon Championships in 1972, {{which was a}} match that had a serve and volley player in Evonne Goolagong versus the baseliner Chris Evert. The match {{looked like it was}} going to the steely-eyed Evert, which she was up one-set to none and three-games to love in the second set and 30-love on Goolagong's service, but Goolagong reigned her focus back in and went on a comeback trail.

After that, Googlagong started bring Evert into net passing her with cross court shots to win the second set. In the third set, Evert and Googlagong had two tense games at 3-all in the third and pivotal set, which both held serve and leveled at 4-all, but from that point onwards Evert only won one point in the next two games and lost the spot in the finals.

The record was nevertheless carried by various independent distributors, which {{placed it in}} independent record shops, surf/skate shops, and [...] "head shops", in a marketing effort designed {{to appeal to the}} band's fan base. The band also adopted the Internet as a viable promotional tool, distributing their albums through early online music retailers. Despite this, Nowell had developed an addiction to heroin; at live performances, he would often be unable to make it through sets. On several occasions, he would steal the band's equipment for a night's performance to pawn for drug money, knowing band manager Michael [...] "Miguel" [...] Happoldt <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to re-acquire the equipment.

[...] The Roman Catholic archbishop of Aachen, Heinrich Mussinghoff, said that the ruling was [...] "very surprising", and the contradiction between [...] "basic rights on freedom of religion and the well-being of the child brought up by the judges is not convincing in this very case." [...] Hans Ulrich Anke, the head of the Protestant Church in Germany, said the ruling should be appealed since it didn't [...] "sufficiently" [...] consider the religious significance of the rite. A spokesman, Steffen Seibert, for German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that Jewish and Muslim communities will be free to practice circumcision responsibly, and the government <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> around the local ban in Cologne.
