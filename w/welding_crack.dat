The quality of friction welding is good {{when compared to other}} fusion welding technique. The main influence parameter in FSW is rotational speed welding traversing speed and pressure applied against the joint. AA 6061 and AA 8011 aluminium alloy has high strength to weight ratio. They have main application in the field of marine, aerospace and automobiles. As it is difficult to perform number of experiments to find out the level combinations which yield good mechanical properties like tensile strength, impact strength and hardness number, Taguchi L 9 orthogonal array is used {{to reduce the number of}} experiment.

40|$|Abstract Columnar {{jointing}} {{is thought}} to occur primarily in lavas and welded pyroclastic flow deposits. However, the non-welded Cerro Galán Ignimbrite at Paycuqui, Argentina, contains well-developed columnar joints that are instead due to high-temperature vapor-phase alteration of the deposit, where devitrification and vapor-phase crystalliza- tion have increased the density and cohesion of {{the upper half of}} the section. Thermal remanent magnetization analyses of entrained lithic clasts indicate high emplace- ment temperatures, above 630 °C, but the lack of welding textures indicates temperatures below the glass transition temperature. In order to remain below the glass transition at 630 °C, the minimum cooling rate prior to deposition was 3. 0 10 – 8. 5 102 °C/min (depending on the experimental data used for comparison). Alternatively, if the deposit was emplaced above the glass transition temperature, conduc- tive cooling alone was insufficient to prevent <b>welding.</b> <b>Crack</b> patterns (average, 4. 5 sides to each polygon) and column diameters (average, 75 cm) are consistent with relatively rapid cooling, where advective heat loss due to vapor fluxing increases cooling over simple conductive heat transfer. The presence of regularly spaced, complex radiating joint patterns is consistent with fumarolic gas rise, where volatiles originated in the valley-confined drainage system below. Joint spacing is a proxy for cooling rates and is controlled by depositional thickness/valley width. We suggest that the formation of joints in high-temperature, non-welded deposits is aided by the presence of underlying external water, where vapor transfer causes crystallization in pore spaces, densifies the deposit, and helps prevent welding...|$|E

The results are summarized as follows; (1) In ilmenite type electrode (D 4301) as the water content of the flux is increasing, the diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal is also increasing straightly. Using the dried electrode, a lot of the diffusible hydrogen are included in deposited metal. (2) In low hydrogen type electrode (D 5016 and E 11016) as the water content of the flux is increasing until 2 %, the diffusible hydrogen in deposited metal is rapidly increasing.

In the wrought alloys, cracking {{has been found to}} occur mainly in the weld metal, whilst in the cast alloys cracking is extensive in both weld metal and heat affected zone. The previously reported effects of certain impurities (P,S,Si) in increasing cracking have been confirmed, and it has also been shown that Ti and Zr may both have a crack promoting effect at levels commonly found in cupro-nickels, whilst C can interact with several of the other elements investigated to produce a beneficial effect.
