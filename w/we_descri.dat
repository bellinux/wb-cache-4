40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) allows an {{autonomous}} system (AS) to apply diverse local policies for selecting routes and propagating reachability information to other domains. However, BGP permits ASes to have conflicting policies {{that can lead}} to routing instability. This paper proposes a set of guidelines for an AS to follow in setting its routing policies, without requiring coordination with other ASes. Our approach exploits the Internet's hierarchical structure and the commercial relationships between ASes to impose a partial order on the set of routes to each destination. The guidelines conform to conventional traffic-engineering practices of ISPs, and provide each AS with significant flexibility in selecting its local policies. Furthermore, the guidelines ensure route convergence even under changes in the topology and routing policies. Drawing on a formal model of BGP, we prove that following our proposed policy guidelines guarantees route convergence. <b>We</b> also <b>descri</b> [...] ...|$|R

Agarwal Lars Arge y Jeff Erickson z Abstract We propose three {{indexing}} {{schemes for}} storing a set S of N {{points in the}} plane, each moving along a linear trajectory, so that a query of the following form can be answered quickly: Given a rectangle R and a real value tq, report all K points of S that lie inside R at time tq. We first present an indexing structure that, for any given constant " ? 0, uses O(N=B) disk blocks, where B is the block size, and answers a query in O((N=B) 1 = 2 +" +K=B) I/Os. It can also report all the points of S that lie inside R during a given time interval. A point can be inserted or deleted, or the trajectory of a point can be changed, in O(log 2 B N) I/Os. Next, we present a general approach that improves the query time if the queries arrive in chronological order, by allowing the index to evolve over time. We obtain a tradeoff between the query time {{and the number of}} times the index needs to be updated as the points move. <b>We</b> also <b>descri</b> [...] ...|$|R

We now consider structural recognition methods, the structure being that perceived by the human eye-brain combination. Here we look to classifying quadratic local descriptors as being slender. We work with the CEDAR Image Database 1 [4], the descriptors having been previously inspected in [5]. 2 Algorithm The algorithm is based on the geometric interpretation of quadratic forms as being ellipses [1], the eigenvalues yielding the axis lengths and the eigenvalues yielding the angle to the major axis. We are concerned here with the aspect ratio of the ellipses, the length of the longer axis divided by the shorter.

We present the design of our prototype inTouch system which provides a physical link between users separated by distance. Keywords Haptics, interpersonal communication, force feedback, telepresence INTRODUCTION Touch is a fundamental aspect of interpersonal communication. Whether a greeting handshake, an encouraging pat on the back, or a comforting hug, physical contact is a basic means through which people achieve a sense of connection, indicate intention, and express emotion. In close personal relationships, such as family and friends, touch is particularly important as a communicator of affection. Current interpersonal communication technology, such as telephones, video conferencing systems, and email, provides mechanisms for audio-visual and text-based interaction. Communication through touch, however, has been left largely unexplored [4]. In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>descri</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{remarkable}} things about human information processing {{is the way we}} store and retrieve information. The human associative memory is a device that has been only rather crudely approximated with computers in flexibility, selfmodifiability, and complexity of associations. In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>descri</b> be a computer language, AMPPL-II, which simulates a machine with an extensive, variable size associative memory and parall el processing capability. It was to be made fairly machine-independent and is, therefore, embedded in a high-leve 1 algebraic language. The version out lined here is built as an extension of SLI P (Symmetric List Processing Language), itself beinq embedded in FORTRAN IV. The expected range of applicability of AMPPL-II covers a rather wide area. Candidates in the non-numerical field are game playing, picture processing and image identification, encoding-decoding, simulation of cognitive behavior, multikey information retrieval, language analysis, sorting, merging, collating, query systems, and so on. Numerical applications would be matrix calculations, solution of partial differential equations, computation of auto- and crosscorrelation functions, signal correction, etc. Stimulated by this languaae, new computational techniques and algorithms may, hopefully, be developed. These, on one hand, and technological advances, on the other, may render the hardware implementation of an AMPPL-like machine economical. *N. V.

40|$|Within {{less than}} 15 years, {{the count of}} known planets {{orbiting}} stars other than the Sun has risen from none to more than 400 with detections arising from four successfully applied techniques: Doppler-wobbles, planetary transits, gravitational microlensing, and direct imaging. While the hunt for tw in Earths is on, a statistically well-defined sample {{of the population of}} planets in all their variety is required for probing models of planet forma tion and orbital evolution so that the origin of planets that harbour life, like and including ours, can be understood. Given the different character istics of the detection techniques, a complete picture can only arise from a combination of their respective results. Microlensing observations are w ell-suited to reveal statistical properties of the population of planets orbiting stars in either the Galactic disk or bulge from microlensing observ ations, but a mandatory requirement is the adoption of strictly-deterministic criteria for selecting targets and identifying signals. Here, <b>we</b> <b>descri</b> be a fully-deterministic strategy realised by means of the ARTEMiS (Automated Robotic Terrestrial Exoplanet Microlensing Search) system at the Danish 1. 54 -m telescope at ESO La Silla between June and August 2008 as part of the MiNDSTEp (Microlensing Network for the Detection of Small Terrestrial E xoplanets) campaign, making use of immediate feedback on suspected anomalies recognized by the SIGNALMEN anomaly detector. We demonstrate for the fir st time the feasibility of such an approach, and thereby the readiness for studying planet populations down to Earth mass and even below, with ground -based observations. While the quality of the real-time photometry is a crucial factor on the efficiency of the campaign, an impairment of the target selection by data of bad quality can be successfully avoided. With a smaller slew time, smaller dead time, and higher through-put, modern robotic te lescopes could significantly outperform the 1. 54 -m Danish, whereas lucky-imaging cameras could set new standards for high-precision follow-up monitor ing of microlensing events...|$|E
40|$|Description: Violence is the {{universal}} phenomenon which is multi-faceted: self-directed, interpersonal and collective. Domestic vio lence {{is one of}} the forms of interpersonal violence which is of different kind s. They are: child abuse, siblings abuse, spousal abuse and elder abuse. Our do ctoral project concentrates on spousal abuse. A home {{is believed to be the}} safe st place for human persons to live; however, for some women home often beco mes a place of abuse and torture. Due to the emergence of feminism, wife abuse a problem meant to be entertained within four walls of a home has become a responsibility of everyone in its eradication. Even though many countrie s have formulated law against this phenomenon it still persists. This is parado x. The sociological researches state that the phenomenon of spousal abuse is common invariably in all societies in the world; yet it varies according to the culture, religion, race and nation. The researches pres ent that in spousal abuse, both men and women are involving; yet in most of the cases women are victimized. It is also clear in the researches that in some cases, men are also victimized by w omen. In this context, we say that all men are neither abusers nor all women a re abused. Although men and women involve in spousal abuse, in our project, we refer only to violence against women by men considering the vulnerabilit y and fragility of women to the various abuses in conjugal relation. To analyse this problem we have taken South Indian context. South India is well-known for its contribution to the development of womens emancipation. However, still in South India due to the illiteracy, poverty and lack of options women are abused in the families by their husbands. Thus, in add ition, having taken a preferential option for women in order to emancipate them from the abuses of men, we are going to develop a redemptive paradigm which comprises of personhood of women (imago Dei, Otherness, dignity and equa lity) a covenantal aspect of marriage (reciprocal love, interdependent freedom, and co-responsibility). This ethical paradigm for the emancipation could be achieved through the practical suggestions which are done in various for ms (public education, pre and post nuptial catechism, programmes for both barterers and victims etc). Research Questions: When we analyse the problem of wife abuse, a number of questions keep disturbing us and call for our attention. What is violence and is i t justifiable? Even though different nations have enacted laws against wif e abuse, why does it persist in families? What are the basic presumptions of this problem? Is it culturally rooted in the society? Why do battered women c ontinue to remain in the abusive home? Who or which becomes a reason for batteri ng? Which is important? institution of marriage or Well-being of spouses? Canon la w is ready to give legal permanent and temporary separation of the spouses bu t not dissolution of the marriage. Why? If God created human beings in His ima ge why has that image been not recognised? If human beings have equal dignity w hy is the dignity of women not accepted? If marriage is a divine institution, from where are the inspirations for battering? Based on these questions, we research on wife abuse; can the Code of Canon Law (CCL) permit annulment of marriage in case of severe battering of a wife? Methodology: Descriptive, analytical and critical method will be employed in this doctoral project. It is descriptive to the extent that <b>we</b> <b>descri</b> be the global problem of spousal abuse in general and the context (South India) in particular. In description, we try to describe the phenomenon with the conceptual analysis on the problem. It is analytical for which analyse the problem in the light of catholic moral theology (Scrip ture, tradition and theological thinking). It is critical for we make critique on present existing culture and ideologies, which are roots for wife abuse. Consequently our critical assessment on the problem, leads to evolve a redemptive par adigm to empower women which is our goal in this research project. Structure: The proposed doctoral project consists of four chapters: the first chapter deals with the concept of violence which is identified with the use of force, violation, aggres sion, coercion and power. At the end of our analysis on these concepts, we def ine the term violence. The second chapter analyses the phenomenon of spousal abuse. This chapter explores the context of spousal abuse, historical ov erview, forms and factors pertaining to wife abuse. This chapter consists of two parts. The first part, elaborately discusses the nature and forms of wife abuse. It discusses physical, sexual, psychological and economic abuses perpetrate d against wife in a family. The second part deals with factors pertaining to wife abuse. Sociological, religious, anthropological factors are identified i n this section. We link this part with the context of Tamilnadu, (South India), analysing the literature, religion, and customs, which play vital role in wife abuse in Tamilnadu. The third chapter elucidates moral perspective of spousal abuse. This chapter consists of two parts. The first part, deals elabora tely the canonical perspective in which we analyse the role and place of wome n in marriage and family. It also speaks about the place of women in the cath olic theology. In which, we analyse the images of women in the catholic ethic al teachings. The second part deals with the redemptive paradigm. This part is divided into three sections. The first section deals with the personhood of wome n. Under this topic we discuss the dignity of women and Imago Dei. God has create d all human beings with equal dignity for they are in the imago Dei. The Imago Dei is the liberating image of God. Since human beings are in the image of God, image of God in women m ust also be respected equally. The second section deals with elements of empowerment in the conjugal relation. This division speaks of the family life which consists in reciprocal love, equality, freedom and co-responsibili ty. Third section deals with church and dialogue with the situation of women. This is the further step to be taken by the church in order to empower women form th e abuses. Here, we mention voices of the local churches against the spousa l abuse. Based on the above discussion we analyse teachings of the Church and propose guidelines for a happy married life. The fourth chapter suggests the practical way of eradicating the spousal abuse in the South Indian society. This could be done in the local level using the local media, public education, pre and post nuptial catechism, and programmes for both barterers and victims etc. status: publishe...|$|E
