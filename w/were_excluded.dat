5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). One of the reasons was the disbanding of the Rifle Corps between August and September 1941 and the consequent removal of the corps artillery. Moreover, all 152mm howitzers <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from divisional artillery. As a result, there was no series production of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E

5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however. A protracted {{battle over}} parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage.

5|$|Since 1714, Britain {{had shared}} a monarch with Hanover in Germany, but under Salic law women <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from the Hanoverian succession.

5|$|The Albanian state led also {{efforts to}} {{establish}} an independent orthodox church, contrary to {{the provisions of the}} Protocol of Corfu and thereby reducing the influence of Greek language in the region.

5|$|Two groups <b>were</b> <b>excluded.</b> Roman Catholics who {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} Pope would not be tolerated. They were, in fact, regarded as traitors, because the Pope had refused to accept Elizabeth as Queen of England. Roman Catholics were given the hard choice of being loyal either to their church or their country. For some priests it meant life on the run, in some cases death for treason.|$|E
5|$|A quick {{peace was}} {{essential}} to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the Main River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from the North German Confederation.|$|E

5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from the House of Commons. Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Although they <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> {{from the}} formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to {{interact}} with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues {{to interact with}} the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E
5|$|Cornwall County Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1894, and first competed in the Minor Counties Championship in 1904.

The Tour {{organizers}} were {{happy with the}} result, but the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF) started an investigation after complaints from other cyclists. Their investigative committee heard testimony from dozens of competitors and witnesses, and, in December 1904, disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers (Maurice Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Aucouturier). Ten of those disqualified were banned for one year, Maurice Garin {{for two years and}} the remaining two for life. In total, 29 riders were punished.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
