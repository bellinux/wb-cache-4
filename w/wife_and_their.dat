5|$|As {{newspapers}} were banned and letters infrequent, the Romanovs {{under house arrest}} knew little of the fate of Tsar Nicholas and his family. Nicholas, his <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children, were originally held at their official residence, the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, but the provisional government under Alexander Kerensky relocated them to Tobolsk, Siberia. Eventually, in July 1918, after being transferred to Yekaterinburg, Nicholas {{and his family were}} killed by their Bolshevik guards. In the Crimea, the Grand Duchess's family were condemned to death by the Yalta revolutionary council but the executions were stayed by the Sevastopol council, who refused to act without orders from Moscow. In March 1918, German forces advanced on the Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.|$|E

5|$|In February 1897, the New York Times prematurely {{reported}} {{his death}} in a New York mental asylum. Some authors claim that he contracted syphilis, {{which may have been}} a cause of the mental breakdowns he suffered in his last years. In the months prior to his death, he spent some time in institutions {{as a result of his}} failing mental health. His chess activities had not yielded any great financial rewards, and he died a pauper in the Manhattan State Hospital (Ward Island) of a heart attack on August 12, 1900. Steinitz is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York. His second <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> two young children were still alive at his death.|$|E

The murderers evidently had no specific grievance with the victims, who were targets of opportunity. Two Ho-Chunk suspects were arrested by Prairie du Chien militiamen and taken to Fort Crawford. After they escaped, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Willoughby Morgan seized two Ho-Chunk hostages and demanded that the Ho-Chunk tribe turn over the murderers.|$|E

A well-known man, Hart had no political experience; he was never elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember the exact location of his body, and it was never moved.

The officer in charge immediately reported the incident, contacting Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. Dönitz's adjutant, who had accepted the call, initially thought that it was a bad joke. He then called Lüth's brother, Joachim, as the two siblings had been staying together. It was he who informed Lüth's <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> four children that Lüth had died.|$|E

5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what {{he thought}} was an unusual insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed by the people who make contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David {{stands in the middle of}} a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invades a family home, kills the father, and holds the <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> two children captive.|$|E
5|$|Born in Wellington, Shout {{had served}} in the Second Boer War as a teenager. He rose to {{sergeant}} and was mentioned in despatches for saving a wounded man before being discharged in 1902.

He was also active in the part-time Citizens' Forces, being commissioned just prior to the outbreak of the First World War. In August 1914, he joined in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for active service overseas and was appointed a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion. After training in Egypt, he took part in the Anzac landings at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. For his leadership during the invasion and its immediate aftermath, Shout was awarded the Military Cross and later mentioned in despatches. Shout's three gallantry awards at Gallipoli made him the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.|$|E
5|$|By 11 May, the {{possibility}} of a deal between the Liberal Democrats and Labour was looking unlikely. Talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding {{that he would not be}} able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation that evening. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. He then left Downing Street with his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children, and drove to Buckingham Palace where he tendered his resignation to the Queen and advised her to call for David Cameron. Cameron became Prime Minister one hour after the Queen accepted Brown's resignation, and arrived at Downing Street with his wife, Samantha shortly afterwards. In his first address outside 10 Downing Street, he announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Cameron met with his MPs in the Committee Room of the House of Commons at 10.00pm, where he was greeted with cheering that could be heard from the central hall of the Commons.|$|E
