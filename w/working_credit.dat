40|$|Over recent years, several {{developed}} countries have implemented {{earned income tax}} credits {{in order to encourage}} welfare recipients to move into work. Here, we investigate the impact of ‘Working Credits', which increased the incentives for welfare recipients to work, but only for a temporary period. Using differences-in-differences and regression-adjusted differences-in-differences, we find evidence that the introduction of the <b>Working</b> <b>Credit</b> increased employment rates, earnings and exits for those on income support. Results from matched differences-in-differences are less precise, but generally consistent with the other two empirical strategies. Back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that on a cost-per-job basis, the <b>Working</b> <b>Credit</b> compares favourably with existing labour market programs. ...|$|E

40|$|Wide {{interest}} margins as {{witnessed in}} Kenya {{are a sign}} of a repressed and inefficient financial sector. This paper carries out a cross-country analysis of the determinants of financial market efficiency using panel cointegration with a view to recommending policy options for improving the efficiency of the financial sector intermediation process in Kenya. The study finds that the major contributors to the differences in financial sector inefficiency in Kenya compared to the other countries in the study are high bank operating costs, default risk and financial market structure. The study recommends, among other measures, that the government through the Central Bank need to collaborate with the commercial banks and establish a <b>working</b> <b>credit</b> reference bureau to enable easy identification of credit worthy customers in order to reduce default risk; there is also need by the central bank to license more new banks to increase competition and reduce bank concentration. The study also recommends increased use of technology including phone-banking and e-banking to reduce operation costs of the banks. The paper concludes that contrary to the findings from other cross-country analysis, the factors that lead to financial market in/efficiency varies from one country to the other.

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the two-tier bank system fifty years ago, the Hungarian commercial banking sector has not only formed in its institutions but it has even strengthened. The consolidation period followed by the stabilization period has meant both the improvement of the credit society and supervisory control, and even the formation of the more cautious credit processes, which was followed by the western investors in the banking sector. The fusions of the financial institutions in the privatised Hungarian banking sector were followed by the concentration of capital and centralization launching good bases for the further stabilization in the Hungarian financial sector. On the one hand the advanced state level {{has become one of the}} key factors of the economic growth in Hungary, on the other hand the control of the participants in the financial and capital market meaning the suppression of the grey and black market.

40|$|After a {{long period}} during which the retreat of the state was fashion-able, {{for some time now}} the return of the state {{has been the subject of}} intense discussion. Whether the issue is minimum wages, {{training}} and education, ensuring a <b>working</b> <b>credit</b> system, or dealing with the global financial crisis, a strong role for the state has once again come to be seen in the public debate as fairly positive or, at the very least, as necessary. At the same time, there is some doubt concerning whether the general »change of mood « really constitutes a paradigm shift in the politics of the state. Taking due account of this uncertainty, in this article an attempt is made to garner some insights from the historical evolution of ideal mod-els of the state with regard to its practical relevance and future develop-ment. »Ideal Models « in Politics »Ideal models « are of central importance in politics. According to Heinrich Schneider (1992), they represent a dialectically related ensemble of objectives and patterns of perception and interpretation which confer a certain »structure of relevance « on concrete situations. One can talk of a change of ideal model when, against the background of a change in a society’s problem horizon, political goals are fundamentally redefined. The transformation of political ideal models or paradigms, therefore, may be inferred from the specific interaction of general material changes and their discursive-ideal processing (see also Jessop 2002 : 92 ff). Such transformations are contested to the extent that – particularly during times of crisis – usually several ideal models compete with one another. Which of the ideal models eventually prevails is difficult to anticipate. It...|$|E
