Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of dominus Italiae (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences {{in the northern part of}} the Po plain, and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.|$|E

Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the Becket controversy.

Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf's time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family.|$|E

According to Szamosközy, Stephen Báthory also ordered Sigismund's companions to talk of foreign lands, wars, and hunting with him during their dinners together. He reorganized the government on 3May 1583, charging Sándor Kendi, Farkas Kovacsóczy, and László Sombori <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of Transylvania during Sigismund's minority. The Diet suggested to Stephen Báthory that he dismiss them, but he only dissolved the council on 1May 1585. He replaced the three councillors with the devout Calvinist János Ghyczy, making him regent for Sigismund.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the rule}} of Frederick III (I), the Brandenburg Prussian territories were de facto reduced to provinces of the monarchy. Frederick William's {{testament}} would have divided Brandenburg-Prussia among his sons, yet firstborn Frederick III with the emperor's backing succeeded in becoming the sole ruler based on the Treaty of Gera, which forbade a division of Hohenzollern territories. In 1689, a new central chamber for all Brandenburg-Prussian territories was created, called Geheime Hofkammer (since 1713: Generalfinanzdirektorium). This chamber functioned as a superior agency of the territories' Amtskammer chambers. The General War Commissariat (Generalkriegskommissariat) emerged as a second central agency, superior to the local Kriegskommissariat agencies initially concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the army, but until 1712 transformed into an agency also concerned with general tax and police tasks.|$|E
5|$|Urged by the Antiochene noblemen, Baldwin III proclaimed Bohemond the {{rightful}} ruler, charging Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the principality during Bohemond's minority.

However, the Antiochene noblemen rebelled against her with the assistance of Thoros II, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, forcing her to leave Antioch in February 1163.|$|E
5|$|During the 7th century {{there were}} {{significant}} changes to the East Platform, including {{a new version of}} Temple 5D-87 that faced away from the Mundo Perdido. Around AD 700 this version was sealed and another version built on top, making Temple 5D-87 one of the three highest structures in the Mundo Perdido. This new version created a new orienting axis in the complex, breaking the primary axis associated with the ancient E-Group complex and its relationship with the old solar cult, thus marking a major change in the ceremonial use of the Mundo Perdido complex. It is about this same time that the twin pyramid complex came into use, demonstrating a major internal reorganisation of the city. During the Late Classic, access to the complex was gradually restricted by closing various access points with new structures, this included discontinuing the use of the causeway that had linked the complex with the North Acropolis since the Preclassic. A new palace complex was built in the northern section of the Mundo Perdido, developing during the 7th and 8th centuries AD; This marked an important change {{in the use of the}} Mundo Perdido, which until then had been dedicated to purely ritual activities. The construction of the palace indicates the permanent inhabitation of the complex by an elite group, apparently involved in some way <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the city.|$|E

Duke Student Government (DSG) charters and provides {{most of the}} funding for other student groups and represents students' interests when dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> The Duke University Union (DUU) is the school's primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life.

One of the most popular activities on campus is competing in sports. Duke has 37 , and several intramural teams that are officially recognized. Performance groups such as Hoof 'n' Horn, the country's second-oldest student-run musical theater organization, a cappella groups, student bands, and theater organizations are also prominent on campus. As of the 2016–2017 school year, there are seven a cappella groups recognized by the Duke University A Cappella Council: Deja Blue, Lady Blue, Out of the Blue, the Pitchforks, Rhythm & Blue, Something Borrowed Something Blue, and Speak of the Devil.

5|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration encouraged Japanese {{businessmen and}} settlers to the expand phosphate mining and copra production, which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era. During this time, new infrastructure was built between towns—including road and harbour facilities, and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out. Immigration from Japan, Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified {{as a result}} of new job opportunities. A state-owned enterprise, Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Colonization Corporation) was formed in 1936 to streamline the islands' economic activities <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> objective of developing the islands' self-sufficiency capabilities. In the late 1930s, Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea, and stopped by Palau from October to April. The influx of pearl divers from Japan {{led to the development of}} the island's tourist industry, and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés, geisha houses and liquor houses in Koror to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April.|$|E
5|$|The {{contact between}} South India and Islam {{goes back to}} the 7th century, when trade between Hindu kingdoms and Islamic caliphates thrived. These Muslim traders settled on the Malabar Coast and married local Hindu women, and their {{descendants}} {{came to be known as}} Mappillas. By the 14th century, Muslims had become a significant minority in the south, though the advent of Portuguese missionaries checked their growth. Haider Ali, though a devout Muslim, did not allow his faith to interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the predominantly Hindu kingdom. Historians are, however, divided on the intentions of Haider Ali's son, Tipu Sultan. It has been claimed that Tipu raised Hindus to prominent positions in his administration, made generous grants to Hindu temples and brahmins, and generally respected other faiths, and that any religious conversions that Tipu undertook were as punishment to those who rebelled against his authority. However, this has been countered by other historians who claim that Tipu Sultan treated the non-Muslims of Mysore far better than those of the Malabar, Raichur and Kodagu regions. They opine that Tipu was responsible for mass conversions of Christians and Hindus in these regions, either by force or by offering them tax incentives and revenue benefits to convert.|$|E
