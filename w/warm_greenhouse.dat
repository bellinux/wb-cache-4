6000|$|With {{respect to}} the {{following}} experiments, I must premise that the leaves, both those placed in the solutions and in water, were taken from plants which had been kept in a very <b>warm</b> <b>greenhouse</b> during the winter. They were thus rendered extremely sensitive, as was shown by water exciting them much {{more than in the}} previous experiments. Before giving my observations, it may be well to remind the reader that, judging from thirty-one fine leaves, the average number of tentacles is 192, and that the outer or exterior ones, the movements of which are alone significant, are to the short ones on the disc in the proportion of about sixteen to nine.

60|$|Plants {{which have}} lived {{for some time}} in a rather high {{temperature}} are far {{more sensitive to the}} action of water than those grown out of doors, or recently brought into a <b>warm</b> <b>greenhouse.</b> Thus in the above seventeen cases, in which the immersed leaves had a considerable number of tentacles inflected, the plants had been kept during the winter in a very warm greenhouse; and they bore in the early spring remarkably fine leaves, of a light red colour. Had I then known that the sensitiveness of plants was thus increased, perhaps I should not have used the leaves for my experiments with the very weak solutions of phosphate of ammonia; but my experiments are not thus vitiated, as I invariably used leaves from the same plants for simultaneous immersion in water. It often happened that some leaves on the same plant, and some tentacles on the same leaf, were more sensitive than others; but why this should be so, I do not know.|$|E
60|$|It {{is also a}} {{remarkable}} fact that the Chelsea-crossed plants exceeded the two other lots in hardiness, as greatly {{as they did in}} height, luxuriance, and fertility. In the early autumn most of the pots were bedded out in the open ground; and this always injures plants which have been long kept in a <b>warm</b> <b>greenhouse.</b> All three lots consequently suffered greatly, but the Chelsea-crossed plants much less than the other two lots. On the 3rd of October the Chelsea-crossed plants began to flower again, and continued to do so for some time; whilst not a single flower was produced by the plants of the other two lots, the stems of which were cut almost down to the ground and seemed half dead. Early in December there was a sharp frost, and the stems of Chelsea-crossed were now cut down; but on the 23rd of December they began to shoot up again from the roots, whilst all the plants of the other two lots were quite dead.|$|E

Natural processes such as solar-irradiance variations, variations in the Earth's orbital parameters, and volcanic activity can produce variations in climate. The climate system can also be influenced by changes in the concentration of various gases in the atmosphere, which affect the Earth's absorption of radiation.

Outdoors, it should be grown in moisture-retentive, fertile soil in full sun. It can be propagated from seed or semi-ripe cuttings and provided with bottom heat for both. Wooly Congea is easy to grow in almost any soil type. It should be watered regularly.|$|E
50|$|During this period, the Earth {{entered a}} long, <b>warm</b> <b>greenhouse</b> phase, {{supported}} by high CO2 levels of 4500 ppm, and warm shallow seas covered {{much of the}} equatorial land masses. Early in the Silurian, glaciers retreated back into the South Pole until they almost disappeared {{in the middle of}} Silurian. The period witnessed a relative stabilization of the Earth's general climate, ending the previous pattern of erratic climatic fluctuations. Layers of broken shells (called coquina) provide strong evidence of a climate dominated by violent storms generated then as now by warm sea surfaces. Later in the Silurian, the climate cooled slightly, but closer to the Silurian-Devonian boundary, the climate became warmer.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, cold frames {{were built}} {{to be used}} in {{addition}} to a heated greenhouse. The name itself exemplifies the distinction between the <b>warm</b> <b>greenhouse</b> and the unheated cold frame. They were frequently built as part of the greenhouse's foundation brickwork along the southern wall (in northern latitudes). This allowed seeds to be germinated in the greenhouse and then easily moved to the attached cold frame to be [...] "hardened-off" [...] before final planting outside. Cold frames are similar to some enclosed hotbeds, also called hotboxes. The difference is in the amount of heat generated inside. This is parallel to the way that some greenhouses are called [...] "hothouses" [...] to emphasize their higher temperature, achieved either by the solar effects alone or by auxiliary heating via a heater or HVAC system of some kind.|$|E

40|$|Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden {{takes at}} least five years to {{initiate}} flower buds from seed and is an infrequent and light flowerer. Because this behavior constitutes a major impediment to breeding programs, we examined the mechanisms controlling floral induction in E. nitens, with the long-term aim of reducing generation time and increasing seed yield. Application of paclobutrazol reduced the concentration of endogenous gibberellic acid (GA) in apical tissue and enhanced the reproductive activity of grafted trees maintained outside over winter in Canberra, Australia. Grafts maintained in a <b>warm</b> <b>greenhouse</b> over winter did not produce flower buds, despite the paclobutrazol-induced reduction in GA concentration of the apical tissue. Exposing untreated grafts, which had been maintained over winter in a <b>warm</b> <b>greenhouse,</b> to low temperature the following spring reduced growth but did not induce flower bud production. Addition of GA 3 to paclobutrazol-treated grafts reduced the effect of paclobutrazol on reproductive activity...|$|E

40|$|Oxygen isotope {{analyses}} of well-preserved foraminifera from Blake Nose (30 °N paleolatitude, North Atlantic) and globally distributed deep-sea sites provide a long-term paleotemperature {{record for the}} late Albian-Maastrichtian interval {{that is difficult to}} reconcile with the existence of significant Cretaceous ice sheets. Given reasonable assumptions about the isotopic composition of Cretaceous seawater, our results suggest that middle bathyal water temperatures at Blake Nose increased from ~ 12 °C in the late Albian through middle Cenomanian to a maximum of 20 °C during the latest Cenomanian and earliest Turonian. Bottom waters were again ~ 12 °C during the middle Campanian and cooled to a minimum of 9 °C during the Maastrichtian. Correlative middle bathyal foraminifera from other ocean basins yield paleotemperature estimates that are very similar to those from Blake Nose. Comparison of global bottom-water temperatures and latitudinal thermal gradients suggests that global climate changed from a <b>warm</b> <b>greenhouse</b> state during the late Albian through late Cenomanian to a hot greenhouse phase during the latest Cenomanian through early Campanian, then to cool greenhouse conditions during the mid-Campanian through Maastrichtian...|$|E

40|$|Middle Eocene hemipelagic marls {{from the}} Pazin-Trieste Basin, a {{foreland}} basin of the Croatian Dinarides, display repetitive alternations of {{two types of}} marls with different resistance to weathering. This study focuses on the chemical composition, stable isotopes, and palynomorph content of these marls {{in order to better}} understand the nature of their cyclic deposition and to identify possible paleoenvironmental drivers responsible for their formation. The less resistant marls (LRM) have consistently lower carbonate content, lower δ 18 O and δ 13 C values, and more abundant dinoflagellate cysts than the more resistant marls (MRM). We interpret these differences between the two marl types to be a result of climatic variations, likely related to Milankovitch oscillations. Periods with wetter climate, associated with increased continental runoff, detrital and nutrient influx produced the LRM. Higher nutrient supply sparked higher dinoflagellate productivity during these times, while reduced salinity and stratification of the water column may have hampered the productivity of calcareous nannoplankton and/or planktonic foraminifera. In contrast, the MRM formed during dryer periods which favoured higher carbonate accumulation rates.
