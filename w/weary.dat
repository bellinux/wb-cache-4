5|$|The mule, {{especially}} its fur, was intensely textured and detailed {{to make it}} look visually rough and bristly, and the mule itself <b>weary</b> and worn. The same techniques were applied to the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} {{volume to}} Proud Shoes, her memoir Song in a <b>Weary</b> Throat: An American Pilgrimage, was published posthumously in 1987.

Kennedy Book Award, the Christopher Award, and the Lillian Smith Book Award.|$|E
60|$|O we are <b>wearied</b> of {{this sense}} of guilt, <b>Wearied</b> of pleasure's paramour despair, <b>Wearied</b> of every temple we have built, <b>Wearied</b> of every right, {{unanswered}} prayer, For man is weak; God sleeps: and heaven is high: One fiery-coloured moment: one great love; and lo! we die.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} historian Yahya of Antioch, the conspirators of 1022 were released by Constantine VIII after Basil's death in 1025, but Xiphias remained in exile until 1028, when the new emperor, Romanos III, released him. Xiphias, however, was by now too old and <b>weary,</b> and soon retired to the Stoudios Monastery. Nothing further is known of him.|$|E
5|$|Betances, who had {{collected}} {{more money in}} France for the Party than the plan's potential cost, grew <b>weary</b> of the Cuban revolutionary movement's diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause. By then, some of the Party's followers stationed in France wanted Betances to be stripped of his posts and assignments. At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental health to have her harass her husband systematically.|$|E
5|$|By February 1918, {{the crews}} of Sankt Georg {{and several other}} {{warships}} grew <b>weary</b> {{of the war and}} the long periods of inactivity, which led to the Cattaro Mutiny. The mutiny was quickly suppressed, but Sankt Georg and several other ships were subsequently decommissioned. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sankt Georg was awarded as a war prize to Britain. In 1920, she was sold to Italian ship breakers and scrapped thereafter.|$|E

50|$|Lord <b>Weary's</b> Castle, Robert Lowell's {{second book}} of poetry, won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1947 when Lowell was only thirty. Robert Giroux, {{who was the}} {{publisher}} of Lowell's wife at the time, Jean Stafford, also became Lowell's publisher after he saw the manuscript for Lord <b>Weary's</b> Castle and was very impressed; he later stated that Lord <b>Weary's</b> Castle was the most successful book of poems that he ever published.|$|R

5|$|Eventually, {{if they do}} not die {{in battle}} or from some other cause, the Elves of Middle-earth grow <b>weary</b> of it and desire to go to Valinor, where the Valar {{originally}} sheltered their kind. Those who wish to leave for the Undying Lands often go by boats provided at the Grey Havens, where Círdan the Shipwright dwells with his folk.|$|E
5|$|Laevinus {{had begun}} {{exploring}} {{the possibility of}} an alliance with the Aetolian League, as early as 212 BC. The Aetolians, war <b>weary,</b> had made peace with Philip at Naupactus in 217 BC. However five years later the pendulum had swung in the other direction, the war faction was on the ascendency, and the Aetolians were once again ready to consider taking up arms against their traditional enemy, Macedon.|$|E
5|$|The Romney Literary Society's library {{suffered}} significant losses {{during the}} war, {{and by the}} war's end in 1865, only about 400 volumes of its once large 3,000-volume library could be located. Many of the society's members never returned from the war, {{and those who did}} were at first too <b>weary</b> and discouraged to revive the society or the Romney Classical Institute.|$|E
6000|$|... 291. ~what time~: {{common in}} poetry for 'when' (Lat. quo tempore). Compare Horace, Od. iii. 6: [...] "what time the sun shifted {{the shadows of}} the mountains, and took the yokes from the <b>wearied</b> oxen." [...] ~laboured~: <b>wearied</b> with labour.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked so}} very pretty, with the rare, genuine, and {{youthful}} excitement that transfigured her <b>wearied</b> and <b>wearying</b> regularity of feature, that Lee contented himself with drinking in her prettiness {{as he would}} have inhaled the perfume of some flower.|$|R
6000|$|If thou hast {{run with}} the footmen and they have <b>wearied</b> thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? And if {{in the land of}} peace wherein thou trustedst they <b>wearied</b> thee, then how wilt thou do in the {{swelling}} of Jordan? ...|$|R
5|$|A {{few months}} later, a highly {{unstable}} Osborn has partially regained his sanity {{with the help}} of anti-psychotic drugs. He comes to see Parker as the son he had always wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails. Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, an emotionally <b>weary</b> Parker tells Osborn he is tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce.|$|E
5|$|A <b>weary</b> emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become <b>weary</b> of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E

5|$|By 1966, Reynolds {{had grown}} <b>weary</b> of touring and Stewart wanted {{to strike out}} on his own as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber {{developed}} an exit strategy of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967. The group followed this strategy successfully, and on June 17, 1967, the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m <b>weary</b> of {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when}} you try out a new idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo III left a Tuscany one of {{the poorest}} nations in Europe; the {{treasury}} empty and the people <b>weary</b> of religious bigotry, the state itself was reduced to a gaming chip in European affairs. Among his enduring edicts is the establishment of the Chianti wine region. Gian Gastone repealed Cosimo's Jewish persecution laws, and eased tariffs and customs. Cosimo's inability to uphold Tuscany's independence led to the succession of the House of Lorraine upon Gian Gastone's death in 1737.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{an unfortunate}} {{accident}} during the Spring of April 6, 2009, Makoto Yuki (Akira Ishida) {{arrives in the}} city late at night on a delayed train. Upon disembarking at midnight, a strange phenomenon grips the city—shutting down all forms of technology and causing humans to become encased in coffins. Unperturbed, Makoto casually {{makes his way to}} the Iwatodai Dormitory where a mysterious boy (Akira Ishida) greets him with a contract after which he meets fellow dormmates, Yukari Takeba (Megumi Toyoguchi) and Mitsuru Kirijo (Rie Tanaka), albeit the pair <b>weary</b> of his arrival at midnight.|$|E
5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. <b>Weary</b> of being {{tied to a}} throne which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty and because there seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Growing <b>weary</b> of his workload, Gray and {{his wife}} {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} Britain, Egypt (for three months), and Switzerland in September 1868. It was during the winter spent in Egypt that Gray first grew his white beard. They returned in autumn 1869. In early 1872 Gray tried to resign his professorship and garden duties still with no replacement for himself. He proposed only looking after the herbarium and writing books in exchange for the rent of the house in which he {{and his wife}} lived on the university grounds. Due to the way the finances of the funding sources were handled and the lack of a replacement, Gray was unable to resign at that time.|$|E
