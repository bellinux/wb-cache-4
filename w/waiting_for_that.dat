500|$|Following {{the end of}} the season, Torres agreed a new {{contract}} with Liverpool, which he signed on 14 August. By signing, Torres had the option of a one-year extension after the contract's expiration in 2013. Torres scored two goals in a 3–2 win over West Ham United on 19 September 2009, a result that took Liverpool to third in the Premier League. One week later, he scored his first hat-trick of the 2009–10 Premier League season in a 6–1 victory over Hull City at Anfield. He was named Premier League Player of the Month for September, after scoring five goals during the month and becoming the Premier League's top goalscorer. On 25 October 2009, he scored the first goal in a 2–0 victory for Liverpool over Manchester United, after which Rafael Benítez praised Torres' performance, saying, [...] "We were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> final pass. When it came we knew he would score." [...] Torres was named in the FIFPro World XI for the second successive season in December 2009. His stoppage-time winning goal against Aston Villa on 29 December 2009 made him the fastest Liverpool player ever to score 50 league goals. He was substituted on 65 minutes in a 1–1 draw with Birmingham City on 4 April 2010, which Benítez justified by saying Torres was [...] "exhausted". Torres made his last appearance of the season scoring twice in a 4–1 victory over Benfica in the Europa League on 8 April 2010, and it was announced on 18 April that he would miss {{the rest of the season}} to undergo knee surgery. This meant that Torres finished the season with 22 goals in 32 games in all competitions, finishing as Liverpool's top scorer for the second time.|$|E
500|$|Screen Daily says, [...] "Notices will focus—rightly—on Craig's {{magnetism}} as the steely, sexy, murderous MI6 agent, but {{two other}} factors weigh in and freshen up proceedings: Forster's new technical team, led by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Dennis Gassner. And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs {{is the only}} real relationship on screen." [...] The review continues, [...] "Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the Martin Scorsese of the BAFTAs: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the GDP {{of one of the}} small nations it depicts, it's still <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> Alexander Korda award. The best Casino Royale could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?" [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who praised the previous film, disliked Quantum of Solace. He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that [...] "James Bond is not an action hero." [...] Kate Muir wrote in The Times that [...] "The Bond franchise is 50 years old this year, and the scriptless mess of Quantum of Solace may be considered its mid-life crisis", before she went on to praise the film's successor Skyfall as a [...] "resurrection". Some writers criticised the choice of Quantum of Solace as a title. [...] "Yes, it's a bad title," [...] wrote Marni Weisz, the editor of Famous, a Canadian film publication distributed in cinemas in that country, in an editorial entitled [...] "At least it's not Octopussy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2014, Lyft, another ridesharing service, {{reported}} to CNNMoney that 177 Uber employees had ordered and canceled approximately 5,560 rides since October 2013, {{and that it}} had found links to Uber recruiters by cross-referencing the phone numbers involved. The CNN Money report identified one Lyft passenger who canceled 300 rides from May 26 to June 10, 2014, and who was identified as an Uber recruiter by seven different Lyft drivers. On this occasion, Uber did not issue an apology, but suggested in a statement on its website that the recruitment attempts were possibly independent parties trying to make money. A Lyft spokesperson stated to CNN Money: [...] "It's unfortunate for affected community members that they have used these tactics, as it wastes a driver's time and impacts the next passenger <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> driver." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oscar, having {{married and}} {{maligned}} the sweet-souled, now hopelessly alcoholic Birdie (Patricia Collinge) to acquire her family's plantation and its cotton fields, {{now wants to}} join forces with Benjamin to construct a cotton mill. They approach their sister with their need for an additional $75,000 {{to invest in the}} project. Oscar initially proposes a marriage between his son Leo (Dan Duryea) and Regina's daughter Alexandra (Teresa Wright) – first cousins – as a means of getting Horace's money; but Horace and Alexandra are repulsed by the suggestion. When Regina asks Horace outright for the money, he refuses. She tells him his refusal is not important since he will die soon and she is eagerly <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> day to come. Alexandra overhears the conversation and is distraught. [...] She then comforts her father after Regina leaves the room.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2011, Douglas County, Colorado, sheriff's deputies arrested Davis in Highlands Park, Colorado, at the Town Center in Highlands Ranch, for third-degree {{assault and}} disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors, {{stemming}} from a dispute between Davis and 50-year-old Jeff Maes about a parking space. Maes and his family got to a parking spot first and parked in it. A witness told police that Davis then confronted Maes and said, [...] "I was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> spot and it wasn't right {{for you to take}} it." [...] When Maes refused to move, Davis struck Maes. The blow sent Maes to the ground. Davis was released on a $1,750 bail bond. When prosecutors later learned that Maes may have suffered a broken vertebra in the incident, they increased one of the charges against Davis to second-degree assault (a felony), a crime of violence that carries a five-year mandatory minimum, and Davis's bond was raised to $10,000. Neither Maes nor a third man present at the scene have been charged in the incident. Davis later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and received a two-year probationary sentence.|$|E
