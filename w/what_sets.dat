According to Jonathan Wilson, <b>what</b> <b>sets</b> apart Modrić from old-school playmakers (number ten) like Juan Román Riquelme is the universality due to increased defensive responsibility, a quality which was insisted by Valeriy Lobanovskyi and Arrigo Sacchi that should make a modern footballer.|$|E

The Hermandad de la Sagrada Pasion is the first in the province to have initiated the narration of the passion in dramatized form as the pasos are brought out to the streets.

500|$|The New York Times Stephen Holden gave a mixed review {{saying the}} film [...] "does a better-than-average job of {{conveying}} the panic and helplessness of men terrorized by a sadist in a degrading environment, {{but it is}} still not especially scary. <b>What</b> <b>sets</b> its demon apart from run-of-the-mill movie serial killers is his impulse to humiliate and torture his victims and justify it with some twisted morality." [...] He said the film is [...] "seriously undermined by the half-baked, formulaic detective story in which the horror is framed." [...] Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times also gave the film a mixed review saying, [...] "Saw is so full of twists it ends up getting snarled. For all of his flashy engineering and inventive torture scenarios, the Jigsaw Killer comes across as an amateur. Hannibal Lecter would have him for lunch." [...] She said the film [...] "carelessly underscores its own shaky narrative at every turn with its mid-budget hokiness." [...] She also noted that Elwes and Whannell had trouble keeping an American accent. Another mixed review came from Roger Ebert, who gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and lamented the gimmicks and plot contrivances but nonetheless described Saw as [...] "well made and acted, and does what it does about as well as it could be expected to." ...|$|E
500|$|Neutopia {{received}} much coverage from various video gaming websites after its release on the Virtual Console, and each drew similar similarities to Zelda. Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that Neutopia was released {{two years before}} [...] and said that Neutopia [...] "kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that [...] "the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield", but {{he noted that the}} things that keep the game from being better than Zelda were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for those who do not own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several [...] "head-scratching moments" [...] which include references to Judaism and Islam as well as quotes from Star Wars. Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to Zelda, including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that <b>what</b> <b>sets</b> it apart from Zelda are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying Zelda, might be better as it added additional features that set it apart. Destructoid's Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of Zelda to China Warriors copying of Kung-Fu Master, and he pointed out what are also considered Zelda clones such as Crusader of Centy and Alundra for the Sega Genesis and PlayStation, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Come What(ever) May was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive critical reviews. Several reviewers noted how it helped to further establish Stone Sour. Chad Bower of About.com stated that the band had [...] "progressed a lot since their debut", noting that the album was [...] "very diverse and [...] the band to show many different sides of their musical personality". Megan Frye of Allmusic opened her review of the album by distinguishing <b>what</b> <b>sets</b> Stone Sour apart musically, writing [...] " [...] ability to create smooth, radio-friendly alternative metal songs while simultaneously not boring {{the people who have}} heard way too much from post-grunge groups." [...] On a similar note, Michael Melchor of 411mania said, [...] "The band is much better at the craft of songwriting than many of their peers." [...] In contrast, reviewer William Fry of IGN criticized the album, writing, [...] "Stone Sour doesn't do anything inspired, original, or fresh here," [...] even calling the album [...] "completely misdirected, and stonewalled". A particular point of interest for reviewers was how Come What(ever) May is more melodic than the band's previous album Stone Sour. Melchor of 411mania said the album is [...] "much more liberal with the balladry and acoustic sounds than its predecessor"; of the track [...] "Sillyworld" [...] he said, [...] "It sounds like what Nickelback could be if Chad Kroeger could write a good melody." [...] In his review, Chad Bower labeled Come What(ever) May as a [...] "very melodic and accessible album" [...] writing that [...] "it has a little something for everyone". Similarly, Megan Frye praised the album as an [...] "unyielding effort from a promising talent".|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to being}} {{released}} as a single, [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] received a mixed response by reviewers when commenting on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. Melbourne based webzine [...] reviewer Andrew Weaver {{comments on the}} song's musical layering, coupling the song with [...] "Wishing on the Same Moon" [...] and comments that the layering in the two songs gives the music [...] "genuine depth of sound and taking the veteran group to new places". CitySearch Sydney also made reference to the likeness to [...] "Wishing on the Same Moon", but notes that <b>what</b> <b>sets</b> the two songs apart is [...] "a serviceable fade-out cacophony of keys and guitar". Music journalist Chris Leonard of UK magazine Rock Louder praises the live performance of the song while Powderfinger performed in Glasgow on 11 December 2007. J. Watson of [...] comments that the song, when performed live at The Sydney Opera House Forecourt for charity on 31 October 2007, was [...] "another highlight of the evening". Fellow reviewer from Fasterlouder, ShahXerxes, comments on the song's [...] "sparse Pink Floyd-esque sound which echoes through [...] "Who Really Cares", as clever a rock ballad as the band have ever written." [...] Andrew Ramadge of Mess + Noise echoed the comments of similarities to Pink Floyd, and also Neil Young, stating [...] "where psych-gospel organ and wailing guitar billow around Fanning’s vocals like a lost track from Dark Side of the Moon". Though most of the critical response has been positive, the song has also received criticism from UK reviewer Matthias Scherer of Noize Makes Enemies. Scherer notes that the song's title [...] "Who Really Cares" [...] {{is a question that}} [...] "should have been asked before recording, not during", though this comment refers both to the song itself, and the whole album of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence.|$|E
500|$|When asked <b>what</b> <b>sets</b> Gravity {{apart from}} his {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E
