50|$|Hereke carpets {{typically}} are very large, palace sized carpets, and are made <b>with</b> <b>wool</b> <b>on</b> cotton, camel hair on cotton, silk on cotton {{as well as}} silk on silk, which are knotted in small sizes. The precision of their double knots (Turkish or Ghiordes knots), which allows the clear display of patterns, together with the colour combinations and the harmonious patterns have made them highly collectible. Today, Hereke carpets and rugs are still made with the traditional patterns of the Ottoman sultan, Abdülmecid I, as well as both traditional Anatolian and contemporary figurative patterns.|$|E

50|$|A coat, or ton, is {{a common}} article of winter {{clothing}} for the Kazakhs. It is often, but not always, made of sheepskin. It can also {{be made of the}} skin of raccoon (Janat ishik) or silver foxes (kara tulki). Nobles often wear fur coats that are made from luxurious blue cloth, which is covered and trimmed with a special beaver skin; these are called kok ton. Tons are often made by sewing together tanned sheepskins <b>with</b> <b>wool</b> <b>on</b> the inside, while more prosperous Kazakhs wear tons made from the fleeces of four- to five-month-old lambs.|$|E

50|$|The Manx Loaghtan {{is a small}} sheep, <b>with</b> no <b>wool</b> <b>on</b> {{their dark}} brown faces and legs. The sheep have short tails and are fine boned. In the past century the sheep's colour has {{stabilized}} as Moorit, that is shades between fawn and dark reddish brown, though the colour bleaches in the sun. Manx Loaghtan usually have four horns but individuals are also found with two or six horns. The horns are generally small on the ewes but larger and stronger on the males. An adult female weighs about 40 kg, and an adult male about a third more.|$|R
50|$|Berlin wool {{work is a}} {{style of}} {{embroidery}} similar to today's needlepoint. It was typically executed <b>with</b> <b>wool</b> yarn <b>on</b> canvas. It is usually worked in a single stitch, such as cross stitch or tent stitch although Beeton's book of Needlework (1870) describes 15 different stitches for use in Berlin work. It was traditionally stitched in many colours and hues, producing intricate three-dimensional looks by careful shading. The design of such embroidery {{was made possible by}} the great progresses made in dyeing in the 1830s, especially by the discovery of aniline dyes which produced bright colors.|$|R

50|$|Shearling is a {{skin from}} a {{recently}} sheared sheep or lamb {{that has been}} tanned and dressed <b>with</b> the <b>wool</b> left <b>on.</b> It has a suede surface {{on one side and}} a clipped fur surface on the other. Usually the suede side is worn outward. Shearling can be made from real sheepskin or from synthetic fibers. Real shearling breathes and is more flexible than synthetic shearling.|$|R
5|$|The Shetland {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} British breeds. The ewes are usually polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, although horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is noted for its very fine, soft wool and the high quality of its meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, <b>with</b> some <b>wool</b> <b>on</b> their faces, noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely boned. They have small, erect ears. A distinguishing feature of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the tip in hair, not wool.|$|R
40|$|In a {{replicated}} experiment, {{we investigated}} {{the impact of}} cashmere in blends <b>with</b> superfine <b>wools</b> <b>on</b> the wear attributes of single jersey knitted fabrics. We also investigated the relative performance of low crimp/low fiber curvature superfine <b>wool</b> when compared <b>with</b> cashmere and also when compared with traditional high crimp/high fiber curvature superfine wool in pure and blended knitted fabrics. Wool type, blend ratio and fabric structure affected fabric air permeability, resistance to pilling and change in appearance, relaxation shrinkage, hygral expansion, and dimensional stability during laundering. The responses to variation in fiber crimp were much greater than previously reported. The fabric properties of low crimp wool differed significantly from those made from high crimp wool, and low crimp wool fabric properties differed significantly from, but were closer to, the fabric properties of cashmere, compared <b>with</b> high curvature <b>wool.</b> <br /...|$|R

25|$|The fotă {{is made of}} woollen {{material}} or cotton mixed <b>with</b> <b>wool,</b> woven <b>on</b> four heddles. It fully covers the underskirt (poale) except for, in some areas, the hem. The oldest fote were made of black or greyish brown fabric using the natural colours of the wool. The earliest decoration was a red border (bete roșii) at the lower edge and on the front edge, which strengthen the fabric. This type of fotă is still found in north Moldavia where fote made of hemp or flax were formerly worn in some parts in summer. Fote with vertical stripes (vâstre) are also common in this area. The extent of the decoration becomes more elaborate as one moves south. The stripes change from simple woven decoration to alternately simple stripes and stripes of woven motifs (alesăture). In Muntenia, the stripes are replaced by compact woven decoration or heavy geometric embroidery, covering the whole surface except for the area which is overlapped in the front. The richest decoration is found in Argeș and Muscel zones where the fotă itself is occasionally made from silk, and the woven decoration is in gold or silver thread.|$|R
5000|$|The {{adoption}} of the half-woolly sow as an emblem of Milan is associated to a legend about {{the foundation of the}} city. According to this legend (which partially draws from Livy's writings), the founder of Milan was a Gaul prince named Belloveso. Belloveso reached the Po Valley following a vision he had had in a dream, where a goddess showed him the place where the city would rise. In this dream, he saw a sow <b>with</b> unusually long <b>wool</b> <b>on</b> the front half of its body. Other ancient sources (most notably the aforementioned Alciato, who in turns credits Ambrose for his account) report that the half-woolly sow is actually a sort of [...] "chimera" [...] — half boar and half ram — and that the emblem came about when the Bituriges and the Aedui, having as their emblems a ram and a boar respectively, joined in the Po Valley.|$|R
5000|$|When {{referring}} to handcrafted textile arts which a speaker {{is unable to}} identify, the appropriate generalized term is [...] "needlework". The first recorded {{use of the term}} needlepoint is in 1869, as a synonym for point-lace. Isabella Beeton's Beeton's Book of Needlework (1870) does not use the term [...] "needlework", but rather describes [...] "every kind of stitch which is made upon canvas <b>with</b> <b>wool,</b> silk or beads" [...] as Berlin Work (also spelled Berlinwork). Berlin Work refers to a subset of needlepoint, popular in the mid-19th Century that was stitched in brightly colored <b>wool</b> <b>on</b> needlepoint canvas from hand-colored charts.|$|R
40|$|Alpaca fibre has low crimp {{and smooth}} fibre surface. This makes the fibre {{difficult}} to process, particularly in sliver/fibre transferring and delivering processes. Blending <b>with</b> <b>wool</b> enhances the alpaca fibre processibility, makes the fibre more easily processed <b>on</b> modern <b>wool</b> processing facilities, {{and allows the}} development of new products. To evaluate the effect of wool fibre properties, especially <b>wool</b> crimp, <b>on</b> alpaca/wool blends, two alpaca fibre lots were processed to tops then blended <b>with</b> three commercial <b>wool</b> tops via top gillings. Yarns and knitted fabrics were subsequently engineered with identical machine settings. The performance of alpaca/wool blend slivers, yarns and fabrics has been investigated in this paper. Blending alpaca fibre <b>with</b> <b>wool</b> improves the cohesion properties of the blend slivers, especially <b>with</b> high-crimp <b>wools.</b> Wool fibre crimp does not affect the evenness of blend yarns, but may affect the yarn hairiness value and tensile properties.

50|$|The {{interior}} {{painting was}} redone in 1858-1859 by Greek artists, assisted by Romanians. It is realistic {{in style and}} mainly uses tempera. The contract specified oil painting was to be employed, but the Greeks only did so when supervisors were present. The western wall of the vestibule features an oil portrait of the ktitors. Located above the door, it depicts Stephen and his wife Maria Voichița between his sons Alexandru and Bogdan. The prince {{and his wife are}} shown holding the church in their hands, without the porch. He has a beard and long hair over his back, looking to the ground. She wears a green Byzantine costume <b>with</b> a <b>wool</b> coat <b>on</b> top, reaching from her shoulders to her feet. The inscription is in Romanian Cyrillic. Christ and an enthroned Mary are painted above the founders. The exterior decoration consists of two rows of small circular recesses beneath the roof.

40|$|Relative {{mobility}} of aniline, benzoic acid and toluene {{was measured in}} the A horizon of Cecil (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Hapludults), Holdrege, (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiustolls), Sharpsburg (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls), and Valentine (mixed, mesic Typic Ustipsamments) soils using soil thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or soil chromatographic columns. Also investigated were the dominant soil properties and bonding mechanisms that affected synthetic organic mobility in the soils, and effect of the synthetic organics on effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) of the soils. ^ Mobility of aniline and benzoic acid was higher in the Valentine soils and lower in the Cecil and Sharpsburg soils while toluene was immobile in all soils. Benzoic acid was most mobile of the synthetic organics but was retained in the Cecil soil by hydrogen bonds to Fe oxides. Toluene probably was hydrophobically sorbed to all soils. Aniline was electrostatically retained in protonated form to organic and inorganic exchange sites that resulted in diminished ECEC of aniline-treated Holdrege and Sharpsburg soils. ^ Soil chromatographic columns were constructed to assess the relative {{mobility of}} volatile synthetic organics in soil. The column method utilized soil contained in narrow diameter (I. D. = 4 mm) glass tubes held <b>with</b> glass <b>wool</b> <b>on</b> each end. Relative mobility of toluene was determined on soils using columns, and aniline and benzoic acid using columns and TLC. Benzoic acid was more mobile than aniline for all soils using both methods. Toluene was less mobile than benzoic acid for all soils, and less mobile than aniline in the Valentine soil as determined by soil columns. Toluene and aniline had very low mobilities in the other soils. Differences in mobilities between methods {{may be due to}} differences in soil preparation. TLC plates were prepared from thinly spread and dried slurries, whereas soil chromatographic columns contained powdered soil samples. ...|$|R
