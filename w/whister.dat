50|$|If the {{defenders}} do {{not win the}} required number of tricks and {{there is only a}} single <b>whister,</b> then the <b>whister</b> loses the value of the contract in dump points (×10) for each undertrick. If this happens when there are two whisters, then the penalty is distributed fairly among them according to the principle that each <b>whister</b> is only responsible for his or her own undertricks with respect to half the required number of tricks. However, if the required number of tricks was 1, then it cannot be divided by 2 and the second <b>whister</b> is deemed responsible.|$|E
50|$|Simple Boston - by {{this the}} player binds himself, if a certain suit, which he designates, become trumps, to win five tricks; or, {{if he can}} find a <b>whister,</b> or partner, to sustain him to win three additional, or in all, eight tricks. Whenever a player announces {{a certain number of}} levees, it must be {{understood}} that, should he avail himself of the assistance of a <b>whister,</b> he and the <b>whister</b> must, in order to take the pool, win three tricks more than the levees announced, and in all cases, losses and gains must be equally shared with the <b>whister.</b>|$|E

50|$|A third {{scheme is}} called Rostov scoring. It differs from Sochi scoring {{in that the}} dump {{penalties}} for <b>whisters</b> in case the defenders do not win enough tricks are halved. Moreover, dump points are not used. Instead of losing a dump point, a player pays 5 whist points to each opponent, resulting in the same overall result.|$|R
50|$|The Preferans {{scoring system}} has three {{different}} kinds of points. The basic unit, whist points, is used for payments from one player to another. Pool points can only be won by winning a game as declarer (or by winning no tricks at all in an all-pass game). Dump points are used for {{keeping track of the}} penalties that declarers or <b>whisters</b> have to pay for not winning the required number of tricks. A pool point or dump point is worth 10 whist points.|$|R

50|$|If {{precisely}} one of {{the defenders}} decides to whist, then that player has a choice between playing normally and playing in the light. In the latter case, both defenders' hands are displayed face-up {{on the table and}} the <b>whister</b> plays from both hands, similar to contract bridge. In any case, only the <b>whister</b> will score for this hand, positively or negatively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} the {{nonlinear}} turbulent processes associated with electromagnetic waves in plasmas. We focus on low-frequency (in comparison with the electron gyrofrequency) nonlinearly interacting electron whistlers and nonlinearly interacting Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (H-MHD) fluctuations in a magnetized plasma. Nonlinear whistler mode turbulence study in a magnetized plasma involves incompressible electrons and immobile ions. Two-dimensional turbulent interactions and subsequent energy cascades are critically influenced by the electron <b>whisters</b> that behave distinctly for scales smaller and larger than the electron skin depth. It is found that in whistler mode turbulence there results a dual cascade primarily due to the forward spectral migration of energy that coexists with a backward spectral transfer of mean squared magnetic potential.

5000|$|This {{variation}} is popular when played with Sochi scoring. When a winning bidder names a contract of 6 in spades, both opposing players {{are required to}} whist and play their hands closed. This is {{in reference to the}} Battle of Stalingrad when the Soviet Army had nowhere to retreat to, being pushed to the banks of Volga river. This variant is sometimes used when a bidder makes an unopposed bid at the beginning, but has the risk of remise and wants the <b>whisters</b> to have a harder time opposing him. Sometimes the players agree to play Six of Spades - Stalingrad even when they're not playing the Sochi, but rather Leningrad or Rostov variants.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{nonlinear}} turbulent processes associated with electromagnetic waves in plasmas. We focus on low-frequency (in comparison with the electron gyrofrequency) nonlinearly interacting electron whistlers and nonlinearly interacting Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (H-MHD) fluctuations in a magnetized plasma. Nonlinear whistler mode turbulence study in a magnetized plasma involves incompressible electrons and immobile ions. Two-dimensional turbulent interactions and subsequent energy cascades are critically influenced by the electron <b>whisters</b> that behave distinctly for scales smaller and larger than the electron skin depth. It is found that in whistler mode turbulence there results a dual cascade primarily due to the forward spectral migration of energy that coexists with a backward spectral transfer of mean squared magnetic potential. Finally, inclusion of the ion dynamics, resulting from a two fluid description of the H-MHD plasma, leads to several interesting results that are typically observed in the solar wind plasma. Particularly in the solar wind, the high-time-resolution databases identify a spectral break {{at the end of}} the MHD inertial range spectrum that corresponds to a high-frequency regime. In the latter, turbulent cascades cannot be explained by the usual MHD model and a finite frequency effect (in comparison with the ion gyrofrequency) arising from the ion inertia is essentially included to discern the dynamics of the smaller length scales (in comparison with the ion skin depth). This leads to a nonlinear H-MHD model, which is presented in this paper. With the help of our 3 -D H-MHD code, we find that the characteristic turbulent interactions in the high-frequency regime evolve typically on kinetic-Alfven time-scales. The turbulent fluctuation associated with kinetic-Alfven interactions are compressive and anisotropic and possess equipartition of the kinetic and magnetic energies...|$|R

5000|$|A second {{incentive}} for whisting, besides {{the chance of}} spoiling the declarer's contract, is that the whisting players are paid {{the value of the}} contract in whist points (×1) from the declarer for each trick they win, regardless of whether the declarer or the defender wins their respective required number of tricks. If there is only one <b>whister,</b> then that player also gets the whist points for the tricks won by the other defender (known as a greedy whist). There also exists a convention that if the declarer has failed to achieve his contract, the whists won by the <b>whister</b> are divided equally between the <b>whister</b> and the other player (known as gentlemanly whist). However, there are significant penalties for the whister(s) if the defenders fail to win enough tricks. The required number is 4 tricks if the declarer undertook to win 6 tricks, 2 tricks if the declarer undertook to win 7 tricks, and 1 trick if the declarer's contract is for 8 tricks or more.

40|$|Recently, {{observations}} from laboratory experiments have revealed amplitude modulation of whistlers by low-frequency perturbations. We here present theoretical and simulation studies of amplitude modulated whistler solitary waves (whistlerons) and their interaction with background low-frequency density perturbations {{created by the}} whistler ponderomotive force. We derive a nonlinear a nonlinear Schrodinger equation which governs the evolution of whistlers {{in the presence of}} finite-amplitude density perturbations, and a set of equations for arbitrary large amplitude density perturbations {{in the presence of the}} whistler ponderomotive force. The governing equations studied analytically in the small amplitude limit, and are solved numerically to show the existence of large scale density perturbations that are self-consistently created by localized whistlerons. Our numerical results are in good agreement with recent experimental results where the the formation of modulated whistlers and solitary <b>whister</b> waves were formed.
