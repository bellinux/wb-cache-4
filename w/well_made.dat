5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of <b>well</b> <b>made</b> fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with <b>well</b> <b>made</b> limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The Oksywie culture, {{so named}} after a village (now within the city of Gdynia) where a burial site was found, lasted from 250 BC to 30 AD and {{originally}} occupied the Vistula delta region, {{then the rest of}} eastern Pomerania, expanded west up to the Jastorf Oder group area, in the 1st century BC also including partially what was before that group's territory. It had basically, like other cultures of this period, La Tène cultural characteristics, with traits typical of the Baltic cultures. Oksywie culture's ceramics and burial customs indicate strong ties with the Przeworsk culture. Men only had their ashes placed in <b>well</b> <b>made</b> black urns with fine finish and a decorative band around. Their graves were supplied (unlike those of the Jastorf culture) with utensils and weapons, including typical for this culture swords with one-sided edge, and were often covered or marked by stones. Women's ashes were buried in hollows and supplied with feminine items. A clay vessel with relief animal images found in Gołębiowo Wielkie in Gdańsk County (2nd half of the 1st century BC) is among the finest in all of the Germanic cultural zone.|$|E

25|$|Portuguese-built cars, {{especially}} those from when production was winding down, {{have a reputation}} in the UK for being much less <b>well</b> <b>made</b> and more prone to corrosion than those made in France.

25|$|Day four {{began with}} more rain clouds looming, but holding {{off for the}} time being.

25|$|Pre-World War II Type 14s are <b>well</b> <b>made,</b> {{with quality}} {{dropping}} during wartime. Machining marks, {{a lack of}} polishing, and thin bluing became more common as wartime shortages affected quality. The later Type 14s remained quite functional despite the decreased quality. Holster quality for the Type 14 also degraded as the shortages of critical raw materials forced a change from a leather holster to rubberized canvas.|$|E

25|$|In Britain, {{prior to}} Harrison's marine watch, a small, or very small watch (Such as Arnold's ring watch) was {{generally}} regarded as the ultimate test of watchmaking skill, {{especially with regard to}} complex and accurate watches. Both Harrison and Arnold however, demonstrated that an accurate watch had to be of large diameter, so {{by the end of the}} 18th century, a watch of large size was considered the primary characteristic of a <b>well</b> <b>made</b> and superior watch.|$|E
25|$|According to wine expert Oz Clarke, <b>well</b> <b>made</b> {{examples}} of Blaufränkisch will have notes of red currants and blackberry fruit. The grape {{does have the}} potential to have high tannins and acidity levels which can be moderated by harvest decisions and some oak aging. However, Clarke notes that wines from Blaufränkisch can take on too much oak flavoring and come across as excessively oaky. When blended with other varieties, Blaufränkisch often contributes acidity and structure to the blend.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{took their}} second innings to 219 for 4 declared, thanks to half-centuries from Allan Border and first innings centurion Jones, setting England an {{unlikely}} target of 403 in a day.

25|$|Since then, Assad {{has become}} the best batsman in the EAP region. He competed for PNG in the Division Two where he had an average tournament.

He carried this into the Twenty20 Qualifier where he had a solid tournament top scoring with a <b>well</b> <b>made</b> 52 against Canada.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{from the}} Allegheny Mountains region began with Jamestown, Virginia. In the 1999 Interim Report, the Massawomeck offered gifts of bows and arrows, deer and bear flesh, fish, clubs, and bear skins to John Smith during his Chesapeake Bay {{exploration}} in 1608. Next, the Susquesahanock {{came down and}} presented venison, tobacco pipes, baskets, targets, bows and arrows.

25|$|A larger Rosé de Loire {{appellation}} {{exist that}} includes wines made from Anjou, Saumur and Touraine.

According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, the wines are always dry with a quality level that falls somewhere between Rosé d'Anjou and Cabernet d'Anjou. Wine expert Karen MacNeil describes <b>well</b> <b>made</b> examples of Rosé de Loire as being fruity with light cherry flavors and moderate acidity.|$|E

25|$|The Australians began day two {{looking to}} go past England's total, {{and build a}} big lead, {{and that is exactly}} what they did. Geoff Marsh fell off just 14 balls for a disappointing 3, but Mark Taylor and David Boon added 145 for the second wicket, {{although}} it was hard work and slow-going. Taylor was caught LBW for 62 in a rare lapse of concentration in an otherwise <b>well</b> <b>made</b> innings, and Boon was dismissed 42 runs later, out for 94. Australia batted on throughout the second day but their progress was slow but steady.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} a film {{critically}} well received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. It was an obvious allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany, well played and <b>well</b> <b>made.</b> The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian proverbs, verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions. This was started, completed, and placed in distribution all within the year 1938, and represented not only Eisenstein's first film in nearly a decade but also his first sound film.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{began their}} 1977 tour of England with the {{traditional}} warm-up game against the Duchess of Norfolk's XI at Arundel Castle Cricket Ground. The match was a 45-over limited overs cricket match, and Australian captain Greg Chappell won the toss and elected to bat. Although not scoring at a particularly fast rate, a solid second wicket partnership of 101 between Chappell (44) and Craig Serjeant (65) was the backbone of a <b>well</b> <b>made</b> 186 for 5. Indian-born Bob Woolmer, who would later {{play a part in}} the Test series, was the best of the bowlers with 3 for 17 off seven overs.|$|E

25|$|Wine expert Karen MacNeil {{notes that}} most <b>well</b> <b>made</b> {{examples}} of Provençal wine have flavors and aromas {{that reflect the}} garrigue landscape of the region which includes wild lavender, rosemary and thyme. The rosés of the region are normally dry with zestiness derived from their acidity. The red and whites are characterized by their full bodies and intense aromatics. The nature and impression of the wines change significantly depending on whether they are consumed as an apéritif or paired with food, particularly the traditional flavors of Provençal cuisine. The rosé wine in particular is noted {{for its ability to}} pair well with garlic based dishes, such as aioli.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} began with Australia {{beginning}} their second innings. The opening pair of Alick Bannerman and Hugh Massie fared {{much better than}} in the first innings, putting on 66 for the first wicket - more than the whole team's total in the first innings. The loss of Massie triggered a mini-collapse with Australia losing 4 for 13 {{over the next few}} overs before captain Billy Murdoch added a much-needed 29, but the last four wickets then fell for eight runs. Bannerman was top scorer with a <b>well</b> <b>made</b> 55, and Australia were all out for 122 in 63 overs, an overall lead of 84.|$|E
25|$|A first innings lead of 248 placed great {{pressure}} on the English batsmen, but their combined experience counted when it was required, and their captain David Gower led the fight-back with a <b>well</b> <b>made</b> 106. Robin Smith was unluckily dismissed for 96. However it was again Terry Alderman's turn with 6 for 128, 4 of them LBWs achieved through either dead straight balls or - his speciality - the late swing from leg stump making them virtually straight balls that the batsmen played across. England had made a solid 359, but their first innings had let them down, and it left Australia with a comfortable target of 117 runs for victory on the last day.|$|E

25|$|Through {{their control}} of the region's wells, the Garen rulers {{effectively}} held a monopoly over their nomadic subjects as {{they were the only}} hydraulic empire in Africa during their reign. Large <b>wells</b> <b>made</b> out of limestone were constructed throughout the state, which attracted Somali and Oromo nomads with their livestock. The centralized regulations of the <b>wells</b> <b>made</b> it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period.|$|R
