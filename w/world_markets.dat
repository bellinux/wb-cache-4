5|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} capital, foreign investment—in particular from Great Britain—was courted, but it was not sizable enough to initiate an economic recovery. Finally the new nations entered the world economy {{after the end of the}} French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when the economies of Europe and the United States were recovering and aggressively seeking new markets to sell their products after more than two decades of disruption. Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> as an exporter of raw materials and a consumer of finished products.|$|E

5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on <b>world</b> <b>markets.</b> Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, Maryland's economy was {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} price fluctuations on the world market of its main cash crop, tobacco. Often in those years, the price on <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> was barely above the cost of production, leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to <b>world</b> <b>markets.</b> There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E

5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 {{million barrels per day}} despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E
5|$|Flex-fuel hybrid {{electric}} and flex-fuel plug-in hybrid {{are two types}} of hybrid vehicles built with a combustion engine capable of running on gasoline, E-85, or E-100 to help drive the wheels in conjunction with the electric engine or to recharge the battery pack that powers the electric engine. In 2007 Ford produced 20 demonstration Escape Hybrid E85s for real-world testing in fleets in the U.S. Also as a demonstration project, Ford delivered in 2008 the first flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid, which runs on gasoline or E85. GM announced that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in the U.S. in late 2010, would be the first commercially available flex-fuel plug-in capable of adapting the propulsion to several <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> such as the U.S., Brazil or Sweden, as the combustion engine can be adapted to run on E85, E100 or diesel respectively. The Volt was initially expected to be flex-fuel-capable in 2013. Lotus Engineering unveiled the Lotus CityCar at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. The CityCar is a plug-in hybrid concept car designed for flex-fuel operation on ethanol, or methanol as well as regular gasoline.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to {{the ups and downs}} of <b>world</b> <b>markets.</b> There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in more intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies. At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less labour-intensive. In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Vipond was an Investment Banking Analyst at CIBC <b>World</b> <b>Markets</b> Inc. in Vancouver from 2005 to 2007. He {{then worked}} in Investment Management at ScotiaMcLeod from 2007 to 2010, where he managed {{portfolios}} of high-net-worth clients that were worth {{a total of}} about $120 million. After taking time off from his career to earn a Master of Business Administration, Vipond worked in Strategy and Corporate Development at the Vancouver-based Goldcorp Inc. from 2012 to 2015 where he made a $2.6 billion unsolicited bid to buy Osisko Mining. In 2013, while working at Goldcorp, Vipond founded Mathers Pacific Capital Inc., which is based in Vancouver. Mathers Pacific Capital works with Vancouver-area companies to help them raise capital, complete mergers and acquisitions, and grow their businesses. In March 2015, Vipond became Vice President of Corporate Finance at Shoes.com, while also continuing to run Mathers Pacific Capital and the Corporate Finance Institute, which is a subdivision of Mathers Pacific Capital. Prior to joining Shoes.com, Vipond worked as a consultant for its owner, Roger Hardy and in 2014, spearheaded the firm's purchase of Shoeme.ca and OnlineShoes.com. These purchases helped bring Shoes.com into the online shoe-selling business and shortly after joining Shoes.com, he oversaw the completion of a non-brokered $45 million private placement. It was the largest such private placement ever completed by a Canadian e-commerce company. In 2014, Vipond taught a one-day course on mining valuation at Sauder School of Business that involved working through a mining acquisition opportunity and the impact on such an mining investment.|$|E
