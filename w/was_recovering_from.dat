5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies.

His wife dutifully accompanied him.

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, Boston College was ranked 26th nationally in total defense, and 2nd nationally in run defense. Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who <b>was</b> <b>recovering</b> <b>from</b> a sprained knee ligament, it was {{expected}} that the Eagles' linebackers would have to play a very good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{irregularities}} in {{the approval of}} the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid.

The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned. During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval. On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.|$|E
