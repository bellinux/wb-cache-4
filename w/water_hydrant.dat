25|$|Fuller {{was not an}} {{engineer}} and {{did not realize that}} the site was a poor choice for a large camp because of its wet, low–lying location. The camp lacked sewers for more than a year, and the prairie on which it was built could not absorb the waste from thousands of humans and horses. The camp flooded with each rainfall. In the winter, it was a sea of mud when the ground was not frozen. When the camp opened, only one <b>water</b> <b>hydrant</b> worked.

50|$|Illinois Governor Richard Yates {{assigned}} Judge Allen C. Fuller, {{soon to be}} adjutant {{general for}} the State of Illinois, to select the site for a permanent army camp at Chicago. Judge Fuller selected the site that was already in use for the makeshift camps because it was only four miles from downtown Chicago, prairie surrounded the site, nearby Lake Michigan could provide water and the Illinois Central Railroad ran within {{a few hundred yards}} of the site. Fuller was not an engineer and did not realize that the site was a poor choice for a large camp because of its wet, low-lying location.

25|$|Colonel DeLand {{tried to}} impose {{discipline}} on the disorderly camp but was frustrated by its poor condition and corrupt guards, including especially those {{from his own}} regiment.

Open sinks (latrines), or sewers, ran through the middle of the camp. The rundown buildings provided inadequate shelter. Hospital capacity, with 120 beds for prisoners and 50 beds for guards, was seriously inadequate. The post chapel was converted into hospital space, but there was still insufficient capacity for all the sick prisoners and guards.|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of preparation goes into {{the running of the}} mini-marathon. Since 2008, fifteen or sixteen members of Dublin City Council has spent the weeks in the build-up to the marathon testing <b>water</b> <b>hydrants</b> in the St Stephen's Green and Stillorgan Road areas to ensure they are working properly. On the morning of the race, they begin a process of laying out cables and attaching them to the hydrants. The cables also have to be covered and ramps have to be installed for the benefit of wheelchair users. When the race is over, the crew have to take apart all their installations.|$|R

The park has a shelter house, fishing piers, picnic tables, barbecue grills, vault toilets and <b>water</b> <b>hydrant.</b> Below Lake McKinley dam is a catch and release youth fishing pond for anglers age 15 and under when with an accompanying adult.

50|$|Arthur Ebeling, who had {{designed}} the chapel addition, {{was chosen as}} the architect for the new Carmel. He used the Baltimore Carmel as his inspiration. The structure is a double cruciform building of gold mottled brick trimmed with Bedford limestone. There is a small dome topped with a cross {{in the middle of the}} center wing of the monastery. The architectural style is Romanesque Revival. The town provided a <b>water</b> <b>hydrant</b> for water, and the building did not have electricity when it was built. A telephone was installed when priests requested it to ease the process of ordering altar breads. A professional landscaper designed the garden and grounds. The chapel was not a part of the building as yet, and the monastery itself was not fully completed when the nuns moved into to their new home on June 29, 1916. The monastery's name was changed to Regina Coeli.|$|E
5000|$|Road traffic {{accidents}} usually involve impact loading, {{such as when}} a car hits a traffic bollard, <b>water</b> <b>hydrant</b> or tree, the damage being localized to the impact zone. When vehicles collide, the damage is proportionate to the relative velocity of the vehicles, the damage increasing as {{the square of the}} velocity since it is the impact kinetic energy (1/2 mv2) which is the variable of importance. Much design effort is made to improve the impact resistance of cars so as to minimize user injury. It can be achieved in several ways: by enclosing the driver and passengers in a safety cell for example. The cell is reinforced so it will survive in high speed crashes, and so protect the users. Parts of the body shell outside the cell are designed to crumple progressively, absorbing most of the kinetic energy which must be dissipated by the impact.|$|E
5000|$|Camping The {{campground}} {{was totally}} rebuilt in 2004. It has 140 roomy campsites {{laid out on}} sand with new, level, asphalt paved pads, 50 amp electrical hook-ups, picnic tables. Drinking <b>water</b> <b>hydrants</b> are located throughout the campground. The roads are newly laid out and paved in 2004, arranged in several connecting loops. The smoothly paved loops of roadway lend themselves to bicycling, rollerblading, etc. Most of the trees were spared during the rebuilding so that many sites have full or partial shade. There are two, large, newly built shower house/restroom structures. There is a short, level forest path to the swimming beach.|$|R

5000|$|Hotel Californian, 1961-1994. Flames engulfed {{the upper}} two {{floors of the}} five-story Hotel Californian at 1907 West Sixth Street on August 2, 1961. Firemen were {{threatened}} with injury when a <b>water</b> <b>hydrant</b> burst and a hose flailed about viciously before water was turned off. Scores of television aerials {{on the roof of}} the hotel hampered the men before the flames were brought under control. The hotel reopened, but became [...] "a classic slum building where a changing cast of owners suck out profits, fail to make repairs and leve tenants in miserable conditions." [...] City officials closed its entrances with plywood and metal bars, but homeless people broke through and made it their home. On November 21, 1994, it took 186 firefighters from three companies to quell a massive blaze that all but destroyed the place. Finally, the City Council ordered the old hotel razed as an irreparable hazard. Burlington Avenue, 1993. Nine people, mostly immigrants from Latin America, and two fetuses died as a result of a fire that ravaged an apartment building at 330 Burlington Avenue on May 5. More than forty were injured. Some residents escaped by jumping from or, in the case of children, being thrown from upper floors into the arms of rescuers, but others died when they were trapped on stairways. Members of the 18th Street Gang joined in the rescue effort. More than a hundred shocked survivors were given emergency shelter in the Belmont High School gymnasium. It was the fourth-deadliest fire in the city's history. Fire officials said the owners failed to correct a faulty alarm system, amid other fire code violations. Some fire doors had been illegally propped open.|$|E

We also conduct the feasibility study on visualisation for the estimation results of housing vacancy distributions derived from the fine spatial resolution data...|$|E

50|$|One {{reason for}} the fire's {{duration}} {{was the lack of}} national standards in firefighting equipment. Fire crews and fire engines came {{from as far away as}} Philadelphia and Washington that day (units from New York City were on the way, but blocked by a train accident; they arrived the next day - Monday, February 8). The crews brought their own equipment. Most could only watch helplessly after discovering that their hoses could not connect to Baltimore's gauge size of <b>water</b> <b>hydrants.</b> High winds and freezing temperatures further contributed to the fire's extent and firefighters' difficulties. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,545 buildings spanning 70 city blocks—amounting to over 140 acre.|$|R
