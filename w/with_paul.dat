50|$|The Mid-Acts {{position}} was developed independently in America later by J.C. O'Hair and followed later by Cornelius R. Stam and Charles F. Baker, among others, and reflects their position that Paul's normative ministry began <b>with</b> <b>Paul's</b> ministry <b>with</b> either his salvation {{in the ninth}} chapter of Acts (Stam) or <b>with</b> <b>Paul's</b> commission in the thirteenth chapter (O'Hair, Baker) of Acts. Some very few independent spirits have staked {{the beginning of the}} church in a few other chapters but such differences are technical preferences rather than disagreements. The hallmark is that the church is served uniquely <b>with</b> <b>Paul's</b> ministry and upon that there is complete and total agreement. Acts is seen as a transitional period between dispensations and the Mid-Acts position does not insert an extra dispensation there (contra Ryrie).|$|R
