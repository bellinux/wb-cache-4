5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E
5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E

25|$|Durham won the toss against Leicestershire {{and elected}} to bat first at Grace Road, Leicester. The first day was {{dominated}} by Durham's Australian left-handed opener, Mike Hussey. Hussey may not {{be good enough to}} make the Australian Test squad, but he <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> make an undefeated 165 off 290 balls on a flat pitch on the first day. Former England Under-19 batsman Gordon Muchall helped Hussey add 166 for the third-wicket partnership, before being run out for 82. Durham finished day one on 325 for 3.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{built up}} steadily, {{although}} not quite at {{quickly as the}} company had estimated. Tolls produced £2,614 in the year to April 1798. During that year, a packet boat began running between Nottingham and Cromford, and in 1798, a second boat provided a service between Nottingham and Leicester. Income from tolls increased to £4,647 in 1799/1800. Most of the traffic was coal, amounting to 89,500 tons {{out of a total}} of 114,227 tons carried. Co-operation between the Cromford Canal and the Nottingham Canal <b>was</b> <b>good,</b> <b>to</b> the benefit of both companies. A brief attempt to poach traffic from the Erewash Canal in 1797 by undercutting their rates was a financial disaster, leading to an agreement to charge the authorised tolls for goods on both canals, and not to try to entice customers from each other. Once the mortgage was redeemed in 1804, the company agreed to pay dividends to the shareholders, at a rate of £12 per £150 share. These were paid twice a year, but from time to time a third payment was made, to reduce the backlog of payments, which were nine years in arrears on the date when the first payment was made. By 1830, tolls raised £9,879, and in 1840, this had risen to £12,825.|$|E
25|$|Cincinnati {{received}} the opening kickoff {{of the second}} half, and exclusively ran {{the ball on the}} first several plays of the drive, even to the extent that Shaq Washington replaced Kay at quarterback, the latter of whom lined up at wide receiver; on third down and nine, however, Kay returned to quarterback on a passing play, but was sacked for the fifth time of the game, and the Bearcats were forced to punt, and Switzer tied the NCAA-record with his fifth punt return touchdown of the season, recording an 86-yard touchdown; the extra point was no good. CINCY finally scored a touchdown on their subsequent drive, via a 15-yard rush by Ralph Abernathy, making the score 29–10. On the ensuing kickoff, CINCY kicked the ball out of bounds, setting up UNC with solid field position at their own 35-yard line. Early in the drive Eric Ebron, hurdled a defender and hit the ground hard, but quickly re-entered the game, and caught another pass just a few plays later. Later in the drive, Switzer made a catch that converted a fourth down in the red zone; moments later, Morris rushed for a 1-yard touchdown. This time, the extra point <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> culminate a 13-play, 65-yard drive that encapsulated 4:36. CINCY's ensuing drive stalled, and they punted; Switzer made a fair catch. In the waning seconds of the quarter, CINCY entered the red zone.|$|E

500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character.

500|$|Time {{contributor}} James Poniewozik {{reported that}} the Pete/Jenna and Tracy/Kenneth plots were a [...] "hit-and-miss", however noted it <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see the show giving the Jack and Liz characters [...] "ongoing direction, not just in their personal lives". The Atlantics Caitlan Smith was skeptical about Liz and Carol's relationship lasting, saying that Damon [...] "who commands more than $20million per movie, won't stick around for long, leaving Liz Lemon Carol-less and in for another round of the entertaining self-loathing that we've all been coming back for four seasons." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Butters' Bottom Bitch" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Ramsey Isler of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.2 out of 10 rating. He said although it started slow, [...] "once this episode found its legs, it was non-stop funny." [...] Isler praised the South Park writers for {{coming up with}} a surprisingly funny plot, and said it ranked among Butters' best moments in the series. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said it <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see an episode focused strictly on comedy, after a string of episodes focusing on social satire. Delgado said the premise of the episode was absurd and over-the-top, but appreciated that South Park was continuing to push boundaries by mocking such issues as prostitution.|$|E

Although Norwood said in January 2011 that Fatboy {{will always be a}} joker, he felt it <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> show Fatboy's softer, more intelligent side, saying that the character's [...] "street" [...] side drops quickly when he is around Dot and Mercy.

500|$|Asher {{is one of}} {{the four}} main {{characters}} in series two of EastEnders: E20, alongside Sol, Naz and Stevie. They were created by the programme's team of thirteen writers.

Thompson was subsequently cast as Asher, and the character and his casting were announced on 28 July 2010. Deborah Sathe, the show's producer, expressed pride in the writers and stated, [...] " [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting."

500|$|Kapur {{discussed}} {{in his review}} how the main event of a show can impact {{the rest of the}} event.

[...] He {{went on to say that}} based on the crowd reaction the [...] "finish seemed to dampen the enthusiasm of what was otherwise a really good show," [...] and that it was [...] "unfortunate, because everything leading up to that point <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> great." [...] Kapur gave the main event a 3 out of 10, while the Full Metal Mayhem match and the World Tag Team Championship both received a 7 out of 10.
