25|$|One Christmas was so {{much like}} another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant {{speaking}} of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with {{the heat and the}} cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{similarly}} astonished at {{the manner in}} which they had lost the final. Manager Carlo Ancelotti said, [...] "We had six minutes of madness in which <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> away the position we had reached until then". The result compounded Milan's failure to win Serie A a week before the match. Milan's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, played down the loss, asserting: [...] "Even if we come second in the league, and second in the Champions League, this is not a disastrous season for us". Captain Paolo Maldini was less optimistic, stating that the reverse was a [...] "huge disappointment", but he added that Milan would accept the defeat and [...] "go out with their heads high".|$|E

The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So {{we went to a}} pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> a lot to our running backs. And I really think it brought out the best in Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E
500|$|Before {{beginning}} work, {{the development}} team commissioned {{two pieces of}} music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game to guide their efforts. They created a number of prototypes, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and removed elements that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players too excited. The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world, but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as [...] "almost like we wanted to throw away the traditional game design, but we end up picking up all the pieces <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> away and putting them back because we know those are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of {{that time in the}} prototyping stage. After deciding on the game elements, Flower was produced in only six months.|$|E
500|$|In 1958 he {{was second}} {{in the league in}} both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was {{followed}} by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce's first pitch down the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice did he go to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, [...] "Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed 'em up beautifully. The big thing is that we won." [...] At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year's pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, [...] "I'm a Washington fan, but that was one night I was rooting for the White Sox." [...] In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, [...] "The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn't feel that badly about it, really. It didn't mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I wish I had got it. It would have been nice." [...] His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, sisters {{at their}} Spokane, Washington, convent {{claimed to have}} a stopped a fire at a chapel in Fort Wright College by invoking Durocher through prayer. [...] The fire, which started in Spokane River gorge, was {{approaching}} the campus when the sisters tacked Durocher's picture to trees and prayed to her for help. [...] Flames were reportedly within 15 feet of the chapel, with smoke filling the interior, when the fire changed direction. [...] Similarly, in 1979, Frank Carr, {{the owner of a}} lake resort in Tonasket, Washington, observed an uncontrolled wildfire change direction after he tossed a picture of Durocher into the flames. [...] Said Carr, [...] "All I know is that <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> in the picture and the wind changed. [...] There's no question the fire would have taken the orchard, some farm houses and the resort if it hadn't turned." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Lillee {{opened the}} Australian bowling {{with the help}} of the wind and was a yard faster than Willis, but Jeff Thomson bowling into the wind was faster still and made the opening batsmen Brian Luckhurst and Dennis Amiss flinch from the ball leaping off the pitch towards their bodies. Luckhurst edged a catch behind to Rod Marsh and Amiss to Terry Jenner in the gully and England were 10/2 just as Australia had been, with Thomson (3/59) {{receiving}} enthusiastic applause from his new home crowd. The England vice-captain John Edrich dug himself in and fought off the short-pitched deliveries which battered his body and hands. His captain Mike Denness padded up to a ball that landed outside his off-stump and cut back under the new leg before wicket law which meant he could be out if the umpire was satisfied that the ball would hit the wicket even if it pitched outside the line of the stumps. Keith Fletcher was severely bruised on his forearm and fended off a couple of balls that landed just beyond the reach of Ian Redpath at short-leg. Thomson had now switched ends and with the wind behind him was bowling at extraordinary speed, Fletcher once edging the ball over the slips that almost went for six. After Doug Walters and Jenner had given him a rest Lillee (2/73) returned to bowl Fletcher, who cut the ball onto his stumps and England were 57/4. The Edrich family were well known for their tenacity and Tony Greig used his long reach to slash the short stuff over the head of the Australian slip and gully fieldsmen. As a result, they saw out the day with the score on 114/4. Strangely Ian Chappell did not ask for the wicket to be rolled at the start of the second day and neither did Denness at the start of the third. Edrich started the day making 2,000 runs against Australia, the seventh man to do so after Jack Hobbs, Wally Hammond, Herbert Sutcliffe, Len Hutton, Colin Cowdrey and Ken Barrington. Immediately afterwards Greig was dropped by Jenner off Lillee and Edrich, whose hand was so swollen from a bone broken on the previous day that he could barely hold his bat, edged Thomson to Ian Chappell at first slip for 48. Max Walker (4/73) was now bowling into the wind with the new ball and dismissed Alan Knott and Peter Lever, but [...] "Greig started slashing the ball all over the place on his way to a century and Underwood's nagging straight bat was defying everything <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> at him. Lillee, Thomson, Walker, Jenner...then through them all again." [...] Greig (110) and Derek Underwood (25) added 58 for the eighth wicket when Chappell called on Doug Walters to break the partnership. The ball slipped from Walters hand and wafted towards Underwood, who was so used to the pace of Lillee and Thomson that he mistimed his stroke and gave a simple catch to Redpath in the covers for 228/8. Greig hit his 17th boundary then gave a fine edge to Marsh from Lillee at 248/9, the first England batsmen to make a century in Brisbane since Maurice Leyland in 1936–37, also the last time England had won at the venue. Bob Willis and Mike Hendrick added 17 runs for the last wicket until the latter gave a catch to Redpath off Walker and England were out for 265, 44 runs behind Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The 14th century saw {{a wave of}} {{travelers}} who left records of their travels. [...] In 1323 the Anglo-Irish friar Simon Fitzsimon (Symon Semeonis) visited the area with his friend Hugh (who died in Cairo) and observed [...] "the granaries (...) of Joseph mentioned in Genesis. [...] They are three in number, of which two are of such size and height that at a distance they look more like the summits of mountains than repositories of corn." [...] In 1349 the Tuscan monk Niccolò Poggibonsi noted that [...] "three miles outside Babylon there are granaries, which are called Pharaoh's granaries. [...] Joseph, the son of Jacob, had them built." [...] He continues: [...] "three are outside Babylon, which are so big that coming from Alexandria they can be seen 60 miles away. [...] The said seven granaries are diamond shaped and within is a large house, above and below of porphyry; and within there is a deep pit. [...] And many a time <b>we</b> <b>threw</b> in stones and did not hear them strike the bottom and it looked very dark, and we left at once through fear, having our little torch quenched from the wind, which came from there." [...] The year 1374 saw thirteen Tuscan travelers make the pilgrimage to the Holy Land, three of which left accounts: Leonardo Frescobaldi, Simone Sigoli, and Giorgio Gucci. [...] Frescobaldi makes a brief mention of [...] "the granaries which Joseph had made {{at the time of}} Pharaoh king of Egypt, {{in the days of the}} famine." [...] Sigoli offers a fuller and more literary account, noting that [...] "Joseph found means to have from every side as much corn as he could, and quickly he collected a very great number of bushels, and this grain he put in these granaries. [...] And they are among the biggest edifices to be seen: and they are three and distant one from another a stones throw; and they are built of very great long thick stones and in shape like a diamond; the base is very wide and the summit pointed ... and each has four sides, and the corn was placed inside: just imagine the very great amount amount that inside would take." [...] Gucci appears to have reflected a bit more on what he saw: [...] "These granaries, which are of giant structure, are said to have been made by Pharaoh at the time of the great famine at the time of Joseph, though to see them they appear to be works for perpetual memory rather than granaries. [...] In 1392 Thomas Brygg, an Englishman who later became mayor of Bordeaux, noted the [...] "famous granaries of wondrous size which Joseph, the son of Jacob, had built in the days of Pharaoh." [...] In 1395 the French lord Ogier d'Anglure described the challenges of getting to the foot of the Pyramids and the commotion of workers stripping the smooth facing: [...] "the great stones falling like so many vine plants that these masons were chopping down." [...] "It should be explained," [...] he continues, [...] "that these granaries are called Pharaoh's Granaries; and the pharaoh had them built in the time when Joseph, the son of Jacob, was governor over all the kingdom of Egypt ... As for describing the inside of these granaries, we could hardly speak of it, since the entrance from above is walled up and there are enormous tombs in front of it ... the entrances were closed up because people had been using the places to make counterfeit money." ...|$|E
