5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> and cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E
5|$|Most starfish embryos hatch at the blastula stage. The {{original}} ball {{of cells}} develops a lateral pouch, the archenteron. The entrance {{to this is}} known as the blastopore and it will later develop into the anus. Another invagination of the surface will fuse <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section will become the gut. At the same time, a band of cilia develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a bipinnaria. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting phytoplankton towards the mouth.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the pink whipray is diamond-shaped and thick at the center, measuring about 1.1–1.2 times wider than long. The outer {{corners of the}} disc are angular. The snout forms a very obtuse angle, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> barely protruding. The small, widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is fairly small and surrounded by prominent furrows; the lower jaw has a small indentation in the middle. There are two large central and two tiny lateral papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth are small and arranged into pavement-like surfaces. Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, adult {{amphibians}} are predators, {{feeding on}} virtually anything that moves {{that they can}} swallow. The diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders. The sirens (Siren spp.) often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a Brazilian tree frog (Xenohyla truncata) includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet. The Mexican burrowing toad (Rhinophrynus dorsalis) has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites. It projects it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first, their tongues being hinged at the front.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E

25|$|Its {{place of}} {{articulation}} is dental, alveolar or post-alveolar, {{which means it}} is articulated behind upper front teeth, at the alveolar ridge or behind the alveolar ridge. It is most often apical, which means that it is pronounced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tongue.|$|E

25|$|The dental series th, nh, lh {{are always}} laminal (that is, {{pronounced}} by touching with {{the surface of}} the tongue just above the tip, called the blade of the tongue), but may be formed in one of three different ways, depending on the language, on the speaker, and on how carefully the speaker pronounces the sound. These are interdental <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tongue visible between the teeth, as in th in English; dental <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tongue down behind the lower teeth, so that the blade is visible between the teeth; and denti-alveolar, that is, with both the tip and the blade making contact with the back of the upper teeth and alveolar ridge, as in French t, d, n, l. The first tends to be used in careful enunciation, and the last in more rapid speech, while the tongue-down articulation is less common.|$|E
25|$|The Liberty cap, {{also known}} as the Phrygian cap, or pileus, is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> pulled forward. It {{reflects}} Roman republicanism and liberty, alluding to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty.|$|E
25|$|The {{alveolar}} series t, n, l (or d, n, l) is straightforward: {{across the}} continent, these sounds are alveolar (that is, pronounced by touching the tongue to the ridge {{just behind the}} gum line of the upper teeth) and apical (that is, touching that ridge <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tongue). This {{is very similar to}} English t, d, n, l, though the Australian t is not aspirated, even in Kalaw Lagaw Ya, despite its other stops being aspirated.|$|E

25|$|Nano-FTIR {{is based}} on s-SNOM, where the {{infrared}} beam from a light source is focused onto a sharp, typically metalized AFM tip and the backscattering is detected. The tip greatly enhances the illuminating IR light in the nanoscopic volume around its apex, creating a strong near field. A sample, brought into this near field, interacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> electromagnetically and modifies the tip (back)scattering in the process. Thus by detecting tip scattering, one can obtain information about the sample.|$|E

The Office of the Whistleblower should advise the whistleblower on the process and timeline to apply for the award.|$|E
25|$|In a nanorecording application, {{a certain}} rotaxane is {{deposited}} as a Langmuir-Blodgett film on ITO-coated glass. When a positive voltage is applied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} probe, the rotaxane rings in the tip area switch to {{a different part of}} the dumbbell and the resulting new conformation makes the molecules stick out 0.3 nanometer from the surface. This height difference is sufficient for a memory dot. It is not yet known how to erase such a nanorecording film.|$|E

25|$|In his time, the gnomon {{was simply}} a {{vertical}} pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the sun draws a curve <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip’s position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.|$|E
25|$|The forward {{place of}} {{articulation}} is alveolar or postalveolar, {{depending on the}} language, and apical, which means it is articulated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> of the tongue against the alveolar ridge or {{the roof of the}} mouth behind the alveolar ridge. (Damin contrasted these two articulations as separate phonemes.) The release is a sharp, plosive sound in southern Africa, but in Sandawe it may be percussive, with the underside of the tip of the tongue striking the floor of the mouth after the release of the click (see below), and in Hadza the release is often quite weak.|$|E
25|$|The {{test method}} {{consists}} of pushing an instrumented cone, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> facing down, {{into the ground}} at a controlled rate (controlled between 1.5 -2.5cm/s accepted). The resolution of the CPT in delineating stratigraphic layers {{is related to the}} size of the cone tip, with typical cone tips having a cross-sectional area of either 10 or 15cm², corresponding to diameters of 3.6 and 4.4cm. A very early ultra-miniature 1 cm² subtraction penetrometer was developed and used on a US mobile ballistic missile launch system (MGM-134 Midgetman) soil/structure design program in 1984 at the Earth Technology Corporation of Long Beach, California.|$|E
