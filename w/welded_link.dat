40|$|We {{introduce}} the multiplexing of a crossing, replacing a classical crossing of a virtual link diagram with multiple crossings {{which is a}} mixture of classical and virtual. For integers m_i (i= 1, [...] .,n) and an ordered n-component virtual link diagram D, a new virtual link diagram D(m_ 1, [...] .,m_n) is obtained from D by the multiplexing of all crossings. For welded isotopic virtual link diagrams D and D', D(m_ 1, [...] .,m_n) and D'(m_ 1, [...] .,m_n) are welded isotopic. From {{the point of view of}} classical link theory, it seems very interesting that D(m_ 1, [...] .,m_n) could not be welded isotopic to a classical link diagram even if D is a classical one, and new classical link invariants are expected from known <b>welded</b> <b>link</b> invariants via the multiplexing of crossings.

40|$|To {{improve the}} usage of {{material}} in fatigue loaded complex welded structures a better calculation method (based on FEA) is needed than what {{is available on the}} market and an improved management of weld quality. Improved FE-procedures are directly applicable to design of generic structural components within virtually all industries using CAD and FEtools, irrespective of industrial sector. More and more welded structures are created as 3 D models from the design offices and the FE-work will be easier but the requirement of being accurate from the beginning and the reduction of lead times create a great need to substantially reduce calculation time. The main objectives in this thesis is to develop novel procedures to extract design data from finite element stress analyses of complex fatigue loaded welded structures, to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} limits of the different fatigue design methods and to investigate the influence of fatigue strength due to the weld quality. An investigation of how weld geometry and different type of defects influence fatigue life of the weld has been made on a non-load carrying cruciform joint. The weld geometries were measured and the stress distributions were computed using FEA. Fatigue tests have been performed and the initial defects were analysed. Life predictions with LEFM based on the stress distributions and defects were performed with good agreement with the test results. The different fatigue design methods Nominal stress, Structural stress, Effective Notch stress and LEFM proposed by the International Institute of Welding (IIW) have been investigated and applied on a <b>welded</b> <b>link.</b> In order to verify the accuracy of the prediction methods, fatigue tests of the link were made. Structural optimisations based FEA, using different objectives regarding the fatigue properties of the <b>welded</b> <b>link</b> were also carried out to increase the performance of the link. Comparison and investigations of the advantages and disadvantage of the two different LEFM approaches, weight function technique and FEA solutions is made on welded structures.

40|$|Virtual and <b>welded</b> <b>links.</b> Virtual link {{theory is}} {{introduced}} by Kauffman [8] as a generalization of classical link theory. He defined a virtual link diagram. On virtual link diagram {{there are some}} types of local moves (generalized Reidemeister moves) : classical Reidemeister moves, virtual Reidemeister moves and mixed Reidemeister move. Two virtual link diagrams are equivalent if one diagram can be transformed into another by a finite sequence of generalized Reidemeister moves. A virtual link is an equivalence class of virtual link diagrams under generalized Reidemeister moves. A theorem of Goussarov, Polyk and Viro [6] states that if two classical link diagrams are equivalent under generalized Reidemeister moves, then they are equi-valent under the classical Reidemeister moves. In this sense virtual link theory is a nontrivial extension of the classical theory. On the set of virtual diagrams there are so called forbidden moves F 1 and F 2 which are similar to a generalized Reidemeister move but {{are not part of}} the equiv-alence relation for virtual links. We can include one or both of them to obtain a quotient theory of the theory of virtual links. If we add the move F 1, then we obtain the theory of <b>Welded</b> <b>links.</b> The theory with both forbidden moves added is called the theory of Fused <b>links.</b> Virtual and <b>welded</b> braids.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{structure}} of the virtual braid group. It is shown that the virtual braid group is a semi–direct product of the virtual pure braid group and the symmetric group. Also, it is shown that the virtual pure braid group is a semi–direct product of free groups. From these results we obtain a normal form of words in the virtual braid group. We introduce the concept of a universal braid group. This group contains the classical braid group and has as its quotient groups the singular braid group, virtual braid group, welded braid group, and classical braid group. Recently some generalizations of classical knots and links were defined and studied: singular links [1, 2], virtual links [3, 4] and <b>welded</b> <b>links</b> [5]. One of the ways to study classical links is to study the braid group. Singular braids [6, 2], virtual braids [3, 7], welded braids [5] were defined similar to the classical braid group. Theorem of A.

To overcome this problem, a smooth description of the grain orientation has to be used. To achieve such a description, the grain orientations are computed on a grid thanks to image processing techniques performed on a macrography of the weld.

ResultsMCA initiation followed by GMA-SS welding PM exposure promoted tumor multiplicity in both the low (12. 122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0302122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0301. 5 tumors/mouse) and high (14. 022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0302122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0301. 8 tumors/mouse) exposure groups significantly above MCA/sham (4. 7722 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0302122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 7 tumors/mouse; p 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 0001). Multiplicity was also highly significant (p 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 004) across all individual lung regions of GMA-SS-exposed mice. No exposure effects {{were found in the}} corn oil groups at 3020 weeks. Histopathology confirmed the gross findings and revealed increased inflammation and a greater number of malignant lesions in the MCA/welding PM-exposed groups. ConclusionsGMA-SS welding PM acts as a lung tumor promoter in vivo. Thus, this study provides animal evidence to support the epidemiological data that show welders have an increased lung cancer risk...|$|R
40|$|Particles {{in urban}} environments {{have for a}} long time been {{associated}} with different health problems and diseases, such as worsening of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, metal containing particles present in occupational settings and industries, particularly particles produced during <b>welding,</b> have been <b>linked</b> to several adverse health effects. In recent years it has also become obvious that humans get exposed to metal containing particles in subway systems although possible health effects of such exposure is unknown. Furthermore, engineered nanoparticles (often containing metals) are increasingly being used within various applications including consumer products, thus constituting a risk for human exposure. In all, this means that the exposure to metal containing particles is present in society and may increase in the future due to the increased use of nanoparticles in various products. There is thus today a great need for more knowledge concerning toxicity of these particles. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate the toxicity and underlying biological mechanisms following exposure to different metal containing micro- and nanoparticles from an inhalation perspective. In studies I-IV (paper I-IV), the toxicity and underlying mechanisms were investigated {{for a wide range of}} metal and metal oxide containing micro- and nanoparticles following exposure of cultured human lung cells (A 549). In particular, the importance of material composition, size and ion release for induction of toxicity in terms of cytotoxicity, DNA damage, oxidative DNA damage, mitochondrial depolarisation, generation of intracellular ROS and haemolysis of red blood cells was explored. In general, there was a high variation in the toxic potential of the investigated particles and the high and size-dependent toxicity of CuO was especially highlighted in study I-II. One suggested reason for this is the release of toxic ions inside cells, facilitated by a Trojan horse like mechanism where the particles transport the ions in to the cell. The investigations of industrially relevant iron and chromium based particles revealed that ion release from these particles, in an acidic and complexing fluid, were dependent on particle size and most likely the surface oxide of the particles. Further, investigations of stainless steel (316 L) in several other artificial biological fluids, with neutral and weakly alkaline pH, revealed that the ion release was only increased in the acidic and complexing fluid. The toxicity of the iron and chromium based microparticles was in general low but increased DNA damage potential of 316 L and NiO nanoparticles was observed, and the latter was also confirmed in study III. In study III (paper III), several metal containing particles were observed to have an oxidative capacity. Despite this, no considerable oxidative DNA damage was detected using the FPG comet assay. The results suggest that this may be due to interference of some of the nanoparticles with the FPG enzyme that is supposed to find the oxidative damage within the assay. Ag nanoparticles particularly inhibited the enzyme, mainly due to Ag ions. In study V (paper V), immunological effects in healthy humans were studied during 24 hours after a 2 hour exposure to the PM rich environment of a subway station. The results indicated a small, but transient, direct inflammatory response seen as a decrease in the level of lymphocytes in blood as well as small changes in the lymphocyte subpopulation in the end of the follow-up time. In addition, an increase in DNA damage in mononuclear cells of the blood was detected in some of the subjects. In conclusion, the results from these studies indicate that the chemical composition of metal containing particles is crucial for the toxicity of the tested particles. This thesis especially highlights toxic effects of CuO and NiO nanoparticles. Release of ions from particles may be one important factor for toxicity and this thesis shows that the release of metals ions from stainless steel particles increased in acidic pH. Additionally, interference of nanoparticles and toxicity assays may be important to consider and this thesis highlights possible interactions with FPG in the comet assay especially with Ag nanoparticles. Exposure to the air at a subway station, rich in metal containing particles, did not cause any large acute toxic effects in humans. Still, some parameters indicated that the immune system reacted to the exposure...|$|R
