5|$|He {{scored in}} both match against Cypriot {{opposition}} AEL Limassol in Tottenham's UEFA Europa League play-offs, scoring an 80th-minute {{winner in the}} first leg, and opening the scoring in the 3–0 second leg victory after missing a penalty. He scored a late goal against Nottingham Forest in the League Cup to secure a 3–1 victory for Tottenham on 24 September 2014. On 23 October 2014, Kane scored his first professional hat-trick for Tottenham in a 5–1 win over Asteras Tripoli in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League. Kane was forced to play in goal for the final three minutes of the match, after Hugo Lloris had been sent off with no substitutions remaining, and conceded a goal <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> a free-kick from Jerónimo Barrales.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} to dominate sumo in 2005, {{becoming the first}} wrestler ever to win all six honbasho (sumo tournaments) in the same year. The great yokozuna Taihō achieved the feat of six consecutive tournament victories twice, but never in a calendar year. Asashōryū lost only six bouts all year (0–1–0–2–2–1). One of those rare losses came on 11 September 2005, {{at the start of}} the Aki Basho <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> his first Shonichi (Day 1) bout during his tenure as yokozuna. On 26 November 2005, a visibly emotional Asashōryū wept after winning his eighty-third bout of the year, (surpassing Kitanoumi's record set in 1978) and clinching the tournament at the same time. The six championships of 2005 (including two more 15–0 wins in January and May) combined with his victory from the final tournament of 2004, meant Asashōryū became the first man in sumo history to win seven consecutive tournament championships.|$|E

Meanwhile, he continued to wrestle overseas, competing in such countries as India, Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes {{started his}} career with Eastern Counties League Premier Division side Newmarket Town, where he came to {{prominence}} after scoring hat-tricks in three successive games in 2003. Rhodes scored 20 goals {{in the early part}} of the 2003/04 season, including 14 goals in 11 games in the league. After trials with several Football League clubs, he joined Brentford in November 2003 and scored the goal that ensured they were not relegated six months later. Rhodes scored five goals during his four seasons at Brentford, which were hampered by injury and included loan spells at Swindon Town and Grays Athletic. He signed for Bradford City in August 2007 but was released after one season, before joining Rotherham United. A loan spell at Woking was followed by his release from Rotherham in May 2009, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> back out of the Football League to join Oxford United. He played just four games before leaving Oxford by mutual consent, and moved to Braintree Town, initially on a short-term deal. Rhodes rejoined Grays Athletic in January 2010, but was released at the end of the 2009–10 season.|$|E

He made his Test debut for Sri Lanka against India on 28 August 2015. His arrival to the test team was not good at all, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> Indian skipper Virat Kohli in fairly easy catch. But then he took 2 catches and 1 stumping in that innings. He showed his batting talents right on the first innings of the match, {{where he was the}} top scorer for Sri Lanka with 56 runs in first innings.|$|E

This loss {{set the stage}} for Luger leaving the Four Horsemen, as manager Dillon's interference cost Luger the match. A steel chair thrown in by Dillon was dropped by Luger and Rhodes DDT'd Luger on it prior to pinning him for the win. Luger left the Four Horsemen in 1988 after he and his stablemates (Tully Blanchard, Arn Anderson, and Dillon) were the sole wrestlers left in a Bunkhouse Stampede battle royal and Dillon asked the other wrestlers to eliminate themselves so he could win. Although Blanchard and Anderson complied, Luger refused and eliminated Dillon, leaving the Horsemen in the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{late night}} scenes caused {{issues with the}} cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> a light and accidentally slit his wrists.

In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she {{continued}} filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold that he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days.|$|E

Winterbottom won the second race of the weekend, with Rick Kelly scoring another podium for Nissan Motorsport, while Mostert finished in third place after starting from pole. The Holden Racing Team endured a difficult race after James Courtney carried too much speed into the first corner and took his teammate Garth Tander out of the race. Lee Holdsworth, driving a customer Holden Racing Team car, also suffered damage in the incident. Mostert took his fourth consecutive pole position in qualifying for the third race, becoming the first driver to achieve the feat since Winterbottom in 2011. Mostert was leading at the halfway mark of the race <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> his left-rear wheel onto the grass on the entry to turn four, causing him to spin into the tyre wall.

500|$|Pasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding led the {{official}} investigation; {{he concluded that}} Parsons had been mixing fulminate of mercury in a coffee can <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> it on the floor, causing the initial explosion, which worsened when it {{came into contact with}} other chemicals in the room. Forman considered this likely, stating that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can. Some of Parsons' colleagues rejected this explanation, saying that he was very attentive about safety. Two colleagues from the Bermite Powder Company described Parsons' work habits as [...] "scrupulously neat" [...] and [...] "exceptionally cautious". The latter statement—from chemical engineer George Santymers—insisted that the explosion must have come from beneath the floorboards, implying an organized plot to kill Parsons. Harding accepted that these inconsistencies were [...] "incongruous" [...] but described the manner in which Parsons had stored his chemicals as [...] "criminally negligent", and noted that Parsons had previously been investigated by the police for illegally storing chemicals at the Parsonage. He also found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, suggesting that Parsons was narcotized. The police saw insufficient evidence to continue the investigation and closed the case as an accidental death.|$|E

She discovers that her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) is helping the Doctor by installing thermal couplings underneath the glass floor of the TARDIS. Rory and Amy then start a small argument about Amy cheating when she took her driving test, when the TARDIS suddenly shakes and the lights go out. The Doctor asks Rory if he dropped a thermal coupling, which Rory admits to and apologises for doing. Amy then apologises as well and, at the Doctor's confusion, explains that Rory was looking up her skirt through the glass floor <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> the thermal coupling. The Doctor then notes that they have landed through [...] "emergency materialisation" [...] which should have landed the TARDIS in the safest space available. The lights come on, revealing another TARDIS inside the control room— the TARDIS has materialised inside itself. The Doctor experimentally walks through the door of the TARDIS inside the control room and instantly walks back into the control room through the door of the outer TARDIS. The Doctor tells Rory and Amy that they are trapped in a [...] "space loop" [...] and that nothing can enter or exit the TARDIS ever again. Despite the Doctor's words, another Amy enters through the TARDIS door saying, [...] "Okay, kids, this is where it gets complicated." ...|$|E

He is also credited with framing the college's acclaimed educational policy. In 1881, it became a full-fledged college and high school courses ceased to be taught.
