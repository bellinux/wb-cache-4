2500|$|Peyton {{was further}} {{designed}} as an artist, {{in order to}} add more depth to the character and express what she cannot or does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> also complemented her romance with Lucas, as both are deep thinkers who use their skills {{to speak to the}} world. The actual artist of Peyton's works is Helen Ward. [...] "Before joining , I had already worked as a set designer, storyboard artist and illustrator for a number of films. But I still had to try out for the job," [...] she said. [...] "I think they asked a bunch of people to give their shot at a particular drawing. They were pretty specific about what they were looking for. I guess my work was closest. I got the job." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY (in a whisper). Then, if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> very much, Gov., please {{say it to}} Polly Lasenby.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'll {{come with}} me I'll tell you. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> here, because the girls will hear me;--and that old Peter will know {{everything}} that's said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Ah, but it’s {{exactly what}} I’ve <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It’s</b> very important. You don’t know me—you don’t {{understand}} me. You think you do—but you don’t.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> {{these three}} weeks. Because of late {{she has been}} worse. I told you," [...] added Felix, [...] "it was very delicate." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CHESHIRE. [Sighing] Well, that's all I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It's</b> a {{question}} of your self-respect; I can't give you any real advice. But just remember {{that if you want}} a friend---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't think you'll ever <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> again, Davy--or think it, either. And I wouldn't {{go about}} much with Mr. Harrison's hired boy if I were you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> Jane--I knew {{it would}} hurt you. And, after all, I couldn't be sure. I still don't {{understand}} why, if he's Mr. Brown, he rescued us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Anne, I'll {{never say}} it again--never. I'll never <b>WANT</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> again. I {{knew it was}} bad, but I didn't s'pose it was so--so--I didn't s'pose it was like THAT." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a bad word, Anne," [...] {{blurted out}} Davy, with a desperate effort. [...] "I heard Mr. Harrison's hired boy <b>say</b> <b>it</b> {{one day last}} week, and ever since I've been <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> ALL the time--even when I'm saying my prayers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Common humanity--nonsense! I {{should always}} have done as much; besides, I was {{crippled}} everywhere, not merely by want of {{power as a}} priest, but by having made myself such a shallow, thoughtless ass. But {{that was not what}} I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> was about Gadley and his confession." ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2012 a {{call for}} {{co-operation}} between the WTO and Economic Partnership Agreements (also termed regional trade agreements) like the TPP came after Pierre Lellouche described the sentiment of the Doha round negotiations; [...] "Although no one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> we must call a cat a cat (failure is failure)...".|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I love him?" [...] she said. [...] "Oh, {{what words}} can say Yes for me, as I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it?</b> I love him--!" [...] Her voice faltered softly; and her answer {{ended in a}} sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said, [...] "we will bury it. But {{before we}} do so, {{there is one thing}} I have had it in my mind to say--for some time. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> now. It is about your daughter, Colonel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you humour me?" [...] he asked. [...] "There is {{something}} I {{want to say}} to you, and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> here. May we drive to Albert Gate and walk in the Park a little way? I can find you another taxi the other side." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hunter told Taste of Country {{about writing}} the song: [...] "At the time, I {{was trying to}} tell {{somebody}} something, but I couldn't figure out how <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> So I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> in music because I knew it would be a little more impactful. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we are great in this relationship together, and I feel like it could even get better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wrote and}} asked if I might see you alone, because I had {{something}} that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you. I've <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> ever since we were at Court Leys together, but I was going away--heaven only knows when I shall come back, and perhaps something may happen to me--and I thought it was unfair to you to speak.' ...|$|R
5000|$|I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see it myself. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> either 'top or flop'. I hope {{it works}} for them because it could improve gamers' lives. The {{technology}} of video-based rendering is not actually a very new concept but they do some things that others didn't do before {{so it will be}} interesting to see.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I have {{something}} to tell you which I cannot tell unless we are going to die. You know it, but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> with my own lips before I die. I love you, John, I love you, I love you; and I am glad to die because I can die with you, and go away with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{not wrong}} for you, Kilmeny. But {{it was a}} little wrong for me, because I knew better--or rather, should have known better. I didn't stop to think, as the {{children}} say. Some day you will understand fully. Now, you will take me to your uncle and aunt, and after I have said to them what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> will be all right for us to meet here or anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harold {{fell back}} feebly and wearily upon the pillows. [...] "Ernest, Ernest," [...] he cried, gasping, [...] "you might forgive me! {{you ought to}} forgive me! you must forgive me! and I'll tell you why. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> but now you force me. I know {{it as well as}} if I'd seen you do it. In my place, I know to a certainty, Ernest, you'd have done exactly as I did. Ernest Carnegie, you can't look me {{straight}} in the face and tell me that you wouldn't have acted exactly as I did." ...|$|E
60|$|But he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was not so. Reaching the house, he hastened upwards to his far-off, lonely room, {{through the}} dark corridors. Once in his own apartment, he {{shut the door and}} {{switched}} on the light, a sensation like fear at his heart. Then he searched his other pockets. He looked everywhere. In vain.|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>Want</b> Her <b>To</b> <b>Say</b> <b>It</b> Again" [...] (Merald Knight, Gladys Knight, William Guess, Johnny Bristol) ...|$|R
50|$|The Sunsets Farewell Tour was a 2010 concert tour of Australian {{rock band}} Powderfinger. It was their last concert tour {{following}} the announcement on 9 April 2010 {{that they would}} be breaking up after the tour, <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> would be their last ever as the band had musically said everything they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> coincided with the release of their final album, Golden Rule, on 13 November 2009.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{perhaps you}} will let me, instead, say {{something}} to you. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> earnestly, and with as plain a meaning as {{it is possible to}} express. When you think of us, John--I mean my brother, and sister, and me--don't think of us as being any different from the rest; for, whatever we once were (which I hardly know) we ceased to be long ago, and never can be any more. It will be much better for you, and much better for others, if you will do that instead of what you are doing now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} more," [...] I said, [...] "and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> to you now. It may seem to you both unnecessary. Perhaps it is. Still, it is better that we should come to an {{understanding}} about it. A year has passed since Isobel, the child, came to us. To-day she is a woman. If we still keep her with us {{there must be a}} bond, a covenant between us, and our honour must stand pledged to keep it. I think that you both know very well what I mean. I hope that you will both agree with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not seem}} to take account of the speech. And his silence--goad to indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- [...] "You saved him, Mr. Brice. I--we all--thank you so much. And that is not all I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>It</b> is a poor enough {{acknowledgment}} of what you did,--for we have not always treated you well." [...] Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand in pained protest. But she continued: [...] "I shall regard it as a debt I can never repay. It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help you, but I shall pray for that opportunity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to MTV.com, Method Man {{revealed}} his, Ghostface Killah's and Raekwon's {{plans to}} record a separate album as a trio: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> written in stone, but it's in discussion. I want some feedback from the fans {{to see how they}} would take that. RZA produced tracks, some other outside producers, of course, and we gonna have Wu-Tang members on the album, but it'll be a Rae, Ghost and Meth album." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is so much}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and <b>it</b> mayn't be so easy--afterwards," [...] she said. [...] "It's a {{pity the}} train starts so soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|He went on. [...] "Oh, you needn't be afraid. I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> that's all. If {{there was}} only some other way to {{straighten}} myself--but I can't go to jail. I can't stand up to be clipped like a poodle-dog, then put on striped clothing and walk lock-step--I can't do it! They'll put me in for ten years. I'd be old when I got out." [...] He shuddered. [...] "No, I won't do that! I'd rather die here in the hills." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Hawk dear, I couldn't even if--just now, I do <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> but I {{want to be}} fair. I am terribly {{happy to}} be in the house of Hawk's arms. I'm not afraid in it, even out here on the dark dunes--which Aunt Emma wouldn't--somehow--approve! But I do want to be fair to you, and I'm afraid I'm not, when I let you love me this way. I don't want to hurt you. Ever. Perhaps it's egotistical of me, but I'm afraid you would be hurt if I let you kiss me and then {{afterward}} I decided I didn't love you at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, dear Miss Cornelia," [...] said Anne seriously, [...] "I {{think we}} have all been making too many excuses. It is very foolish {{and we ought to}} stop it. I am {{going to tell you what}} I'd LIKE to do. I shan't do it, of course"--Anne had noted a glint of alarm in Susan's eye--"it would be too un{{conventional}}, and we must be conventional or die, after we reach what is supposed to be a dignified age. But I'd LIKE to do it. I'd like to call a meeting of the Ladies Aid and W.M.S. and the Girls Sewing Society, and include in the audience all and any Methodists who have been criticizing the Merediths--although I do think if we Presbyterians stopped criticizing and excusing we would find that other denominations would trouble themselves very little about our manse folks. I would say to them, 'Dear Christian friends'--with marked emphasis on 'Christian'--I have something to say to you and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> good and hard, that you may take it home and repeat it to your families. You Methodists need not pity us, and we Presbyterians need not pity ourselves. We are not going to do it any more. And we are going to say, boldly and truthfully, to all critics and sympathizers, 'We are PROUD of our minister and his family. Mr. Meredith is the best preacher Glen St. Mary church ever had. Moreover, he is a sincere, earnest teacher of truth and Christian charity. He is a faithful friend, a judicious pastor in all essentials, and a refined, scholarly, well-bred man. His family are worthy of him. Gerald Meredith is the cleverest pupil in the Glen school, and Mr. Hazard says that he is destined to a brilliant career. He is a manly, honourable, truthful little fellow. Faith Meredith is a beauty, and as inspiring and original as she is beautiful. There is nothing commonplace about her. All the other girls in the Glen put together haven't the vim, and wit, and joyousness and 'spunk' she has. She has not an enemy in the world. Every one who knows her loves her. Of how many, children or grown-ups, can that be said? Una Meredith is sweetness personified. She will make a most lovable woman. Carl Meredith, with his love for ants and frogs and spiders, will some day be a naturalist whom all Canada--nay, all the world, will delight to honour. Do you know of any other family in the Glen, or out of it, of whom all these things can be said? Away with shamefaced excuses and apologies. We REJOICE in our minister and his splendid boys and girls!" ...|$|E
50|$|Speak {{what you}} want to say and say it in the way you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> This {{combines}} points two through six above.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but <b>it</b> sounds {{different}} on your lips. It {{sounds as though}} you meant it yourself, and that you meant it because of me." ...|$|R
60|$|He hurried forward. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make sure. He wanted relief. It {{was as if}} {{the power}} of evil had {{suddenly}} seized him and thrown him, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was not so, that he had imagined it all, conjured it up. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> admit the power of evil--particularly at that moment. For surely a very ugly evil spirit had struck him, in the midst of that gang of Italian soldiers. He knew it--it had pierced him. It had got him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are so simple--so {{much like}} a child," [...] Olive Chancellor said. That was the truth, and she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> because, quickly, without forms or circumlocutions, it made them familiar. She wished to arrive at this; her impatience was such that before the girl had been five minutes in the room she jumped to her point--inquired of her, {{interrupting}} herself, interrupting everything: [...] "Will you be my friend, my friend of friends, beyond every one, everything, for ever and for ever?" [...] Her face was full of eagerness and tenderness.|$|R
