5|$|The pre-1980 subway {{stations}} of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway font on the stations' walls. The tiling theme {{was influenced by the}} Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the tiles, one for main <b>wall</b> <b>tiles</b> and another for trim tiles near the ceiling of the stations. The station names on the main <b>wall</b> <b>tiles</b> use the colour of the trim tiles and vice versa, except that some of the station names of the trim tiles are white instead of the main wall tile colour for readability.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Second Avenue Subway resumed construction. As {{part of the}} project, {{the station}} was to undergo {{renovation}} to finish the BMT side, which would serve Second Avenue Line trains. The renovation included installation of new platform staircases, new <b>wall</b> <b>tiles,</b> new columns and column cladding, new platform pavings, new entrances/exits, new low-vibration track, and new mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, and communication systems. The contract for renovation of the station was awarded to Judlau Contracting on January 13, 2011.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 1976, an {{arsonist}} lit a fire on {{a subway}} train at Christie station. The fire destroyed four subway cars and some <b>wall</b> <b>tiles,</b> and resulted in {{a section of the}} subway being closed for a few days. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This program would result in making the subway system more accessible, add new bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{comprehensive}} review of the literature concerning the various causes of failures of external <b>wall</b> <b>tile</b> finishes. Design/methodology/approach - A 4 × 3 matrix hierarchy framework is developed for a systematic analysis of the literature reviewed. Findings - The findings from this paper indicate the importance of environmental effects, movement joints, and adhesive on the performance of external <b>wall</b> <b>tile</b> finishes. Thermal and moisture effects induce movement of tiles, and the failure of the tiling system depends very much on the adhesive strength and the provision of movement joints. Workmanship is also a key factor affecting the performance of external <b>wall</b> <b>tile</b> finishes and should not be overlooked. Research limitations/implications - Various studies have been carried out on the causes of defects in external finishes in the past. However, many of them were case-oriented and were not supported by laboratory findings. The hierarchical framework developed in this paper serves as a basis for further laboratory and field studies on this issue. Practical implications - The framework is conducive to the diagnosis of external <b>wall</b> <b>tile</b> delamination. Originality/value - This paper reviews systematically and comprehensively the literature on the causes of external <b>wall</b> <b>tile</b> delamination. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} over the sub-surface platforms, the station buildings were remodelled internally to share a single entrance and ticket office. Space in the Piccadilly line building that was formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit to the street is now used for retail purposes. During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged <b>wall</b> <b>tiles</b> being replaced. The dark green and cream tiled walls of the Piccadilly line's lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2007, {{construction}} resumed on the Second Avenue Subway, {{and as part}} of the line's construction, the BMT side of {{the station}} would finally be used. The orange wall was removed and replaced by a temporary barrier. Beige-white <b>wall</b> <b>tiles</b> were installed on the station walls adjacent to the tracks. The never-opened entrance at Third Avenue was redesigned with multiple elevators, and the station's false ceiling was removed. Before Second Avenue Subway service began operating, the temporary walls were removed, revealing the BMT side of the station. On January 1, 2017, {{the first phase of the}} Second Avenue Subway opened, with Q trains, and limited rush hour N trains serving the BMT half of the station. Ridership has increased at the station with the opening of the Third Avenue exit and the introduction of Q service. Many passengers now take advantage of the cross-platform transfer available between the F and the Q.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish loggia {{on the southwest}} elevation of the house. Bottomley was able to incorporate the existing parapets, finials and pierced railings and posts from the north library bay windows into the loggia design, with a ceiling reconstructed from a sixteenth-century house {{on the grounds of}} a manor in Knole, Kent, England. <b>Wall</b> <b>tiles</b> were used which indicated use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his loggia was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of picturesqueness and romance {{that the rest of the}} house displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the loggia was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for his drawings and construction.|$|E

5|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies. If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one life and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition {{can be found in}} hidden rooms revealed by activating certain <b>wall</b> <b>tiles</b> that slide back when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} beige <b>wall</b> <b>tiles</b> with intertwining blue and orange stripes, {{representing}} the two {{colors of the}} New York City flag, and {{the colors of the}} IND Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue lines which serve the station. There are two fare control areas. The full-time area at the east end of the station, between 179th and 180th Streets, has a token booth and a bank of 12 turnstiles and two high-exit-only turnstiles. The part-time exit at 178th Street contains a nine-turnstile bank, two high exit entrance turnstiles (HEETs), and two high exit turnstiles. The two ends are connected by a full-length mezzanine, which features Our Spectrum of Support artwork by Reginald Polynice, a set of plywood cutout figures appearing to hold up the ceiling of the mezzanine.

Evolution of the microstructure was followed by XRD and SEM. The results revealed that the main phases formed during the sintering step are anorthite, gehlenite and hematite. It appears that the sintering process {{is characterized by the}} presence of a small amount of a liquid phase below 1140 °C.

25|$|While the {{production}} of pots and utensils is Mexico's signature pottery, ceramic floor and <b>wall</b> <b>tiles</b> consist of the bulk of Mexico's ceramic production. The second largest type of ceramic product is bathroom fixtures, such as toilets, washbasins and accessories. Most of the raw materials are obtained from the local market, with limited amounts of other raw materials being imported. Most of equipment used to mass-produce ceramics of this type comes from Italy, including pressure molds and development technology. However, companies are also considering US suppliers for mixers, conveyors, ovens and electronic control equipment due to the country's proximity and NAFTA tariffs.|$|E
25|$|After the Spanish Invasion and Conquest, European {{techniques}} and designs were introduced, nearly wiping out the native traditions. Indigenous traditions {{survive in a}} few pottery items such as comals, {{and the addition of}} indigenous design elements into mostly European motifs. Today, ceramics are still produced from traditional items such as dishes, kitchen utensils to new items such as sculptures and folk art. Despite the fame of the prior, the bulk of ceramic items produced in the country are floor and <b>wall</b> <b>tiles</b> along with bathroom fixtures. Mexico has a number of well-known artisan ceramic traditions, most of which are in the center and south of the country. Examples are the Talavera of Puebla, the majolica of Guanajuato, the various wares of the Guadalajara area, and barro negro of Oaxaca. A more recent addition is the production of Mata Ortiz or Pakimé wares in Chihuahua. While the number of artisans has been dropping due to competition from mass-produced items, the production of folk art and fine ware still has {{an important role in the}} Mexican economy and the production of pottery in general is still important to Mexican culture.|$|E
