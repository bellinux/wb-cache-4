2500|$|In September 2006, 22-year-old Melinda Duckett {{committed}} suicide following an interview conducted by Grace concerning {{the disappearance of}} Duckett's 2-year-old son Trenton. Grace interviewed Duckett {{less than two weeks}} after the child went missing, questioning her for her alleged lack of openness regarding her son's disappearance, asking Duckett [...] "Where were you? Why aren't you telling us where you were that day?" [...] Duckett appeared confused and was unable to answer whether or not she had taken a polygraph test. When Grace asked her why she could not account for specific details, Duckett began to reply, [...] "Because I was told not to," [...] to which Grace responded, [...] "Ms. Duckett, you are not telling us for a reason. What is the reason? You refuse to give even the simplest facts of where you were <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> before he went missing. It is day twelve." [...] According to the CNN transcript, Duckett replied, [...] "(INAUDIBLE) with all media. It's not just there, just all media. Period." [...] Grace then moved on to a psychologist who asserted that Duckett was [...] "skirting around the issue." ...|$|E

Public scandal exaggerates enormously, of course; but moralize as you will, superabundant vitality {{is a physical}} fact that cant be talked away. [He sits down between the writing table and the sideboard]. Difficult question this, of bringing up children. Between ourselves, it has beaten me. I never was so surprised in my life as when I came to know Johnny {{as a man of}} business and found out what he was really like. How did you manage <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>sons?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. H. That {{has nothing}} to do <b>with</b> us. <b>Your</b> <b>son</b> came and {{wrenched}} the knowledge out of Mr. DAWKER by abuse and threats; that is all. You will kindly behave yourself here, or I shall ask that you be shown out.|$|R

"Sir Philip," [...] said Reginald, [...] "you overrate my influence, and underrate the Prince's judgment, if {{you imagine}} aught save {{personal}} merit would weigh <b>with</b> him. <b>Your</b> <b>son</b> shall have every opportunity of deserving his notice, {{but whether it}} be favourable or not must depend on himself. If you desire more, you must not seek it of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was safe}} enough with us," [...] Frank said. [...] "No one would venture {{to try a}} tent with a pretty strong party; but <b>with</b> only <b>your</b> <b>son</b> and {{yourself}} {{there might have been}} a temptation to some broken-down gambler to carry it off. Besides, we have Turk as a guard, and I don't fancy any one would venture to try any tricks with our tent while he is inside it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I admire you for it, old boy. I don't believe I {{should have}} done it at your age--too much of a Forsyte, I'm afraid. But I suppose the type gets thinner <b>with</b> each generation. <b>Your</b> <b>son,</b> if you have one, may be a pure altruist; who knows?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' asked Logan, 'have things gone so very far? Is the {{disaster}} irremediable? I am acquainted <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> Lord Scremerston; in fact, {{he was my}} fag at school. May I speak quite freely?' ...|$|E

"Your son," [...] {{replied the}} Doctor, [...] "wrote {{to me by}} the same messenger: he seldom fails to do so, being aware of what {{importance}} it is that I should know every thing that passes. Means of escape are provided on the coast, and Master Kerneguy must be ready to start <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> the instant he appears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{think it}} may refer to <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> Mrs. Conway," [...] Major Barlow said. [...] "I have just {{returned}} from town, and happened to hear that a vessel had been spoken with that reported having picked up a lad from a smack run down in the channel some five months ago, which corresponds pretty well, I think, <b>with</b> the time <b>your</b> <b>son</b> was missing." ...|$|R
60|$|It remains now {{for us to}} join heartily, as we all do, {{in expressing}} a wish that, being convalescent, {{you would not be}} tempted to over-exert yourself.

"Vincy, I must repeat, {{that you}} will not get any {{concurrence}} from me as to the course you have pursued <b>with</b> <b>your</b> eldest <b>son.</b> It was entirely from worldly vanity that you destined him for the Church: with a family of three sons and four daughters, you were not warranted in devoting money to an expensive education which has succeeded in nothing but in giving him extravagant idle habits. You are now reaping the consequences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel {{inclined}} {{to make a}} lazy day of it and go out <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> Archie," [...] said Mabberly, [...] "to look at the best views for photographing.

6000|$|... "Good day to you, Mrs Stuart; I {{trust you}} will forgive my abrupt intrusion, but urgent {{business}} must be my excuse. I have called {{to have a}} little further conversation <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> respecting that rascally pirate who has given me so much trouble. If he will have the goodness to take a short walk with me, I shall be much indebted." ...|$|E

[...] The {{brothers}} settle that Jolyon will pay full price for the house. June gets along well with her father's family as they unpack their belongings at Robin Hill. She discovers a bundle of paintings of her father's; among them is a painting of her father she did as a child. The family toasts to [...] "new beginnings." ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{concerns}} {{about the development of}} the attachment between the adolescent mother and her baby. Its objectives are to know the adolescent’s experience as a mother; to recognize the manifestations of attachment between mother/baby and to know the factors that facilitate and/or interfere the development of the attachment. It is a longitudinal study with a qualitative approach, realized with six adolescent mothers, between thirteen and nineteen years old, and their babies, linked to the Family Health Program (FHP) from Vila Pinto, a popular class comunity in Porto Alegre/RS. The collection of the information was realized through semi-structered interviews and participatory observations. For the analysis of the information, an analysis of the content was used, from where the following cathegories emerged: satisfaction with the maternity; bonding-attachment; familiar support and interrupted project of life. The results indicate that the familiar and the partener’s support are the bonding facilitating factors, since youngesters have this support, show an affectionate relationship with their babies, but we can not to say that others adolescents whose don’t have this support, don’t development of the attachment <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>sons...</b>|$|R
