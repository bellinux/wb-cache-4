40|$|<b>White</b> <b>specks</b> are undyed {{spots on}} dyed fabric, and are {{commonly}} caused by neps. According to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D 123 - 96, 1996), a nep is “a tightly tangled knot-like mass of unorganized fibers. ” Due to low cellulose {{content of the}} neps, clumps of these fibers do not accept dye. Therefore, when a fabric is dyed, the mechanical and biological neps formed by fine or immature fibers create undyed spots in the finished fabric. These undyed spots are known as <b>white</b> <b>specks.</b> Quality of a finished garment is determined by, among other things, the number of imperfections contained within the fabric. The more imperfections found in the cloth, the less value added the product has from the manufacturer. Since uniform surface color is a desirable aspect for fabrics, the inclusion of <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> is detrimental to fabric quality. The process of counting <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> is very tedious and time consuming. Since the late 1930 s, <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> were counted manually using a back light or a black background. Even today, <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> are being counted manually relying on visual inspection. The manual counting {{is not only a}} tedious and timeconsuming process but also inconsistent and prone to error because it is very subjective. In this research, a robust image analysis system was developed to count and size <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> on dyed fabric that can minimize the variations from light fluctuations and automatically perform threshold and calibration...|$|R

60|$|The boys {{might as}} well have husbanded their strength, as was learned on {{arriving}} at the point; for, to the great disappointment of both, the sail was so far away that it became necessary to search the horizon-line several moments before discovering the tiny <b>white</b> <b>speck.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-17 mm {{for males}} and about 17 mm for females. The forewings are fuscous with various markings, including a light yellow spot on the costa at three-fourth from the base, followed by a row of diffused <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> below up to the inner margin, two <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> at one-third from the base and a blackish-fuscous discocellular spot sparsely suffused with white.

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-17 mm. The forewings are grey closely irrorated dark fuscous. The stigmata {{are hardly}} perceptible, but the plical is sometimes preceded {{and followed by}} minute <b>white</b> <b>specks.</b> The hindwings are grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{sandgrouse}} is {{a medium-sized}} bird with a plump body, small head and short legs. It grows to {{a length of}} about 28 cm. The male has an orangish buff head, throat and chest delineated by a conspicuous narrow band of white and dark brown. The back and wings are mottled brown with large <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> {{and there are two}} long black filaments extending from the olive-brown tail. The colouring of the female and juvenile is more cryptic being generally various shades of brown patterned with <b>white</b> <b>specks.</b> It could be confused with the double-banded sandgrouse (Pterocles bicinctus) and Burchell's sandgrouse (Pterocles burchelli), which share the same range.|$|R
50|$|Underside of {{the male}} is duller, and more opaque than on the upperside; the brownish-black apical area of forewing and base of hindwing thinly {{sprinkled}} with yellowish-brown scales.

Hindwing markings {{are similar to those}} on the upperside but smaller, more widely divided one from the other by the veins which are edged with black; a subterminal more or less well-defined series of small white lunules and a terminal series of <b>white</b> <b>specks.</b> Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen black; {{on the underside of the}} body a spot behind the eyes and <b>white</b> spots and <b>specks</b> on the thorax and abdomen.|$|R
60|$|Three lofty windows gave on the harbour. There {{was nothing}} in them but the dark-blue {{sparkling}} sea and the paler luminous blue of the sky. My eye caught in the depths and distances of these blue tones the <b>white</b> <b>speck</b> of some big ship just arrived and about to anchor in the outer roadstead. A ship from home--after perhaps ninety days at sea. There is something touching about a ship coming in from sea and folding her white wings for a rest.|$|E
60|$|All {{attention}} was now bestowed on the <b>white</b> <b>speck</b> which was {{visible on the}} margin of the ocean, and which the 'Skimmer of the Seas' confidently pronounced to be the Water-Witch. None but a seaman could have felt this certainty; for, seen from the low raft, there was little else to be distinguished but the heads of the upper sails. The direction too was unfavorable, as it was to leeward; but both Ludlow and the free-trader assured their companions, that the vessel was endeavoring to beat in with the land.|$|E
60|$|As {{the bark}} bore {{me out of}} the harbor of Genoa, how eagerly my eyes Stretched along the coast of Sestri, till it discerned the villa gleaming from among trees {{at the foot of the}} mountain.

60|$|Now, while Fred {{was nodding}} in his cart, {{and trying to}} keep awake that night, he little thought that he was so nearly {{attaining}} the great object for which he had come to Norway. Yet so it was. They came, in course of time, to the summit of a ridge from which could be had a splendid view of the fiord, and the sea with its thousands of islands beyond, and the Snowflake floating like a <b>white</b> <b>speck</b> on the blue water far below. Here Hans pulled up and touched Fred on the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Stepping {{forward in}} this {{direction}} yet a little further, {{he could see the}} tower of West Endelstow Church, beneath which he was to meet his Elfride that night. And {{at the same time he}} noticed, coming over the hill from the cliffs, a <b>white</b> <b>speck</b> in motion. It seemed first to be a sea-gull flying low, but ultimately proved to be a human figure, running with great rapidity. The form flitted on, heedless of the rain which had caused Stephen's halt in this place, dropped down the heathery hill, entered the vale, and was out of sight.|$|E
60|$|We unsaddled our horses {{near the}} spring, and {{prepared}} to pass the night. The evening was fine, and the atmosphere so clear that the masts of the vessels at anchor in the bay of Valparaiso, although no less than twenty-six geographical miles distant, could be distinguished clearly as little black streaks. A ship doubling the point under sail appeared as a bright <b>white</b> <b>speck.</b> Anson expresses much surprise, in his voyage, at the distance at which his vessels were discovered from the coast; {{but he did not}} sufficiently allow for the height of the land and the great transparency of the air.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The forewings are very dark fuscous {{with an almost}} marginal series of <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> around the posterior sixth of the costa and the termen. The hindwings are dark fuscous, lighter towards the base.|$|R
50|$|This nudbranch is red, and the dorsum {{is covered}} with caryophyllidia. There are {{regularly}} distributed, rounded brown patches all over the back, and scattered <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> {{at the edge of}} the mantle. The rhinophore club is edged with white pigment.|$|R
40|$|Before a quality-related issue can be {{addressed}} from a causal and predictive perspective, {{there has to be}} a reliable and repeatable system designed to detect and quantify the problem. Current fiber testing was not designed to measure or detect the presence of dead or immature fibers in the small quantities that have been determined to be detri-mental to the quality of dyed finished products. In the absence of applicable fiber testing, the most logical step would be the development of a count-ing procedure that would allow the accurate and repeatable quantification of <b>white</b> <b>specks</b> in a test medium that has significance to the end product.
