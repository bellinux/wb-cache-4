Ignorant and superficial readers take them in a literal, not in a figurative sense. Even well informed persons are bewildered if they understand these passages in their literal signification, but they are entirely relieved of their perplexity when <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the figure, or merely suggest that the terms are figurative. For this reason I have called this book Guide for the Perplexed”.|$|E
2500|$|Hacker's {{political}} party is never explicitly stated - a deliberate ploy by the series' creators {{to prevent the}} show from having a partisan affiliation. This begins in very first scene of the 'Yes Minister' pilot episode, where the victorious Hacker's party rosette is white, {{as opposed to the}} red (for Labour) and blue (for the Conservatives) rosettes worn by the other candidates. The Labour and Conservative parties are eventually compared in The National Education Service, when Sir Humphrey tells Bernard, [...] "When there is a Labour government, the education authorities tell them that comprehensives abolish the class system and when there's a Tory government we tell them that it's the cheapest way of providing mass education; to Labour <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> that selective education is divisive and to the Tories <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> that it is expensive." [...] but Sir Humphrey then goes on to tell Hacker neither of these things, forgoing any suggestion that Hacker is from either party. Throughout the show, Hacker's political opinions tend towards reform of administration and are neither left nor right wing. However, the concentration on [...] "making budget cuts (of 5%)" [...] in the Yes Minister episode [...] "Doing the Honours" [...] and cutting taxes in the Yes Prime Minister episode [...] "The Smoke Screen" [...] allude towards him being a conservative; and the writers have since established that they privately saw Hacker as a centrist [...] "wet" [...] Conservative.|$|E
2500|$|The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, {{called the}} raid an [...] "unforgivable crime" [...] and {{suggested}} Britain and the US had coordinated their withdrawal so Israel could send in tanks {{as soon as}} the monitors left. He asked: [...] "I'm giving the facts. They [...] left at 9.20am and the Israelis came in at 9.30am. How can <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> that?". Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that [...] "This was a severe blow to the Palestinian Authority and to Abu Mazen [...] personally". Sufian Abu Zaida, the Palestinian minister of prisoners, told Israel Radio that the operation [...] "was designed to show the Palestinians what the Israelis can do, and to show the Hamas government what will happen -- no agreements, no cooperation, no coordination, only force".|$|E

In this activity, <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> how the {{participant}} {{could use the}} Organic tool to collect either the list of agglomerations or the list of (non-agglomerated) code smells.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{show how the}} {{combination}} of Behaviour Tree and Utility Based AI architecture {{can be used to}} design more realistic bots for Military Simulators. In this work, we have designed a mathematical model of a simulator system which in turn helps in analyzing the results and finding out the various spaces on which our favorable situation might exist, this is done geometrically. In the mathematical model, <b>we</b> have <b>explained</b> the matrix formation and its significance followed up in dynamic programming approach <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> the possible graph formation which will led improvisation of AI, latter <b>we</b> <b>explained</b> the possible geometrical structure of the matrix operations and its impact on a particular decision, <b>we</b> also <b>explained</b> the conditions under which it tend to fail along with a possible solution in future works.

6000|$|It is {{difficult}} to suppose that Dr. Cumming can have been so grossly imposed upon—that he can be so ill-informed as really to believe that these lines were “written” by Lord Byron in his dying moments; but, allowing him the full benefit of that possibility, how shall <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> his introduction of this feebly rabid doggrel as “an infidel’s brightest thoughts?” ...|$|E

6000|$|How can <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the {{reckless}} {{retention of}} errors, {{and also the}} large additions and improvements? Did the true author (Bacon or Bungay) now edit his work, add much matter, and go wrong forty-seven times where the quarto was right, and go right twenty times when the quarto was wrong? Did he, for the Folio of 1623, nearly double The Merry Wives in extent, and also leave all the errors of the fourth quarto uncorrected? ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the second}} day after the tea-party just described, John Lockhart, Esquire, and Mr Spivin met in a low public-house not far from Cherub Court.

It may seem strange that two such men should choose a low tavern in such a neighbourhood for confidential intercourse, but when <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> that both were landlords of numerous half-decayed tenements there, the choice will not seem so peculiar. Lockhart frowned darkly at his companion.|$|E

" ... any theory, {{by which}} <b>we</b> <b>explain</b> the {{operations}} of the [...] understanding, or the origin and connexion of the passions in man, [...] will acquire additional authority if we find that the same theory [...] is requisite to explain the same phenomena in all other animals.
