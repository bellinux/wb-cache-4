This is not due to any {{university}} policy, but rather the preference of seniors, who select houses first in the student housing lottery due to their larger number of credit hours.|$|E

More recently, the Green was the location of a controversial 2006 May Day rally in favor of immigrant rights.|$|E

40|$|We analyse the {{adjustment}} {{of public education}} spending in response to rapidly decreasing student cohorts in East Germany where birth rates collapsed after German reunification. Previous results from the literature {{based on data from}} more stable demographic periods suggest that public resources are incompletely adjusted, and that large reductions in the student population would thus translate into major increases in spending per student. Our empirical analysis suggests, however, that resource adjustments in East Germany have been considerable, especially in the years <b>when</b> <b>student</b> cohorts actually decreased. Adjustments were less tight <b>when</b> <b>student</b> numbers began to stagnate. Although our results are restricted to public education, they may be interpreted as early evidence on fiscal adjustments during strong demographic change, which will play a growing role in the years to come.
