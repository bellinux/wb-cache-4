40|$|Purpose: Objective of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} the forces acting on the structural elements of railway wagons. It is part of research conducted under a grant, on the use of composites in the repair and construction of new structural elements of railway wagons. Design/methodology/approach: The main tool of verification of the research is Siemens PLM Software NX 7. 5. Motion simulation has been carried out in one module of the software, Motion Simulation. Connections between components have been made using constraints and connections mapping the real relationship between components. Findings: The aim {{of the study}} was to identify the forces acting on the door, and establish a database of input for further research. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of the study were the possibility of mapping all the connections of components, in the same way as in reality. The second limitation was the maximum length of track, depending on the number of possible landmarks in which it was possible the measurement of variables. Originality/value: Results of the analysis of the wagon constructed with the standard steel components are input data to research on the modification of structural components on the basis of fibrous composite The results obtained are an example of application of the methods of computer analysis, on the basic type of <b>testing</b> <b>wagons.</b> Completed study is the first step in a study of movement railway wagon in further stages will be possible to perform the studies in more complex aspects of the movemen...|$|R
50|$|Road & Track {{magazine}} was impressed, noting the car's improved fuel economy and price {{compared to the}} RX-3. This was notable, as the Wankel engine had suffered by the mid 1970s with {{a reputation as a}} gas-guzzler. Performance was good in a 1974 comparison <b>test</b> of six <b>wagons,</b> with an 11.7 s sprint to 60 mi/h km/h and an 18 s/77.5 mph quarter-mile. The magazine noted that the wagon's brakes suffered from the extra 300 lb weight compared to the coup√©.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis {{based on the}} results from strength-deformation analysis of wagon body, series Fals, and on the results from the real <b>wagon</b> <b>test</b> was made. Calculations were carried out in the Department of Railway Engineering at Technical University of Sofia and are based on the finite elements method. Two computational models of wagon design were developed. One of them consists of shell elements (triangular), and the second one of solid elements (tetrahedral). Experimental studies on real wagon were conducted at the National Transport Research Institute. It was found that the results obtained for the stresses are similar, which proves that the models are appropriate and they can help to solve a wide range of issues, for example those related to lightweight design of railway vehicles...|$|R

It is expected that Boston will be reached by August, 22. The total distance is about 850 miles. George K. Wheeler general manager of the company, J. E. Caps, two chauffeurs and newspaper men and representatives of the A. A. A. will constitute the party; a 50-horsepower Kansas City tourabout will also make the trip." ...|$|R
40|$|Field <b>testing</b> of the <b>wagon</b> {{health card}} was {{completed}} using the RailCorp AK Track recording car. The wagon health card device was {{installed on the}} AK Car to allow the device to be tested and compared with the measured track data and AK car vehicle responses. As wheel rail contact forces cannot be measured directly these were calculated using VAMPIRE simulation. An inverse model with parameters matching the AK Car was embedded in the wagon health card device. The inverse model had been developed in earlier research to predict wheel rail contact forces using only measurements of car body responses; lateral and vertical accelerations, roll, pitch and yaw angular velocities. The device tested was also a proof of concept test for an integrated device with all transducers mounted within the one small 'black box'. Testing was completed in January 2007 on the Parks-Cobar section in NSW. The following paper presents the results and discusses the difficulties in validation without direct wheel-rail contact forces measurements. The results for estimating vertical contact forces were quite encouraging and acceptable for a proof of concept device. There was significant difference in lateral predictions and hence L/V ratios probably due to differences between assumed and actual wheel profiles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{special wagon}} {{with a low}} {{rotatable}} loading platform for transportation of truck vehicles by rail was developed in Military University of Technology in the Department of Mechanics and Applied Computer Science in Warsaw. The essence of such reloading is to place the semitrailer on a special rotatable platform {{with the use of}} a truck tractor. The structure can be used for transportation of different types of vehicles such as tractors, trucks, trailers, semitrailers and cargo containers. The wagon allows quick and fast loading and unloading without any platform infrastructure or terminals. An intermodal transport system based on an innovative concept of the railway wagon, which will use the national railway infrastructure, was developed. The process of loading and unloading the trailers can be performed considering a whole train or individual wagons from any part of the train (no cranes needed). This type of railway wagon will allow transport companies to save time and money for road transport. The advantages of this construction are reduction of the negative impact on the environment as well as an increase of road safety by reducing the number of vehicles on the roads. As part of the work on the wagon and the intermodal transport system, a strength <b>test</b> of the <b>wagon</b> structure was carried out and the effort of the basic components of a the wagon and a complete structure was estimated. For this purpose, numerical analysis was used...|$|R
50|$|In 1840, {{the penal}} colony at Moreton Bay was being {{prepared}} to {{be turned into a}} free settlement (which ultimately became the city of Brisbane). As there was settlement already occurring on the Darling Downs, there was a need for Lieutenant Owen Gorman, the last commandant of the penal colony, to find a wagon route between the two locations, but the obstacle was the mountains of the Great Dividing Range. There was a route already known at Cunninghams Gap but it was not able to be used by a wagon. A convict John Sterry Baker had escaped from the penal colony in 1826 and had lived among the Goomburra Aboriginal people in the Lockyer Valley area and walked with them on a track {{to the top of the}} range. Having returned to the penal colony in 1840, Baker told Gorman of the track up the range and modified an Irish jaunting car to <b>test</b> as a <b>wagon</b> on the route. Together Gorman and Baker ascended the range with their wagon on 17 October 1840 arriving at Eton Vale. Despite the fact that Gorman did not discover the route, it nonetheless became known as Gorman's Gap Road. The route which runs between Upper Flagstone in the west and Flagstone Creek in the east was marked by blazing a line of trees. It became the first gazetted road in Queensland. Today, the road no longer officially exists and is overgrown but can still be followed. There are three monuments along the route, one at each end and the other along the route at Camel's Hump where Gorman took his compass bearing.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Study the {{possibility}} of using geometrically-force method to determine sections of high risk of derailment in railway stations at empty wagons movement. In the test program track diagnosing subject to longitudinal forces in the freight train effecting empty wagons is provided. Methodology. To this effect empty mineral wagon and thermal cistern were equipped with strain-gauge wheel sets, strain-gauge automatic coupler and other instruments, set in the freight train weighing 4500 t. Findings. In the course of this work it was ascertained that the geometric-force ethod gives possibility to receive additional information about the track condition from the position of empty cars stability against derailment. It is shown that some sections of high risk of derailment pieces of line does not discarded by traditional ways, based on an assessment of the geometric parameters of the way. Those track sections are identified by this method, which can not be evaluated by technical means, used currently on track measurement cars. Pieces of line with low parameters on empty cars stability against derailment are individual and they are determined not only by the sizes of deviations, but their form, a combination of different types of roughness, profile and defective elements of the permanent way. Originality. Geometric-force method should be considered as complementary to the existing technology assessment of the way on the geometrical parameters; its implementation will allow revealing the track section, dangerous for the motion of empty wagons. Practical value. For the geometrically-force method realization of assessment of the way in the railway network of JSC ¬´Russian Railways¬ª it is proposed {{on the basis of the}} accumulated statistics and experimental data in accordance with <b>wagons</b> <b>tests</b> with a high center of gravity to develop specialized software for wagons through gauges to assess ways bygeometrically-force method that excludes the use in technology assessment of the additional freight wagon way with a strain-gauge wheel sets. ...|$|R
