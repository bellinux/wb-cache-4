500|$|When Geisel {{returned}} to Springfield in 1986 {{as part of}} a publicity tour he was greeted by dozens of children on Mulberry Street. Another group of children held up a banner that read, [...] "And to think that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> on Mulberry Street". John Fogerty, frontman for the Creedence Clearwater Revival, has stated that the band's song [...] "Lookin' Out My Back Door" [...] was partly inspired by the book.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} over Andrew Lincoln's performance. Despite citing {{that his}} accent was [...] "dodgy", Pierce lauded Lincoln's acting. [...] "his body language and expression here is totally different {{now than when}} <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> before," [...] he opined. [...] "He's a fast learner." [...] Gilbert referred to his accent as [...] "spotty", while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well; [...] "For much of the pilot, he's {{on his own and}} exudes a lot of believable, shocked emotion, as Rick tries to process what he is seeing. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid. His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{unobtrusive}} man, <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as {{a spectator}} at [...] "Nottingham, 1936" [...] wandering about {{as if he}} was nobody.|$|R
60|$|Our {{democrat and}} ponies were outside the door, but Robert {{was nowhere to}} be seen; in fact, <b>we</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|But how {{changed from}} what he was when <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> reader! His aspect might have {{forcibly}} recalled the words, [...] "was lost and is found." ...|$|R
500|$|The final {{blame for}} the {{military}} stalemate was determined to lie not in military preparation, supplies, leadership, or superior tactics by the Seminoles, but in Florida's impenetrable terrain. An army surgeon wrote: [...] "It {{is in fact a}} most hideous region to live in, a perfect paradise for Indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, and every other kind of loathsome reptile." [...] The land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of wonder or hatred. In 1870, an author described the mangrove forests as a [...] "waste of nature's grandest exhibition to have these carnivals of splendid vegetation occurring in isolated places where it is but seldom they are seen." [...] A band of hunters, naturalists, and collectors ventured through in 1885, taking along with them the 17-year-old grandson of an early resident of Miami. The landscape unnerved the young man shortly after he entered the Shark River: [...] "The place looked wild and lonely. About three o'clock it seemed to get on Henry's nerves and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> crying, he would not tell us why, he was just plain scared." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatologist, {{confirmed}} that Jackson misused prescription drugs, and that Klein had diagnosed Jackson with vitiligo and lupus. Yet, Klein said, {{when he saw}} Jackson at his office three days before his death, the singer [...] "was in very good physical condition. He was dancing for my patients. He was very mentally aware when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{and he was in}} a very good mood." ...|$|E
2500|$|When 15 farmers {{staging a}} {{peaceful}} rally in Mendiola were gunned {{down by the}} military under Aquino on January 22, 1987 during the Mendiola Massacre, Jose Diokno, head of the Presidential Committee on Human Rights {{and chairman of the}} government panel in charge of negotiations with rebel forces resigned from his two government posts in deep disgust and great sadness. His daughter Maris said, [...] "It was the only time <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> near tears.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... (ERNEST appears, mopping his hair, {{which has}} become very wet since <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> He is not bearing malice, he is too busy drying, but AGATHA is {{specially}} his champion.) ...|$|R
60|$|In one and {{one-half}} hours I pulled him {{close to the}} boat, and <b>we</b> all <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> But I {{did not get a}} good look at him as he wove to and fro behind the boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} Cripps's father first. I {{think it might}} be well if <b>we</b> both <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> before {{deciding}} on the form of discipline. We have to think not only of justice but of the effect on their characters." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1832, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon {{wrote an}} account {{in which they}} both claimed to have seen the resurrected Jesus Christ. They wrote, [...] "And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the {{testimony}} last of all, which we give of him, that he lives; for <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> even on the right hand of God, and we heard the voice bearing record {{that he is the}} Only Begotten of the Father." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 4, 2004, Kean again {{stated that}} the September 11 attacks could have been prevented, saying that the United States {{government}} should have acted sooner to dismantle al-Qaeda and responded more quickly to other terrorist threats. [...] "When we actually saw bin Laden on the ground, using the Predator or other means, did we have...actionable intelligence? Should we have sent a cruise missile into a site where he was at that point? I think those early opportunities are clear. We had him. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> I think maybe {{we could have done}} something about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 3, 1989, Herschfield sent {{a partial}} script to Jason Alexander, {{who was in}} New York City at the time. Herschfield had met Alexander {{when he was working}} on the CBS sitcom E/R. Alexander enjoyed the script and felt it read like a Woody Allen film; therefore, he did a Woody Allen {{impression}} on his audition tape, and bought a pair of glasses to better resemble the character. Though Alexander thought his audition was [...] "a complete waste of time", both David and Seinfeld were impressed; Seinfeld stated [...] "the second <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> like two lines out of his mouth, we went 'That's the guy'". On April 10, 1989 at 9:00 A.M. Alexander did his first official audition and met David and Seinfeld. While in the waiting room for his final audition, Alexander saw that Larry Miller was also auditioning. Alexander was aware that Miller and Seinfeld were very good friends, and so figured that he would not get the part. After his final audition he returned to New York City, and when he landed he received a phone call informing him that he was hired.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tough!" [...] {{interpolated}} Mr. Brown judicially. [...] "I was broke once {{way out in}} a tank-town in Oklahoma. The manager skipped {{with our}} salaries. Last <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> of <b>him</b> {{he was doing the}} trip to Canada in nothing flat." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Institute {{obtained}} an {{exit visa}} {{for him at}} his request, and on September 21 arranged for a car that {{took him to the}} airport. But the school's director said: [...] "After that, <b>we</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again, and apparently he did not leave Yemen".|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a big}} {{shame that}} we couldn't have taken Elias Macomber when he was there ready to drop, like a ripe peach. We might have walked right up to that house when <b>we</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> an' the thing could have been done." ...|$|R
2500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Lennie James as Morgan Jones in a brief uncredited post-end credits cameo. It marked his third appearance in the show, after the pilot, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and the season three episode [...] "Clear". Gimple explained {{in an interview with}} The Hollywood Reporter that Morgan's appearance was the [...] "beginning of something" [...] for the character, but would not state further; he instead said, [...] "Looking at him, how he's dressed, how he's acting — it's not a 42-minute episode there — but you get some hints about where he's at. I would look at that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than the last time <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> He looks pretty well put together. You know, he’s not talking to himself. I would say that, just laying eyes on him, it looks like a different Morgan." [...] Kirkman stated that Morgan was possibly following Rick's trail, as Rick left him a map in [...] "Clear". He also said that the post-credits scene was used not only to surprise the audience, but to also [...] " [...] story of this episode...into its own contiguous piece." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} we were indeed fated to cross the path of Vaughn Steele. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> working round his adobe house; then <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> on horseback. Once we met him face to face in a store.|$|E
60|$|But {{the long}} years of penance {{had not been in}} vain. Nick had forgiven her. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{kneeling}} at the bedside, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> with her hand in his, and Helene was drawing me gently {{out of the room and}} closing the door behind her. She did not look at me, nor I at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> twice, {{going and}} returning, {{and he was}} successful. The last time, he was {{detained}} by a snow-storm, and staid with us some days--so long, indeed, that he remained, and accompanied us out, when we went below. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> much of <b>him,</b> too, last winter, in town." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> (Captain Burbage) rave. Always at his post, {{and always}} quiet, {{everything}} went on like clockwork. No traveler {{accustomed to the}} privileged usage on many similar craft would have imagined {{that one of them}} could be so well managed with so little damage to the Third Commandment. (Bruce 1859:726f) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--but {{the man was}} so queer. He did nothing, you know. <b>We</b> hardly <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> if you remember, at Turin. All he did was to tie the shawls at Bologna. What can any man {{want with}} another man about with him like that, unless he is cracked either in body or mind?" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} or three dances at our hotel last week and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> then.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I never knew. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> hoist sail {{under the}} moon-track and stand away. I have prayed {{that he found}} his wife and the children.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This Kepher goes at a {{wonderful}} pace {{for an old}} man," [...] said Tua presently. [...] "When first <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> he could scarcely hobble." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} day when Hiram Griffin {{suddenly}} appeared, coming to my home {{at the moment when}} my mother and I were breaking our fast, and one might have fancied from his manner and the business-like way in which he spoke, that no more than a dozen hours had passed since <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Caresfoot, thank you," [...] replied Mr. Bellamy, who, {{with the}} {{exception}} that he had grown a size larger, and boasted a bald patch {{on the top of}} his head that gave him something of a appearance of a jolly little monk, looked very much the same as when <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as a newly married man.|$|R
60|$|The last <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> of <b>him</b> {{was from}} the street. He was waving his tongue at us in his attractive, foolish way, and Josy was poised on Joeykin's hand like a {{butterfly}} that had alighted on a flower. We could not exactly see old Joey, but <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> his feet, and so feared the worst. Of course they are not everything they should be, but one can't help liking them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{he asked}} your name, my dear, and mine; {{and on other}} Sunday mornings, when we walked his way, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> again, and--and really that's all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> on the {{mountain}} side and found a big pit and made a trap of it with some wildcat meat, and we caught him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll go if {{you want}} me to, Roger," [...] {{answered}} our hero. [...] "But he was a good distance away when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> through the glasses." ...|$|E
50|$|Marvin is left alone. He {{sits and}} {{reflects}} on {{his relationship with}} Whizzer ("What Would I Do?"). Whizzer appears, dressed as <b>we</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> and the two sing together one last time, and then Whizzer is gone. Marvin is comforted by his family, now short a member, as Mendel bids us goodnight from the crazy, sad world known as Falsettoland.|$|R
60|$|Strange to say, our English sportsman {{is living}} with Ignacio just now, with several {{sporting}} friends. He has {{been back to}} England and out again since <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> and goes aw-ing all over the settlement with as much nonchalance and latent vigour as ever--when not better engaged with Ignacio and Spotted Tiger, and Leetle Cub, in the mountains.|$|R
60|$|Captain Bream {{reclined}} one {{day on a}} sofa in the sitting-room of {{the house}} where he had first made the acquaintance of the Miss Seawards. Both ladies were seated by his side, the one working worsted cuffs and the other comforters, and both found the utmost difficulty in repressing tears when they looked at their kind nautical friend, for a great change had come over <b>him</b> since <b>we</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
