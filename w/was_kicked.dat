2500|$|Attacking <b>kicks</b> <b>are</b> also employed, usually if the {{opposition}} is out of position or running at them is proving ineffective. Common attacking kicks include the [...] "up and under", box kick, [...] "grubber", crossfield kick and chip kick. The up and under, {{also known as a}} [...] "bomb" [...] or Garryowen, is a high punt. A well executed up and under will be high enough to give anyone chasing enough time to compete for the ball. Box <b>kicks</b> <b>are</b> similar, but <b>are</b> <b>kicked</b> by the scrum-half over their shoulder when a ruck, maul, scrum or line-out occurs near the touchline. The ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> high and parallel to the touchline with the wingers chasing. If the ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> along the ground it is called a grubber. It can catch the defenders unaware and because the ball is oval shaped it does not bounce consistently, making it hard for them to collect it. A cross field kick occurs when the ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> from one touchline to a player waiting near the other one. Chip <b>kicks</b> <b>are</b> short <b>kicks</b> just behind the defensive line for attacking players to run onto. Like defensive <b>kicks</b> there <b>is</b> still a risk that {{the opposition}} will regain possession after an attacking kick.|$|R

5|$|The {{birth of}} {{football}} at the Naval Academy is debated among historians. The most accepted occurrence was in 1869, when a midshipman (a student) {{returned from his}} leave with a football. While throwing the ball with a friend, it was dropped {{and a group of}} fellow midshipmen attempted to take it. A contest was eventually organized, which ended abruptly when the ball <b>was</b> <b>kicked</b> into the Severn River. However, biographer C. Douglas Kroll stated that the first evidence of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward, a theory supported by journalist Jack Clary. Regardless, the sport had been banned for several years prior to 1879.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed at the Clemson 26-yard line, {{where the}} Tigers began their second {{offensive}} possession.

A rush for no gain and a short pass forced Clemson to again punt before gaining a first down. Somaini's second punt <b>was</b> <b>kicked</b> cleanly, and the Hokies returned the punt to their 42-yard line.
