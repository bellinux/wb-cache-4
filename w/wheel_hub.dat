5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
25|$|Hub dynamos {{are built}} into the front or rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> These are {{generally}} the most reliable and most efficient of the three types.|$|E
25|$|In the 1989 Race Across America, {{one team}} (Team Strawberry) used an {{experimental}} device comprising a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> a sensor, and a handlebar mounted processor, to measure each cyclist's power output.|$|E
50|$|Rotary engine <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> {{have been}} used in motorbikes for over one hundred years.|$|R
50|$|An inboard {{braking system}} is an {{automobile}} technology wherein the disc brakes are {{mounted on the}} chassis of the vehicle, rather than directly on the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs.</b> The main advantages are twofold: {{a reduction in the}} unsprung weight of the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> as this no longer includes the brake discs and calipers; also,braking torque applies directly to the chassis, rather than being taken through the suspension arms.|$|R
50|$|Roller brakes are {{specially}} designed drum brakes for bicycles, mounted {{to the side}} of the <b>wheel's</b> <b>hub.</b>|$|R
25|$|To {{be able to}} work in {{a vacuum}} a special {{fluoride}} based lubricant was used for the rover's mechanical parts, and the electric motors, one in each <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> were enclosed in pressurised containers.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of parts}} made by this process are: <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> unit bearings, {{transmission}} gears, {{tapered roller bearing}} races, stainless steel coupling flanges, and neck rings for LP gas cylinders. Manual transmission gears are an example of automatic hot forging {{used in conjunction with}} cold working.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with a ratchet and a hexagonal socket on the end which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} design of {{uprights}} and <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> of front <b>wheels</b> of Formula Student race car. Specifically race cars named Dragon 3 and Dragon 4 of TU Brno Racing team. In this thesis {{there will be}} load calculations of front wheels, choosing of bearings and uprights and <b>wheel</b> <b>hub’s</b> design. Then control of design by FEA analysis. And finally comparing of both designs and comparing with previous designs...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "RR" [...] logos {{on each of}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> are {{independent}} bezels in order to always remain upright while the wheel is rotating.|$|R
25|$|Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, {{in which}} {{friction}} pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is {{contained within the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes. Disc brakes are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.|$|E
25|$|Either type could {{potentially}} fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface {{on either side}} of the brake disc between the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> and brake disc hub before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and brake disc. However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the first}} {{prototype}} was completed in 1968. A first flight on 27 June 1967 ended prematurely due to oscillations caused by control problems; one set of main wheels contacted the ground hard bursting a tyre and bending a <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> The cause of the oscillations {{proved to be a}} harmonic amplification of vibrations in the cockpit floor feeding back into the control column when a roll demand was input into the cyclic stick. It was widely but erroneously reported in the Western press that the aircraft had been destroyed.|$|E
50|$|Since {{only the}} brakes on the driving wheels can easily be inboard, the Citroën 2CV had {{inertial}} dampers on its rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> to damp only wheel bounce.|$|R
50|$|Mk I {{carriage}} : recoil {{was controlled}} by drag-shoes. These were placed under the wheels, and were connected by chains and cables to the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> and the trail.|$|R
50|$|The ten-wheeler {{uses the}} {{hydropneumatic}} suspension design, {{based on the}} Citroën DS platform. The steering controls all the four front wheels. Tires to <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> are parts of the Citroën H Van.|$|R
25|$|From {{as early}} as 1888 {{electric-powered}} bicycle lamps were manufactured but did not become a viable proposition until 1898. They comprised an incandescent bulb and either a lead-acid battery or a dynamo. Lead-acid batteries were replaced by dry cells and later by alkaline batteries. Dynamos improved in efficiency and reliability, recently being incorporated into the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> for example. Moulding techniques for plastics also improved, allowing lens optics to be improved and cost reduced. Incandescent bulbs were replaced first by sealed-unit halogen lamps and later by high-output light emitting diodes.|$|E
25|$|Bicycle {{historian}} David V. Herlihy {{documents that}} Lallement {{claimed to have}} created the pedal bicycle in Paris in 1863. He had seen someone riding a draisine in 1862 then originally {{came up with the}} idea to add pedals to it. It is a fact that he filed the earliest and only patent for a pedal-driven bicycle, in the US in 1866. Lallement's patent drawing shows a machine which looks exactly like Johnson's draisine, but with the pedals and rotary cranks attached to the front <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> and a thin piece of iron over the top of the frame to act as a spring supporting the seat, for a slightly more comfortable ride.|$|E
25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b> Hub gears work using internal planetary, or epicyclic, gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive sprocket. They have just a single chainring and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a straight chain path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E
50|$|By 1914 Perry & Co {{specialized}} in steel pens and pen holders, cycle chains, free <b>wheels,</b> <b>hubs,</b> bells and cycle accessories, stationers' sundries, gold pens, solitaires, studs, sleeve links, tobacconists' and drapers' sundries and had 2,000 employees.|$|R
50|$|These replicas {{followed}} the original chassis designs accurately. The frames were T.I.G welded, and employed either AJS Stormer <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs,</b> British Hubs or Grimeca hubs. Betor or Marzocchi front forks were fitted, usually with Sebac rear shocks.|$|R
50|$|Columbia mopeds {{were the}} first mopeds ever {{assembled}} in the United States, even though the motor and some parts were outsourced. The tubular frames, seats, fenders, <b>wheels,</b> <b>hubs,</b> brakes, front fork assembly, headlight, and wiring harnesses {{were made in the}} United States.|$|R
500|$|Though {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, a bike {{may become}} longitudinally unstable under sufficient acceleration or deceleration, and Euler's second law {{can be used}} to analyze the ground reaction forces generated. For example, the normal (vertical) ground reaction forces at the wheels for a bike with a wheelbase [...] and a center of mass at height [...] and at a distance [...] in front of the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> and for simplicity, with both wheels locked, can be expressed as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Spartanburg {{was formed}} in 1785 and was named after a local militia called the Spartan Regiment in the American Revolutionary War. The Spartan Regiment, {{commanded}} by Andrew Pickens, participated in the nearby Battle of Cowpens. In 1831, Spartanburg was incorporated, later becoming known as the [...] "Hub City": railroad lines radiated from the city forming {{the shape of a}} <b>wheel</b> <b>hub.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 1968 models {{featured}} additional safety features, including {{side marker}} lights and shoulder belts on cars built after December 1, 1967. The 1967 model's large steering <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> {{was replaced by a}} soft [...] "bar" [...] spoke that ran though the diameter of the wheel (and like the 1967 style, was used throughout the Ford Motor Company line). A plastic horn ring was also featured.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of a}} Dynapack Dyno {{requires}} the wheels to be removed prior to tuning. Adapters are then bolted onto the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> using lug nuts to properly center them. The dyno is then connected to the adapters and locked into place.|$|R
50|$|The Daimler had full {{independent}} suspension and four wheel drive. Epicyclic gearing in the <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> enabled {{a very low}} ratio in bottom gear - it was credited with managing 1:2 inclines. The rugged nature combined with reliability made it ideal for reconnaissance and escort work.|$|R
50|$|The 1978 XL175 was {{the last}} model produced. The colors it came in were Excel Black with Tahitian Red. The side cover decal was red and white like the 1977 model. Both {{mudguards}} were plastic painted in red. The stripes were red. The <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> were now black.|$|R
2500|$|A {{disc brake}} {{consists}} of a metal disc, or [...] "rotor", [...] attached to the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> that rotates with the wheel. Calipers {{are attached to the}} frame or fork along with pads that squeeze the rotors for braking. As the pads drag against the rotor, the wheel - and thus the bicycle - is slowed as kinetic energy (motion) is transformed into thermal energy (heat). Disc brakes may be actuated mechanically by cable, or hydraulically.|$|E
2500|$|In 1898, {{after the}} advent of {{freewheel}} coasting mechanisms, the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel. [...] The coaster brake was contained in the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>hub,</b> and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling, thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear. [...] In the United States, the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout {{the first half of}} the 20th century, often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, Ebony leather {{with red}} {{stitching}} accents dominate, while the seats, {{steering wheel and}} armrests feature microfiber suede accents. The headrests have an embossed Centennial Edition logo and the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> carries the same [...] "Louis Chevrolet 100" [...] graphic found on the car's B-pillar and wheel center caps. Arguably the most subtle variation to be found {{is seen in the}} signature crossed-flags exterior badge, which sees the traditional fleur-de-lis element replaced with [...] "100" [...] in all Centennial Edition cars.|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} X-ray diffractometer with classic {{scheme of}} measurements (Sin 2 Ψ) {{was applied for}} the residual stress control. The example of residual stress determination in the landing <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> with different service life (take-off-landing numbers) are presented. The assessment of the durability {{is based on the}} results of residual stress determination...|$|R
50|$|In late 1858 the two {{brothers}} moved to Pennsylvania {{at the invitation of}} Lester Frank's oldest brother Cyrenus (9 years Lester Frank's senior) who was starting a business making wagon <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> and needed workers. The brothers saw {{this as an opportunity to}} move closer to civilization and to eventually attend college.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Columbia sold {{the rights and}} design of their mopeds to a company, KKM Enterprises, Inc. that {{produced}} identical mopeds under the name Mopet into the mid-1990s. This company produced the tubular frames, long seats, fenders, <b>wheels,</b> <b>hubs,</b> brakes, front fork assembly, headlight, and wiring harnesses in the United States.|$|R
