5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive of a settlement, but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to accept President Carter's nomination for Secretary of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E
25|$|On April 5 US President Barack Obama said he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> any {{bill that}} {{prevented}} the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases.|$|E
25|$|Several US states sought ways {{to block}} the move, citing {{security}} concerns {{as well as the}} possibility of losing related leases of foreign ports. President Bush stated he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> any legislation created with the intent to interfere with the change.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} side <b>would</b> have <b>veto</b> {{on production}} decisions, the distribution side <b>would</b> have a <b>veto</b> on distribution decisions, and all {{would have a}} say in what projects they would do. Initially Alan Finney represented Roadshow on the Hexagon board.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{surprise}} victory of Kurt Waldheim, the British and Italian delegations criticized Finnish [...] "overconfidence" [...] {{that led to}} [...] "inaccurate Finnish statements concerning positions of alleged supporters." [...] In addition to getting the Chinese position wrong, Finland had also claimed that the Soviet Union <b>would</b> not <b>veto</b> Jakobson, and Sweden would withdraw Jarring. [...] Finland also claimed that the Soviet Union <b>would</b> not <b>veto</b> their candidate {{and said that the}} U.S. and U.K. had [...] "let them down" [...] by not vetoing Waldheim. The French were [...] "furious" [...] when the Finns accused them of vetoing Jakobson in the first round, as they had actually abstained.|$|R
50|$|Four African {{candidates}} were nominated to replace Boutros-Ghali: Amara Essy of Côte d'Ivoire, Kofi Annan of Ghana, Hamid Algabid of Niger, and Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah of Mauritania. The Security Council met on 6 December 1996 {{but did not}} vote, awaiting more candidates. However, no other {{candidates were}} nominated. Moustapha Niasse of Senegal was not nominated because he <b>would</b> be <b>vetoed</b> by China. Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania was not nominated because he <b>would</b> be <b>vetoed</b> by France, an ironic twist for a diplomat who had been vetoed by the United States in 1981. With the General Assembly expecting to end its session on 17 December 1996, the Security Council had only one week to select a Secretary-General.|$|R
25|$|On 9 May {{president}} Sezer {{implied that}} he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> {{amendments to the}} Turkish constitution, stating that the amendments had been passed at a very heated time. The European Union raised a similar objection. Foreign (non-Turkish) press also reported the expectation of a presidential veto on the AKP's recent amendments to the Turkish constitution.|$|E
25|$|In a September 2007 Republican primary presidential debate, Paul {{answered}} yes to {{the question}} of whether he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation by employers with at least 15 employees. This is consistent with his views of opposing any private sector anti-discrimination laws and his belief in freedom of association.|$|E
25|$|Lévesque and his people, all in Quebec, {{remained}} {{ignorant of}} the agreement until Lévesque walked into the premiers' breakfast and was told the agreement had been reached. Lévesque refused to give his support to the deal and left the meeting; the government of Quebec subsequently announced on November 25, 1981, that it <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> the decision. However, both the Quebec Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on the matter on December 6, 1982, stated that Quebec had never held such veto powers.|$|E
50|$|Johnson opposed Arizona SB 1070, {{and says}} he <b>would</b> have <b>vetoed</b> it were he the governor, though he understands and {{supports}} the spirit behind it. He says that the bill was devastating to drawing business to Arizona and believes the bill will create racial discrimination.|$|R
50|$|Resolution 1249 {{was adopted}} by 14 votes to none against and one {{abstention}} from China which said it could not support the recommendation (due to Nauru's close diplomatic ties to Taiwan) but <b>would</b> not <b>veto</b> it {{in the interests of}} the people of both countries.|$|R
50|$|President Johnson, however, {{signed the}} bill into law on August 24, 1968, {{just hours before}} a pocket <b>veto</b> <b>would</b> have taken effect.|$|R
25|$|NATO {{claimed that}} the Albanian {{population}} in Kosovo were being persecuted by FRY forces, Serbian police, and Serb paramilitary forces, and that military action was needed to force the FRY to stop. NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the United Nations Security Council for military action, but were opposed by China and Russia that indicated they <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> such a proposal. NATO launched a campaign without UN authorisation, which it described as a humanitarian intervention. The FRY described the NATO campaign as an illegal war of aggression against a sovereign country that was in violation of international law {{because it did not}} have UN Security Council support.|$|E
25|$|During the season, Häkkinen became {{embroiled in}} a {{contract}} dispute. Häkkinen, who was under contract to Lotus, opted to join Williams. However, Williams had not submitted their entry for the 1993 season, and Häkkinen was unable to join the team when he learnt that Lotus team principal Peter Collins <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> the Williams team entry if they had signed Häkkinen. Häkkinen later approached Ligier although his contract contained a clause of which his manager Keke Rosberg disagreed. He later approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis for {{a contract with the}} team, which was drafted at Courchevel Airport. The dispute eventually went to the Formula One Contract Recognition Board, who ruled in favour of McLaren after two days of deliberation.|$|E
25|$|Barbour {{has also}} {{received}} criticism from some Mississippi Democrats for {{his refusal to}} approve a bill to increase the cigarette tax and decrease the grocery tax passed by the Mississippi House of Representatives during his first term as governor. Mississippi currently has the third-lowest cigarette tax and the highest grocery tax—while being the poorest state in the country. He stated {{that the lack of}} revenue generated after the tax swap would quite possibly result in bankrupting the state government, which was already fragile due to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The House of Representatives could produce no figures to dispute this assertion. Also, in his successful 2004 campaign, Barbour ran on the platform that he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> any tax increase.|$|E
50|$|She is African American and is {{a member}} of the NAACP. In a 2010 vote on same sex marriage, Turner was one of six Democrats to vote against the bill to legalize it. However, in a 2012 vote on a similar bill, she {{supported}} the measure (which <b>would</b> be <b>vetoed</b> by Governor Chris Christie).|$|R
500|$|Of {{the four}} leading Democratic candidates, Boyle, Harris, and Nelson {{declared}} that they <b>would</b> have <b>vetoed</b> the bill, {{arguing that it}} would not in fact lead to long-term property-tax relief. [...] Hoppner expressed enthusiastic support for the measure, [...] "because it's {{at the heart of the}} traditional Democratic message of this state, because the people of this state care about our children".|$|R
50|$|On January 12, Ralston Purina Company {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} club to Edmonton Oilers founder Bill Hunter, who had plans to move the team to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The NHL <b>would</b> eventually <b>veto</b> the deal, resulting in the team not participating in the Entry Draft. It would {{pave the way for}} Harry Ornest to purchase the franchise prior to the following season.|$|R
25|$|Romney {{also said}} during the primary {{campaign}} that he would seek to make the U.S. a much less hospitable place for undocumented immigrants by eliminating {{what he called the}} magnets that attract them. An example of a magnet, he said, would be offering to undocumented immigrants the same tuition discounts that are offered to legal residents who attend public colleges in their states, a benefit that rival candidate Governor Rick Perry supported for Texas students who had been brought as children to the U.S. by their undocumented immigrant parents. Romney similarly said that he opposed all forms of amnesty because he regards amnesty as another magnet for illegal immigration. He vowed that as president he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> the DREAM Act (legislation which would allow individuals who had been brought to the U.S. as children when their families immigrated illegally an opportunity to qualify for permanent residency if they met certain qualifications), because he considered it yet another magnet for illegal immigration.|$|E
500|$|Orr accused Nelson of [...] "lacking leadership" [...] on abortion, {{declaring that}} she <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> any bill that relaxed {{restrictions}} on the procedure. [...] The Nebraska Coalition for Life endorsed Orr, with the comment that [...] " [...] position is no position at all".|$|E
500|$|When New York City faced {{bankruptcy}} in 1975, Mayor Abraham Beame was unsuccessful in obtaining Ford's {{support for a}} federal bailout. The incident prompted the New York Daily News famous headline [...] "Ford to City: Drop Dead", referring to a speech in which [...] "Ford declared flatly ... that he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> any bill calling for 'a federal bail-out of New York City.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the four}} leading Democratic candidates, Boyle, Harris, and Nelson {{declared}} that they <b>would</b> have <b>vetoed</b> the bill, {{arguing that it}} would not in fact lead to long-term property-tax relief.

25|$|Between 2006 and 2008, {{a series}} of protests led by groups opposed to the pro-Western Prime Minister Fouad Siniora demanded the {{creation}} of a national unity government, over which the mostly Shia opposition groups <b>would</b> have <b>veto</b> power. When Émile Lahoud's presidential term ended in October 2007, the opposition refused to vote for a successor unless a power-sharing deal was reached, leaving Lebanon without a president.|$|R
500|$|The Parliament {{also has}} a great deal of {{indirect}} influence, through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings, as a [...] "pan-European soapbox" [...] with the ear of thousands of Brussels-based journalists. There is also an indirect effect on foreign policy; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for post-war Iraq reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of Iranian nuclear development, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States. Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new EU treaties but cannot veto it. However, when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the Belgian and Italian Parliaments said they <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> the treaty on the European Parliament's behalf.|$|E
500|$|Tension {{developed}} between Roosevelt and Barkley during the war, however. In 1943, Roosevelt refused to appoint Barkley to a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and Barkley criticized the War Production Board for awarding contracts {{for the production}} of war-related materials to large companies rather than small businesses. Their most notable clash occurred in February 1944 when Roosevelt requested that Congress approve tax increases to generate over $10billion in revenue for the war. Barkley and the Senate Finance Committee negotiated a bill containing only $2.3billion in tax increases. Feeling the measure was insufficient, Roosevelt convened the [...] "Big Four" [...] on February 21 and told them he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> it. They urged him not to do so, assuring him that the bill they had drafted was the best one that they could pass. Roosevelt vetoed the bill the next day, marking the first time a U.S. president vetoed a revenue bill.|$|E
500|$|During a July {{press conference}} in Spokane, Washington, while {{lobbying}} for ballot access, Paul promised that as president he <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> spending increases for both domestic programs and the military. He asked {{in reference to the}} portrayal of his party's plank, [...] "what's extreme about a balanced budget?" [...] Paul conceded that he would not win the election but explained that votes for his ticket would give a bigger voice to Libertarian issues in American politics, and that he would only be disappointed if he did not receive at least 5% of the vote in the state. A few weeks later, The New York Times discovered that many former members of the Pat Robertson campaign were helping Ron Paul's candidacy. They found that the campaign workers were disseminating literature in Michigan that criticized Bush, and stated that Paul would [...] "carry the standard" [...] of the free market. Paul commented in a San Diego Union interview that he [...] "identifwith Robertson" [...] although [...] "he's not a libertarian." [...] Paul spent the beginning of August, campaigning {{in his home state of}} Texas.|$|E
50|$|The Secretary-General of the United Nations is {{appointed}} by the General Assembly {{on the recommendation of}} the Security Council. Candidates for the office can be vetoed by any of the five permanent members. Members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact were not eligible for the job, as they <b>would</b> be <b>vetoed</b> by the opposing superpower. Only diplomats from neutral countries could expect to escape a veto.|$|R
50|$|Galloway {{suggested}} {{the creation of}} an American colonial parliament to act together with the Parliament of Great Britain. On matters relating to the colonies each body <b>would</b> have a <b>veto</b> over the other's decisions.|$|R
5000|$|On July 30, 2014, President Barack Obama {{released}} a statement of administration policy stating that [...] "his senior adivsors <b>would</b> recommend he <b>veto</b> the bill" [...] if it were presented to him for his signature.|$|R
500|$|The forced {{merger of}} Gulf and Chevron was controversial, with the U.S. Senate {{considering}} legislation to freeze oil industry mergers for a year—before the Reagan administration made it known it opposed government {{intervention in the}} matter and <b>would</b> <b>veto</b> any bill. [...] However, Pickens and Lee (Gulf's CEO) were summoned {{to testify before the}} Senate months before the merger was hammered out and the matter was referred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC only approved the deal subject to strict conditions. Never before had a [...] "small operator" [...] successfully taken apart a Fortune 500 corporation, or in Gulf's case a [...] "Fortune 10" [...] corporation. The merger sent even deeper shock waves through the long-time exclusive [...] "Seven Sisters" [...] club of major integrated oil companies that defined themselves as elevated from the [...] "non-major independents". A board member of Exxon even admitted in the mid-1980s that [...] "mostly all we talk about in board meetings anymore is T. Boone Pickens". [...] Chevron, to settle with the government antitrust requirements, sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States to British Petroleum (BP) and Cumberland Farms in 1985 {{as well as some of}} the international operations.|$|E

5000|$|On April 28, 2010, Governor Ed Rendell {{proposed}} that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission be merged into the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. A special session of the state legislature will vote on this issue on May 4.

500|$|Harris and Hoppner both {{declared}} themselves {{supporters of}} abortion rights, and were {{endorsed by the}} pro-choice organization Nebraska Voters for Choice.
