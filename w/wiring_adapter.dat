50|$|The PS/2 {{keyboard}} interface was electrically {{the same}} as for the 5-pin DIN connector on former AT keyboards, and keyboards designed for one can be connected to the other with a simple <b>wiring</b> <b>adapter.</b> In contrast to this, the PS/2 mouse interface is substantially different from RS-232 (which was generally used for mice on PCs without PS/2 ports), but nonetheless many mice were made that could operate on both with a simple passive <b>wiring</b> <b>adapter,</b> where the mice would detect the presence of the adapter due to its wiring and then switch protocols accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|The XM Direct receiver, also {{marketed as}} the XM Commander, can now serve {{the same purpose}} as the PCR. While the XM Direct is {{intended}} for automotive use, the unit itself is controlled by RS-232 command signals, and so is easily adapted to PC control. When combined with a [...] "smart cable", which is really just a USB to Serial cable and a <b>wiring</b> <b>adapter</b> to connect to the XM Direct's control port, the XM Direct supports some features not found on the original PCR.|$|E
50|$|Many {{keyboards}} {{and mice}} were {{specifically designed to}} support both the USB and the PS/2 interfaces and protocols, selecting the appropriate connection type at power-on. Such devices are generally equipped with a USB connector and ship with a passive <b>wiring</b> <b>adapter</b> to allow connection to a PS/2 port. Such passive adapters are not standardized and may therefore be specific to the device they came with. They cannot be used to adapt other devices to PS/2 ports. While combi-devices supporting USB and PS/2 are still available, most USB keyboards and mice in the 2010s no longer come with or even support the PS/2 protocol. Connecting them to a PS/2 port would require an adapter, actively translating between the protocols. Such adapters only support certain classes of USB devices such as keyboards and mice, but are not model- or vendor-specific.|$|E
5000|$|Differential {{drivers are}} also more {{forgiving}} of incorrectly <b>wired</b> <b>adapters</b> or equipment that unbalances the signal by shorting pin 2.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} allow common wired USB devices to be connected, the {{specification}} defines device <b>wire</b> <b>adapters.</b> Likewise, hosts connect to W-USB systems through use of a host <b>wire</b> <b>adapter.</b> Even though the physical layer is based on Ultra-WideBand, W-USB devices have a fully compliant USB interface. The physical layer may support {{a wide range of}} transfer rates, of which three are defined as mandatorily supported: 53.3, 106.7 and 200 Mbit/s, all other possible UWB rates being optional for devices (hosts must support them all).|$|R
5000|$|However, to {{facilitate}} migration from wired to wireless, WUSB {{introduced a new}} Device <b>Wire</b> <b>Adapter</b> (DWA) class. Sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "WUSB hub", a DWA allows existing USB 2.0 devices to be used wirelessly with a WUSB host.|$|R
50|$|WUSB host {{capability}} can {{be added}} to existing PCs {{through the use of a}} Host <b>Wire</b> <b>Adapter</b> (HWA). The HWA is a USB 2.0 device that attaches externally to a desktop or laptop's USB port or internally to a laptop's MiniCard interface.|$|R
50|$|W-USB {{devices are}} {{categorized}} {{in the same}} way as traditional USB. Because of the existence of <b>wire</b> <b>adapters,</b> traditional USB hubs are not needed. A device supports one or more communication pipes to the host, and allocates endpoint 0 for the USB control pipe. Device type information is available through this pipe.|$|R

50|$|In October 2006 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{approved}} a Host <b>Wire</b> <b>Adapter</b> (HWA) and Device <b>Wire</b> <b>Adapter</b> (DWA) wireless USB products from WiQuest Communications for both outdoor and indoor use. The first retail product was shipped by IOGEAR using Alereon, Intel and NEC silicon in mid-2007. Around the same time, Belkin, Dell, Lenovo and D-Link began shipping products that incorporated WiQuest technology. These products included embedded {{cards in the}} notebook PCs or adapters for those PCs that do not currently include Wireless USB. In 2008, a new Wireless USB Docking Station from Kensington was made available through Dell. This product was unique {{as it was the}} first product on the market to support video and graphics over a USB connection, by using DisplayLink USB graphics technology. Kensington released a Wireless USB universal docking station in August, 2008 for wireless connectivity between a notebook PC and an external monitor, speakers, and existing wired USB peripherals. Imation announced Q408 availability of a new external Wireless HDD.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{designs of}} {{headphone}} adapters {{have been created}} by various individuals and/or manufacturers. The most common types are the [...] "Y" [...] design, adapters with up to six headphone sockets, and <b>wired</b> headphone <b>adapters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 12-volt {{version has}} screw {{terminals}} and a rectangular base. Since it is 12-volt, this type {{can be used}} to power car accessories outside of an automobile, using extra <b>wiring</b> or an <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
25|$|PDP {{had also}} offered a <b>wired</b> legacy <b>adapter</b> {{for use with}} wired {{instruments}} (such as first-generation Rock Band hardware and the Ion Drum Rocker) and the Rock Band 3 MIDI-Pro Adapter. However, following its initial shipment in November 2016, PDP affirmed that their terms of licensing with Harmonix only allowed them to produced {{a limited number of}} the units, less than the demand that was found for the device.|$|R
40|$|Currently, most {{cell phones}} utilize <b>wired</b> <b>adapters</b> to charge, which cause a minor hassle when one {{frequently}} needs to unplug and replug their device whenever they {{pick it up}} to use while it is charging. The charging adapter is a pad that phones can be placed on to wirelessly charge the device. The charging adapter consists of two components: the wireless charging platform to supply and transmit the power, and the wireless charging receiver for phones that do not already have an internal receiver included, specifically targeting newer generation iPhones that utilize a lightning port (i. e. iPhone 5, 6, 6 s, 7, 7 s). The wireless charging receiver connects to the smartphone through the charging port and rests between {{the back of the}} phone and its casing. The entire system fully charges the device to 100 % battery capacity within three hours and automatically shuts off upon completion. A unique feature of the charger is that it operates regardless of the orientation of the phone on the pad (an LED indicator notifies the user that the device is charging). The size of the entire charging assembly does not exceed that of a small textbook, allowing ease of transportation and use on a table or surface with limited space. Additionally, the incorporation of an ellipsed surface {{at the top of the}} 3 D-printed base centers the phone while charging and biases it towards the middle where optimum power transfer is achieved. Reverse engineering was done on market examples and designs were made to create a charging platform to supply power. Then a development kit was used to test methods of improving the performance...|$|R

50|$|A {{separate}} DHCP server may be configured {{to assist}} interfaces equipped with network boot capability {{to be able}} to boot over iSCSI. In this case, the network interface looks for a DHCP server offering a PXE or bootp boot image. This is used to kick off the iSCSI remote boot process, using the booting network interface's MAC address to direct the computer to the correct iSCSI boot target. One can then use a software-only approach to load a small boot program which can in turn mount a remote iSCSI target {{as if it was a}} local SCSI drive and then fire the boot process from said iSCSI target. This can be achieved using an existing Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot ROM, which is available on many <b>wired</b> Ethernet <b>adapters.</b> The boot code can also be loaded from CD/DVD, floppy disk (or floppy disk image) and USB storage, or it can replace existing PXE boot code on adapters that can be re-flashed. The most popular free software to offer iSCSI boot support is iPXE.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis described {{the design and}} implementation of a fiber optic link for a token ring local area network (LAN). It features the use of fiber optic channels as the transmission medium between a computer system and a wiring concentrator to convert a physical ring design into a star-wired configuration. The LAN was controlled by the TMS 380 LAN Adapter chipset, which provided all diagnostic and network management features to include the 4 Mb/s electrical signal for operation. Since this adapter was developed for systems using twisted <b>wire</b> pair <b>adapter</b> cables, design modifications required that the fiber link be able to simulate impedance and current characteristics of the copper wire link. This allows the use of adapter diagnostic checks for ring continuity and proper ring operation. Design evaluations using test signals and adapter signals from within the computer-concentrator link shower mixed results. All transmission objectives were met, but the circuit loaded down the LAN adapter causing hardware error messages. [URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there exists}} an {{abundance}} of handheld electronic devices, especially smart phones that require frequent charging. Traditionally, these devices were charged by using <b>wired</b> power <b>adapters</b> (chargers). However, the use of wires poses limits in terms of user convenience and distance from electrical outlets. While wireless chargers exist, commercial widespread use of the technology for consumer electronics is relatively recent. Also, {{the application of the}} underlying science and engineering principles of power transfer wirelessly are not commonly explored in Electrical Engineering Technology (EET) programs. In this paper, the authors report their findings and present the results of application- based research on the prototyping and testing of a wireless charger. This research was conducted as an independent study course by one student, who was supervised by an Electrical Engineering Technology professor. The design procedure is explained, tests results are presented, lessons learned are discussed, and ways in which the project could be incorporated into the lab component of an Electrical Engineering Technology course are suggested. Lastly, the authors suggest ways in which their design and approach could be improved...|$|R
40|$|What is Data Cabling? A {{structured}} cabling {{system is a}} type of network construction that is open and is used by different systems like data, access management, telephony, building automation, along with many other similar capabilities. It is an extremely flexible and economical set up. Usually, a cabling system such as this can be broken into six components: work space, horizontal cabling, backbone cabling, gear space, telecommunication closet (room) and entrance ways. Common Network Set up Work space components are extended over into horizontal cabling networks via the telecommunications connector, reaching into the equipment in the targeted workspace. The components utilized in the work place usually include channel equipment (computers, information terminals, telephones, etc.), patch cables (modular cords, PC <b>adapter</b> <b>wires,</b> fiber patch cables, etc.) and communication sockets or outlets. Horizontal cabling setups are designed to extend to the telecommunications data outlet directly to the desired work area. The elements of horizontal cabling contain cable terminations, telecommunication outlets, cross-connections, cable from the patch panel into the work place, and cross-connects into different telecommunication rooms. Generally speaking, backbone cabling networks contain components such as spine wires (typically optical fiber cables), mechanical terminations, intermediate and main cross-connects, and patch cables that can be utilized for backbone-to-backbone cross-connections. Typically, equipment rooms within a building houses (stores) equipment in a type of network room. This usually includes main corr-connect, horizontal connects, or intermediate cross connects. A telecommunication room house any terminations of backbone and horizontal cables to joining hardware such as patch cords or jumpers. Entrance facilities typically have a telecommunications service entrance to the backbone and construction pathways different buildings. These areas contain the wires, network demarcation points, connecting safety devices, hardware and other equipment that connect to personal network cabling and your access provider. Why a Business Needs a Cabling Structure Without the right network installation and data infrastructure, a company {{would not be able to}} operate or compete in the marketplace. Today, most businesses operate using a data network system to help process transactions, store and handle sensitive information, conduct daily business operations, manage accounting and money, employee tracking and payroll, along with business email and hosting services...|$|R
