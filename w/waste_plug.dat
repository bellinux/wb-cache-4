40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of reliable weathering/dissolution rates for cement phases is of fundamental {{importance for the}} modelling of the temporal evolution of both radioactive waste repositories and CO 2 geological storage sites (e. g. <b>waste</b> matrix, <b>plug</b> in boreholes). Here, the dissolution kinetics of AFm-Cl (hydrated calcium aluminates containing interlayer Cl) has been studied using flow-through experiments conducted at pH values ranging from 9. 2 to 13. Mineralogical (XRD) and chemical (EPMA, TEM) analyses have been performed to determine {{the evolution of the}} phases during the dissolution experiments. For pH values between 10 and 13, the dissolution of AFm-Cl is congruent (i. e. Ca/Al ratios close to 2 both for solids and outlet concentrations). In contrast, the precipitation of amorphous Al-phases and possibly amorphous mixed Al/Ca phases is observed at pH 9. 2, leading to Ca/Al ratios in the outlet solutions higher than those of the initial solid. Therefore, at pH 9. 2, even if Cl – /OH – exchange occurs, estimation of dissolution rate from released Cl appears to be the best proxy. Dissolution rates were normalized to the final specific surface areas (ranging from 6. 1 to 35. 4 m 2 g − 1). Dissolution rate appears to be pH-independent and therefore the far-from-equilibrium dissolution rate at room temperature is expressed as: logR(mol m – 2 s – 1) = – 9. 23 ± 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|Axial loads on plugs or {{seals in}} an {{underground}} repository due to gas, water pressures and temperature changes induced subsequent to <b>waste</b> and <b>plug</b> emplacement lead to shear stresses at the plug/rock contact. Therefore, {{the bond between}} the plug and rock is a critical element for the design and effectiveness of plugs in boreholes, shafts or tunnels. This study includes a systematic investigation of the bond strength of cementitious borehole plugs in welded tuff. Analytical and numerical analysis of borehole plug-rock stress transfer mechanics is performed. The interface strength and deformation are studied {{as a function of}} Young`s modulus ratio of plug and rock, plug length and rock cylinder outside-to-inside radius ratio. The tensile stresses in and near an axially loaded plug are analyzed. The frictional interface strength of an axially loaded borehole plug, the effect of axial stress and lateral external stress, and thermal effects are also analyzed. Implications for plug design are discussed. The main conclusion is a strong recommendation to design friction plugs in shafts, drifts, tunnels or boreholes with a minimum length to diameter ratio of four. Such a geometrical design will reduce tensile stresses in the plug and in the host rock to a level which should minimize the risk of long-term deterioration caused by excessive tensile stresses. Push-out tests have been used to determine the bond strength by applying an axial load to cement plugs emplaced in boreholes in welded tuff cylinders. A total of 130 push-out tests have been performed as a function of borehole size, plug length, temperature, and degree of saturation of the host tuff. The use of four different borehole radii enables evaluation of size effects. 119 refs., 42 figs., 20 tabs...|$|R
40|$|Borehole sealing is {{required}} for different purposes, like permanent tightening of deep holesbored in conjunction with site investigations for location of radioactive <b>waste</b> repositories, andtemporary <b>plugging</b> of holes carrying water in deep mines. The holes will pass through low-permeablerock {{as well as through}} water-bearing fracture zones. Sealing can preferably bemade by use of concrete where such zones are intersected, while very low-permeable clayseals can be placed where the holes are surrounded by tight rock. This study focuses on withconcrete seals, and on grouts used for stabilizing intersected fracture zones before boreholesealing is started. The work on concrete comprised comparison of two recipes with different superplasticizers,i. e. organic Glenium which is currently used on a large scale, and talc being an inorganic,hydrophobic material. The study included determination of the compressive and tensilestrength as functions of time, and fluidity, pH and hydraulic conductivity of matured concrete. Part of the study concerned grouts for sealing of rock fractures. Two cement brands were usedas for the concrete study. The effect of adding palygorskite and talc to the silicious aggregatematerial for enhancing fluidity was tested. The work included determination of properties likestrength and fluidity.

40|$|The {{understanding}} {{resistance of}} mass transfer for adsorption of phosphate (PO 43 -) onto industrial waste such as clay brick and ceramic as an adsorbent {{is important to}} verify. This study presented the removal of (PO 43 -) from a synthetic solution by adsorbing onto the clay brick and ceramic <b>wastes</b> in a <b>plug</b> flow column (PFC). The experimental results showed that increasing the flow rate was decreases the breakthrough time. The mass transfer factor (MTF) models were used to study the behaviours of breakthrough curve and to determine the resistance of mass transfer. The MTF models verified that the resistance of mass transfer could be dependent on porous diffusion until the percentage of outflow reaches 72 % for clay brick waste and 86 % for ceramic waste, even though film mass transfer can play a minor role in controlling the movement of (PO 43 -) from the bulk water to film zone. The results of MTF models coefficient could be indicated to increase the capacity of clay brick and ceramic wastes to adsorb (PO 43 -) from synthetic solution, it needs to develop the porosity of these adsorbents by either physical or chemical modification...|$|R
40|$|At {{the heart}} of {{traditional}} risk assessment and risk management lies the notion that analytic tools are able to predict the future. There are, however, activities where risk is considered over long time frames, theoretically eternal, for which the future is truly unpredictable. This thesis reviews the methodologies and regulations of three activities where a safe strategy is needed for handling hazardous materials, with extreme consequences that could occur in a far future. These activities are i) permanent nuclear <b>waste</b> disposal, ii) <b>plugging</b> and abandonment of wells in {{the oil and gas}} industry, and iii) carbon dioxide sequestration in deep geological formations. The thesis is based on an understanding of risk as a combination of the consequences of an activity, with associated uncertainty, which goes beyond traditional probabilistic thinking about risk, and also includes the knowledge and surprise dimensions of risk. Current risk assessment and risk management of the three above-mentioned activities are reviewed with this new risk concept in mind, resulting in concerns about the effectiveness of currently used methods. In particular, concerns are raised related to the effectiveness of the current methodologies to see, study, plan, and act in the occurrence of unforeseen events. Suggestions for improvements are given, aiming to provide more adaptive risk assessment and risk management strategies, and building resilience towards unexpected events. Remove selecte...|$|R
40|$|Problems with {{pipeline}} plugs at Hanford {{have occurred}} throughout its tank farm system. Most cross-site transfer lines at Hanford {{are no longer}} functional due to these <b>plugs.</b> <b>Waste</b> transfers frequently led to partial line plugs, resulting in substantial amounts of water being added to the tank system {{in an attempt to}} free the lines. In response to these plugs, the Hanford tank farm developed waste acceptance criteria that a waste must pass before it can be transferred (Shekarriz et al., 1997). The criteria, which include physical properties such as viscosity, specific gravity, and percent solids, are based primarily on past operational experience. Unfortunately, the chemistry of the waste solutions {{was not included in the}} criteria even though the tank farm operators are fully aware of its importance. Pipeline plugs have also occurred during relatively short waste transfers at Hanford. In FY 2000, the effort to saltwell pump 50, 000 gal of filtered waste from tank U- 103 to tank SY- 102 was delayed for several weeks due to a plugged pipeline. Attempts to locate the plug(s) determined that it had occurred in the 02 -A flex and that other plugs were possible in each of the SY-farm flexes. Modifications such as larger flex jumpers and additional heat tracing were made to the transfer system. The plug was probably attributable to a reduction in the temperature of the waste in the pipeline. The waste in tank U- 103 was approximately 30 C prior to the transfer. During tests on actual waste from tank U- 103 (Herting, 1999), trisodium phosphate solids were observed at temperatures as high as 20 C after a 50 % dilution with water. Therefore, the following precautions (Herting, 1999) were recommended during the saltwell pumping of tank U- 103. First, the tank waste should not be heated prior to the transfer. Second, the waste should not be permitted to cool during the transfer. Third, the waste should be kept moving during the transfer. A previous Tanks Focus Area (TFA) study (Hunt et al., 1999) clearly demonstrated the need to maintain the temperature of the waste in this range. Even small reductions in the temperature of simulated wastes from 35 to 30 C and from 30 to 25 C led to high-viscosity solids that could easily plug a pipeline...|$|R
