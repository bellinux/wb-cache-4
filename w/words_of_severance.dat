They found that the debate had been adjourned, {{and it was not}} until May 6th that Burke had an opportunity of explaining himself on the Revolution in France. He had no sooner risen than interruptions broke out from his own side, and a scene of great disorder followed. Burke was incensed beyond endurance by this treatment, for even Fox and Windham had taken part in the tumult against him. With much bitterness he commented on Fox's previous eulogies of the Revolution, and finally there came the fatal <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>severance.</b> [...] "It is indiscreet," [...] he said, [...] "at any period, but especially at my time of life, to provoke enemies, or give my friends occasion to desert me. Yet if my firm and steady adherence to the British Constitution place me in such a dilemma, I am ready to risk it, and with, my last words to exclaim, 'Fly from the French Constitution.'" [...] Fox at this point eagerly called to him that there was no loss of friends. [...] "Yes, yes," [...] cried Burke, [...] "there is a loss of friends. I know the price of my conduct. I have done my duty at the price of my friend. Our friendship is at an end." ...|$|E

The impact <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> payments depends largely on how much of the costs to employers can be shifted to workers. The theoretical analysis in this Paper shows that, in contrast to a traditional system <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> payments, the system of SPSAs facilitates the shifting <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> payments costs to workers in the form of lower wages. Empirical results using the Colombian National Household Surveys indicate that the introduction of SPSAs shifted around 80 % <b>of</b> the total <b>severance</b> payments contributions to wages and had a positive effect on weekly hours. Results using the 1997 Colombian Living Standards Measurement Survey suggest that, although SPSAs in part replaced employer insurance with self-insurance, SPSAs continue to play a consumption smoothing role for the non-employed. consumption smoothing; crowding out; distortions; tax shifting; unemployment insurance...|$|R

40|$|While {{most of the}} {{literature}} on employment protection has focused on government-mandated severance pay, it has recently been documented that a substantial share <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> payments derives from private contracts or collective agreements. This paper studies the determination of these payments. We analyze the problem of joint bargaining over wages and severance payments and examine the impact of unions on these choices. To do so, we use a search and matching model with risk averse workers, in which we assume that workers may be unionized and that bargaining is over wages and severance pay. Bargaining results in levels <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> pay providing full insurance, which depend on the generosity of unemployment benefits and on the job finding rate. Unions opt for higher levels <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> pay given that their higher wage demands imply reduced job creation. Calibrated to 8 European economies, the model predicts bargained levels <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> pay which are close to those found in reality...|$|R
30|$|Another {{issue to}} account for when {{computing}} effective coverage would be the issue in compliance with labor regulations. In other words, an effectively covered worker is a wage employee working for an employer complying with EPL. Statistics on such employees can be collected though firm and worker surveys. Some very rare examples of such surveys include the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) and the National Labour Force Survey (Sakernas), used by Brusentsev et al. (2012) to assess receipt <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> pay among dismissed workers. Restricting the sample to private and public sector employees covered by employment protection legislation and who experienced a job separation, these authors find that two thirds of all eligible employees who separated from a job do not receive their severance payment. Moreover, workers obtain, on average, only 40  % <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> payments due to them; in other <b>words,</b> most <b>of</b> the complying firms are complying only partially. The authors also suggest that compliance and levels <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> pay set by law exhibit sizeable trade-offs. It {{would be useful to}} include compliance questions in labor force surveys {{in order to get a}} better understanding of EPL compliance, and hence effective EPL coverage, in other countries.|$|R

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which firing restrictions could serve as a welfare-improving contractual arrangement between the firm and the worker.

The welfare loss of the fired worker in turn depends on the degree of wage inflexibility, the unemployment duration, and the unemployment benefit. I examine the labor data for OECD countries, and find that the the level <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> payment and notice period is comparable to the welfare loss of the fired worker, as the model suggests. In the immedate future, I will calibrate the model and estimate the (socially) optimal level <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> payment and notice period in individual OECD countries.

40|$|It is {{frequently}} {{alleged that the}} persistent, high rates of unemployment in many European countries are due, at least in part, to various labor market rigidities. One of these rigidities is {{the high cost of}} firing workers, compared with the cost in the United States, or in Europe in the early 1960 s.; This paper assesses the empirical importance <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> costs on labor demand. A partial equilibrium model of the firm's employment decision in the presence <b>of</b> significant <b>severance</b> costs is formulated and solved. The theoretical section of the paper identifies the following determinants of the impact <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> costs on labor demand: (1) the size <b>of</b> the required <b>severance</b> payments, (2) the variability and persistence of shocks to labor demand, (3) the expected rate of growth of labor demand, (4) the rate at which workers voluntarily leave the firm to retire or take other jobs, (5) the wage elasticity of labor demand, and (6) the firm's discount rate.; The analytical framework is then used to evaluate the impact <b>of</b> <b>severance</b> costs on the expected cost of hiring a worker, and hence on labor demand. These costs are evaluated for a plausible base case, and the sensitivity of the conclusions to alternative assumptions is investigated. Unemployment; Labor market...|$|R
