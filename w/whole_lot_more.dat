500|$|James Berardinelli {{enjoyed the}} film. [...] "It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> {{colorful}} than before." [...] Scott Beatty felt [...] "Tommy Lee Jones played Harvey Dent as a Joker knock-off {{rather than a}} multi-layered rogue." [...] Lee Bermejo called Batman Forever [...] "unbearable". Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a thumbs up and the latter a thumbs down. In his written review, Ebert wrote: [...] "Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it's great bubblegum for the eyes. Younger children {{will be able to}} process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from Batman Returns where the PG-13 rating was a joke." [...] Mick LaSalle had a mixed reaction, concluding [...] "a shot of Kilmer's rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|The Quest Begins {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins who wanted Victoria Holmes, editor and creator of the Warriors series which {{followed}} the adventures of feral cats, to write another series about animals. The company suggested dogs to Holmes, but the idea was rejected since dogs behave very similarly to the cats in the Warriors series. Both horses and dolphins were suggested, but rejected due to their tendency to run away rather than fight and the slowness of battles underwater. Out of ideas, HarperCollins consulted with Holmes on {{what she wanted to}} write about. After a bit of thinking Holmes replied, [...] "BEARS! They live much more solitary lifestyles than cats, they are wild through and through with no history of domestication whatsoever (performing bears don’t count), and they are much bigger animals, with a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> potential for fighting".|$|E
500|$|Gavin Martin from The Mirror gave a mixed response, as he said: [...] "Nothing dates {{as quickly}} as pop that dares to call itself futuristic". Martin awarded the song 3/5 and {{concluded}} with [...] "It's not that this new number from the forthcoming Greatest Hits set is bad – but it's a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> routine than it pretends to be." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented on the possibly outdated dance theme. Responding to the new additions of the record including [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better", he noted: [...] "Not exactly what one would call original, but if it's true the singer's next studio album will reprise this electro-pop sound, Aguilera deserves credit for refusing to play it safe." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com awarded the track three stars. He noted Aguilera's dance-inspired effort, {{at a time of}} dance dominance in the industry, negatively and stated that [...] "the catchy electro-pop vibe isn't enough to make it one of her more memorable efforts." [...] Rolling Stone noted that in the compilation, Aguilera's old singles are [...] "weighed down by four bland attempts at 2008's trendy, Lady Gaga-jacking electropop". Paul Thompson and Amy Phillips from Pitchfork Media said that the track was [...] "basically a ripoff" [...] of Goldfrapp's [...] "Ooh La La".|$|E
5000|$|Born to Fight has {{received}} mixed reviews. Beyond Hollywood gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "90-odd minutes of random over-the-top action shot to a throbbing techno soundtrack. It’s not Ong Bak, {{although it does}} come dangerously close to being that other movie’s bastard love child." [...] Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying, [...] "So it's a little quaint and corny when compared to the American action flicks, but it's also got a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of energy, <b>more</b> than enough action, and some truly staggering stunt work. Fun, crazy stuff all the way." ...|$|R
40|$|As any weaver knows, {{the elegance}} of a fabric lies in the yarns, not the threads. The <b>whole</b> is <b>lots</b> <b>more</b> {{than the sum of}} its parts. In health services, the threads are the diagnoses on which {{interventions}} are based. How these threads are spun into yarn (the under-lying biodynamic of the tapestry of health) is poorly understood, to the detriment of efforts to understand the genesis of health problems and the interventions associated with them. Part of the problem is the impera-tive to “sell ” diagnoses in order to market the interven-tions associated with them. Those who make their living by focusing on diseases resist understanding that health is a pattern. Without grasping the pattern, man-agement is at best an approximation of adequate care.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{described}} as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as [...] "If aliens invade, don't fight back. Run." [...] Saunders compared the film to Independence Day, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate {{the atmosphere of the}} September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to Reader's Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: [...] "They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life." [...] Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – [...] "I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I think that when you're that age you don't fully consider the ramifications of what you're doing and you're very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that's a good idea or not." [...] Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men's weapons, but the planet's smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as [...] "nature, in a way, knowing a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> than we do".|$|E
500|$|Similarly to the Warriors series, Seekers {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins to Victoria Holmes to develop another series {{about a group of}} animals, but not cats. Dogs were considered, but {{rejected}} because they were too close to cats in their hierarchical social organization, pack and hunting lifestyles, and territoriality. This was expressed by Victoria Holmes later in an online chat, where she stated that she [...] "was reluctant to create stories that... would be quite similar to Warriors. Dogs live in packs, they hunt for their food, they have a strict hierarchy within their communities, they guard their territories". Horses, otters and dolphins were considered, but were dismissed: Holmes felt that horses tended to run away rather than stay and fight, and that dolphin battles would be slow without [...] "the all-action excitement that Erin loves so much". In the end, the company left the decision to Holmes and she opted for bears; in the later author chat she notes that bears [...] "live much more solitary lifestyles than cats, they are wild through and through with no history of domestication whatsoever (performing bears don't count), and they are much bigger animals, with a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> potential for fighting". The series took inspiration from Inuit beliefs and Native American languages. Holmes found that Native Americans and bears are very closely linked to the natural environment. The names of the bears are taken from several different Native American languages. Lusa, for example, means [...] "black" [...] in Choctaw.|$|E

2500|$|In Japan, Famitsu {{gave it a}} {{score of}} one eight, one nine, one ten, and one nine {{for a total of}} 36 out of 40. One {{reviewer}} said, [...] "The way you participate in events and run races on public roads serves well as a new direction for the series. [...] Earning popularity for things like drifting and other stuff makes it fun to just drive around, but I still wish there was something more unique to this game. I have to give top marks to the graphics and ease of play, though." [...] Another reviewer stated, [...] "This used to be a really stoic racing simulator, but this is more of a driving game designed to be easy to pick up.

The stories being filmed are just as flimsy. Of course Beowulf does have a more impressive literary pedigree than, say, Bwana Devil. But you'd never know that {{by looking at the}} movie. Beowulf's story of a hero who slays monsters has become a fanboy fantasy that panders with demonic energy to the young male demographic." [...] Manohla Dargis of the New York Times compared the poem with the film stating that, [...] "If you don't remember this evil babe from the poem, it's because she's almost entirely the invention of the screenwriters Roger Avary and Neil Gaiman and the director Robert Zemeckis, who together have plumped her up in words, deeds and curves. These creative interventions aren't especially surprising given the source material and the nature of big-studio adaptations. There's plenty of action in Beowulf, but even its more vigorous bloodletting pales next to its rich language, exotic setting and mythic grandeur." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, they probably would be unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of permissiveness extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man who is black. It is that of a man who knows a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> about things than you do and is intent on setting you straight, at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E
