5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
5|$|Children with high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> {{prefer to be}} alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those <b>with</b> <b>autism.</b> For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: We {{compared}} {{the frequency and}} duration of specific mealtime behaviors and GI dysfunction in children <b>with</b> classic <b>autism</b> to typically-developing siblings. Survey Method: A 41 -item on-line parent survey. Statistics: Chi square and binomial logistical regression. Results: 79 children <b>with</b> classic <b>autism</b> matched <b>with</b> a normally-developing sibling. Logistic Regression Analysis Revealed: Dislike of new foods and bizarre mealtime mannerisms, were more frequent in those <b>with</b> classic <b>autism</b> (p < 0. 01). They also had higher odds ratio of constipation and fecal incontinence (p < 0. 01). 40 % of children <b>with</b> classic <b>autism</b> had been on GFCF diets (p < 0. 01). Only 1 % of those children on a gluten-free diet had a biopsy-proven diagnosis of celiac disease. Conclusion: Children <b>with</b> classic <b>autism</b> had more frequent dislike of new foods, bizarre mealtime behaviors, constipation, and fecal incontinence...|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} who believe that {{regressive}} autism is simply early-onset autism that was recognized at a later date. Researchers have conducted studies to determine whether regressive autism is a distinct subset of autism spectrum disorders. Over the years, {{the results of these}} studies have contradicted one another. Some researchers believe there is still nothing to support a definitive biological difference between early-onset and regressive autism. However, emerging research shows that males <b>with</b> regressive <b>autism</b> have brains that are six percent larger than anyone <b>with</b> early-onset <b>autism.</b> The brains of females <b>with</b> regressive <b>autism</b> show no difference in brain size.|$|R

40|$|Anxiety {{and stress}} are {{everyday}} issues {{for many people}} <b>with</b> high-functioning <b>autism,</b> and while cognitive-behavioural therapy is the treatment of choice {{for the management of}} anxiety, there are challenges in using it with people <b>with</b> high-functioning <b>autism.</b> This study used modified experience sampling techniques to examine everyday anxiety and stress in adults <b>with</b> high-functioning <b>autism</b> and to explore the feasibility of delivering real-time stress management techniques using a mobile platform. High levels of anxiety were found to be characterised by worry, confusing thoughts and being alone but was not associated with internal focus, imagery or rumination. Participants reported improved mood and less worry and anxious thinking in the active phase of the study. These results support previous studies indicating that people <b>with</b> high-functioning <b>autism</b> differ in their experience of anxiety and provided preliminary data on the feasibility of real-time stress management. The limitations of this approach are discussed together with considerations for future work in the area of developing clinical interventions on mobile platforms...|$|R

5|$|Unusual eating {{behavior}} {{occurs in}} {{about three-quarters of}} children with ASD, {{to the extent that}} it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in malnutrition. Although some children <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> also have gastrointestinal symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.|$|E
5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> provides communication to those {{with little or no}} functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E

5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E
5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients <b>with</b> <b>autism,</b> schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children <b>with</b> <b>autism</b> reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E

40|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} deficits in verbal communication, social interactions, {{and the presence}} of repetitive, stereotyped and compulsive behaviors. Excessive early brain growth is found commonly in some patients and may contribute to disease phenotype. Reports of increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other neurotrophic-like factors in autistic neonates suggest that enhanced anabolic activity in CNS mediates this overgrowth effect. We have shown previously that in a subset of patients <b>with</b> severe <b>autism</b> and aggression, plasma levels of the secreted amyloid-b (Ab) precursor protein-alpha form (sAPPa) were significantly elevated relative to controls and patients <b>with</b> mild-to-moderate <b>autism.</b> Here we further tested the hypothesis that levels of sAPPa and sAPPb (proteolytic cleavage products of APP by a- and b-secretase, respectively) are deranged in autism and may contribute to an anabolic environment leading to brain overgrowth. We measured plasma levels of sAPPa, sAPPb, Abpeptides and BDNF by corresponding ELISA in a well characterized set of subjects. We included for analysis 18 control, 6 mild-to-moderate, and 15 severely autistic patient plasma samples. We have observed that sAPPa levels are increased and BDNF levels decreased in the plasma of patients <b>with</b> severe <b>autism</b> as compared to controls.
