500|$|.....I {{thought about}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> offered and I said to myself, [...] "What am I being so damn grand about? I have two {{children}} to support, the part {{they want me to}} play has a lot of dignity, the show is already on the air, I wouldn't have to film a pilot, and they have a sponsor. This is really a great gift that has been offered me. I'd be stupid not to at least look into it." ...|$|E
500|$|Morse {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} supporting roles following the finale of St. Elsewhere in 1988. He is quoted as saying: [...] "I made the decision that I didn't care if there was any money in the role or not. I had to find roles that were different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> doing." [...] His turn in Desperate Hours as antagonist showed a darker Morse. He later starred in The Indian Runner and The Crossing Guard. He has {{appeared in}} three adaptations of Stephen King stories: The Langoliers, Hearts in Atlantis, and The Green Mile. He was a guest star on , playing the racist cousin of Detective Tim Bayliss.|$|E
500|$|In 1953, Levin {{applied for}} a job on the weekly {{periodical}} Truth. The paper had recently {{been taken over by}} the liberal publisher Ronald Staples who together with his new editor Vincent Evans was determined to cleanse it of its previous right-wing racist reputation. Levin's noticeably Jewish surname, together with such skills as he had acquired in shorthand and typing, gained him immediate acceptance. He was offered the post of [...] "general editorial dogsbody, which was exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> looking for". After a year, Evans left and was succeeded by his deputy, George Scott; Levin was promoted in Scott's place. He wrote for the paper under a variety of pseudonyms, including [...] "A.E.Cherryman".|$|E

500|$|During the {{pregnancy}} storyline, Martha was also {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to your friends and family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} Open Salon.com enjoyed the episode, writing [...] "While I enjoyed {{the last eight}} weeks of {{alternate}} universe hijinks, this week's episode reminded me of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> missing from the earlier seasons... It's nice to know we'll {{be back with our}} good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted with just the right about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E
2500|$|At {{that point}} during the December 13 press conference, Christina Genovese Renna texted to Pete Sheridan, [...] "Are you listening? He [...] just flat out lied about senior staff and [...] Stepien not being involved," [...] and [...] "He lied. And if e-mails are found with the {{subpoena}} or [...] e-mails are uncovered in discovery if it come to {{that it could be}} bad." [...] The texts from Renna (an employee of Kelly) to Sheridan (who had worked on the re-election campaign) came to light in court filings by Baroni's attorneys on August 10, 2016, to which Christie responded, [...] "I absolutely dispute it. It’s ridiculous. It’s nothing new." [...] At the federal trial, Renna walked back her comments, testifying, [...] "I had no knowledge of whether the governor was lying or not. But it seemed to contradict <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence's {{second husband}} Richard Aldrich became a {{lieutenant}} in the United States Navy during World War II, during which time Lawrence had a standing invitation to perform for British troops {{from the head of}} the UK's Entertainments National Service Association. Her chief obstacle was getting from her home in Massachusetts to Britain. Aldrich was overseas at the time. In her 1945 memoir A Star Danced, she recalled, [...] "After weeks of more or less patient waiting, repeated timid, pleading, urgent and finally importunate requests to the authorities who rule such matters in Washington and London, and a rapid-fire barrage of telegrams, cables and telephone calls, it had happened. At last I had permission to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wanting desperately to do for four years—go to England and do my bit on a tour for E.N.S.A." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kiedis, Slovak, and Flea {{began to}} create their own music after finding {{inspiration}} in a punk-funk fusion band called Defunkt. [...] Kiedis rejected the violence and misogyny associated with the Los Angeles punk rock scene at the time, and wished to create a more peaceful environment that would encourage women to come to concerts. The three formed a band with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons, called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, titled [...] "Out in L.A.", and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once. The song was based on a guitar riff that Slovak wrote while [...] "jamming" [...] with Irons, and was not meant to become a real song until Kiedis decided to rap over the music. Mike Chester, a friend of Kiedis', invited the band to open for his act Mike and Neighbor's Voices at The Rhythm Lounge, as he felt that Kiedis had potential as a frontman. Slovak and Flea were initially skeptical, and felt that Kiedis did not have enough vocal experience, but the two eventually agreed to perform. Kiedis later described the performance: [...] "All the anticipation of the moment hit me, and I instinctively knew that the miracle of manipulating energy and tapping into an infinite source of power and harnessing it in a small space with your friends was <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> put on this earth to do." ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{presentation}} I revisit {{some of my}} work on 'groups and networks' to {{draw out}} the distinction between cooperation and collaboration for this mass collaboration workshop. I argue that mass collaboration may be impossible to achieve, and show how we employed a principle of mass cooperation to support massive open online courses (MOOCs). I also introduced new terminology, using the term 'collective' to describe <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> calling 'groups', and 'connectives' to describe <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> calling networks.
