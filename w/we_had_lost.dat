500|$|According to drummer Sean Moore, {{the band}} {{felt they had}} been [...] "going a bit astray" [...] with their {{previous}} album, 1993's Gold Against the Soul, and so the approach to the follow-up was for the band {{to go back to}} their [...] "grass roots" [...] and rediscover [...] "a little bit of Britishness that we lacked". Singer and guitarist James Dean Bradfield recalls the band feeling they had become [...] "a bit too rockist [...] <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> our direction". The band stopped listening to American rock music and returned to influences that had inspired them when they first formed, including Magazine, Wire, Skids, PiL, Gang of Four and Joy Division.|$|E

Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I think some of the guys got a little angry with me. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost,</b> I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E

[...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost.</b> [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by. I just wish I could stop losing these epic races" [...] while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a [...] "blow to the heart". Wooge was disappointed: [...] "I pull my hat off to Oxford, that was an amazing race." [...] Rankov later revealed [...] "It’s the hardest I’ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's fifth round {{match was}} away to league rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford on 16 February 2003. After Giggs missed {{the chance to}} score past an open goal, midfielder Edu gave Arsenal the lead through a free kick which took a {{deflection}} off David Beckham's shoulder. Wiltord scored the second goal of the match in the 52nd minute, running onto a pass from Edu and side-footing the ball past goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Vieira said of the performance: [...] "We knew when we lost here in the league that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> the battle in midfield. We had to put that right, and we did." [...] In the sixth round, Arsenal were drawn at home to Chelsea in {{a repeat of the}} previous season's final. Chelsea defender John Terry put his team ahead with a header from a set piece before Arsenal responded through Jeffers and Henry. Frank Lampard scored a late equaliser for the visiting team meaning the match was replayed at Stamford Bridge. An own goal by Terry and a strike by Wiltord in the space of seven minutes during the replay gave Arsenal an early lead against Chelsea. Despite going down to ten men after Cygan was sent off and Terry scoring from a header, the away team scored a third goal through Lauren to ensure progression into the semi-finals. In the semi-final against Sheffield United on 13 April 2003 at Old Trafford, Ljungberg scored the winning goal to help Arsenal reach their third successive FA Cup final appearance. The match was remembered for Seaman, who on his 1,000th appearance in senior football produced a late save to deny Sheffield United from equalising.|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigating}} {{committee was}} subject to severe criticism {{from the time of}} beginning their work {{until the end of the}} 37th Congress. Nearly every person who had wronged the government had friends, and sought to defend himself. Newspapers and members of Congress both came the defense of those allegedly wronged by the committee. Opponents of the committee looked for any opportunity to attack the committee's work in floor speeches, particularly when committee members were absent from the House, thereby lessening the importance of the work of the committee and to render its members unpopular. Rep. Roscoe Conkling, Republican of New York, was an often vocal opponent of the committee, sharply denounced its work, maintaining that [...] "the nation, the government, classes of individuals, and individuals themselves, had suffered in character; that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> caste, and that much harm had come, not from detecting or exposing fraud or extravagance, but from magnifying and exaggerating what had happened, and charging and publishing to the world what had never happened at all." [...] Rep. Schuyler Colfax, Republican of Indiana, frequently joined Rep. Conkling in attacking the committee's work.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a soldier}} his {{standing}} was perfect: {{his name was}} a synonym of bravery, and his patriotism of the highest order. In battle he was apparently lost to fear, and his every action heroic. His acts of heroism on the 20th of September, 1863, that came under my personal observation, I believe are without a parallel of individual bravery of that memorable battle. He with his bugle {{made it possible for}} us to check a most disastrous retreat. We were able through the assistance of Carson to rally over 2500 of our division and retake the position <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost,</b> which was then held by us until night. W. J. Carson, along with 1900 of us, after being completely surrounded by the enemy, and out of all ammunition, were captured at 6:30 P. M. on the original line of battle, the entire army, at that time, having retired several miles toward Chattanooga. He was as brave a man as ever wore the blue, and I deem it a great privilege and honor to be remembered among his friends and acquaintances. As to his simple request, asking the Government to award him the Medal of Honor for gallantry and heroism, I am sure no more patriotic or gallant breast ever merited the distinguishing mark of bravery from the U. S. Government than that of W. J. Carson." ...|$|E
