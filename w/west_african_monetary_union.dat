40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a survey of}} recent advances {{in the literature on}} proposed <b>African</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>unions.</b> The survey comprises about 60 empirical papers published during the past fifteen years. Four main strands are discussed individually and collectively, notably, the proposed: West <b>African</b> <b>Monetary</b> Zone (WAMZ), East <b>African</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> (EAMU), Southern <b>African</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> (SAMU) and <b>African</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> (AMU). We observe a number of issues with establishing the feasibility and/or desirability of potential <b>monetary</b> <b>unions,</b> inter alia, variations in: choice of variables, empirical strategies, sampled countries and considered periodicities. We address this ambiguity by reviewing studies with scenarios that are consistent with Hegelian dialectics and establish selective expansion as the predominant mode of monetary integration. Some proponents make cases for strong pegs and institutions as viable alternatives to currency unions. Using cluster analysis, disaggregating panels into sub-samples and distinguishing shocks from responses in the examination of business cycle synchronisation provide more subtle policy implications. We caution that for inquiries using the same theoretical underpinnings, variables and methods just by modifying the scope/context and periodicity may only contribute to increasing the number of conflicting findings. Authors should place more emphasis on new perspectives and approaches based on caveats of, and lessons from the European <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> (EMU) and CFA zones...|$|R
40|$|The {{devaluation}} of the CFA Francs in 1994 has highlighted the relevance of fiscal coordination in <b>African</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>unions.</b> After 1994, <b>African</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>unions</b> have adopted a fiscal rule which prescribes a permanent nil or positive budgetary balance. This article studies how this fiscal rule affects the cyclicality of fiscal policies. The results show that compared to other African states, such a fiscal rule creates a pro cyclical bias in public expenditure during recessions. The bias justifies a modification of the rule in order to impose a fiscal surplus during expansions. Fiscal policies, Pro cyclicality, currency union, Fiscal rules, Africa. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Monetary</b> <b>unions</b> are {{characterized}} by contemporary institutional arrangements that entrust monetary policy to a supranational entity while fiscal policies are framed by rules imposed on the budget deficit. Limits on public deficits are usually justified {{by the idea that}} government deficits reduce national savings, which ultimately reduces domestic investment and economic growth. However, this idea that domestic savings must necessarily increase if investment increases cannot be taken for granted. Moreover, it is possible that within the union, countries reveal different saving-investment causality, which is capable of rendering considerable credibility and effectiveness of budgetary rules of government deficits systematic prohibition as a means to revitalize investment. This study raises the question of domestic savings-investment causality in an <b>African</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> with a focus on the WAEMU zone.

By applying the techniques of unit–root tests and the long–run Granger non-causality test proposed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995), the causal relationships between the real GDP growth rate and two stock market development proxies are tested. The results are in line with the supply leading hypothesis in the sense that there is strong causal flow from the stock market development to economic growth. A unidirectional causal relationship is also observed between real market capitalization ratio and economic growth. stock market development; economic growth; Toda and Yamamoto causality test; <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union...</b>|$|E

40|$|Could a <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>union</b> (either of the non-CFA countries, or all ECOWAS members) be an {{effective}} "agency of restraint" on fiscal policies? We discuss how monetary union could affect fiscal discipline and the arguments for explicit fiscal restraints considered in the European Monetary Union literature, and their applicability to West Africa. The empirical evidence, EMU literature, and CFA experience suggest that monetary union could create the temptation for fiscal profligacy through prospects of a bailout, or costs diluted through the membership.

40|$|With the spectre of the Euro crisis hunting {{embryonic}} monetary unions, we use {{a dynamic}} model of a small open economy to analyze REERs imbalances and examine whether the movements in the aggregate real exchange rates {{are consistent with the}} underlying macroeconomic fundamentals in the proposed <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Union</b> (WAMU). Using both country-oriented and WAMU panel-based specifications, we show that the long-run behavior of the REERs can be explained by fluctuations in the terms of trade, productivity, investment, debt and openness. While there is still significant evidence of cross-country differences in the relationship between underlying macroeconomic fundamentals and corresponding REERs, the embryonic WAMU has a stable error correction mechanism with four of the five cointegration relations having signs that are consistent with the predictions from economic theory. Policy implications are discussed and the conclusions of the analysis are a valuable contribution to the scholarly and policy debate over whether the creation of a sustainable monetary union should precede convergence in macroeconomic fundamentals that determine REER adjustments. ...|$|E
