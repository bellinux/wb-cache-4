25|$|The ageing of Europe, {{also known}} as the greying of Europe, is a {{demographic}} phenomenon in Europe characterized by a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy among European populations. Low birth rates and higher life expectancy contribute to the transformation of Europe's population pyramid shape. The most significant change is the transition towards a much older population structure, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of the working age while the number of the retired population increases. The total number of the older population is projected to increase greatly within the coming decades, with rising proportions of the post-war baby-boom generations reaching retirement.

In the next 20 - 25 years, the window of opportunity is likely to benefit most South Asian countries if favourable policies are pursued to take advantage of this with opening up their economy.
