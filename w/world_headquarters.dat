5|$|Nelson {{moved to}} Austin, Texas, where the burgeoning hippie music scene (see Armadillo <b>World</b> <b>Headquarters)</b> rejuvenated the singer.

5|$|At an {{appearance}} at the Armadillo <b>World</b> <b>Headquarters,</b> a music venue in Austin, Texas, Nelson met publisher and screenwriter William D. Wittliff. Because {{of the success of}} the album, Wittliff decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red Headed Stranger. In 1979 Wittliff finished a draft of the project, which was turned over to Universal Studios. The studio budgeted the film at $14 million and sent the script to Robert Redford, who turned it down. The movie project was tabled, and Wittliff and Nelson had to buy the script back from Universal. The script then went to HBO, who assigned the project a budget of $5 million, but this project was not completed either. Finally, Nelson and Wittliff decided to finance the film themselves.

5|$|Throughout his career, James {{has been}} ranked by Forbes {{as one of}} the world's most {{influential}} athletes, and in 2017, he was listed by Time {{as one of the}} 100 most influential people in the world. During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its <b>world</b> <b>headquarters.</b> Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games versus the New York Yankees sporting a Yankees hat. Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision, he was listed as one of the world's most disliked athletes. By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA {{for the second time in}} his career.

5|$|In July 2011, CoMS {{was renamed}} the Etihad Stadium, {{sponsored}} by Etihad Airways who fought off competition from Ferrostaal and Aabar {{to gain the}} stadium naming rights. The lucrative ten-year sponsorship deal included not just the naming rights to the stadium itself but to the whole £200 million complex of football-related facilities into which it was soon to be incorporated. In mid-September 2011, development plans were duly announced for a new state-of-the-art youth academy and training facility, {{now known as the}} City Football Academy (CFA) to be built on derelict land adjacent to the stadium and which would include a 7,000 capacity mini-stadium plus fifteen additional outdoor football pitches, six swimming pools and three gyms. The planned CFA facility was not only to become the new home base of the Manchester City first team squad, reserve (under-21 youth) team squad, and all of the Academy younger age group squads, but also the new home of the prior loosely affiliated Manchester City Ladies team (which was re-branded in 2012 as Manchester City Women's F.C. and more formally merged into the Manchester City family of affiliated football teams). Also fully integrated into the new CFA facility would be the parent club's <b>world</b> <b>headquarters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Today, Christians make up 57% of the state's population, with Protestants {{making up}} 21% of them. Roman Catholics make up 34% and now predominate because of massive {{immigration}} from primarily Catholic countries and regions – chiefly Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Quebec, and Latin America. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities {{have been in}} decline since the late 20th century, due {{to the rise of}} irreligion in New England. It is the most irreligious region of the country, along with the Western United States. A significant Jewish population immigrated to the Boston and Springfield areas between 1880 and 1920. Jews currently make up 3% of the population. Mary Baker Eddy made the Boston Mother Church of Christian Science serve as the <b>world</b> <b>headquarters</b> of this new religious movement. Buddhists, Pagans, Hindus, Seventh-day Adventists, Muslims, and Mormons can also be found.
