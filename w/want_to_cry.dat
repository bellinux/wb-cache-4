500|$|On May 29, 2008, Beghe {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the Church of Scientology held outside the Scientology building on East 46th Street in New York City. He addressed the 50 protesters gathered {{across the street from}} the Scientology building, and told them: [...] "What you guys are doing means so much to me, and so much to these people ... It just kills me. It makes me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> You don’t know what kind of good you’re doing." [...] He then walked across the street in an attempt to enter the Scientology building, but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards. He returned to the group of protesters and tried to phone the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, John Carmichael: [...] "I called and asked for John Carmichael and said I was Jason Beghe. Then they hung up." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{expressed}} mixed {{opinions of}} the game's audio. The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro said that the [...] "whimsical" [...] background music is [...] "quite enjoyable" [...] and the character sound bites are [...] "varied enough to avoid becoming annoying." [...] Doug Perry of IGN had a more mixed take, saying that the [...] "classic bouncy, xylophone-heavy beat" [...] is [...] "not necessarily great", and that after a few courses, [...] "you either stop hearing it, or the incessant simplicity of it makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> or pull your hair out". On {{the subject of the}} voice acting, he concluded that there is [...] "nothing really that cute, clever or memorable" [...] in the game, and noted that Crash's voice in the game is extremely similar to that of Luigi from the Mario Kart series. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote that while the music and sound effects [...] "push the game's cartoon theme," [...] the themes were not too [...] "over the top" [...] or incessant. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution passed the music off as [...] "standard kitschy fare" [...] and added that while the sound effects [...] "add to the cartoon quality of the game", some of the character voices were unsatisfactory. Joe Ottoson of Allgame noted that the characters [...] "are all quite vocal", and the music [...] "sets off the whimsical mood nicely".|$|E

500|$|... "Baby Don't Lie" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella, with Tedder and Blanco also serving as the song's producers. It is a midtempo electropop and reggae-pop song which begins with Stefani announcing, [...] "Uh huh, here we go," [...] to a rubbery bass line and hand claps. The song also has a hip hop-inflected breakdown, in which Stefani raps, [...] "You can tell me what you're hidin' boy/And {{you can tell me}} if I'm gettin' warm". Lyrically, the song {{discusses}} insecurities in a relationship, where Stefani questions her man's love. Nolan Feeney of Time complimented that the song is [...] "about falling in love with someone who's got a few skeletons in their closet." [...] As noted by Spins Brennan Carley, [...] "Stefani sounds shattered as she sings, [...] "But there's something behind those eyes / Those eyes / That you can't that you can't disguise / Disguise." [...] In the [...] "stomping, infuriatingly catchy" [...] chorus she sings, [...] "Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie…/I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> no longer." [...] Melodically, [...] "Baby don't Lie" [...] is written in the key of B♭ minor, performed in a common time moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute and follows the sequence B♭m - G♭ - D♭ as its chord progression. Stefani's voice spans two octaves from the lowest note A♭3 to the highest note A♭5.|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific {{smile on his face}} that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|Paige {{returned}} to his hotel room. He recalled that the next morning, [...] "My stomach got sick with the pain that shot up my right arm. Sweat popped out all over me. The pain wouldn't quit. I tried lifting my arm. I couldn't. I just sat there, sweating, hurting enough to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> getting sicker in the stomach and getting scared—real scared. My arm. I couldn't lift it." [...] He was examined by physicians in Mexico and in the United States; one expert {{told him that he}} would never pitch again.|$|E
2500|$|A {{detailed}} description of conditions in the camps is provided by Varlam Shalamov in his Kolyma Tales. In Dry Rations he writes: [...] "Each time they brought in the soup... it made us all <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> We were ready to cry for fear that the soup would be thin. And when a miracle occurred and the soup was thick we couldn’t believe it and ate it as slowly as possible. But even with thick soup in a warm stomach there remained a sucking pain; we’d been hungry for too long. All human emotions—love, friendship, envy, concern for one’s fellow man, compassion, longing for fame, honesty— had left us with the flesh that had melted from our bodies...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Check It Out" [...] {{features}} the nearly constant {{repetition of the}} piano and vocal hook from The Buggles' 1979 classic 'Video Killed the Radio Star,' which is famous for being the first video ever played on MTV. Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio Blog states that the [...] "Incessant 'Oh-a oh's' pretty much bore a hole in your head, the duo verbally flip the bird to their haters while on {{their way into the}} hottest dance club in town." [...] Wilkening gave the songs lyrics a negative review stating [...] "If you're looking for deep lyrical insights, jeez, are you at the wrong party." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator gave the song a positive review stating, [...] "We almost <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> foul for taking an extremely beloved 80s song (okay, the song was released in 1979 but the video debuted in 1981) and appropriating it for a modern-day hip-hop song, just because that’s become so commonplace it’s an uncreative, predictable way to get attention for your song. But… but… but… we can’t hate. We love this. We have no taste. It’s just too much fun—we can easily see this getting massive radio play like her other let’s-sample-another-popular-song-from-another-decade hit and make people's ears bleed, “Your Love”. What say you?" [...] Entertainment Weekly put the single as their #2 of [...] "The Must List" [...] stating, [...] "The Black Eyed Peas front-man and hip-hop's reigning femme fatale make ingenious use of those famous coos from the 1979 Buggles hit [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star" [...] to create an irresistible party-starter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{replacement}} scenario:In this, we {{are asked}} to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same." [...] This response, however, is impossible, as identical signals would be sent to the remaining organic regions of the brain as would be sent under normal circumstances, by the definition of the behavior of the hypothetical computers. (See Ship of Theseus for a similar thought experiment.) ...|$|E
