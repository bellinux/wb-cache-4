6000|$|... "They <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you," [...] said Henry, [...] "and {{carry you}} {{prisoner}} to the Tower; {{and there will}} be no pacifying them unless you go with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked out}} of the window, but she saw nothing of the {{landscape}} now. [...] "I understand it all. You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> mother away before she finds out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is rather}} luxurious for us," [...] said Mrs. Bowen. [...] "It's a {{compromise}} with Effie. She <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her <b>to</b> Giacosa's this afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Bradley {{was out of}} the room, Sir Richmond remarked: [...] "I {{saw that}} nerves man, Dr. Martineau, to-day. He <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a holiday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With her {{or without}} her, my dear; that {{concerns}} only your poor daddy. She has big interests over there, and she <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a look at}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a letter}} from you and see that it reaches him. And then he can write back to my address, and I can smuggle the letter to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. You know we {{are trying}} in Budmouth to raise some money for your sufferers; {{and the way we}} have thought of is by a {{dramatic}} performance. They <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a part.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I used to ride when I was a boy, before Tippoo {{came down}} and killed my father and mother, and brought me up here. Will my lord <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the horses across?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--in this house! Did {{you ever}} hear of such a little cat? I could tell you more than that. She <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them and dispose of them." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{take great}} care of myself, be quite sure of that, Susie; {{the worst of}} it is, here in Assisi {{everybody}} else <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a {{ride with}} him this afternoon," [...] said Stanley. [...] "And I can invite three others to go along. Will you come with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The man {{handed him}} one of the bills back. [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> more than five you'll have to show your book," [...] he said. [...] "I've been finding out how you work these affairs, Larry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Then in {{this case}} of sweet and generous {{friendship}} {{the party of the}} second part may have construed the sentiment quite differently! Well, {{what do you want me}} to do? Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the contract off your hands?" ...|$|E
60|$|Things ran along, {{a tournament}} nearly every week; {{and now and}} then the boys used to <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a hand--I mean Sir Launcelot and the rest--but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much {{government}} machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.|$|E
6000|$|... "'And {{suppose she}} waits about outside for me, and Mrs. Plimmer <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> 'er out?' he ses, shivering. 'She's a fearful obstinate woman; and she'd wait {{a week for}} me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The captain {{has found}} a {{passageway}} and <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the ship out and {{around to the other}} side of the island," [...] replied the first mate. [...] "He wants us to be lively, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Helen, 'there {{used to be}} {{teachers}} {{enough without}} me, but now Lizzie <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a class, I suppose I must, because it is my duty; but really I do not think I can ever like it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She got lighthearted and happy, {{and went}} to the cradles, and spent {{what was left of the}} night [...] "practicing." [...] She would give her own child a light pat and say humbly, [...] "Lay still, Marse Tom," [...] then give the real Tom a pat and say with severity, [...] "Lay still, Chambers! Does you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> somep'n to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't try, {{unless you}} <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it back," [...] Trent said, strolling to the sideboard. [...] "Lord, how those City chaps can guzzle! Not {{a drop of}} {{champagne}} left. Two unopened bottles though! Here, stick 'em in your bag and take 'em to the missis, young man. I paid for the lot, so there's no use leaving any. Now clear out as quick as you can. I'm off!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Marston {{was silent}} for a moment or two. Mabel's trust moved him and he was half embarrassed. Then he said: [...] "There's a remark of yours I can't let go. No ground you think you ought to venture on is awkward to us. Very well. You don't approve Harry's marrying Flora, but what line d'you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take?</b> I can't give him up and you're not going to give up your friend. It wouldn't be like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I do {{not like}} thee, Dr. Fell; the reason why I cannot tell," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Foker; [...] "and he wants <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> as my head man. Blanche <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him. Why does Miss Amory like him so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So," [...] she said, {{when the}} {{children}} had gone home, [...] "I thought you <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Mara under my care. I was going to begin and teach her some marking stitches, and you put her up to studying Latin. I don't understand you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] he said, frankly condemning {{that former}} self. [...] "Dad needs <b>me.</b> He <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> charge here--to be a man. I'm back now. It's {{good to be}} home. I never was worth much. Lord! I hope I don't {{disappoint}} him again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't comfort you for worlds, my dear. I {{am saying}} this to {{distress}} you. But since I have worked that love-business over, {{it seems to}} me much less a one-part play, and if I could get a manager to take a fancy to it I could have my own way with it much better; at least, he wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> all the good things out of the other characters' mouths and stuff them into Haxard's." ...|$|E
6000|$|Johnny Eames {{cannot be}} called unlucky in that matter of his annual holiday, seeing {{that he was}} allowed to leave London in October, a month during which few chose to own that they remain in town. For myself, I always regard May as the best month for holiday-making; but then no Londoner cares to be absent in May. Young Eames, though he lived in Burton Crescent and had as yet no {{connection}} with the West End, had already learned his lesson in this respect. [...] "Those fellows in the big room <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> May," [...] he had said to his friend Cradell. [...] "They must think I'm uncommon green." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I can't go back yet; I {{must answer}} your {{question}} first. But are you really so very simple as to suppose that I don't see straight through you and your letter? You know that the major's difficulty is our opportunity as well as I do; but you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the responsibility of making the first proposal, don't you? Suppose I take it in your own roundabout way? Suppose I say, 'Pray don't ask me how I propose inflaming Mr. Armadale and extinguishing Miss Milroy; the question is so shockingly abrupt I really can't answer it. Ask me, instead, {{if it is the}} modest ambition of my life to become Miss Milroy's governess?' Yes, if you please, Mrs. Oldershaw, and if you will assist me by becoming my reference.|$|E
6000|$|Kelley {{saw that}} it was {{necessary}} to go the whole way, and he said, quietly: [...] "That was all fixed up yesterday. You see, he wanted to save your mother and you, and he came <b>to</b> me--and <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him in as a partner, and--I did it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would do}} {{anything}} she could, poor, dear soul. I have not told you yet--she <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> all her savings--her three hundred pounds. I tell her {{to set up a}} little school. It will be hard for her to go into a new family now she has been so long with us." ...|$|R
5000|$|The emperor <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the {{offensive}} ... but his Majesty does {{not realize that}} the smallest movement in these parts expends quantities of resources and of horses ... To make a requisition on the poorest village we have to send a detachment of 200 men and, {{to be able to}} live, we have to scatter over distances. Marshal August Marmont ...|$|R
6000|$|So had I, only {{of another}} kind. I really thought I should have expired in my tracks {{with the effort}} of keeping my {{enjoyment}} strictly to myself. I saw what had happened. The Museum is lit by electric light. To turn it on one has to shoot the bolt of the door, which, like the handle, is made of metal. It is on the killing two birds with one stone principle. You lock yourself in and light yourself up with one movement. It was plain that the current had gone wrong somehow, run amock, as it were. Mellish meanwhile, instead of being warned by Gerard's fate, had followed his example, and tried to turn the handle. His jump, though quite a creditable effort, fell short of Gerard's by some six inches. I began {{to feel as if}} some sort of round game were going on. I hoped that they would not <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a hand. I also hoped that the thing would continue for a good while longer. The success of the piece certainly warranted the prolongation of its run. But here I was disappointed. The disturbance had attracted another spectator, Blaize, the science and chemistry master. The matter was hastily explained to him in all its bearings. There was Bradshaw entombed within the Museum, with every prospect of death by starvation, unless he could support life {{for the next few years}} on the two stuffed rats and the case of butterflies. The authorities did not see their way to adding a human specimen (youth's size) to the treasures in the Museum, so--how was he to be got out? ...|$|E
5000|$|Senators manager Mickey Vernon later {{wanted to}} make a change, {{reportedly}} asking the pitcher: [...] "Your arm okay? You sure you don't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you out?", to which Cheney replied [...] [...]|$|E
5000|$|.....Chileansraped {{and killed}} my women and murdered my sons and impaled my women. How {{is that you}} Colonel do not <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> arms when I have been treated this way? -A Mapuche chief to Gregorio Urrutia after the {{uprising}} ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{they will}} be always <b>wanting</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the chair," [...] said he, in a deplorable voice that made the others laugh in spite of themselves; {{and he was so}} {{grateful}} to his mother for staying in his house, and letting him remain in his regiment, that he seemed to have quite forgotten that the power was in his own hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "The servants," [...] he stated, [...] "with the tenantry and others, {{had been}} all {{regularly}} enrolled and mustered, and they <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> arms also. But I'll ride in nae siccan troop--they little ken'd Andrew that asked him. I'll fight when I like mysell, but it sall neither be for the hure o' Babylon, nor any hure in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if that isn't John Drew all over! I {{suspected}} {{he was at}} the bottom of it as soon as I laid my eyes on that animal. John Drew is a cousin of mine. He's been living out at Poplar Valley and he writes me that he has gone out west, and <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> 'old Nap.' I suppose that is the horse. He says that Nap is getting old and not much use for work and he couldn't bear the thought of shooting him or selling him to someone who might ill-treat him, so he <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him and be kind to him for old times' sake. John and I were just like brother and sister when we were children. If this isn't like him nothing ever was. He was always doing odd things and thinking they were all right. And now he's off west and here is the horse. If it were a cat or a dog--but a horse!" ...|$|R
