500|$|Brian Lowry, {{reviewing}} the two-part premiere for Variety, felt that giving Atwell her own television series was [...] "a pretty smart bet" [...] by Marvel, {{and he called}} the episodes [...] "considerable fun". He noted the period setting as contributing to this, and positively mentioned the score by composer Christopher Lennertz. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "the show isn't as retro-stylish as it thinks it is ... the first hour of Agent Carter feels like an above-average episode of Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", noting that it tonally aims for His Girl Friday, Dick Tracy, and Alias ("A tough tonal mixture on a weekly broadcast budget, but also an ambition worth pursuing"), but praised Atwell's performance, calling her [...] "a delight" [...] and [...] "firing on all cylinders". Franich was negative about what he saw to be common MCU tropes, notably [...] "Somebody named Stark invented something dangerous; everyone wants an All-Important Glowing Thing; there's an implicit promise that nothing <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> for weeks/years to come." [...] Though he was wary about the series being forced {{to contribute to the}} rest of the MCU, he did note that [...] "Agent Carter feels pleasantly segmented off from the greater Marvel Machinery".|$|E
500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment I am worried because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think you can draw conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say too much about the season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm sure at some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which I attended at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so far it has been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. I took them together again. I think at some stage it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved.</b> I am a patient man." ...|$|E

I do not enter into the question now in detail.

2500|$|In 2005, the RCMP {{launched}} project E-PANA which focussed {{upon the}} unsolved murders and disappearances {{of young women}} along Highway 16 throughout the past thirty-seven years. E-PANA sought to discover {{if there was a}} single serial killer at work or a multitude of killers operating along the highway. The unit investigated nine cases in 2006, but by 2007 its caseload had doubled to eighteen. The victims involved within the E-PANA investigation followed the criteria of being female, participating in a high risk lifestyle, known to hitchhike and were last seen or their bodies were discovered within a mile from Highway 16, Highway 97 and Highway 5. In the 2009/2010 year, E-PANA received over five million dollars in annual funding but has since dramatically declined due to budget cutbacks; receiving only $806,109 for the 2013/2014 year. In 2013, Craig Callens, the RCMP Deputy Commissioner, warned that further budget reductions from the provincial government would greatly affect the Highway of Tears investigation. A 2014 Freedom of Information request stated that the task force had dropped from seventy officers to twelve officers over the past few years. [...] E-PANA is responsible for solving the murder of sixteen-year-old Colleen MacMillen, who was killed in 1974 by the now deceased American serial killer Bobby Jack Fowler. E-PANA now considers Fowler a suspect in the murders of two other highway victims, Gale Weys and Pamela Darlington, both of whom were killed in the 1970s. In 2014, investigations by E-PANA and the Provincial Unsolved Homicide Unit brought murder charges against Garry Taylor Handlen for the death of twelve-year-old Monica Jack in 1978. E-PANA is still investigating the remaining unsolved cases although it is unlikely that all the murders and disappearances <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved.</b>|$|E

40|$|Muscle {{stress is}} a disease {{resulting}} from performing too much effort, sport fitness or high blood pressure problem. This paper focuses on the mathematical modeling of crack propagation that applies on the human muscle stress. The modeling describes {{the relationship between the}} temperature and crack propagation among targeted region, node and element.

The initial stage of crack propagation that leads to an initiation of crack propagation is being modeled satisfactorily the discretization of finite element method (FEM) of the specific region.
