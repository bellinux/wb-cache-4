5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good <b>work</b> <b>relations</b> support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} {{the notion of}} <b>relation</b> <b>work</b> will be put forward to {{describe}} efforts of connecting people and artefacts in a multitude of ways as part of facilitating global interaction and coordination in an engineering firm. <b>Relation</b> <b>work</b> {{can be seen as}} a parallel to the concept of articulation work. Articulation work describes efforts of coordination necessary in cooperative work, but, arguably, focuses mainly on taskspecific aspects of cooperative work. As a supplement, the concept of <b>relation</b> <b>work</b> focuses on the fundamental relational aspect of cooperative <b>work.</b> <b>Relation</b> <b>work</b> forms the fundamental activities of creating socio-technical connections between people and artefacts during collaborative activities required to create and enact the human and electronic network and engage with articulation work in cooperative engagements. The concept of <b>relation</b> <b>work</b> is applied within an ethnographic study of War Room meetings in a Global engineering firm. It is argued that <b>relation</b> <b>work</b> is a perquisite for other activities such as articulation <b>work.</b> <b>Relation</b> <b>work</b> is described in a number of dimensions, including connecting people with people, people with artefacts, and artefacts with other artefacts...|$|R

2500|$|According to Surinder Jodhka, {{the state}} of Punjab with a Sikh {{majority}} has the [...] "largest proportion of scheduled caste population in India". The practice of caste system, states Jodhka, is decried by Sikhism, but like Hindus, Christians and Muslims, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab. The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, [...] "have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or dalits; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras {{they would not be}} permitted to cook or serve langar." [...] The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity. According to Jodhka, due to economic mobility in contemporary Punjab, castes no longer mean an inherited occupation nor are <b>work</b> <b>relations</b> tied to a single location.|$|E

Complementing previous theoretical analysis using quantum channels, we show that the nonequilibrium <b>work</b> <b>relation</b> remains valid in this situation, and we test this assertion experimentally using a system engineered from an optically trapped ion.
