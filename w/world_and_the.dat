5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular contact with the outside <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Brütal Legend was {{generally}} well received by game reviewers, praising Schafer's vision and {{writing of the}} heavy metal-inspired <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> performances of the voice cast, particularly Black and Osbourne. Some felt that the hybrid gameplay of action and real-time strategy games did not mix well, however, blaming console control limitations and missing features normally found in games of either genre.|$|E
5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between the real <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E

The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do so. Many of the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version.|$|E
