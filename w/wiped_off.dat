The churches have not imposed this as an obligatory rule, and the ashes may even be <b>wiped</b> <b>off</b> immediately after receiving them; but some Christian leaders, such as Lutheran pastor Richard P. Bucher and Catholic bishop Kieran Conry, recommend it as a public profession of faith. Rev. Morgan Guyton, a Methodist pastor and leader in the Red-Letter Christian movement, encourages Christians to wear their ashed cross throughout the day as an exercise of religious freedom.|$|E

500|$|According to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based David Bowie, fuelled by an [...] "astronomic" [...] cocaine {{habit and}} {{subsisting}} {{on a diet}} of peppers and milk, spent much of 1975–76 [...] "in a state of psychic terror". Stories—mostly from one interview, pieces of which {{found their way into}} Playboy and Rolling Stone—circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his semen stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from The Rolling Stones, and living in morbid fear of fellow Aleister Crowley aficionado Jimmy Page. Bowie would later say of L.A., [...] "The fucking place should be <b>wiped</b> <b>off</b> the face of the earth".|$|E

[...] However, St-Pierre offered Penn a rematch in the summer that Penn verbally accepted but is unlikely to happen due to the fact they have both since been scheduled for title defenses.|$|E

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be <b>wiped</b> <b>off</b> the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster.

The tornado then crossed the Mulberry Fork again, moving into Blount County, where it crossed Interstate 65, before crossing the Mulberry Fork into Cullman County southwest of Garden City. It quickly crossed the river again (the seventh crossing), moving back into Blount County. As it continued to the south-southwest of Garden City, it straddled the Mulberry Fork before finally moving solidly into Blount County and toward Blountsville. On the southeast side of Blountsville, the tornado caused high-end EF2 damage to multiple well-built brick and slab foundation homes, one of which had some exterior walls collapse. The storm continued to the northeast and out of Blountsville, where two additional homes sustained high-end EF3 damage.
