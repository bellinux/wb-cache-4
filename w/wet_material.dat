50|$|Finer {{particle}} sizes (>40 µm) {{are able}} to be separated with the gyratory separator than with a trommel screen. The size of the gyratory screen separator can be adjusted through removable trays, whereas the trommel screen is usually fixed. Gyratory separators can also separate dry and <b>wet</b> <b>materials</b> like trommel screens. However, {{it is common for}} the gyratory separators to separate either dry or <b>wet</b> <b>materials</b> only. This is because there are different parameters for the gyratory screen to have the best separation efficiency. Therefore, two separators would be required for the separation of dry and <b>wet</b> <b>materials,</b> while one trommel screen {{would be able to do}} the same job.|$|R

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} techniques {{that are used}} as a standard method characterize micro- and nano-structured materials have been extended for observing <b>wet</b> <b>materials.</b> Most of the microstructures of solid materials, such as ceramics, metals, polymers and composites in their dry conditions, are characterized by electron microscopy. However, the observation methods for hydrous materials have still been under development because the wet condition is not suitable for the electron microscopy under high vacuum conditions. This difficulty in the characterization of the hydrous materials is a barrier to the research progress related to <b>wet</b> <b>materials</b> processing. 　In this review paper, developed observation methods {{with the aid of}} a hydrophilic ionic liquid (IL) for various kinds of hydrated materials are reported. By the developed observation methods, the characterization of hydrous materials, such as seaweed, agar gel and a HAp green body, is enabled and extended to a range of related fields. Based on the interaction between water molecules and hydrophilic IL, the mechanism for the observation of <b>wet</b> <b>materials</b> using the hydrophilic IL has been clarified and the molecular dynamics of the IL and solvents have been studied. In addition, an IL-inorganic composite material was successfully fabricated by mixing of IL and montmorillonite clay in the proper ratio, which suggests possibility to invent novel electron conductive transparent thin films...|$|R

40|$|The {{appearance}} of many natural materials is largely {{influenced by the}} environment in which they are situated. Capturing the effects of such environmental factors is essential for producing realistic synthetic images. In this work, we model the changes of appearance due to one such environmental factor, the presence of water or other liquids. <b>Wet</b> <b>materials</b> can look darker, brighter, or more specular {{depending on the type of}} material and the viewing conditions. These differences in appearance are caused by a combination of the presence of liquid on the surface and inside the material. To simulate both of these conditions we have developed an approach that combines a reflection model for surface water with subsurface scattering. We demonstrate our approach with a variety of example scenes, showcasing many characteristic appearances of <b>wet</b> <b>materials.</b> Keywords: appearance, subsurface scattering, participating media, global illumination, Monte Carlo, rendering, ray tracing. 1 Introduction [...] ...|$|R

50|$|However more {{material}} can be screened at once for a vibrating screen {{compared to a}} trommel screen. This is because {{only one part of}} the screen area of the trommel screen is utilised during the screening process whilst the entire screen is used for a vibrating screen. Trommel screens are also more susceptible to plugging and blinding, especially when different sized screen apertures are in series. Plugging is when material larger than the aperture may become stuck or wedged into the apertures and then may be forced through which is undesirable. Blinding is when <b>wet</b> <b>material</b> clump up and stick {{to the surface of the}} screen. The vibrations in the vibrating screens reduce the chance of plugging and blinding.|$|E
5000|$|Dry rawmills are {{the normal}} {{technology}} installed today, allowing minimization of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In general, cement raw materials are mainly quarried, and so contain {{a certain amount}} of natural moisture. Attempting to grind a <b>wet</b> <b>material</b> is unsuccessful because an intractable [...] "mud" [...] forms. On the other hand, {{it is much easier to}} dry a fine material than a coarse one, because large particles hold moisture deep in their structure. It is therefore usual to simultaneously dry and grind the materials in the rawmill. A hot-air furnace may be used to supply this heat, but usually hot waste gases from the kiln are used. For this reason, the rawmill is usually placed close to the kiln preheater. Types of dry rawmill include ball mills, roller mills and hammer mills.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{determination}} of structural properties of a material is important before its practical application. The analysis data provide us some information whether {{the material is}} suitable for application or not. The prospective applications of soft and <b>wet</b> <b>materials</b> explore the new era in the material science as an industrial material especially for medical applications. Shape memory gels (SMGs) are one kind of unique soft and <b>wet</b> <b>materials</b> having shape recovery property which is suitable for medical application such as bandages for broken bones or making optical lens and so on. In the present study, scanning microscopic light scattering (SMILS) is used to characterize the internal structure of shape memory gels. It is observed that the SMGs are transparent at room temperature, mechanically elastic and ductile as well as thermoresponsive despite the high water contents. We confirm the mesh size in nanometer scale of the internal network structure and the critical behavior of the SMG by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The mechanical properties also have been characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) ...|$|R
50|$|In powder two {{different}} dimensions in the mixing {{process can be}} determined: convective mixing and intensive mixing. In the case of convective mixing material in the mixer is transported from one location to another. This type of mixing leads to a less ordered state inside the mixer, the components that must be mixed are distributed over the other components. With progressing time the mixture becomes more randomly ordered. After a certain mixing time the ultimate random state is reached. Usually this type of mixing is applied for free-flowing and coarse materials. Possible threat during macro mixing is the de-mixing of the components, since differences in size, shape or density of the different particles can lead to segregation. In the convective mixing range, Hosokawa has several processes available from silo mixers to horizontal mixers and conical mixers.When materials are cohesive, which {{is the case with}} e.g. fine particles and also with <b>wet</b> <b>material,</b> convective mixing is no longer sufficient to obtain a randomly ordered mixture. The relative strong inter-particle forces form lumps, which are not broken up by the mild transportation forces in the convective mixer. To decrease the lump size additional forces are necessary; i.e. more energy intensive mixing is required. These additional forces can either be impact forces or shear forces.|$|E
40|$|Several {{types of}} {{sintered}} porous silica supports for the immobilization of protease were developed. In the three technical methods (slip formation, metal pattern press, and granulation), the granulation method {{was the most}} suitable one. As the silica powder materials, a dry material, a <b>wet</b> <b>material</b> and the hybrid of wet and organic materials were investigated. The dry material produced porous spaces which were assumed that three spheres touched one another (No. 001 and No. 021). Granules produced with the <b>wet</b> <b>material</b> gave a stratified structure because of the <b>wet</b> <b>material</b> itself being cohesive granule and flat form (No. 095). In the case of dry material, the apparent porosity was 47 - 66 % (No. 001 and No. 021). On the other hand, the <b>wet</b> <b>material</b> gave apparent porosity of 75 % and {{it was better than}} that of dry material (No. 095). The hybrid of wet and organic material produced larger apparent porosity than that of <b>wet</b> <b>material</b> alone (No. 720 - 940). The activities of immobilized enzyme on these porous silica supports were also investigated, and No. 095 gave the highest value, and No. 720 the second.
