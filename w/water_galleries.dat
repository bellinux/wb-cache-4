5000|$|Antonio Rodríguez Medero (1712 - April 10, 1760) was {{the mayor}} of San Antonio, Texas in 1741.

50|$|Following the {{take-over}} of Triumph by Leyland Motors in 1967 Spen King {{was placed}} in charge of product development at Triumph. The V8's Bosch fuel injection was running into numerous difficulties in development and King was unable to convince Leyland to divert extra funds to Triumph to solve the problems. Instead, King dropped the fuel injection in favour of twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetors. To maintain the required power output the capacity was increased to 3-litres, which then entailed modification to the Stag's other drivetrain systems included the gearbox, back axle and brakes. This relatively 'last-minute' capacity increase was achieved by expanding the bore of the engine instead of the stroke, which explains the Triumph V8's unusual 'oversquare' internal dimensions. This widening of the bore also meant that the <b>water</b> <b>galleries</b> surrounding the cylinders were narrower than originally planned, thus creating one of the engine's major weaknesses (see below).|$|E

40|$|Serious damage {{may occur}} to {{concrete}} hydraulic structures, such as <b>water</b> <b>galleries,</b> spillways, and stilling basins, {{due to the}} abrasive erosion caused {{by the presence of}} solid particles in the flow. This underlines the importance of being capable in providing characterization of the concrete {{from the point of view}} of its vulnerability to abrasive erosion, in order to improve the design of the structure and the material selection. Nevertheless, the existing apparatus for concrete abrasive erosion testing are either far from allowing realistic simulation of the actual environment in which this phenomenon occurs, or show a large degree of complexity and cost. An alternative method has been developed with the aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). CFD was first employed to verify the effectiveness of a new laboratory equipment. Afterwards, a parameter has been introduced which, by successful comparison against preliminary experiments, proved suitable to quantify the effect of the fluid dynamic conditions on the concrete abrasive erosion, thereby opening the way to CFD-based customization of the apparatus. In the future, the synergy of numerical and physical modelling will allow developing predictive models for concrete erosion, making it possible to reliably simulate real structures...|$|E

[...] Proceedings of the International Congress on Science and Technology for the Conservation of Cultural Heritage, held 2 - 5 october, Santiago de Compostela, España. Paranhos {{constitutes}} one of {{the main}} <b>water</b> <b>galleries</b> excavated in the granite substratum of Porto City (Portugal) to gather the groundwater for public use during the past six centuries. The interest of this water gallery is double: a) Cultural Heritage and scientific value, b) Underground geoturism. A multidisciplinary research to study the microclimatology, geochemistry, mineralogy and geomicrobiology of the Paranhos catchwork galleries is currently in progress. The characterization of the main environmental parameters (air-rock temperature, relative humidity, CO 2, 222 Rn, etc.) in the internal atmosphere would allow the establishment of: a) Fluid-rock interactions and development of a physical-chemical model of air-water-rock, as a base to define their relations with unusual mineral formations and microbial communities b) Microclimatic parameters and determination of effective radioactive dose for visitors based on 222 Rn studies, as potential use as underground geotourism site under safe conditions.

40|$|AbstractTraining in {{different}} {{scientific and technical}} disciplines has always been supported by the relationship between “theory and practice”. This paper focuses {{on the need to}} take this fact into consideration once again with greater intensity regarding the current training in mining engineering schools. Subjects related to groundwater and geology on volcanic islands should take advantage of any existing underground hydraulic infrastructures, such as <b>water</b> <b>galleries.</b> In the Canary Islands’ archipelago, there is a unique and extensive network of galleries, tunnels and stunning waterways covering thousands of kilometres. There are examples of horizontal drilling of 6, 500 m, and vertical wells up to 600 m in depth on the island of Tenerife. Consequently, the Canary Islands are a natural laboratory for the study of earth sciences to be used and exploited in teaching; however, this aspect is hardly taken advantage of in current training programmes. Although the access to such infrastructure entails in some cases safety risks, the fact remains that with adequate planning, selection and adaptation of the best infrastructures and proper evaluation and prevention measures based on the techniques used in mining safety, they could be exploited in teaching at local, national and international level due to their outstanding educational potential...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for constructing 2 D maps of enclosed un- derwater structures using an underwater robot equipped {{with only a}} 2 D scanning sonar, compass and depth sensor. In particular, no motion model or odometry is used. To accomplish this, a two step offline SLAM method is applied {{to a set of}} stationary sonar scans. In the first step, the change in position of the robot between each consecutive pair of stationary sonar scans is estimated using a particle filter. This set of pair wise relative scan positions is used to create an estimate of each scan’s position within a global coordinate frame using a weighted least squares fit that optimizes consistency between the relative positions of the entire set of scans. In the second step of the method, scans and their estimated positions act as inputs to a mapping algorithm that constructs 2 D octree-based evidence grid maps of the site. This work is motivated by a multi-year archaeological project that aims to construct maps of ancient water storage systems, i. e. cisterns, on the islands of Malta and Gozo. Cisterns, wells, and <b>water</b> <b>galleries</b> within fortresses, churches and homes operated as water storage systems as far back as 2000 B. C. Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) these water storage systems located around the islands were explored while collecting video, still images, sonar, depth, and compass measurements. Data gathered from 5 different expeditions has produced maps of over 90 sites. Presented are results from applying the new mapping method to both a swimming pool of known size and to several of the previously unexplored water storage systems...|$|E

40|$|The karst cave ‘Vlychada’of Diros, one of {{the oldest}} show caves in Peloponnese, sustains {{extended}} phototrophic biofilms on various substrata – on rocks inside the cave including speleothems, and especially near the artificial lighting installation (‘Lampenflora’). After a survey of the main abiotic parameters (Photosynthetically Active Radiation -PAR, Temperature -T, Relative Humidity -RH, Carbon Dioxide -CO 2) three clusters of sampling sites were revealed according to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) : i) the <b>water</b> <b>gallery</b> section predominately influenced by CO 2, ii) the dry passages influenced by RH and PAR, and iii) the area by the cave exit at the dry section influenced by temperature. The collected samples from the <b>water</b> <b>gallery</b> section and the dry passages of the cave revealed a total of 43 taxa of Cyanobacteria, with the unicellular/colonial forms being the most abundant. The applied non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling Ordination (nMDS) of the cumulative species composition showed a clear distinction between the <b>water</b> <b>gallery</b> section and the dry passages of the cave. Further comparison with previous data from other wild caves of Peloponnese (‘Kastria’, ‘Francthi’, and ‘Selinitsa’) was conducted revealing a distinction between the show cave and the wild ones. Apart from the human impact on cave ecosystems – through aesthetic alteration (‘greening’) of cave decorations by the ‘Lampenflora’, and by the cleaning treatments and restoration projects on the speleothems – identification of the organisms constituting the ‘Lampenflora’ might provide taxonomically and ecologically significant taxa. ...|$|R
