During the Mission Status Briefing, lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that a sample {{was taken from the}} Water Processor Assembly that contained 10% urine and 90% condensate, and would be returned to the ground with the shuttle. Kerrick noted that if activation of the system continued on schedule, a sample from the potable <b>water</b> <b>dispenser</b> would be taken on flight day eleven. The ground crew continued to troubleshoot the Urine Processor Assembly, looking at whether there is a sensor touching part of the system’s centrifuge as it rotates, which might be causing it to slow down.|$|E

Sayid Jamal Mubariz finished first, becoming the first rapper to do so, with Zulala Hashemi finishing second, making her the farthest placed female contestant. The top 3 contestants were awarded various prizes, with Mubariz winning the motorcycle, Hashemi winning an air conditioner and <b>water</b> <b>dispenser,</b> and top 3 finalists, Mubariz, Hashemi, and Babak Mohammadi winning a week long trip to Almaty, Kazakhstan. After being declared the winner, Mubariz decided to give the trophy to Hashemi, due to her placement in the show, as well as showing respect for women in Afghanistan, due to the dangers and hardships they face everyday in the country.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the food}} aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags. Cans are rare because they are heavy and {{expensive}} to transport. Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew, and taste is reduced in microgravity. Therefore, effort is made to make the food more palatable, such as using more spices than in regular cooking. The crew looks forward {{to the arrival of}} any ships from Earth, as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables. Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs. Sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment. Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley. The galley features two food warmers, a refrigerator added in November 2008, and a <b>water</b> <b>dispenser</b> that provides both heated and unheated water. Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption. Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.|$|E

In the late 19th century, bacteriologists found staphylococci, streptococci, coli bacilli, Loeffler's bacillus, and other bacteria in samples of holy water taken from a church in Sassari, Italy. In a study performed in 1995, 13 samples were taken when a burn patient acquired a bacterial infection after exposure to holy water. The samples in that study were shown to have a [...] "wide range of bacterial species", some of which could cause infection in humans. During the swine flu epidemic of 2009, Bishop John Steinbock of Fresno, California recommended that [...] "holy water should not be in the fonts" [...] due to fear of spreading infections.

MethodsIn 2013, twelve middle schools in the San Francisco Bay Area participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial in which they received 6 weeks of promotional activities, received provision of cups, and were assigned to 1 of 2 cafeteria water delivery systems: <b>water</b> <b>dispensers</b> or bottleless <b>water</b> coolers (or schools served as a control).

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the occurrence of yeasts and filamentous fungi in drinking water as well as to investigate their correlation with the indicator bacteria of faecal pollution. Yeasts were detected in 36. 6 % and 11. 6 % of the bottled mineral on <b>water</b> <b>dispensers</b> and tap <b>water</b> samples from municipal system, respectively. Twenty-one (35. 0 %) of bottled mineral water and two (3. 3 %) of tap water samples were positive for filamentous fungi. For bottled mineral water 12 (20. 0 %) of 60 samples were positive for total coliform, compared with 3 (5. 0 %) out of 60 samples from tap water. The mineral <b>water</b> from <b>dispensers</b> was more contaminated than tap water. Strains belonging to the genera Candida identified to the species level were C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata and C. albicans. Thus, bottled mineral <b>water</b> from <b>water</b> <b>dispensers</b> and tap <b>water</b> could be considered a possible transmission route for filamentous fungi and yeasts, and could constitute a potential health hazard, mainly to immunocompromised indivuals...|$|R
