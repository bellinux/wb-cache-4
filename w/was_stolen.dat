5000|$|A certain gift may be {{particularly}} sought after, prolonging the game (almost indefinitely). To address this, two related variations have been widely adopted: First, no gift may <b>be</b> <b>stolen</b> more than once per turn.

Because of this, a second common variation states that after a gift has <b>been</b> <b>stolen</b> {{a certain number of}} times (usually three) it is [...] "frozen" [...] (or [...] "dead" [...] or [...] "safe") and cannot <b>be</b> <b>stolen</b> again. Another version dictates that in order to steal a gift, the stealer has to take a shot of alcohol for every time the gift has already <b>been</b> <b>stolen,</b> including the current time.|$|R
