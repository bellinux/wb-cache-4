50|$|In general {{there are}} two main systems of {{preparing}} fiber for yarn: the <b>worsted</b> <b>system</b> and the woollen system. The <b>worsted</b> <b>system</b> is defined by the removal of short fibers by combing and top preparation by gilling. In the woollen system short fibers are retained, and {{it may or may not}} involve combing.|$|E
50|$|The Noble comb is {{no longer}} used in <b>worsted</b> <b>system</b> as {{technology}} is inefficient. Noble combing may have uses for woollen system, or long fibers 250 mm+. The predominant technology for all fibers is the French comb system. A cotton comber is scaled and simplified mechanically version of a rectilinear comb relative to a mean fiber length (similar to Naismith comber). This scaled version of wool comb {{can be seen in}} stroke of the components used in a cotton comber. The scaled down has the purpose of accommodating fiber length and fiber physics requirements. The same scaled-up version of a comb {{can be seen in the}} way flax is combed.|$|E
5000|$|The Natural Fibre Company scours, cards, {{spins and}} dyes fibre on both woollen and <b>worsted</b> <b>systems,</b> working in batches upwards of 20 kilos. There are also organic {{production}} runs.|$|R
50|$|The Bradford system (also {{known as}} the English <b>Worsted</b> Yarn Count <b>System</b> or {{spinning}} count or Bradford count) {{is a way to}} assess the quality of wool.|$|R
50|$|The S numbers {{originated}} in England, where the worsted spinning process was invented and {{arose from the}} <b>worsted</b> yarn count <b>system</b> for stating the fineness of yarn. The worsted count (also known as the Bradford count) {{was the number of}} 560 yard m lengths (hanks) of worsted yarn that 1 lb of wool yields. The finer the wool, the more yarn and the higher the count.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{bleaching}} of alpaca tops and dyeing of bleached alpaca tops/yarns {{on the quality of}} tops and yarns. A dark brown alpaca top was bleached with hydrogen peroxide. Two bleaching methods were tried for effectiveness of color removal. A portion of each bleached top was dyed after bleaching. Color parameters were examined for unbleached, bleached and bleached/dyed tops, these tops were then converted into yarns of different twist levels and counts using a <b>worsted</b> spinning <b>system.</b> Some of the bleached yarn from each bleaching method was dyed in a package dye vat to compare the difference of top dyeing versus yarn package dyeing on yarn quality. Fiber diameter, yarn strength, yarn evenness, yarn hairiness and fiber degradation were tested to examine {{the effects of}} bleaching and dyeing on these properties at top and yarn stages. A processing route for bleaching and dyeing alpaca fiber was recommended. <br /...|$|R
30|$|Polyester/wool (90 / 10) yarn of 56 s Nm (17.9 Tex) with 890 twist per meter was {{produced}} for the study. Polyester fibre of 1.4 denier and length 56  mm and merino wool of average diameter 21  μm (4.08 denier) and 70  mm length {{was used for}} spinning of yarn on <b>worsted</b> ring spinning <b>system.</b> Single jersey knitted fabric (WPI[*]×[*]CPI[*]=[*] 35 [*]×[*] 58, GSM[*]=[*] 135, Tightness factor[*]=[*] 14.9, Loop length[*]=[*] 2.82  mm) was made on Delha socks knitting machine of diameter 8.9  cm using 22 gauge. Protease enzyme was used in both alkaline (ALPE) & acidic (ACPE) medium.|$|R
40|$|In this minireview it is {{to analyze}} the {{physical}} attributes that determine the comfort of fabrics made of South American Camelid fibers (Lama and Alpaca), discuss the effect on their textile value and evaluate an possible approache on their possible mechanical solutions. Taking the distribution of all fibers {{do not respond to}} a normal distribution, but the different fiber types identified by the type of medulla, they do respond to a normal distribution. While emphasis has always been on mean fiber diameter, the fiber frequency exceeding 30 microns (objectionable fibres) has a key role in quality. This is essential for light fabrics, where the effect of prickle plays a critical part in consumer´s choice. Dehairing, as a mechanical way, provides an immediate solution, though excessive fiber breakage should be addressed. It is concluded that the textile fiber quality of South American Camelids is promissory if the presence of objectionable fibers is solved, resulting in a tolerable frequency for consumers (< 3 %). This implies a true paradigm shift with regard to the classic textile processing of Alpaca and Lama fibers (from <b>worsted</b> to woolen <b>system).</b> This would enhance the fiber softness to touch, together with other important features that would render the fiber price more competitive...|$|R
40|$|The exposed {{carbonate}} rocks aged from Sinian to Mid-Triassic Periods cover {{an area of}} 500, 000 km 2 in south-west China. In karst {{areas with}} spectacular landscapes characterized by magnificent tower karst and conical karst, rare surface drainage systems and prevalent subsurface drainage systems, the environment is ecologically very fragile. The rapid increase of population, over deforested and cultivated lands, <b>worsted</b> the ecological <b>system,</b> causing a higher frequency of draught, flood and various disasters, backward economic development, low living standard of the people. In order to improve the sustainability of the agriculture the experience shows that the following operations should be adopted: (1) serious control of the population increase, emigration, extra labours and improvement of the environmental education of the local inhabitants; (2) terracing of the slopes (shi jala di) as to improve the cultivated land quality, to preserve the water, soil and fertiliser and ameliorate the effective utilisation of the land; (3) development of new rural energies such as the solar energy and gas energy, and expansion of the saving-fuel stoves to reduce the load of bio-energy; (4) reforestation and bounding the hills and mountains; the ecological, economic and fuel forests model has been developed in fengcong-depression areas: the tree species with high ecological, economical and energetic characteristics, should be chosen, such as the bamboo, wild grapes, Sapium rotundifolium etc.; (5) better utilisation of the ram water and karst water resource to solve the water supply problems. The karst landscape is well developed in the 500, 000 km 2 carbonate terrain in Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, west Hunan and south Sichuan provinces in south-west China, where 100 million habitants live (Song, 1997). The large population and its high density, serious deforestation, over-cultivation and fragile ecological system make the environmental problems very serious and about 30, 000, 000 people are now very poor. This paper describes the measures to improve the ecological and sustainable development of the agriculture in the karst areas...|$|R
