The Arsenal was the largest building project of the young Kaiser Franz Joseph I in his first years of reign, and served to consolidate his neoabsolutist position of power, as opposed to the revolutionary Vienna of 1848.It was Danish architect Theophil Hansen who designed what was then referred to as the <b>weapons</b> <b>museum.</b> The museum was completed on 8 May 1856, just six years after the beginning of construction (15 April 1850), making it the oldest museum building [...] - [...] planned and executed as such [...] - [...] in Austria.At the time of its construction, the Arsenal was located outside the outer ring of fortifications; in 1850, however, the area was incorporated into Vienna along with the original Favoriten (4th District; as of 1874, 10th District; since 1938, the Arsenal forms part of Vienna's 3rd District). Along the south-west side of the Arsenal ran the Vienna-Raab railway, for which the main Vienna station, the Wiener Bahnhof had been opened in 1848.|$|E

This scientific forum continued the tradition of conferences held in the Moscow Kremlin Museums in 1999 - 2007. The participants of this forum discussed a number of priority topics for the studies of the weapon collection history in the Kremlin. These topics were relevant to the national and world studies of weaponology as a whole. In addition to general issues of the history of arms and armour, a number of reports were devoted to the functioning of the historical centers of arms production, weapons collections in Russia and abroad, particular items, as well as the activities of gunsmiths, designers of weapons. The conference was attended by representatives of more than 20 Russian and foreign museums, 14 academic and university research centers and institutions, private collectors and lovers of ancient weapons. During the three days of the conference 36 reports were presented and discussed. Organizers of the conference highlighted a number of reports including new attributions of the items from the Kremlin collections. The conference program is available on the official website of the Moscow Kremlin State Museums. The conference results were published as a collection of proceedings. The weaponology forum in the Kremlin will be held annually. The Moscow Kremlin Museums invite researchers of historical <b>weapons,</b> <b>museum</b> employees and collectors to the active cooperation...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work is to produce a {{catalogue}} of holdings {{of a collection of}} weeapons and militaria originating in the Orient, which is now owned by the German Historical Museum, the successor to the former Zeughaus (the Berlin Arsenal). This collection was assembled by Prince Carl of Prussia (1801 - 1883), the third son of King Friedrich Wilhelm III (1770 - 1840) and Queen Luise (1776 - 1810). Prince Carl succeeded in building up one of the most extensive and valuable weapons collections in Europe {{and was one of the}} greatest weapons collectors of the 19 th century. Later the Prince Carl's collection was to form the beginning of scholarly collection activity at the Berlin Arsenal. Most of the large weapons collections in Europe are based on the legacies of courts, armouries and hunting arsenals, and contain primarily objects from the Renaissance and the Baroque. Ther Berlin Arsenal however could fall back on such resources only to a moderate degree. The building, which was completed as a military structure in 1730, served as a weapons arsenal for the Prussian state up to the beginning of the 19 th century; it was generally used to store not only the weapons and war wquipment necessary to equip the army, but also material captured in battle. After the founding of the German Reich in 1871, at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm I the Arsenal was converted by Friedrich Hitzig between 1877 and 1881 into a <b>weapons</b> <b>museum,</b> and the site of the Pantheon of the Brandenburger-Prussian army, the Prussian monarchy, and their generals and commander. The former Prussian weapons arsenal thus also became a museum of Prussian history with a significant military historical collection. In the decades that followed, up until World War One, there arose one of the most comprehensive military history collections in the world. As with the other major European arsenals and weapons collections, many outstanding one-of-a-kind items of cultural history and military technology increased from year to year and highlighted various points in the history of weapons and of such collections. After the prince's death in 1883, in accordance with the request set forth in his last will and testament, the entire weapons collection went to the Berlin Arsenal, which thereby acquired all of the items. The acquisition of that very valuable and extensive collection represented a turning point in the history of the Arsenals's collection, since up until then the collection's focal point had been primaily on Brandenburg and, after 1871, on exhibits which were important and worthy of being shown with regard to German history. At that point however, while half of the total of 1151 pieces of weaponry and equipment originated in Europe, 575 of the items came from Asia (Japan, China, Indonesia, India, the Ottoman Empire, Persia, Central Asia) and Africa. The quality and quantity of the prince's collection was exquisite. Today there exist only a very few documents on Prince Carl's life and acquisition strategy. After his death the prince quickly fell into oblivion. As there is no catalogue of oriental holdings yet, this task is a worthwhile and expedient undertaking...|$|E
