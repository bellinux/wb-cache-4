5|$|Gemma Rose Adams aged 25, born in Kesgrave, {{was last}} seen on West End Road in Ipswich, {{where she had been}} living; she {{disappeared}} on 15 November at about 01.15 (UTC). Her body was found on 2 December, in a river at Hintlesham. The first victim found, she <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> but had not been sexually assaulted.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E

500|$|My {{specific}} {{intent is to}} bring attention {{to the millions of}} children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, 'Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' ...|$|E
500|$|The fourth episode {{features}} {{a scene where}} Mark jams his dressing gown {{in the door and}} is forced to hide naked in his new neighbour's flat. This sequence was Moffat's revenge for Bathurst's late arrival at the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London. Moffat threatened that if they ever did a second series he would write a whole episode in which Bathurst <b>was</b> <b>naked.</b> After being mistaken for a flasher, Mark is punched by his neighbour's brother. When he awakens he is confronted by a man (Kerry Shale) in a red polo neck jumper who claims to be [...] "his very best friend". In the fifth episode it transpires that the man, who identifies himself as Dick, is the personification of Mark's penis.|$|E
500|$|The {{installment}} {{was filmed}} {{and set in}} Los Angeles, California, as were all other Awake episodes. During filming of the installment, Isaacs {{thought it would be}} funny to moon down the stairs during a scene in which Hannah and Michael go nude swimming, but stated that it would probably break the Standards and Practices law. Filming of the episode commenced at an actual campus swimming pool for one scene. A lady present during filming asked if Isaacs <b>was</b> <b>naked.</b> Isaacs replied that he was not completely naked, but had a [...] "small piece of material taped over [...] genitals"; the lady said [...] "That's naked," [...] adding [...] "I can see your butt crack." [...] In response, Isaacs [...] "taped a piece of material over [...] butt crack". When the last scene was filmed that day, he ran up the stairs, causing the material—which had been secured only by a piece of sealing tape—to fall off. The woman was [...] "furious". Isaacs thought that the team of Awake would have to withdraw the footage, but was happy to see that part was included in the finished episode.|$|E

500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{arrived at}} the scene at 11:45. His report {{of the crime scene}} described [...] "the deceased lying on her back, with her leg bent at the thigh and knee, with the knee resting {{against the back of the}} seat, and the left thigh running along the edge of the seat with the leg hanging over the edge. The body <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well." [...] The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00a.m.) 5December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: [...] "It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer in a matter of seconds after Jenni Savage left her. He could have been waiting, and seen Jenni leave. It is possible that he was actually sitting in Teresa's car, as we found the nearside [...] door unlocked." ...|$|E
500|$|Larger {{cockatoos}} {{can live}} 30 to 70 years {{depending on the}} species, or occasionally longer, and cockatiels can live for about 20 years. As pets they require a long-term commitment from their owners. Their longevity is considered a positive trait as it reduces instances {{of the loss of}} a pet. The oldest cockatoo in captivity was a Major Mitchell's cockatoo named [...] "Cookie", residing at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which lived to be 83 years old (1933-2016). A salmon-crested cockatoo named 'King Tut' who resided at San Diego Zoo was nearly 69 when he died in 1990 and a palm cockatoo reached 56 in London Zoo in 2000. However, anecdotal reports describe birds of much greater ages. 'Cocky Bennett' of Tom Ugly's Point in Sydney was a celebrated sulphur-crested cockatoo who was reported to have reached an age of 100 years or more. He had lost his feathers and <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> for much of his life. A palm cockatoo was reported to have reached 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, and a little corella that was removed from a nest in central Australia in 1904 was reported still alive in the late 1970s. In February 2010, a white cockatoo named 'Arthur' was claimed to be 90 years old; he had lived with a family for generations in Dalaguete, Cebu, before being taken to Cebu City Zoo.|$|E
500|$|For {{the album}} cover, Barrett painted {{the floor of}} his bedroom in Wetherby Mansions orange and purple. The nude woman {{appearing}} {{on the back of the}} record sleeve was an acquaintance of his known as [...] "Iggy the Eskimo". Photographer Mick Rock says, [...] "When I arrived for 'The Madcap Laughs' photo session, Syd was still in his underpants [...]. His lady friend of two weeks, 'Iggy the Eskimo', <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> in the kitchen [...]." [...] Iggy met Barrett in March 1969, through Barrett's then-girlfriend, Jenny Spires. Barrett had moved into Wetherby Mansions, and Jenny took Iggy there one evening. Iggy stayed on at the flat when Jenny left for The States a couple of weeks later. Iggy didn't know who Barrett was or that he was previously in Pink Floyd. Iggy heard Barrett play several songs that would later appear on the album, one being [...] "Terrapin", which she called [...] "quite catchy". In October 2010 she was interviewed, revealing that her name was Evelyn. The album was designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The original sleeve featured no musician credits, barring producer credit; later issues contain musician credits. On the original release, track 10 is listed as [...] "She Took a Long Cold Look", although on the 2010 remaster the track is re-titled to [...] "She Took a Long Cool Look", in similar vein to An Introduction to Syd Barrett.|$|E

500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E
500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E

2500|$|The serpent {{told the}} woman {{that she would not}} die, but that as soon as she ate the fruit, her eyes would be opened and she would be like divine beings who knew good and evil. When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, {{pleasing}} in appearance, and desirable as a source of wisdom, she ate some of its fruit and gave some to her husband to eat. Then their eyes were opened and they saw that they were naked; and they sewed themselves loincloths out of fig leaves. Hearing God move in the garden, they hid in the trees. God asked the man where he was. The man replied that he grew afraid when he heard God, and he hid because he <b>was</b> <b>naked.</b> God asked him who told him that he <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> and whether he had eaten the forbidden fruit. The man replied that the woman whom God put at his side gave him the fruit, and he ate. When God asked the woman what she had done, she replied that the serpent duped her, and she ate. God cursed the serpent to crawl on its belly, to eat dirt, and to live in enmity with the woman and her offspring. A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|E
