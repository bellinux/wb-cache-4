5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with <b>water</b> <b>cooling.</b> The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  48, {{the effect of}} the <b>water</b> <b>cooler</b> after {{optimization}} on the temperature rise of the ranging arm is significant. Without the <b>water</b> <b>cooler,</b> the acceleration speed of temperature increase is very large. Figure  49 shows the distribution of the ranging arm temperature field without the <b>water</b> <b>cooler</b> under working conditions. Without the <b>water</b> <b>cooler,</b> the temperature gradient generated between transmission shaft and box is very large. It indicates that the <b>water</b> <b>cooler</b> of ranging arm design has solved the overheating problem with the 750  kW ranging arm. In addition, it provides a reference for the study on the heat balance of large power ranging arms, and the optimization of cooler design.|$|R
5|$|Wigner led the Theoretical Group at the Metallurgical Laboratory that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Gale Young and Edward Creutz. The group's {{task was to}} design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and <b>water</b> <b>cooling.</b> The choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time. Water was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolants would delay the project.|$|E

In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E

25|$|The {{machine gun}} {{is defined as}} a fully {{automatic}} firearm, usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine. The world's first true machine gun, the Maxim gun, was invented in 1884 by the American inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim, who devised a recoil power of the previously fired bullet to reload rather than the crude method of a manually operated, hand-cranked firearm. With the ability to fire 750 rounds per minute, Maxim's other great innovation was the use of <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> to reduce overheating. Maxim's gun was widely adopted and derivative designs were used on all sides during World War I.|$|E
