5|$|Structure 7B {{is a small}} {{structure}} {{situated on}} the eastern side of Structure 7. Like Structure 7A, the four sides were dressed with standing stones and <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a pavement.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} and the keep <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a ditch, which had three counterscarp musketry galleries. These were also significantly altered by the British.|$|E
5|$|The outworks <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> an {{advanced}} ditch, {{but only a}} part of it remains since most of it was filled in with rubble.|$|E

50|$|Mannar is the {{one among}} the {{beautiful}} place in Kerala, because the southern side <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> paddy fields and eastern side <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the river and north and west <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> hills.|$|R
50|$|Bath {{is one of}} {{only two}} UK Parliament {{constituencies}} to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> another constituency. Bath <b>is</b> entirely <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the North East Somerset constituency. The other constituency, York Central, <b>is</b> entirely <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> York Outer.|$|R
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{bonus of}} the Bruneval raid was the Germans' {{efforts to improve}} defences at Würzburg stations and prevent similar attacks. The radars <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> rings of barbed wire which increased their visibility from the air, making them easier to target prior to Operation Overlord.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This {{may have led to}} the distortion of the shape of the head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, Isdud was {{described}} as a village spread across the eastern slope of a low hill, covered with gardens. A ruined khan stood southwest of the village. Its houses were one-storey high with walls and enclosures built of adobe brick. There were two main sources of water: a pond and a masonry well. Both <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> groves of date-palm and fig-trees.|$|E
50|$|As {{the germ}} of a fruit <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the {{perisperm}} so the spirit, properly so called, <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> an envelope which, by analogy, may be {{designated as the}} perispirit.|$|R
50|$|An ambulacrum is an {{architectural}} {{term for the}} atrium, courtyard, or parvise {{in front of a}} basilica that <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> arcades or colonnades, often containing a fountain, and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> trees.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is mainly}} for {{decorative}} purposes and has four fountains. It has a dock and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a sidewalk. The lake {{and the entire}} condominium complex <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> Casablanca Drive.|$|R
5|$|The first {{high-resolution}} electron micrographs {{appeared in}} 1952, replacing the Janus Green stains as the preferred way of visualising the mitochondria. This {{led to a}} more {{detailed analysis of the}} structure of the mitochondria, including confirmation that they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a membrane. It also showed a second membrane inside the mitochondria that folded up in ridges dividing up the inner chamber and that the size and shape of the mitochondria varied from cell to cell.|$|E
5|$|During the attacks, both hotels <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> Rapid Action Force {{personnel}} and Marine Commandos (MARCOS) and National Security Guards (NSG) commandos. When reports emerged that attackers were receiving television broadcasts, feeds to the hotels were blocked. Security forces stormed both hotels, and all nine attackers {{were killed by}} the morning of 29 November. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan of the NSG was killed during the rescue of Commando Sunil Yadav, who was hit in the leg by a bullet during the rescue operations at Taj. 32 hostages were killed at the Oberoi Trident.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{left his}} {{headquarters}} at Keynsham Abbey and moved towards Bath, which {{had also been}} occupied by royalist troops, making entry into the city impossible. Monmouth camped in Philips Norton (now Norton St Philip), where his forces were attacked on 27 June by the leading elements of Feversham's forces, which had now combined into a larger force, but were still awaiting their artillery. The Duke of Grafton led some cavalry, dragoons, and 500 musketeers into the village, where they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the rebels and had to hack through hedges to escape. They were rescued by Churchill and withdrew with approximately twenty casualties on each side; however, each side believed that the other had taken greater losses.|$|E
50|$|The island {{itself is}} covered with trees but it <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a beach around which is a lagoon. Outside this, the whole <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a coral reef and the open ocean.|$|R
2500|$|The {{virus is}} {{approximately}} 122–180 nm {{in diameter and}} is composed of a double helix of DNA which contains about 172,000 base pairs and 85 genes. The DNA <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a protein nucleocapsid. This nucleocapsid <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a tegument made of protein, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> an [...] envelope containing both lipids and surface projections of glycoproteins which are essential to infection of the host cell.|$|R
50|$|The {{reverse of}} the medal depicts a trident <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a laurel wreath. The wreath <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a blue enamel ring {{containing}} the inscription FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE. Like the obverse, the blue enamel {{ring on the}} reverse <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> scroll waves.|$|R
5|$|The Chenes {{style is}} very similar to the Puuc style, but predates the use of the mosaic façades of the Puuc region. It {{featured}} fully adorned façades on both the upper and lower sections of structures. Some doorways <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities, identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm. Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels. The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula. Examples of Chenes sites include Dzibilnocac, Hochob, Santa Rosa Xtampak, and Tabasqueño.|$|E
5|$|The friars {{returned}} in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek' welcomed {{them in a}} friendly manner, {{but this time the}} Maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> armed warriors, and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never return. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to Mérida.|$|E
5|$|When the Marines <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the Chinese Communist troops {{close to}} the Manchurian border, they were ordered to retreat and work {{their way back to}} Hungnam. The men of the 65th rushed to their defense and were ordered to stay behind and fight the enemy. As a result, the Marines were able to {{withdraw}} to their ships with the 65th holding the rear guard. The 65th, attached to the 1st Marine Division, was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for their defense and were among the last units to embark from Hungnam. Among the battles and operations in which the 65th participated was Operation Killer in January 1951, becoming the first regiment to cross the Han River in South Korea during the operation.|$|E
50|$|Na2Te, {{like many}} related {{compounds}} with the formula M2X, adopts the antifluorite structure. Thus, in solid Na2Te each Te2− ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> eight Na+ ions and each Na+ ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> four Te2− ions.|$|R
50|$|Kuruman has {{relatively}} mild {{weather patterns}} {{compared to other}} Northern Cape towns, such as Upington and Springbok, and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> more vegetation {{as compared to the}} Upington and Springbok, which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> desertic environments.|$|R
50|$|The last {{assumption}} {{means that}} each cation <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a spherically symmetric cloud of other ions. The cloud has a net negative charge. Similarly each anion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a cloud with net positive charge.|$|R
5|$|Burghs had unique layouts and {{economic}} functions. They were typically <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a palisade or possessed a castle, and usually had a marketplace, with a widened high street or junction, often {{marked by a}} mercat cross (market cross), beside houses for the burgesses and other inhabitants. The foundations of around 15 burghs {{can be traced to}} the reign of David I and there is evidence of 55 burghs by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts. Excluded from international trade they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. In general, burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands than nationally or internationally, relying on them for food and raw materials.|$|E
5|$|By mid-January Captain García de Paredes {{had arrived}} at the advance portion of the Camino Real at Chuntuki. By now he only had 90 {{soldiers}} plus labourers and porters. Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, García’s senior officer, arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, two Franciscans, and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and a scuffle then broke out; a dozen of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and three of them were killed. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners, who included the two Franciscans. The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> thousands of Itza warriors. Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the French Navy {{suffered}} {{a series of}} defeats {{at the hands of}} the British Royal Navy, culminating in the destruction of much of their Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Unable to compete at sea, the French were increasingly confined to their principal naval bases, especially Brest on the Biscay coast and Toulon in the Mediterranean. With British squadrons patrolling the entrances to these ports, the French found it difficult not only to conduct regular overseas trade, but also to supply and reinforce their overseas colonies. As a result, the colonies faced financial collapse and the constant threat of attack by British forces, especially in the Caribbean, where by 1809 their island colonies of Martinique and Guadeloupe <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> British held islands and blockaded by a strong British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} Schmitt {{established}} radio {{communication with the}} 1st Battalion, 9th infantry. When daylight came Schmitt and his group saw that they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> North Koreans. One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them, formerly held by B Company. Below them, North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units, some of them already several miles eastward. The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group. They first attacked it at 14:00 that afternoon, and were repulsed. That night an estimated company attacked three times, pressing the fight to close quarters, but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter. Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|In February 1827, Joaquim Inácio was {{transferred}} to the crew of the corvette Duquesa de Goiás, in which he was {{to take part in the}} invasion of Carmen de Patagones, a village in the northeast of the United Provinces that served as a port for corsairs. The Duquesa de Goiás sank during the expedition, killing several crew members. Joaquim Inácio insisted on being the last officer to leave the vessel. He was next given the command of the schooner Constança. The invasion of Carmen was a complete failure, and the Brazilian land forces were defeated and taken prisoner. On 7 March, while Joaquim Inácio awaited news of the invasion, the Constança and another schooner <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> enemy vessels. After a desperate battle, he was taken captive after refusing to surrender.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} or post-medieval period, {{the remains of}} the hillfort were used as a rabbit warren which was used to breed rabbits, {{providing}} valuable meat and fur. Many warrens <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> banks or walls to prevent the rabbits from escaping; escaped rabbits caused damage to nearby farmland and meant a loss in profit. The warren at Dolebury is completely enclosed by the substantial ramparts of the Iron Age hill fort and thus provided an ideal location to breed rabbits. The presence of pillow mounds and vermin traps demonstrate man's management of the site for husbandry. Ridge and furrow agriculture has also been identified, from aerial photographs, within the fort. Some of these structures, along with earlier Iron Age features, have been damaged by subsequent quarrying which may have been for lead, ochre or calamine. The site was described by John Leland in the 16th century. A three-storey building, believed to be the warrener's house and possibly a watch tower, surrounded by a garden, was in ruins by 1830.|$|E
50|$|The Justizwache corps badge {{shows the}} Austrian coat of arms, which <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a {{circular}} enclosure. It thus deviates only marginally from the corps badge of the Federal Police, {{in which the}} Bundeswappen <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> an oak leaf wreath.|$|R
50|$|In {{the earlier}} Geordie lamps an oil lamp <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> glass. The {{top of the}} glass has a {{perforated}} copper cap with a gauze screen above that. The glass <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a perforated metal tube to protect it.|$|R
50|$|An axon is {{the part}} of a neuron which conducts {{electrical}} impulses. Axons <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> myelin, which contain Schwann cells. Schwann cells improve the electrical conduction. The myelin <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> endoneurium, which <b>is</b> a protective sheath of connective tissue. This <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> perineurium and epineurium, of which the latter is the outmost layer of dense connective tissue. When it comes to nerve repair, it is crucial that those layers make a good connection.|$|R
