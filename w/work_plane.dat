Energy efficient lighting has been studied extensively in the aspect of daylighting harvesting and task ambient lighting, predominantly in Temperate developed countries.

This paper explores into the office occupant’s mood and preferences of low ambient daylight and usage of task light for the office in the Tropics.

40|$|For {{daylighting}} purpose, {{office buildings}} {{should have a}} shallow plan and increase the ratio of surface to building’s volume. However, intensive use of air-conditioning drives office building’s plan to be deep with a minimum surface to volume ratio. This leads {{to the presence of}} areas that have insufficient daylight level at the <b>work</b> <b>plane.</b> Considering limitations of some daylighting methods in distributing daylight to these areas, Horizontal Light Pipe (HLP) was selected. The aim of this research was to evaluate and explain the effect of HLP branching on daylight quantity and distribution inside open plan office space. Experimental with simulation as a tool was used as the research method. HLP branching’s uniformity ratio, illuminance and Daylight Factor were compared with unbranching HLP, simultaneously with daylighting standards. Results showed that office space with HLP-L branching had higher daylight level than HLP-T branching, 296 lux and 295 lux, HLP-L and HLP-T, respectively. However, HLP-T branching distributed daylight more evenly than HLP-L branching, with uniformity ratio as 1. 49 : 1 and 1. 50 : 1, HLP-T and HLP-L, respectively.

40|$|Daylight {{distribution}} {{models are}} essential for daylighting design and present information in a visual manner that facilitates decision making. With an accurate model, daylight in a space can be distributed in an efficient and comfortable way, so {{that the need for}} electric lighting in daytime is reduced. On the other hand, motorized shades can be controlled automatically to better distribute daylight on the <b>work</b> <b>plane</b> and reduce or avoid glare. Most of modern buildings, both commercial and high-rise residential, have windows in more than one orientation and have the provision for daylight penetration into space. In this study, a radiosity model for simulating the daylight distribution of a corner office having two windows in various orientations with motorized shades has been developed. The model calculates the illuminance at different locations on the <b>work</b> <b>plane.</b> The simulation model based on radiosity theory is verified with measured data under overcast and clear sky conditions with direct and diffuse lighting, and a parametric analysis is carried out for various room shapes and shading devices and façade orientations.

Three section façade is considered with the bottom section being opaque (spandrel), the middle viewing section and a top daylighting section. Variable shade transmittance in the middle and top section of the facades is studied, and it is shown that having a higher transmittance in the top section results in improved daylight utilization and a middle section with lower transmittance provide privacy to the building occupants. Specific recommendations are made for shade transmittances for upper and middle part of the façade to maintain occupant privacy with acceptable illuminance in the work-plane...|$|E

Daylight is not only useful for reducing cost from electric light sources, but also give benefits both physiologically and psychologically for building users. Studies in various countries showed that daylight was more preferable as main light source, compared to light from electric lamps. Effect of daylight on performance of building users might be evaluated based on variation of electroencephalograph (EEG) signal, specifically alpha and beta waves. In this research, EEG signal {{was used to evaluate}} brain response of the participant while doing activity of solving jigsaw puzzle under daylight condition inside a room. Several factors were varied, i. e. average illuminance on <b>work</b> <b>plane</b> (1000 and 300 lux), orientation of the participant with regard to the window (perpendicular and parallel to the window plane), and timing of the experiments (at noon [12. 00 13. 00 WIB] and in the afternoon [14. 30 15. 30 WIB]).
