2500|$|He is, arguably, {{the most}} {{important}} philosopher <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Australia.

But for every student who became a philosopher there were far, far, more in the law, in medicine, in journalism, in other academic disciplines, that were profoundly influenced by him. I am inclined to think that, especially in the thirties and forties of the last century, Anderson was the person who set the agenda, and set the tone, for intellectual discussion in Sydney. – David Armstrong (2005) ...|$|E
