2500|$|Some American {{legislators have}} unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to provide {{financial incentives to}} women on welfare who agree to use Norplant.

[...] Some judges have offered Norplant implants as a voluntary alternative to jail time for certain women convicted of child abuse or drug abuse during pregnancy.

Eleven days later the Inquirer apologized for their [...] "misguided and wrongheaded" [...] editorial and for their suggestion of offering incentives for Norplant use. Critics such as the ACLU argued that such uses are coercive and discriminatory, and compared such uses to early 20th-century American eugenics. In Killing the Black Body, black feminist Dorothy Roberts links such uses of Norplant to a [...] "white mainstream" [...] that is allegedly determined to [...] "demonize, even criminalize" [...] poor black women's lives and reproductive choices.|$|E

5000|$|Collins' {{discussion}} of controlling images {{focuses on the}} negative stereotypical representations and images of black women.

The images' pervasive nature aid in sustaining intersecting oppression because they [...] "reflect the dominant group's interest in maintaining Black women's subordination. These images are used to make black women's oppression seem natural and normal. Collin's critique on controlling images includes an analysis of the mammy, the <b>welfare</b> <b>mother,</b> and the jezebel. She explains that the images constitute different oppressions simultaneous: the mammy works to make the defeminized black women and all oppressive factors against her seem natural, the <b>welfare</b> <b>mother</b> works to make the economically unfit black women and all oppressive factors against her seem natural, and the jezebel works to make the hypersexual black women and all oppressive factors against her seem natural.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} march, Duncan {{organized}} upwards of 6000 people to march together down the Las Vegas Strip {{with the goal}} of shutting down revenues to the Casinos {{for at least an hour}} to show the government how serious the <b>welfare</b> <b>mothers</b> were and to make the injustice public. The <b>welfare</b> <b>mothers</b> invited celebrities and well known activists like Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Ralph Abernathy, Cesar Chavez, Dr. Benjamin Spock, and Dave Dellinger, in order to protect themselves from police and bystander abuse during the protest. On March 6, 1971, Ruby Duncan and the <b>welfare</b> <b>mothers,</b> their children, and hundreds of allies marched down the Las Vegas Strip and effectively cut off business from most of the casinos, including Caesars Palace, for several hours.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} Bridgette Baldwin’s reworking of Ivan Illich’s {{notion of}} “shadow work. ” Bridgette Baldwin’s article highlights {{the limits of}} shadow work’s definition – as unpaid labor in preparation for consumption. While the Author acknowledges that Illich’s identification of a shadow realm of consumption—and, by extension, production—is a powerful commentary and foreshadowing of our present times, he suggests that Bridgette Baldwin’s Article demonstrates how class still matters and how shadow work is not gender neutral. The Author posits that the full expanse of Illich’s shadow market {{can be seen by}} exploring the standpoint position of poor black and brown citizens. This Article brings to light the similarities between the “tough love,” privatization approach to welfare reform and recent attacks on collective bargaining, the dismantling of social programs, decreased contributions to healthcare, and the failure to create a large-scale jobs program—combined with increased tax cuts for the wealthy. Unfortunately, the <b>welfare</b> <b>mother</b> remains socio-economically central but conceptually marginal to the discontent expressed by a growing number of Americans. The Author cautions against ignoring the plight of the <b>welfare</b> <b>mother</b> while America builds a new political consciousness...|$|R
50|$|The {{march was}} successful, and gained {{a lot of}} {{attention}} from local and national news.

This sewing class was central in Ruby Duncan's radicalization and activism, as this class was where she and the other <b>welfare</b> <b>mothers</b> were able to voice their opinions and bond with each other.

50|$|Historically {{there have}} been four {{stereotypes}} of Black female sexuality, the Jezebel, mammy, matriarch, and <b>welfare</b> <b>mother.</b> Researchers Dionne P. Stephens and Layli D. Phillips reinterpreted these categories and claimed the modern day hip-hop equivalent of these gender-role scripts are the diva, gold digger, freak, dyke, gangster bitch, sister savior, earth mother, and baby mama. Of these stereotypes, the most similar to the ride-or-die chick is Philips's description of the gangster bitch. Like the gangster bitch, the ride-or-die chick comes from a violent, impoverished, crime-filled environment and is considered an important ally in surviving this environment because of her lack of fear, street smarts, and devotion. However, the two terms do have their differences. For example, according to Philips, the gangster bitch and her partner recognize {{they are in a}} short-term relationship whereas the ride-or-die chick and her partner are often portrayed as being in lifelong relationships.|$|R
40|$|One could {{assume it}} {{is a given}} that Essence {{magazine}} dispels stereotypical images of Black women and that it works to liberate them from the stric-tures imposed on them by {{a world in which}} they live as an undervalued and marginalized minority.

This content analysis examines whether Essence works as a liberating feminist text that dispels, as opposed to validates, stereotypical images of Black women. We hypothesize that (a) there will be more evidence to dispel the stereotypes than to perpetuate them and (b) that of the four major African American women stereotypes—mammy, matriarch, sexual siren, and <b>welfare</b> <b>mother</b> or queen—the matriarch and sexual siren stereotypes will be dispelled more frequently. Results support the former hypothesis entirely and the latter hypothesis partially...|$|R
