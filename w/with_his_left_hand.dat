5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> it was probably easier for him to write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|Shevchenko, who {{had scored}} the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, {{then had to}} score or Liverpool would win. He hit his penalty {{straight}} {{down the middle of}} the goal. Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3–2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp {{answered}} the door, the visitor grabbed him <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|When {{he first}} {{displayed}} this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian {{accused him of}} disrespect. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing in response to Robidoux's formal complaint, where he had {{to prove that he}} could play to a high level <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> He played three frames of snooker against former world championship runner-up Rex Williams, winning all three. The charge of bringing the game into disrepute was subsequently dropped.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{became a}} Christian {{at the age}} of 23. He has adopted a gesture of {{crossing}} his arms, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> in his glove and his right hand underneath pointing with the index finger while looking at the sky, which both honors The Holy Trinity as well as his late father who died of cancer when Wilson was 17. He performs it when he records a save or closes out a game.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> including brushing his teeth and eating dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E

50|$|Strasbourg “Dernieres Nouvelles”, 1966. A great pianist…it was {{incredible}} how <b>with</b> only <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> he managed (in the Chaconne Bach-Brahms) {{to create the}} impression of a whole orchestra. A night which those who experienced it will discuss and remember for many years.|$|R

5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{returned}} for the Fifth Test at The Oval, where England elected to bat first on a rain-affected pitch. Tallon caught Jack Crapp from an outside edge for a duck from the bowling of Miller, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. England continued to {{struggle against the}} moving ball and were all out for 52 in the middle session. The innings ended when Tallon took an acrobatic catch to dismiss Len Hutton down the leg side, catching it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> It was considered the catch of the season by Wisden. Tallon conceded six byes in the innings.|$|E
5|$|However, Wilson defends House when House's {{career is}} in jeopardy, after billionaire {{entrepreneur}} and then chairman of Princeton-Plainsboro's Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) proposes a motion for House's dismissal. Wilson {{is the only}} one to vote against the motion. In response, Vogler proposes and succeeds in obtaining Wilson's dismissal, but Wilson is soon reinstated thanks to Cuddy after she convinces the board that Vogler is the real threat to the hospital and his money is not worth his business-obsessed mindset. In a late Season episode it is revealed that Wilson suffers from clinical depression and takes medication. Wilson is also seen to write <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> a trait he shares with Cuddy and Foreman, but when he performs detailed medical work, such as injections or incisions, or gesticulates while speaking, appears to be right-handed in general, suggesting he may be ambidextrous.|$|E

5|$|Nevinson {{obtained}} a commission from the Royal Air Force to portray airmen {{preparing for the}} Dieppe raid in August 1942 and they also allowed him to fly in their planes to develop pictures of the air war. He presented a painting, a cloudscape entitled The Battlefields of Britain, to Winston Churchill {{as a gift to}} the nation and which still hangs in Downing Street. Shortly afterwards a stroke paralysed his right hand and caused a speech impediment. He applied for a junior clerical post with WAAC and was refused. Nevinson taught himself to paint <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and had three pictures shown at the Royal Academy in the summer of 1946. He attended that exhibition, with the assistance of his wife Kathleen, in a wheelchair but died a few months later aged fifty-seven.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a rest day, and {{the match}} resumed on Monday morning. In the third over of the day, Lindwall {{was the last}} man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bradman's men had added only one run to its {{overnight}} score of 457/9. Bedser took the final wicket as Lindwall edged, and Crapp took the catch low down in the slips <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> Bedser ended with 3/92 and Laker 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each. England's use of Cranston as an all rounder had not been successful; he conceded almost four runs per over without taking a wicket. Although England only had a slight lead, Australia had the disadvantage of being a bowler short due to Toshack's injury. This meant Johnston and Johnson among the slower bowlers were left to exploit the wearing pitch.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E

5|$|Martin Keown {{took care}} of the free-kick which Popescu unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to clear, only to give Overmars a shot on goal, a volley which went over. One minute later, Galatasaray's first opportunity came when Erdem received a straight ball from a Hagi taken free–kick, and took a shot on goal, which goalkeeper David Seaman managed to keep out <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> for a corner. The corner was taken, but no Galatasaray player was available to direct the ball towards the goal. Arsenal would create more opportunities into the match, when Sylvinho snatched the ball from Hagi and ran down to Galatasaray's left, before putting in a cross to the running Henry, who was halted by a clearance from Bülent Korkmaz. As Galatasaray grew more into the game minute, Erdem exchanged passes with Şükür, whose bicycle kick went completely off target. Arsenal began creating more chances – in the 35th minute, Overmars made a low powerful shot on goal, forcing Cláudio Taffarel to make a diving save. Overmars then made another run into the area but his attempt went across the goal. Galatasaray nearly took the lead with only two minutes of the first half remaining, when Şükür found Erdem, who beat the offside trap. However, his shot went just wide.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2009–10 season Bogosian was {{bothered by}} an injury. During {{a game against}} the Ottawa Senators on October 31, 2009, Bogosian fell behind his team's net; <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> lying on the net's iron frame along the ice, another player fell on top of him. The impact broke his left thumb and injured his wrist. Though he did not miss any time from the injury, it had an effect on his {{offensive}} play; Bogosian was perceived to be more hesitant with the puck, choosing to pass it more often than shooting. In the first 17 games of the season, he had scored 8 goals, then went 29 contests without scoring. In the final 64 games, he only scored 2 goals. After he recovered, Bogosian admitted he did not play at his full capacity, but had decided not to disclose the injury to the team until the season finished in April 2010. Regardless of his injury, Bogosian only missed one game throughout the season, a game on March 14 against the Phoenix Coyotes. Even with these setbacks, Bogosian set career highs for games played (81), goals (10), assists (13) and points (23). The 10 goals he scored tied a team record for most by a defenseman in a season, first set by Yannick Tremblay in 1999–2000, the Thrashers' inaugural year. He also set a team record with 196 hits. Again the Thrashers missed the playoffs.|$|E

Much has survived to illustrate Leonardo's studies, discoveries and inventions.|$|E

25|$|On the {{recorded}} version, Borland played without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, {{and the other}} playing chord progressions. Borland's playing featured octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> creating a percussive sound. Borland also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes and hypnotic, droning licks to create a disorienting effect.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Kennedy. Michaels reeled Kennedy in the {{beginning}} of the match. A stomp of Michaels injured Kennedy's <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> Michaels went on to execute a diving elbow drop on Kennedy and then he also attempted a Sweet Chin Music but Kennedy countered it into a roll-up. Michaels kicked out but Kennedy continued to punch Michaels <b>with</b> <b>his</b> injured <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> further injuring Kennedy. Michaels executed a Sweet Chin Music for the victory.|$|R
25|$|Hodge {{tried to}} hook the ball clear but miscued it. The ball screwed off {{his foot and}} into the penalty area, toward Maradona, who had {{continued}} his run. England goalkeeper Peter Shilton {{came out of his}} goal to punch the ball clear. Maradona, despite being 8 inches (20cm) shorter than the 6-foot-1 (1.85m) Shilton, reached it first <b>with</b> <b>his</b> outside <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> The ball went into the goal. Referee Ali Bin Nasser of Tunisia claimed he did not see the infringement and allowed the goal.|$|R
60|$|The muzzle of the rifle, {{four feet}} away, was bearing {{directly}} on him, when Grief resolved to act. The rifle wavered as Griffiths kept his {{balance in the}} uncertain puffs {{of the first of}} the wind. Grief took advantage of the wavering, made as if to sign the paper, and at the same instant, like a cat, exploded into swift and intricate action. As he ducked low and leaped forward <b>with</b> <b>his</b> body, <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> flashed from under the screen of the table, and so accurately-timed was the single stiff pull on the self-cocking trigger that the cartridge discharged as the muzzle came forward. Not a whit behind was Griffiths. The muzzle of his weapon dropped to meet the ducking body, and, shot at snap direction, rifle and revolver went off simultaneously.|$|R
