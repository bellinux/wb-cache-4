5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{original}} working titles of the film were first The Beatles and then Beatlemania, the group's name is never spoken in the movie—it is, however, visible on Ringo's drum kit, on the stage lighting, and on the helicopter in the final scene. The television performance scene also contains a visual pun on the group's name, with photos of beetles visible on the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> dancers.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow on the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
5|$|Stretford Cenotaph, {{opposite}} the Chester Road entrance to Gorse Hill Park, was {{built as a}} memorial to the 580 Stretford men {{who lost their lives}} in the First World War. Their names and regiments are listed on a large bronze plaque on the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> cenotaph. It was formally unveiled in 1923, by the Earl of Derby, Secretary of State for War.|$|E

5|$|Group B is {{near the}} centre of the site, roughly {{equidistant}} between Group A (to the northeast) and Group C (to the southwest). The main plaza of Group B was at the northern end of the group and was enclosed by the ballcourt on the south side, a double pyramid on the east side and three platforms. A stairway with 28 steps descends the Group B retaining <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> northeast corner of the double pyramid, providing an access route towards Group D. On {{the north side of the}} group another stairway, with 18 steps divided into two flights, descends towards Group A.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor is}} of Jura marble, the altar, ambo, baptismal font and {{tabernacle}} {{are made of}} Lahn marble. The <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> altar held a neo-gothic crucifixion scene of Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene under the cross, from the Magdalenenkirche. Low stained glass windows forming the Stations of the Cross were designed by Paul Corazolla from Berlin. The first organ was built by E. F. Walcker & Cie. and consecrated in 1974. It {{was placed on the}} right side in the opening for the chapel, visible to the congregation. The free-standing bell tower, housing four bells, is 42m high.|$|E
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> band.|$|E
50|$|The {{ceiling of}} the church, which {{contains}} gold leafing, is from 1984, as are the crosses painted on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> altar {{and many of the}} light fixtures.|$|R

50|$|The {{gardens of}} the palace were formal French Renaissance gardens {{constructed}} in 1636. In front {{of the palace}} were trees and parterres enclosed by <b>walls.</b> <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> palace was a larger garden with four rectangular ponds.|$|R
5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it {{should always be}} on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|E
5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives {{a page from the}} disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> stone <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Town Pound, Town Hall, {{and former}} Town Barn date from about 1800. The stone wall {{along the east}} side of Center Road dates from 1840, when the road was moved to its current position.|$|R
50|$|In the Middle Ages {{there was}} a priory at Wetheral. All that is left now is the gatehouse, {{which is in the}} care of English Heritage, and some low ruined <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> farm {{buildings}} that now occupy the site.|$|R
40|$|A choir, predominately women, {{is shown}} singing. They are wearing dark robes with sleeves that fold {{back to reveal}} a lining {{matching}} the stolls on the robes. They are holding their music open. A young woman is pictured in the foreground, not singing and wearing a different robe. There are decorations on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> choir. The lower {{right corner of the}} photograph is damaged...|$|R

25|$|The <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> {{stone is}} defined by its {{striking}} blue balconies and tau cross-bearing red banners (depicting the insignia of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre), and is decorated with lamps. The modern mosaic along the wall depicts the anointing of Jesus' body.|$|E
25|$|There are {{believed}} to have been settlements in the Chippenham region since before Roman times. Remains of Romano-British settlements are visible in the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> former magistrates' court and recent redevelopments of the town have shown up other evidence of early settlements.|$|E
30|$|The {{flow depth}} in Yenikapı exceeds 6  m near the shore, and between <b>the</b> {{historical}} city <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Yenikapı Fishery port and the shoreline, {{because of the}} accumulation of water volume. The inundation distance reaches 200  m inland, depending on the YAN source simulations by tsunami numerical modeling.|$|R
50|$|The George and Eugene Markle House is {{a two-story}} frame cross-gable Queen Anne house. A two-story shed roofed {{addition}} fills the angle between <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> front porch. The porch {{itself is a}} hip-roofed wraparound porch with Doric piers. The house is clad with clapboard, with the gables covered with decorative shingling.|$|R
50|$|Wiring and piping {{installed}} behind traditional plaster or wallboard ceilings {{is extremely}} difficult to modify once the finished ceiling is in place. Wires must either be fished through hollow spaces in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> finished ceiling, or the ceiling must be demolished in order for wiring or piping changes to be made.|$|R
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the style of architecture, five unique altars line the rear <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Main Altar. These altars are {{dedicated}} to: St. Patrick, St. Aloysius, Mary Immaculate, St. Anne, and St. Vincent de Paul, whose life work with the poor and needy inspired Father Baker.|$|E
25|$|A {{statue of}} George Orwell, sculpted by the British {{sculptor}} Martin Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House, {{the headquarters of}} the BBC. The <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> statue is inscribed with: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what {{they do not want to}} hear”, words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.|$|E
25|$|The DEGC {{awarded the}} {{demolition}} contract on April 22, 2008, with the speculation that demolition revenue {{would come from}} the sale of scrap metal and not from the City of Detroit. Wrecking crews commenced operations on June 30, in the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> old bleacher section facing I-75 near the intersection of Trumbull Avenue. The demolition of the left field stands opened up the stadium's interior to view {{for the first time in}} decades on July 9, 2008 (the ballpark had been double-decked since the late 1930s).|$|E

50|$|The {{entrance}} vestibule and ramp {{of the station}} are covered with granite tiles and have suspended ceilings. The entire station was designed in vibrant colors: the platforms are covered with colored granite tiles and the walls have panels of circular red mosaic designs set on white tiles. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> panels are covered with a light blue mosaic.|$|R
25|$|On {{the fourth}} {{anniversary of the}} bombings Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall {{unveiled}} a memorial in London, {{at the rear of}} the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Main Building, facing St. James's Park. The memorial consists of a 1.5-metre marble globe, to represent that people from 21 countries were killed, and has 202 doves carved into it. The names of all 202 victims are on a curved stone <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> globe. It is the work of the artist Gary Breeze and the sculptor Martin Cook.|$|E
25|$|As a Google search shows, {{the phrase}} ad orientem is today much more {{commonly}} used to describe a particular orientation of a priest in Christian liturgy, facing the apse or <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> altar, with priest and people looking in the same direction, {{as opposed to the}} versus populum orientation, in which the priest faces the congregation. In this use, the phrase is not necessarily related to the geographical direction in which the priest is looking and is employed even if he is not facing to the east or even has his back to the east.|$|E
25|$|The University Chapel was {{constructed}} {{as a memorial}} to the 755 sons of the University who {{had lost their lives}} in the First World War. Designed by Sir John Burnet, it was completed in 1929 and dedicated on 4 October. Tablets on the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Communion Table list the names of those who died, while other tablets besides the stalls record the 405 members of the University community who gave their lives in the Second World War. Most of the windows are the work of Douglas Strachan, although some have been added over the years, including those on the South Wall, created by Alan Younger.|$|E
60|$|On {{one side}} {{was a book}} stand, where a boy was selling books. There was a counter before, and shelves against <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>behind.</b> <b>The</b> shelves were filled with books. These books were in fancy-colored paper bindings, and seemed to consist chiefly of guide books and tales, and other similar works suited to the wants of travellers.|$|R
50|$|During the pastorate of Bishop Ward, {{the parish}} added a mosaic <b>wall</b> {{decoration}} <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> main altar.|$|R
50|$|Sweet-Art Deal: Three classic {{paintings}} are brought out and described {{with the names}} of the painters on a placard underneath each painting. Then, three asking prices appear each on movable <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> paintings. The team must place each asking price behind each one of the paintings. After all three paintings and prices have been paired; the team is then given the opportunity to make changes before locking in the pairs. To win the round, all three prices must be correctly matched with their corresponding painting.|$|R
