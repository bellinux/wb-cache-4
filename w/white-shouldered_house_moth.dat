5000|$|Invalid {{scientific}} names (junior synonyms and others) of the <b>white-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> are: ...|$|E
50|$|As type {{species of}} Endrosis, the <b>white-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> was {{originally}} {{included in the}} genus when it was established (by Jacob Hübner in 1825) as Alucita betulinella, a scientific name established by Johan Christian Fabricius under this name in 1787. But Hübner had misidentified Fabricius' species, which was in reality a tineid moth known today as Nemaxera betulinella. In addition to this case of mistaken identity, the <b>white-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> as discussed by Hübner had actually been named Tinea lactella by J. N. C. M. Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. Earlier still, Carl Linnaeus had described the <b>white-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> as Phalaena (Tinea) sarcitrella in 1758, but neither Denis and Schiffermüller nor Hübner did remember it. Later authors, who {{were aware of the}} earlier descriptions, supposed the taxon of Denis and Schiffermüller or that of Linnaeus to be this type of Endrosis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> (Endrosis sarcitrella) is {{a species}} of gelechioid moth. It belongs to the {{subfamily}} Oecophorinae of the concealer moth family (Oecophoridae), just like the brown house moth (Hofmannophila pseudospretella). Though several presumed congeners of E. sarcitrella were described, its genus Endrosis is currently understood to be monotypic.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Adult at Browns Bay (New Zealand). <b>White-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moths</b> {{from the}} New Zealand {{population}} were once considered a separate species E. subditella, {{but are not}} recognizably distinct from European specimens.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{originally}} {{native to}} Asia, the synanthropic brown <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> {{has been introduced}} to other regions by human activity and is found almost worldwide today. It is often considered a pest due to the feeding activity of its caterpillars.|$|R
50|$|Hofmannophila pseudospretella, {{the brown}} <b>house</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species of}} the concealer moth family (Oecophoridae), wherein it belongs to {{subfamily}} Oecophorinae. It is the only known member of its genus Hofmannophila, and {{as is often the}} case for such monotypic taxa, the genus' distinctness remains to be conclusively proven. However that may be, it seems to be a close relative of Borkhausenia.|$|R
50|$|Many concealer moths feed on dead plant {{material}} and play a useful part in nutrient recycling. On the other hand, the family includes the <b>white-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> (Endrosis sarcitrella), a widely distributed species whose caterpillars infest stored grain, and the brown house moth (Hofmannophila pseudospretella), which feeds on textiles and carpets as well as stored foodstuffs. Other pest species include the black-headed caterpillar (the larva of Opisina arenosella) on coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) in India, and Peleopoda arcanella on Elaeis oleifera oil palms in Central America.|$|E
50|$|Hübner, however, {{believed}} to have identified his white-shouldered house moths correctly with Fabricius' A. betulinella and disregarded T. lactella entirely. Thus, the taxon T. lactella (though not the <b>white-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> species as a whole) {{was not included in}} Endrosis at the genus' inception, and such a change of type species can only be made by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature - it is not permitted in the rules of zoological nomenclature to prevent the confusion and misinterpretations of scientific names that was frequent before the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of {{supposed}} close relatives of the <b>white-shouldered</b> <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> were described. Soon enough, they were all grouped in Endrosis. What remained unclear was how many species there were, and whether any forms stood out. With reports of the species accumulating {{from all over the}} world, it was eventually realized that this moth must have tagged along Homo sapiens and spread with human habitation since prehistoric times. In this single global gene pool, few if any current authors recognize more than a single species, E. sarcitrella.|$|E
50|$|Actual book-borers are uncommon. Two moths, {{the common}} clothes moth and the brown <b>house</b> <b>moth,</b> will attack cloth bindings. Leather-bound books attract various beetles, such as the larder beetle and the larva of the black carpet beetle and Stegobium paniceum. Larval death watch beetles and common {{furniture}} beetles will tunnel through wood and paper (if it is nearby the wood).|$|R
50|$|Phalaena is an {{obsolete}} genus of Lepidoptera used by Carl Linnaeus to <b>house</b> most <b>moths.</b>|$|R
5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown <b>house</b> <b>moth</b> attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of the}} word, “treasures,” could {{refer to}} the {{contents}} of a treasure box or a store <b>house.</b> <b>Moths</b> are often associated with the destruction of fabrics, and in this era, pieces of clothing were a major investment. What is meant by the Greek, brosis, sometimes translated as “rust,” is less certain. The word generally means “eating.” This could refer to the oxidization that eats away metals, or it could be referring to vermin, such as the mice that might consume a supply of grain, the worms that eat through wood, or even a reiteration of the aforementioned moths.|$|R
5000|$|Borkhausenia is a genus of the concealer moth family (Oecophoridae). Among these, {{it belongs}} to {{subfamily}} Oecophorinae, wherein it is probably closely related to Hofmannophila (Brown <b>House</b> <b>Moth).</b> In the past, several other Oecophoridae (e.g. Schiffermuelleria) {{have been included in}} Borkhausenia, as well as a few even more distant members of the superfamily Gelechioidea. Metalampra was originally described as a subgenus of Borkhausenia. Telechrysis has also been included here as a subgenus by some, while other authors have considered it a separate genus in the Oecophorinae or [...] - [...] if these are also considered distinct [...] - [...] the Amphisbatinae.|$|R
30|$|In Figure  8 a we can {{see that}} booklice and {{silverfish}} [i], booklice and woodlice [ii], booklice and woolly bears [iii], silverfish and woolly bears [iv] and booklice and plaster beetles [v] were found together more often than expected. Silverfish and woodlice [vi] and woolly bears and woodlice [vii] (Figure  8 b) lie close to the diagonal line and are thus near to the expected frequency. Although in smaller numbers, brown <b>house</b> <b>moths</b> (Hofmannophila pseudospretella) are found at higher than expected association with booklice [viii], and not surprisingly woolly bears are strongly associated with the varied carpet beetle [ix]- an adult form of the woolly bear. There is a lower than expected association between plaster beetles and silverfish [x] (Figure  8 b).|$|R

50|$|One {{entomologist}} visiting Gillies Hill stated, “It {{would take}} five entomologists {{a lifetime to}} inventory all the insects on this hill.” Nevertheless, 88 invertebrate species have been documented on Gillies Hill so far; mollusks, arachnids, annelids and insects which include bumblebees, wasps, ants and sawflies, damselflies, dragonflies, caddisflies, grasshoppers, stoneflies, backswimmers, butterflies, <b>moths,</b> <b>house</b> flies, ants, knapweed bugs, water striders, aphids, and a myriad of beetles.|$|R
5|$|Wallace {{returns to}} Sarawak, where {{he stays in}} the {{circular}} 'head-house' of a Dyak village, travels upriver, and describes the Durian, praising it as the king of fruits with exquisite and unsurpassed flavour, and the Dyak's slender bamboo bridges, as well as ferns and Nepenthes pitcher plants. On a mountain he finds {{the only place in}} his entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other <b>houses</b> the <b>moths</b> at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.|$|R
5000|$|Ants in the Pantry {{was filmed}} on December 11-14, 1935; the film title is a pun on the phrase [...] "ants in the pants." [...] Moe Howard later {{recalled}} that {{a nest of}} ants actually worked their way into his pants: There was a scene where we were having trouble selling our services, so we complain to our boss, who tells us, 'If they don't have ants, give them some. You dumbkopf!' We got the idea and went from house to <b>house</b> throwing <b>moths</b> in with minks, mice on the floor, and ants in the pantry. During the shooting, I hadn't noticed that a small container of red ants had broken apart in my pocket and the little devils were crawling down my back, in my hair, and into my pants. It was insane. All through the scene I was scratching and squirming and slapping myself on the neck and face and on the seat of my pants. Elated, director Preston Black shouted, 'Great Moe. Keep up that squirming!' It was very funny - to everyone but me.|$|R
40|$|I See A Darkness is a 4000 -word paper {{commissioned}} by fine art publishers, The <b>Moth</b> <b>House,</b> {{as the sole}} English-language text included in a photographic monograph on Portuguese photographer, Edgar Martins. Edgar Martins was described by pioneering video artist Bill Viola as “the most interesting photographer working today”. There are, effectively, two central research questions that underpin the paper: first, {{to what extent can}} creative media be coherently and credibly addressed as carriers of conceptual freight; secondly, to what extent and for what reasons has an aesthetics of ‘darkness’ been marginalised in photographic and other art practices. The paper marshals evidence and argument from a number of domains – including philosophy, Japanese aesthetics, popular astrophysics – in pursuit of these two questions...|$|R
50|$|The Black Witch moth is {{considered}} a harbinger of death in Mexican and Caribbean folklore. In many cultures, one of these moths flying into the house {{is considered}} bad luck: e.g., in Mexico, when there is sickness in a <b>house</b> and this <b>moth</b> enters, it is believed the sick person will die, though a variation on this theme (in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas) is that death only occurs if the moth flies in and visits all four corners of one's house (in Mesoamerica, from the prehispanic era until the present time, moths {{have been associated with}} death and the number four). In some parts of Mexico, people joke that if one flies over someone's head, the person will lose his hair.|$|R
