5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black stripes <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> {{for the vast majority}} of their history. This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> until 1988, when the familiar red and black stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and tangerine shirts with white shorts.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Hull City's first shirt badge {{mirrored}} the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston-upon-Hull, which was {{displayed on the}} sky blue shirts worn in the 1935–36 season. Following that season, the team went without wearing a badge until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> up until 1957, when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, a logo with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, The Tigers.|$|E

The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> out and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for his refusal to carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|Baxter's brigade <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> {{down and}} out of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson {{replaced}} it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul.

Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before {{the end of the}} day, three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.|$|E
5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage. Much of it <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for daily use. The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E

5|$|Once a recruit was {{accepted}} he was 'marked' on the arm, presumably a tattoo or brand, to facilitate recognition if {{he attempted to}} desert. The recruit was then issued with an identification disk (which <b>was</b> <b>worn</b> around the neck) and a certificate of enlistment (probatoria). He was then assigned to a unit. A law of 375 required those with superior fitness to be assigned to the comitatenses. In the 4th century, the minimum length of service was 20 years (24 years in some limitanei units). This compares with 25 years in both legions and auxilia during the Principate.|$|E

The commercials also featured the Danny Elfman Batman theme from Tim Burton's two films.|$|E
