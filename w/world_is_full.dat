25|$|The song Hop Hop has {{political}} tones. It {{describes how}} the states exploit the citizens for their own purposes, how today's political systems are good for nothing, since the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of violence, war, human rights are many times oppressed, we are a subject to global warming and governments do little to save us. Tarkan explained in the interview that the song examines these problems and encourages people to unite, no matter what color our skin is or what religion we follow.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} come {{the words of}} Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake {{of life in the}} present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "big" [...] musical number, [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] begins {{within the}} first fifteen minutes of Tangled during the film's first act when, {{on the eve of}} her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel finally summons enough courage to ask Gothel for {{permission}} to travel and see the floating lanterns in person. Gothel, whose eternal youth and beauty solely relies on the safety and protection of Rapunzel's magical hair, denies this request by sarcastically reminding her that [...] "mother knows best," [...] warning her ward that [...] "the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of wicked people who want to steal her hair's magic," [...] while explaining to her that it's [...] "for her own good," [...] claiming to only want to protect her. At one point during the scene, Gothel actually contradicts herself; Teena Elizabeth of BookMyShow observed, [...] "Gothel has no intentions of letting her go. Though Mother Gothel sings, 'soon, but not yet,' but ironically later says, 'Rapunzel, don't ever ask to leave this tower...again.'" [...] Writing for the Tulsa World, Michael Smith observed that Gothel uses the song [...] "as her lie/rationale for keeping the girl safe (holding her hostage) from those who might steal her for their own hair-inspired profit schemes." [...] Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew felt that the scene is both funny and scary, citing Gothel's [...] "theatrical gestures" [...] and [...] "claustrophobia-inducing stark black backgrounds" [...] as examples of both. [...] "cementing [...] character's ruthlessness," [...] Gothel ultimately orders Rapunzel to promise never to ask permission to leave the tower again. Moviefone's William Goss cited the musical number as an example of [...] "fear-mongering," [...] which has been defined by Dictionary.com as [...] "a person who creates or spreads alarming news." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail penned, [...] "Mother Knows Best hilariously convey the fear and guilt that have kept Rapunzel in the tower of her own free will." [...] In her book Marvels & Tales, author Kendra Magnusson observed that, during the [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] musical sequence, [...] "the manipulation of Rapunzel's hair leaves the heroine's body wrenched in one moment and bound up in it the next", depicting that, while Rapunzel's hair can be used to defend herself, [...] "it is simultaneously a liability" [...] and can just as well be used to harm her.|$|E

Tyler appears in the film singing the song during the title sequence. It peaked at number thirty-five on the UK Singles Chart in July 1979. Record Mirror criticised the song; its reviewer wrote: [...] "Bonnie stops chewing gravel for a minute or two..." [...] and continued with [...] "she ends up sandpapering my eardrums again.

Creativity is everywhere. ... The initial idea for a job comes to me literally just like that sometimes, and if that first idea is good then you are on the right track. It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse. But I do think a lot of creativity depends on your relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever. Your personal happiness or unhappiness comes out in your work, it's a reflection of your emotional state and you can't separate the two." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, Powell {{claimed that}} since Britain {{was not an}} ally of Kuwait in the [...] "formal sense" [...] and because {{the balance of power}} in the Middle East had ceased to be a British concern after the end of the British Empire, Britain should not go to war. Powell claimed that [...] "Saddam Hussein has a long way to go yet before his troops come {{storming}} up the beaches of Kent or Sussex". On 21 October, he wrote, [...] "The <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of evil men engaged in doing evil things. That does not make us policemen to round them up nor judges to find them guilty and to sentence them. What is so special about the ruler of Iraq that we suddenly discover that we are to be his jailers and his judges?... we as a nation have no interest in the existence or non-existence of Kuwait or, for that matter, Saudi Arabia as an independent state.

2500|$|This story echoes Mildred's [...] "Seashell ear-thimbles" [...] (i.e., a {{brand of}} in-ear headphones) that act as an {{emotional}} barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that Fahrenheit 451 is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature. Regarding minorities, {{he wrote in his}} 1979 Coda:There is {{more than one way to}} burn a book. And the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, Mattachine/Four Square Gospel feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse. Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel Fahrenheit 451, described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever. Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. Judy-Lynn del Rey, one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.|$|E
2500|$|I compare {{human life}} to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, {{the doors of the}} rest being as yet shut upon me—The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and {{notwithstanding}} the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the <b>World</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd {{and at the same time}} on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil.
