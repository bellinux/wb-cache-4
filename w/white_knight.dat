5|$|The other {{possibility}} for Black {{is to keep}} his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the <b>white</b> <b>knight</b> only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been done with this in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram at right) {{to play on the}} queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 push and have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance if the <b>white</b> <b>knight</b> moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} emblem {{that was used}} {{at the time of}} the BNR and post-Soviet independence was called the Pahonia (the chase). On the base of a red shield, an armored <b>white</b> <b>knight</b> is mounted on a silver horse, with a sword drawn and charging to the left. On the shield of the knight, a golden Patriarchal cross is displayed. A variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|The rook is {{then used}} to support a piece attack against White's castled King. Black can easily get several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The queen's arrival on the h4-square is {{facilitated}} {{by the absence of}} a <b>white</b> <b>knight</b> on the f3-square (that would otherwise cover the h4-square) and of a black knight on the f6-square (that would block the way for the black queen). If White tries to defend with h2–h3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file.|$|E
5|$|White and red were officially {{adopted as}} {{national}} colors in 1831.

Prior to that, Polish soldiers wore cockades of various color combinations. The national flag was officially adopted in 1919. Since 2004, Polish Flag Day is celebrated on May 2.|$|E

5000|$|The {{strategy}} {{that is usually}} employed by the Hostile Firm is making an offer more lucrative than the <b>White</b> <b>Knight's,</b> so that the shareholders consider rejecting the <b>White</b> <b>Knight's</b> bid.

5|$|The Knight on c6 {{is safer}} than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} a general {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the <b>white</b> <b>knight</b> on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main lines 4.Bf4, 4.Nf3 and 4.e4, the only {{significant}} other fourth move is 4.e3 to continue by 4...Nxe5 5.Nh3 (or the other move-order 4.Nh3 and 5.e3) so that the <b>white</b> <b>knight</b> starts the journey Ng1–h3–f4–d5 reach its ideal d5-square. The idea with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3 was favorite of a leading Soviet coach and writer Mikhail Shereshevsky, who wrote in his 1994 book The Soviet Chess Conveyor that the line was first shown to him by a strong correspondence player Donatas Lapienis. Black has tried to prevent White's idea by the suitably strange-looking move 5...Ng6, taking the f4-square from the Nh3. Then White can develop along various setups, the most active being 6.Qh5 with the possibility Nh3–g5 in store to recycle the knight towards a more central position. Black can also ignore White's intentions and concentrate on his own play by placing the Nb8 on c5, {{in order to put}} pressure on the d3-square. After 5...g6 6.Nf4Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Qd2 a5 11.b3 Nc5 the position of Black's knights is secured and Black's position is similar to the Leningrad variation of the Dutch Defence (once he has played f7–f5). White has no reason, however, to abandon the a1–h8 diagonal to Black, and he can try 5...g6 6.Bd2 d6 7.Nf4 Bg7 8.Bc3 0-0 9.Be2 Nbd7 10.Nd2 b6 and in one game White gained a minimal edge.|$|E
25|$|The {{design is}} quite {{different}} from the <b>White</b> <b>Knight,</b> both in size, use of tail, engine configuration and placement of cockpit(s). The <b>White</b> <b>Knight</b> uses two T-tails, but the <b>White</b> <b>Knight</b> Two uses two cruciform tails. Engine configuration is also very different. <b>White</b> <b>Knight</b> Two has four engines hung underneath the wings on pylons while White Knight's pair of engines are on either side of its single fuselage.|$|E

50|$|The <b>White</b> <b>Knights</b> of the Ku Klux Klan are {{considered}} the most militant {{as well as the}} most violent chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in history. They originated in Mississippi in the early 1960s under the leadership of Samuel Bowers, its first Grand Wizard. The <b>White</b> <b>Knights</b> of Mississippi were formed in 1964, and they included roughly 200 members of the Original Knights of Louisiana. The <b>White</b> <b>Knights</b> were not interested in holding public demonstrations or in letting any information about themselves get out to the masses. Similar to the United Klans of America (UKA), the <b>White</b> <b>Knights</b> of Mississippi were very secretive about their group. Within a year, their membership was up to around six thousand, and they had Klaverns in over half of the counties in Mississippi. But by 1967, the number of active members had shrunk to around four hundred.|$|R
