500|$|When the {{instrumentation}} was completed, Draiman {{began to}} write melody lines for each song. Draiman commented, [...] "I'm {{a big believer in}} the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate {{what it is to be}} about and so if you start with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> it?" [...] The first song completed musically was [...] "The Night", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night. As Draiman recalled, [...] "The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that I right away kind of jumped into it." [...] When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, Reprise Records, and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.|$|E
500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now {{that we want to}} do, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> the power? Let's test it and try to get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Juan Castro {{scored the}} game 8.5 out of 10. He too praised the graphics, writing [...] "EA did a {{magnificent}} job {{of bringing the}} grandeur of Middle-earth into The Third Age." [...] However, he was critical of the difficulty, claiming [...] "from the moment they brandish a weapon in-game, RPG veterans will most likely tell that EA {{went to great lengths}} to make The Third Age as accessible as possible." [...] He also criticized the story, writing [...] "gamers will be hard pressed to find an ounce of character development throughout the entire adventure," [...] and calling the characters [...] "soulless archetypes." [...] However, he concluded [...] "For the most part, The Third Age rips gamers from their living rooms and dumps them in a detailed rendition of Middle-earth. EA Redwood Shores has faithfully recreated everything from the glowing majesty of Rivendell to the murky depths of Helm's Deep. Suffice to say, this is one of the best looking games based on Tolkien's classic trilogy. But, as gamers everywhere know, looks aren't everything. It's one thing to have video games look as good as the movies they're based on, but <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> any of it if the actual gameplay isn't enough to keep you playing. Thankfully, this combat heavy RPG delivers the goods, although some die hard RPG fans may be put off by its overly streamlined approach." ...|$|E
