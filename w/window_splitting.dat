40|$|A {{group of}} {{individual}} real-time systems that must coordinate high level actions among themselves can itself {{be viewed as}} a real-time system. Often, the communications must be wireless, which being inherently noisy, constrains these high level messages to being soft, i. e., some deadlines can be missed without detrimentally effecting overall functioning. Current military systems and future interconnection of embedded real-time systems will require wireless communications. We present and compare analyses of three protocols; variations of two published protocols by Paterakis and Gallager as well as our new one, the Sliding Partition (SP) collision resolution algorithm (CRA). The modified Gallager CRA cannot be practically implemented in wireless networks but is used for comparison because it is perhaps the most famous <b>window</b> <b>splitting</b> CRA. In a real-time setting, however, it consistently performs worst of the three we consider. We observe that the time bounded Paterakis CRA offers extremel [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{applications}} require processing high-volume on-line {{streams of}} numerical data from instruments and simulations. We present an extensible stream database {{system that allows}} scalable and flexible continuous queries on such streams. Application dependent streams and query functions are defined through an Object-Relational model. Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries: <b>window</b> <b>split</b> and <b>window</b> distribute. <b>Window</b> <b>split</b> provides operators for customized parallel execution of query functions whose complexity depends on size of the data units on which they are applied. It reduces the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluated these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that <b>window</b> <b>split</b> is favorable when computational resources are limited, while window distribute is better when there are sufficient resources. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} algorithm for cloud field detection {{over the}} Antarctic region is presented. The algorithm {{is a combination}} of a conventional <b>split</b> <b>window</b> method and a spatial coherence method. The conventional <b>split</b> <b>window</b> method utilizes the brightness temperature and the brightness temperature difference between <b>split</b> <b>window</b> channels. The spatial coherence method makes use of the standard deviation of the brightness temperature difference between <b>split</b> <b>window</b> channels as an index of cloud field homogeneity. The algorithm, in principle, enables us to detect an inhomogeneous cloud field which has not been well detected with only the conventional <b>split</b> <b>window</b> method. This algorithm was applied to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data during the polar night over the Antarctic region. It is found that the improved algorithm seems to work well for an inhomogeneous cloud field as expected, although there still remains uncertainty related to the vertical structure of the cloud field. In order to investigate the vertical structure in detail, further analyses are needed such as comparison of the result to ground-based meteorological observation, radiative transfer simulation, and analysis of TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) data...|$|R

O processamento das imagens incluiu o geo-referenciamento e as correções quanto aos efeitos atmosféricos e de emissividade, para as quais se utilizou o método de correção <b>split</b> <b>window.</b> A equação de <b>split</b> <b>window</b> usada considerou o parâmetro de emissividade da superfície cultivada estimada diretamente no campo pelo método da caixa. Este método foi comparado a um método alternativo de estimativa de emissividade no campo baseado na proporção de cobertura vegetal e solo descoberto. Os dois métodos apresentaram resultados equivalentes quanto à estimativa de emissividade da superfície. A alta correlação entre a temperatura de superfície medida no campo e a obtida a partir das imagens indicou que as equações de <b>split</b> <b>window</b> usadas corrigiram satisfatoriamente as imagens quanto aos efeitos atmosféricos e de emissividadeAbstract: Diurnal and nocturnal image series {{have been}} used in this work. These images were {{processed}} on suitable software to the treatment of NOAA-AVHRR products, for Surface temperature final value obtaining. The processing work includes both the images geo-referencing and their atmospheric correction applying the "split <b>window</b> method". The <b>split</b> <b>window</b> equation used takes into account the crop surface emissivity parameter, estimated directly on the field by the "box method". This one was compared to an alternative emissivity estimate on the field method, which is based on the crop covering/bared soil relation. Both methods when compared presented similar results. A terrestrial radiometer was used to the surface temperature measurements carried out in situ, during the satellite passes. The correct surface temperature satellite data were submitted to a regression analysis against the terrestrial data about the same parameter. High association level between surface temperature measured at the field and the near air temperature was observed. The high correlation between surface temperature measured at the field and that one from the images shown that the <b>split</b> <b>window</b> equation corrected satisfactorily the atmosphere effects over the image...|$|R

The algorithm is used to analyze a time series of VAS <b>split</b> <b>window</b> radiances observed at 15 km horizontal resolution over eastern North America during a 12 hr period on 13 July 1981. Results of the color coded images of the derived precipitable water fields are found to show vivid water vapor features whose broad structure and evolution are verified by the radiosonde and surface networks. The satellite moisture fields also show significant mesoscale features and rapid developments which are not resolved by the conventional networks. The VAS <b>split</b> <b>window</b> is determined to clearly differentiate those areas in which water vapor extends over a deep layer and is more able to support convective cells from those areas in which water vapor is confined to a shallow layer and is therefore less able to support convection. It is concluded that the VAS <b>split</b> <b>windows</b> can be used operationally to monitor mesoscale developments in the low-level moisture fields over relatively cloud-free areas of the United States...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a new {{vehicle routing problem}} that simultaneously involves time <b>windows,</b> <b>split</b> collection and linear weight-related cost, which is a generalization of the split delivery vehicle routing problem with time windows (SDVRPTW). This problem consists of determining least-cost vehicle routes to serve a set of customers while respecting the restrictions of vehicle capacity and time windows. The travel cost per unit distance is a linear function of the vehicle weight and the customer demand can be fulfilled by multiple vehicles. To solve this problem, we propose a exact branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, where the pricing subproblem is a resource-constrained elementary least-cost path problem. We first prove that at least an optimal solution to the pricing subproblem is associated with an extreme collection pattern, and then design a tailored and novel label-setting algorithm to solve it. Computational results show that our proposed algorithm can handle both the SDVRPTW and our problem effectively. Comment: 22 page...|$|R
