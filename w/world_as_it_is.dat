5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History <b>world,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> widely {{believed to be the}} first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
25|$|For Friedrich Nietzsche, life {{is worth}} living {{only if there}} are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw {{nihilism}} ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the <b>world,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} the Old Lady finally agrees {{to sit for}} George, losing herself in fond {{memories}} of his childhood that George repeatedly disputes. She bemoans Paris's changing skyline, and he encourages her to see the beauty in the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> rather than how it has been ("Beautiful"). The American Tourists arrive with Louis and Dot, who holds her newborn daughter, Marie. George refuses to acknowledge her or his child, able to offer only a feeble apology as Dot departs sadly.|$|E

25|$|Since {{resolution}} {{in space and}} time is lost in each node as described above, beliefs formed by higher-level nodes represent an even larger range of space and time. This is meant to reflect the organization of the physical <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> perceived by human brain. Larger concepts (e.g. causes, actions and objects) are perceived to change more slowly and consist of smaller concepts that change more quickly. Jeff Hawkins postulates that brains evolved this type of hierarchy to match, predict, and affect the organization of the external world.|$|E
25|$|While {{recording}} Henry Cow's last album, differences emerged {{between the}} group members over the album's content. Frith and Chris Cutler favoured song-oriented material, while Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper wanted purely instrumental compositions. As a compromise, Frith and Cutler agreed, early in 1978, {{to release the}} songs already created on their own album, Hopes and Fears, under the name Art Bears (with Dagmar Krause). The instrumental material was recorded by Henry Cow on Western Culture later that year, after which the band split. The Art Bears trio continued purely as a studio group until 1981, releasing two more albums, Winter Songs in 1979 and The <b>World</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Is</b> Today in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Finnish mythology {{and more}} {{specifically}} the Finnish national epic Kalevala were also acknowledged by Tolkien as an influence on Middle-earth. In {{a manner similar to}} The Lord of the Rings, the Kalevala centres around a magical item of great power, the Sampo, which bestows great fortune on its owner, but never makes clear its exact nature. Like the One Ring, the Sampo is fought over by forces of good and evil, and is ultimately lost to the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> destroyed {{towards the end of the}} story. In another parallel, the work's wizard character, Väinämöinen, is similar to Gandalf in his immortal origins and wise nature, and both works end with the wizard character departing on a ship to lands beyond the mortal world. Tolkien also based elements of his Elvish language Quenya on Finnish.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "WALL-E: from {{environmental}} adaption to sentimental nostalgia," [...] Robin Murray and Joseph Heuman explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, i.e. Zippo lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items {{that we use}} out of necessity, are made sentimental {{through the lens of}} the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing [...] "Put on Your Sunday Clothes", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural <b>world,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.|$|E
500|$|The film {{presents}} Ricky as its [...] "visionary, {{spiritual and}} mystical center". He sees {{beauty in the}} minutiae of everyday life, videoing {{as much as he}} can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was [...] "an entire life behind things"; he feels that [...] "sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in." [...] Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the [...] "cultural dross", has [...] " [...] the radiant splendor of the created world" [...] to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world. Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family [...] "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with [...] "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By {{looking back}} to Book XV of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare also gives a modern view (one that {{includes}} minutes) of an ancient view of time, one that provides a contrast to the more mechanized time of the 1590s. Time, in Ovid's work {{and in the first}} three quatrains of Sonnet 60, is intertwined with the processes of nature, {{looking back to}} a time before time and nature were fractured. [...] Just as the poem struggles with time, so Shakespeare's modernized use of Ovid struggles to reconcile the past view of time and the present view of time, the world as it was, and the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
