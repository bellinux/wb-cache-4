5000|$|Eight {{species of}} {{whistling}} duck are currently {{recognized in the}} genus Dendrocygna. However, Johnsgard considers the <b>white-backed</b> <b>duck</b> (Thalassornis leuconotus) from Africa and Madagascar to be distinct ninth species, a view first proposed in 1960 and initially supported by behavioral similarities. Later, similarities in anatomy, duckling vocalizations, and feather proteins gave additional support. Molecular analysis in 2009 also suggested that the <b>white-backed</b> <b>duck</b> was nested within the whistling duck clade. In addition to the [...] species, subfossil remains of an extinct, undescribed species have been found on Aitutaki of the Cook Islands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-backed</b> <b>duck</b> (Thalassornis leuconotus) is a waterbird of {{the family}} Anatidae. It is {{distinct}} from all other ducks, but most {{closely related to the}} whistling ducks in the subfamily Dendrocygninae, though also showing some similarities to the stiff-tailed ducks in the subfamily Oxyurinae. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Thalassornis.|$|E

50|$|<b>White-backed</b> <b>ducks</b> live in {{southern}} Africa, especially between Senegal and Chad {{in the west}} and Ethiopia and South Africa in the east. Their habitat consists of lakes, ponds, swamps and marshes where they are well camouflaged against predators.|$|R
50|$|Whistling duck taxonomy, {{including}} that of the entire infraorder Anseriformes, is complicated and disputed. Under a traditional classification proposed by ornithologist Jean Théodore Delacour based on morphological and behavioral traits, whistling ducks belong to the tribe Dendrocygnini under the family Anatidae and subfamily Anserinae. Following the revisions by ornithologist Paul Johnsgard, Dendrocygnini includes the genus Thalassornis (the <b>white-backed</b> <b>duck)</b> under this system.|$|E
50|$|Altogether, {{however, the}} only thing that seems clear is that the musk ducks {{probably}} {{are not part of the}} stiff-tailed ducks in the strict sense, but rather represent a not-too-distantly related lineage that is highly convergent as regards their hind limb anatomy. These two are probably part of a very ancient radiation of Gondwanan (often Australian) waterfowl, including such forms as the Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis), the coscoroba swan (Coscoroba), the freckled duck (Stictonetta) which once was placed in the Oxyurinae, or the pygmy geese (Nettapus), but the exact relationships between these lineages remains unresolved. For example, the African <b>white-backed</b> <b>duck</b> (Thalassornis) also shows some similarities to Oxyura, but again, this may be yet another case of convergent evolution.|$|E

Most of the species are tropical in distribution, and {{in all of them}} the pair bond seems to be permanent and potentially lifelong. Both sexes share equally in brood-rearing responsibilities, and in some species the male is known to participate in incubation as well. Unlike those of geese and swans, the downy young are distinctively patterned. Although the downy young of the <b>white-backed</b> <b>duck</b> differ somewhat from those of Dendrocygna, the species shares a sufficiently large number of behavioral and anatomical traits to be tentatively included in this tribe...|$|E
40|$|Ten wildfowl taxa are {{resident}} in Madagascar including four endemics: Madagascar <b>White-backed</b> <b>Duck</b> Thalassornis leuconotus insularis, Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri, Meller’s Duck A. melleri and Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata. These endemic duck taxa were amongst the last wildfowl forms {{to be described}} in Africa and are undoubtedly currently the rarest in this region. The history of our knowledge of these birds follows four easily definable stages: discovery, understanding, protection and the future. The new millennium has started with a much more detailed understanding of the four ducks ’ ecology than ever before, the protection of several key sites and the re-discovery in 2006 of the Madagascar Pochard. The next few years will tell if the ducks have a more secure future and, while not yet safe, Madagascar’s ducks are perhaps now among the better known of Africa’s endemic wildfowl. Key words: endemic, Madagascar, protection, status review, wildfowl. Madagascar has ten extant species of wildfowl (Anatidae) with a further two species (of sheldgeese) Centrornis majori and Alopochen sirabensis known only from sub-fossil remains (Table 1) (Young et al. 2003; Young & Kear 2006). The extant taxa include three full endemic species and an endemic subspecies with varied geographical origins: two species – Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri and Madagascar Pochard Aythya innotata – are of Australo/Asian origins, and two others...|$|E
40|$|Whistling ducks {{comprise}} {{a group of}} nine species that are primarily of tropical and subtropical distribution. In common with the swans and true geese (which with them comprise the subfamily Anserinae), the included species have a reticulated tarsal surface pattern, lack sexual dimorphism in plumage, produce vocalizations that are similar or identical in both sexes, form relatively permanent pair bonds, and lack complex pair-forming behavior patterns. Unlike the geese and swans, whistling ducks have clear, often melodious whistling voices that are the basis for their group name. The alternative name, tree ducks, is far less appropriate, since few of the species regularly perch or nest in trees. All the species have relatively long legs and large feet that extend beyond the fairly short tail when the birds are in flight. They dive well, and some species obtain much of their food in this manner. Eight species are represented in the genus Dendrocygna, including {{all three of the}} species included in this book. A ninth species, the African and Madagascan <b>white-backed</b> <b>duck</b> (Thalassornis leuconotus), is considered by the author (Johnsgard, 1966) to be an aberrant whistling duck. Two of the three species included in this book regularly nest in the southern United States, while the third (the Cuban whistling duck) might be regarded as North American {{on the basis of its}} occurrence in the West Indies, although it is not known to have ever reached continental North America...|$|E
40|$|The stiff-tailed ducks {{constitute}} a unique {{section of the}} Anatidae that is possibly the most isolated of all the tribes {{with the exception of}} the Anseranatini. There are eight species which almost certainly belong in the group, plus one more that is only very tentatively included. The tribe is of worldwide occurrence. Seven of the species have long, narrow, and stiffened tail feathers that function as rudders in underwater swimming, at which all species are very adept. These species also have a dense and shiny body plumage much like that of grebes, but lack metallic coloration altogether. The typical species have short, thick necks with loose-fitting skin that can be expanded through the inflation of the esophagus or special air sacs. All species have large feet and their legs are placed well toward the rear, which results in a poor walking ability. All species but the most aberrant one (the <b>white-backed</b> <b>duck)</b> exhibit sexual dimorphism. Vocalizations are extremely variable, and male calls are often produced by extra-tracheal structures. Sexual maturity is probably reached in the first year in all but one of the species (the musk duck), and pairs are probably renewed yearly in most and quite possibly all species. Male displays are generally elaborate and tend to produce sound. Nests are generally built over the water surface and the eggs are generally chalky white and relatively large, the young being very precocial at hatching...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to test and evaluate the various taxonomic arrangements of the family, to discover some of the trends of behavioral evolution, {{and to provide a}} basis for future workers to use in naming, describing, and evaluating the behavioral patterns observed in waterfowl. The major sexual behavior patterns of the species of Anatidae are reviewed and summarized, for the purpose of clarifying evolutionary relationships in the family, tracing the evolution of behavior patterns through various taxa, and evaluating the importance of certain behavior patterns as potential isolating mechanisms.
