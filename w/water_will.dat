Donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault. After defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure, Donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue. When the disappointed Donald returns home, Huey, Dewey and Louie accidentally break the statue, which reveals a golden jeweled necklace was hidden inside. Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} of Category 3 {{and higher}} {{are described as}} major hurricanes in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific basins. These storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures. Buildings that lack a solid foundation, such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and gable-end roofs are peeled off. Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by floating debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Additionally, terrain may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and <b>water</b> <b>will</b> likely also be lost or contaminated.|$|E

25|$|The second {{technique}} for cryoconservation is vitrification or flash freezing. Vitrification is the transformation from a liquid to solid state without {{the formation of}} crystals. The process and mechanics of vitrification are similar to slow freezing, the difference lying in the concentration of the medium. The vitrification method applies a selected medium which has a higher concentration of solute so the <b>water</b> <b>will</b> leave the cells via osmosis. The medium is concentrated enough so all of the intracellular <b>water</b> <b>will</b> leave without the medium needing to be reconcentrated. The higher concentration of the medium in vitrification allows the germplasms to be frozen more rapidly than with slow freezing. Vitrification {{is considered to be}} the more effective technique of freezing germplasms.|$|E
