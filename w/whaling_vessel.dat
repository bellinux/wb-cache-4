5|$|His first ocean misadventure {{does not}} dissuade Pym from sailing again; rather, his {{imagination}} is ignited by the experience. His interest is further {{fueled by the}} tales of a sailor's life that Augustus tells him. Pym decides to follow Augustus as a stowaway aboard the Grampus, a <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel</b> commanded by Augustus's father that is bound for the southern seas. Augustus helps Pym by preparing a hideout in the hold for him and smuggling Tiger, Pym's faithful dog, on board. Augustus promises to provide Pym with water and food until the ship is too far from shore to return, at which time Pym wants to reveal himself.|$|E
5|$|Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He {{captured}} a <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel</b> 80miles (130km) out at sea, {{and in a}} foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound {{and the loss of}} Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They were lucky, and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.|$|E

The ship {{had been attacked}} by Ju 88 dive bombers of III./KG 30 east-north-east of Bear Island on 5 July, the day after Convoy PQ 17 dispersed. The crew had abandoned the badly damaged ship, believing {{it was about to}} sink. All 76 of the crew had taken five days to reach land at Novaya Zemlya, eventually being rescued by a Soviet <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel.</b> After finding her the II.WO and two mates from U-255 boarded the ship, and attempted to start the engines, but the engine room was flooded. They then searched the vessel, taking blankets, cigarettes, and other useful materials, including confidential documents found on the bridge, and the ship's ensign as a prize, before the ship was sunk with a single torpedo. U-255 returned to Narvik on 15 July.|$|E

25|$|The Italian nobleman Luigi Amedeo {{organized}} {{an expedition}} to sail as far north by land as possible and then traverse the ice sheet with sledges to the North Pole. He bought the Norwegian <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel</b> Jason, which he christened Stalle Polare. The expedition left Christiania on 12June 1899, taking on board 121 dogs in Arkhangelsk, which they left on 12July. After sighting Northbrook Island on 21July, they subsequently encountered the Capella and Wellman on 6August, while stuck in ice in the British Channel. The Stalle Polare eventually broke free and sailed north to Rupert Island. Although hoping to continue along Petermann or King Oscar Lands, they established that no such lands were visible and instead established a winter base at Replitz Bay. From August onwards, the ice proved strong enough for a dog sleigh expedition to explore the island.|$|E
25|$|In early 1786, the Enderby family lobbied the {{government}} for the right to go into the South Pacific (an area in which the East India Company had historically enjoyed a monopoly). The lobbying efforts were eventually successful, and on 1 September 1788, the 270 ton <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel</b> Amelia, owned by Samuel Enderby & Sons and commanded by Captain James Shields, departed London. The ship went west around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean to become the first ship of any nation to conduct whaling operations in the Southern Ocean. A crewman, Archelus Hammond of Nantucket, killed the first sperm whale there off the coast of Chile on 3 March 1789. Amelia returned to London on 12 March 1790 with a cargo of 139 tons of sperm oil.

2500|$|The Larsen Ice Shelf {{is a long}} {{ice shelf}} in the {{northwest}} part of the Weddell Sea, extending along {{the east coast of}} the Antarctic Peninsula from Cape Longing to Smith Peninsula. In 2005, it covered approximately 78500 km2 of the earth's sea with exceptionally thick ice. It is named for Captain Carl Anton Larsen, the master of the Norwegian <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel</b> Jason, who sailed along the ice front as far as 68°10' South during December 1893. In finer detail, the Larsen Ice Shelf is a series of shelves that occupy (or occupied) distinct embayments along the coast.

[...] Further south, Larsen D and the much smaller Larsen E, F and G are also named.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the hardships}} {{created by the}} nature of the Nullarbor, European {{settlers}} were determined to cross the plain. Although Edward John Eyre described the Plain as [...] "a hideous anomaly, a blot on the face of Nature, the sort of place one gets into in bad dreams", he became the first European to successfully make the crossing in 1841. Eyre departed Fowler's Bay on 17 November 1840 with John Baxter and a party of three Aboriginal men. When three of his horses died of dehydration, he returned to Fowler's Bay. He departed with a second expedition on 25 February 1841. By 29 April, the party had reached Caiguna. Lack of supplies and water led to a mutiny. Two of the Aborigines killed Baxter and took the party's supplies. Eyre and the third Aborigine, Wylie, continued on their journey, surviving through bushcraft and some fortuitous circumstances, such as receiving some supplies from a French <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel</b> anchored at Rossiter Bay.

2500|$|Numerous shipyards {{developed}} along Port Jefferson's {{harbor and}} the village's shipbuilding industry became {{the largest in}} Suffolk County. [...] A common misconception {{is the belief that}} the village was as a major whaling port. This is not supported by Government documents used to compile the two definitive references on the American Whale fishery. These two works list every vessel and every voyage undertaken by American whaling vessels from colonial days until the 1920s, none of which began or ended at Port Jefferson. However two whaling vessels were built for New Bedford at Port Jefferson in 1877 (ship Horatio and bark Fleetwing), and a Port Jefferson built schooner (La Ninfa) was later converted into a <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel</b> at San Francisco. Port Jefferson's main role as a port in the 19th Century was to build and support vessels engaged in the coastal freighting trades. Many of Port Jefferson's remaining homes from this period were owned by shipbuilders and captains.

60|$|It was noon of the 10th of August, 1838. The {{monotonous}} {{coast line}} between Monterey and San Diego had set its hard outlines against the steady {{glare of the}} Californian sky and the metallic glitter of the Pacific Ocean. The weary succession of rounded, dome-like hills obliterated all sense of distance; the rare <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel</b> or still rarer trader, drifting past, saw no change in these rusty undulations, barren of distinguishing peak or headland, and bald of wooded crest or timbered ravine. The withered ranks of wild oats gave a dull procession of uniform color to the hills, unbroken by any relief of shadow in their smooth, round curves. As {{far as the eye}} could reach, sea and shore met in one bleak monotony, flecked by no passing cloud, stirred by no sign of life or motion. Even sound was absent; the Angelus, rung from the invisible Mission tower far inland, was driven back again by the steady northwest trades, that for half the year had swept the coast line and left it abraded of all umbrage and color.|$|E
60|$|The weather {{continued}} very bad, but it at last permitted us {{to proceed}} with the survey. The time hung heavy on our hands, as it always did when we were delayed from day to day by successive gales of wind. In the evening another harbour was discovered, where we anchored. Directly afterwards a man was seen waving his shirt, and a boat was sent which brought back two seamen. A party of six had run away from an American <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel,</b> and had landed a little to the southward in a boat, which was shortly afterwards knocked to pieces by the surf. They had now been wandering up and down the coast for fifteen months, without knowing which way to go, or where they were. What a singular piece of good fortune it was that this harbour was now discovered! Had it not been for this one chance, they might have wandered till they had grown old men, and at last have perished on this wild coast. Their sufferings had been very great, and one of their party had lost his life by falling from the cliffs. They were sometimes obliged to separate in search of food, and this explained the bed of the solitary man. Considering what they had undergone, I think they had kept a very good reckoning of time, for they had lost only four days.|$|E
60|$|I {{have before}} stated {{more than once}} that my intellect, for some period prior to this, {{had been in a}} {{condition}} nearly bordering on idiocy. There were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. It must be remembered that I had been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a <b>whaling</b> <b>vessel,</b> and for a long portion of that time but scantily supplied with water. For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I had none--nor had I slept during that time. Salt provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, {{with the exception of the}} sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and in every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested itself that I had examined only one side of the paper. I shall not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight I had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. The blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise--in my disappointment at not finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.|$|E
