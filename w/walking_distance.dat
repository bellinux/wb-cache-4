40|$|PURPOSE: The {{present study}} evaluates the intra- and inter-unit {{variability}} of the GlobalSat(R) DG 100 GPS data logger/receiver (DG 100) when estimating outdoor <b>walking</b> <b>distances</b> and speeds. METHODS: Two experiments were performed using healthy subjects {{walking on a}} 400 m outdoor synthetic track. The two experiments consisted of two different outdoor prescribed <b>walking</b> protocols with <b>distances</b> ranging from 50 to 400 m. Experiment 1 examined the intra-unit variability of the DG 100 (test-retest reproducibility) when estimating <b>walking</b> <b>distances.</b> Experiment 2 examined the inter-unit variability of four DG 100 devices (unit to unit variability) when estimating <b>walking</b> <b>distances</b> and speeds. RESULTS: The coefficient of variation [95 % confidence interval], for the reliability of estimating <b>walking</b> <b>distances,</b> was 2. 8 [2. 5 - 3. 2] %. The inter-unit variability among the four DG 100 units tested ranged from 2. 8 [2. 5 - 3. 2] % to 3. 9 [3. 5 - 4. 4] % when estimating distances and from 2. 7 [2. 4 - 3. 0] % to 3. 8 [3. 4 - 4. 2] % when estimating speeds. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that the DG 100, an economical and convenient GPS data logger/receiver, can be reliably used to study human outdoor walking activities in unobstructed conditions.

40|$|This paper uses a novel {{method of}} {{analysis}} to define the optimal configuration of airport passenger buildings for travelers. The approach explicitly recognizes two significant practical facts omitted in previous work: (1) the importance of transfer passengers, who may comprise 50 % {{or more of the}} travelers; and (2) the way airlines intelligently position aircraft at gates to minimize the <b>walking</b> <b>distances</b> between connecting flights. The analysis breaks the issue of finding the <b>walking</b> <b>distances</b> of travelers into two parts: (1) an "impedance " matrix that defines the distance or level of difficulty in transiting between any gates, and that results from architectural considerations; and (2) a "flow " matrix that defines the number of passengers going between gates. Multiplication of these matrices results in a "passenger-impedance " matrix that defines the distribution of <b>walking</b> <b>distances</b> or travel time for travelers. Comparison of these distributions shows the relative advantage of different configurations. Results suggest that, {{from the perspective of the}} travelers, intelligently managed linear mid-field concourses generally provide the best overall configuration for significant airports passenger buildings...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{decision}} model to choose between kitting and line stocking at the level of single parts, while taking into account the variable operator <b>walking</b> <b>distances.</b> Different ways of feeding assembly lines, such as kitting and line stocking not only have an impact on in-plant logistics flows but also determine the amount of stock that is available at the line. This, in turn, has an impact on operator <b>walking</b> <b>distances</b> during assembly. Design/methodology/approach – A mixed integer linear programming model is developed for the assignment of parts to one of both methods, and to be able to extensively test the model, an algorithm is created for the construction of representative datasets. Findings – Parts are often kitted because of a space constraint at the line, but even without a space constraint, the shorter <b>walking</b> <b>distances</b> might give preference to kitting. An analysis is presented that demonstrates how specific part characteristics influence the chances of a part being kitted. Research limitations/implications – Our research model can be extended to include, e. g., the study of alternative in-plant logistic designs and the outsourcing of kitting to a third-party logistics provider (3 PL) or to the suppliers. Practical implications – The objective assignment model and the insights obtained from it are valuable for logistics and production engineers that otherwise have to rely solely on intuition. In situations with thousands of components, intuition mostly falls far short. Originality/value – First, existing models do not consider variable <b>walking</b> <b>distances,</b> which are shown to have a crucial impact on the decision. Second, the data instances created allow for a systematic comparison of future research in the field...|$|R
