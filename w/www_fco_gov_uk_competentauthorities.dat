40|$|<b>Gov.</b> <b>UK</b> Verify, the new Electronic Identity (eID) Management {{system of}} the UK Government, has been {{promoted}} as a state-of-the-art privacy-preserving system, designed around demands for better privacy and control, and is the first eID {{system in which the}} government delegates the provision of identity to competing private third parties. Under the EU eIDAS, Member States can allow their citizens to transact with foreign services by notifying their national eID systems. Once a system is notified, all other Member States are obligated to incorporate it into their electronic identification procedures. The paper offers a discussion of <b>Gov.</b> <b>UK</b> Verify's compliance with eIDAS as well as <b>Gov.</b> <b>UK</b> Verify's potential legal equivalence to EU systems under eIDAS as a third-country legal framework after Brexit. To this end it examines the requirements set forth by eIDAS for national eID systems, classifies these requirements in relation to their ratio legis and organises them into five sets. The paper proposes a more thorough framework than the current regime to decide on legal equivalence and attempts a first application in the case of <b>Gov.</b> <b>UK</b> Verify. It then assesses <b>Gov.</b> <b>UK</b> Verify's compliance against the aforementioned set of requirements and the impact of the system's design on privacy and data protection. The article contributes to relevant literature of privacy{preserving eID management by offering policy and technical recommendations for compliance with the new Regulation and an evaluation of interoperability under eIDAS between systems of different architecture. It is also, to our knowledge, the first exploration of the future of eID management in the UK after a potential exit from the European Union...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Available online public/governmental {{services}} re-quiring authentication {{by citizens}} have considerably expanded in recent years. This has hindered the usability and security associated with credential management by users and service providers. To address the problem, some countries have pro-posed nation-scale identification/authentication systems that intend to greatly reduce {{the burden of}} credential management, while seemingly offering desirable privacy benefits. In this pa-per we analyze two such systems: the Federal Cloud Creden-tial Exchange (FCCX) in the United States and <b>GOV.</b> <b>UK</b> Verify in the United Kingdom, which altogether aim at serving {{more than a hundred}} million citizens. Both systems propose a bro-kered identification architecture, where an online central hub mediates user authentications between identity providers and service providers. We show that both FCCX and <b>GOV.</b> <b>UK</b> Ver-ify suffer from serious privacy and security shortcomings, fail to comply with privacy-preserving guidelines they are meant to follow, and may actually degrade user privacy. Notably, the hub can link interactions of the same user across different ser-vice providers and has visibility over private identifiable in-formation of citizens. In case of malicious compromise it is also able to undetectably impersonate users. Within the struc-tural design constraints placed on these nation-scale brokered identification systems, we propose feasible technical solutions to the privacy and security issues we identified. We conclude with a strong recommendation that FCCX and <b>GOV.</b> <b>UK</b> Ver-ify be subject to a more in-depth technical and public review, based on a defined and comprehensive threat model, and adopt adequate structural adjustments...|$|R
40|$|The UK Government {{has been}} {{designing}} a new Electronic Identity Management (eIDM) system that, once rolled-out, {{will take over}} how citizens authenticate against online public services. This system, <b>Gov.</b> <b>UK</b> Verify, has been promoted as a state-of-the-art privacy-preserving system, tailored {{to meet the requirements}} of UK citizens and is the first eIDM interoperability in which the government does not act as an identity provider itself, delegating the provision of identity to competing third parties. According to the recently enacted EU eIDAS Regulation, member states can allow their citizens to transact with foreign services by notifying their national eID scheme. Once a scheme is notified, all other member states are obligated to incorporate it into their electronic identification procedures. The UK Government is contemplating at the moment whether it would be beneficial to notify. This article examines <b>Gov.</b> <b>UK</b> Verify 's compliance with the requirements set forth by the Regulation and the impact on privacy and data protection.

40|$|Over the {{previous}} decade a number of initiatives within European Union (EU) Member States, in particular the UK, have attempted to open up access to public sector data for broader economic and social uses. Driving some of these initiatives has been the ambition to increase the transparency of public bodies and, as a result, improve the democratic process. Other initiatives have had an economic agenda that see the opening up of public sector data for commercial exploitation {{as a way to}} stimulate economic activity and growth. In the UK, the launch of the data. <b>gov.</b> <b>uk</b> website in 2010 combines both these ambitions by making over 8, 000 public data sets available for third parties to download and build information services on top of. This paper examines a sample of these data sets {{as well as some of}} the applications that have been developed from them and uses a conceptual model developed by Yu and Robinson (2012) in the US. The model provides a basis for determining the technical characteristics of the data (is it adaptable or inert) as well as the primary purpose of the data (is it to improve service delivery or public accountability). Based on the analysis of the sample of data sets from the data. <b>gov.</b> <b>uk</b> website, it is concluded that Yu and Robinson’s framework provides a useful basis for separating the technical characteristics of public data from the purposes to which they can be put.

The harbour seal population in Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland, has reduced by 65 % between 2001 and 2010. The cause(s) of this decline are unknown but must affect the demographic parameters of the population. Here, satellite telemetry data were used to test the hypothesis that increased pup mortality could be a primary driver of the decline in Orkney. Pup mortality and tag failure parameters were estimated from the duration of operation of atellite tags deployed on harbour seal pups from the Orkney population (n = 4) and from another population on the west coast of Scotland (n = 24) where abundance was stable. Survival probabilities from both populations were best represented by a common gamma distribution and were not different from one another, suggesting that increased pup mortality is unlikely to be the primary agent in the Orkney population decline. The estimated probability of surviving to 6 months was 0. 390 (95 % CI 0. 297 – 0. 648) and tag failure was represented by a Gaussian distribution, with estimated mean 270 (95 % CI = 198 – 288) and s. d. 21 (95 % CI = 1 – 66) days. These results suggest that adult survival is the most likely proximate cause of the decline. They also demonstrate a novel technique for attaining age-specific mortality rates from telemetry data.
