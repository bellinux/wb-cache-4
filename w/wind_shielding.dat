To address this issue, tobacco Nicotiana tabacum plants were subjected to two levels of mechanical stress, 0 (control) or 40 (flexed) daily flexures, and grown solitarily, in a dense monostand (with plants of only one mechanical treatment), or in a mixed stand (flexed and control plants grown together). Flexed plants produced shorter and thicker stems with a lower Young's modulus than control plants, while dense-stand plants had relatively taller and thinner stems than solitary ones. Flexing effects on stem characteristics were independent of stand density. Growth, reproduction, and survival of solitary plants were not affected by flexing, while in the monostand growth was slightly reduced. But in the mixed stand, flexed plants were readily shaded by controls and had considerably lower growth, survival, and reproduction rates. These results suggest that <b>wind</b> <b>shielding</b> indeed {{plays a role in}} the plastic increase in stem elongation of plants in dense vegetation and that this response can have important consequences for competitive ability and lifetime seed production...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of natural night-ventilation {{in the urban}} environment depends on local climate char- acteristics, but also on solar shading and <b>wind</b> <b>shielding</b> effects of the surrounding buildings. However, {{the impact of the}} latter factors on the {{effectiveness of}} night-ventilation is often disregarded, altering the predicted building energy performance.

30|$|The {{surface of}} the Moon {{undergoes}} space weathering due to the continuous bombardment by high-energy solar wind plasma (Denevi et al. 2014 and references therein). The shielding of the surface from solar wind plasma by magnetic anomalies shows that the weathering is not uniform across the surface. The regions inside anomalies undergo less weathering and the region surrounding the local magnetic field received more solar wind flux. Thus the maturity of the soil is different at different locations on the Moon. This variable weathering {{is seen in the}} spectral features of the regions around the magnetic anomalies such as the high albedo regions known as ‘swirls’ (Blewett et al. 2011 and references therein). It has been found that most of the observed swirls have been associated with magnetic anomalies and are located inside the anomalies such as swirls of Reiner Gamma and the swirls in Mare Ingenii and Mare Marginis. The compositional analysis of several swirl regions by Blewett et al. (2011) showed the spectral characteristics of swirls to be similar to that of immature material and swirls were found to have slightly lower FeO values compared with their surroundings.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} undertaken {{to determine if}} wing shielding could reduce the noise impacting the fuselage of an advanced turboprop airplane. Four wings were tested behind two eight-bladed propeller models. Significant shielding of the propeller noise was observed and a particular wing-propeller geometry was identified to provide the most shielding. Specifically, an up-inboard rotation would be needed for a low-wing airplane and a down-inboard rotation for a high-wing airplane. As the axial Mach number was increased, the position where the shielding starts moved farther downstream. This shift in the start of shielding was roughly a straight line with respect to Mach number between M = 0. 7 and M = 0. 8. At M = 0. 85 the start of shielding does not shift any farther downstream. A simple barrier noise-reduction model gave the same trends with transducer positions as did the data, and, if corrected for Mach number shift, the model {{might be used to}} provide estimates of the wing shielding. Besides providing a barrier to the noise reaching the shielded area, the wing also reflects some of the noise back onto the unshielded area.

This report summarizes the efforts of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) to assess the impacts of HIR measures on building cooling- and heating-energy use. We discuss our efforts to calculate annual energy savings and peak-power avoidance of HIR strategies in the building sector of the Greater Toronto Area. The analysis is focused on three major building types that offer most saving potentials: residence, office and retail store. Using an hourly building energy simulation model, we quantify the energy saving potentials of (1) using cool roofs on individual buildings [direct effect], (2) planting deciduous shade trees near south and west walls of building [direct effect], (3) planting coniferous wind-shielding vegetation near building [direct effect], (4) ambient cooling by a large-scale program of urban reforestation with reflective building roofs and pavements [indirect effect], (5) and the combined direct and indirect effects. Results show potential annual energy savings of over $ 11 M (with uniform residential and commercial electricity and gas prices of $ 0. 084 /kWh and $ 5. 54 /GJ) could be realized by ratepayers from the combined direct and indirect effects of HIR strategies. Of that total, about 88 percent was from the direct impact roughly divided equally among reflective roofs, shade trees and wind-shielding, and the remainder (12 percent) from the indirect impact of the cooler ambient air temperature. The residential sector accounts for over half (59 percent) of the total, offices 13 percent and retail stores 28 percent. Savings from cool roofs were about 20 percent, shade trees 30 percent, <b>wind</b> <b>shielding</b> of tree 37 percent, and indirect effect 12 percent. These results are highly sensitive to the price of gas. Assuming a residential gas price of $ 10. 84 /GJ (gas price during December 2001), the net annual savings are reduced to about $ 10 M; about 78 percent resulted from wind-shielding, 16 percent from shading by trees, and 5 percent from cool roofs. Potential annual electricity savings were estimated at about 150 GWh or over $ 12 M, of that about 75 percent accrued from roofs and shade trees and only 2 percent from <b>wind</b> <b>shielding.</b> The indirect effect was 23 percent.

40|$|Melting icebergs are {{a mobile}} source {{of fresh water}} {{as well as a}} sink of latent heat. In most global climate models, the spatio-temporal {{redistribution}} of fresh water and latent heat fluxes related to icebergs is parameterized by an instantaneous more or less arbitrary flux distribution over some parts of the oceans. It is uncertain if such a parameterization provides a realistic representation of the role of icebergs in the coupled climate system. However, icebergs could have a significant climate role, in particular during past abrupt climate change events which have been associated with armada’s of icebergs. We therefore present the interactive coupling of a global climate model to a dynamic thermodynamic iceberg model, leading to a more plausible spatio-temporal redistribution of fresh water and heat fluxes. We show first that our model is able to reproduce a reasonable iceberg distribution in both hemispheres when compared to recent data. Second, in a series of sensitivity experiments we explore cooling and freshening effects of dynamical icebergs on the upper Southern Ocean and we compare these dynamic iceberg results to the effects of an equivalent parameterized iceberg flux. In our model without interactive icebergs, the parameterized fluxes are distributed homogeneously South of 55 °S, whereas dynamic icebergs are found to be concentrated closer to shore except for a plume of icebergs floating North–East from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Compared to homogeneous fluxes, the dynamic icebergs lead to a 10 % greater net production of Antarctic bottom water (AABW). This increased bottom water production involves open ocean convection, which is enhanced by a less efficient stratification of the ocean when comparing to a homogeneous flux distribution. Icebergs facilitate the formation of sea-ice. In the sensitivity experiments, both the fresh water and the cooling flux lead to a significant increase in sea-ice area of 12 % and 6 %, respectively, directly affecting the highly coupled and interactive air/sea/ice system. The consequences are most pronounced along the sea-ice edge, where this sea-ice facilitation has the greatest potential to affect ocean stratification, for example by heat insulation and <b>wind</b> <b>shielding,</b> which further amplifies the cooling and freshening of the surface waters...|$|E
40|$|Unlike the Earth and Mercury, our Moon has no global {{magnetic}} field {{and is therefore}} not shielded from the impinging solar wind by a magnetosphere. However, lunar {{magnetic field}} measurements made by the Apollo missions provided direct evidence that the Moon has regions of small-scale crustal magnetic fields, ranging up to a few 100 km in scale size with surface magnetic field strengths up to hundreds of nanoTeslas. More recently, the Lunar Prospector spacecraft has provided high-resolution observations allowing to construct magnetic field maps of the entire Moon, confirming the earlier results from Apollo, but also showing that the lunar plasma environment is much richer than earlier believed. Typically the small-scale magnetic fields are non-dipolar and rather tiny compared to the lunar radius and mainly clustered {{on the far side}} of the moon. Using iPic 3 D we present the first 3 D fully kinetic and electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell simulations of the solar wind interaction with lunar magnetic anomalies. We study the behaviour of a dipole model with variable surface magnetic field strength under changing solar wind conditions and confirm that lunar crustal magnetic fields may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind and form a mini-magnetosphere, as suggested by MHD and hybrid simulations and spacecraft observations. 3 D-PIC simulations reveal to be very helpful to analyze the diversion/braking of the particle flux and the characteristics of the resulting particles accumulation. The particle flux to the surface is significantly reduced at the magnetic anomaly, surrounded by a region of enhanced density due to the magnetic mirror effect. Second, the ability of iPic 3 D to resolve all plasma components (heavy ions, protons and electrons) allows to discuss in detail the electron physics leading to the highly non-adiabatic interactions expected as well as the implications for solar <b>wind</b> <b>shielding</b> of the lunar surface, depending on the scale size (solar wind protons typically have gyroradii larger than the magnetic anomaly scale size) and magnetic field strength.

40|$|With the {{continued}} growth of global population, urbanization becomes an inevitable trend. As substantial urban expansion undergoes, ecosystem and global land cover have been altered consequently. Urban development becomes the biggest contributor to global carbon emissions while {{the process of}} urbanization results in urban heat islands, climate change, and losses of carbon sinks. Urban vegetation has drawn direct attention of city planners and policy makers by {{considering the importance of}} vegetation in urban climate modification and energy conservation in different ways. For instance, tree shading and <b>wind</b> <b>shielding</b> effects can attenuate the direct solar heat and air infiltration into individual houses. In city wide, vegetation contributes the largest proportion of carbon storage which reduces climate warming and urban heat island effects by sequestering CO 2 and storing carbon in biomass. The carbon content stored in individual trees can be estimated by dendrometric parameters such as the diameter at breast height (DBH) using allometry-based models. With the development of airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology, ALS data and very high resolution multispectral imagery have proven to be promising tools for deriving dendrometric parameters in forest. With the emerging multispectral ALS technology, it became possible to obtain both the range and spectral information from a single source meanwhile the intensity of multispectral ALS showed its power in vegetation mapping. This study aims to develop a workflow that can quantify the carbon storage in urban trees using multispectral ALS data. The workflow consists of four steps: multispectral ALS data processing, vegetation isolation, dendrometric parameters estimation, and carbon storage modeling. First, the raw multispectral ALS data is intensity-rectified and filtered to generate a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) and multispectral ALS intensity information at wavelengths: 532 nm (Green), 1064 nm (Near-infrared, NIR), and 1550 nm (Shortwave Infrared, SWIR), respectively. Vegetation covers are isolated by the support vector machine (SVM) classifier using multispectral ALS intensity information and nDSM in which total six classes including two vegetation classes (grass and tree) are classified. Individual tree crown is delineated by local maxima filtering and marker-controlled watershed segmentation. Tree height and crown width are derived from the crown segments and compared with field measurements. An ALS-DBH (diameter at breast height) multiple linear regression model is developed to predict field-measured DBH using ALS-derived tree height and crown width and assessed by cross validation. Then the carbon storage in individual trees is calculated by allometric equations using ALS-estimated DBH and height. A total of 40 trees are sampled in the field that four attributes: height, crown width, DBH, and biomass are recorded for each single tree. The results show that the land cover classification with multispectral ALS intensity images and nDSM achieves above 90 % overall accuracy. The result of local maxima filtering is improved by using both multispectral ALS intensity and nDSM as input data. The ALS-derived tree height has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1. 21 m (relative RMSE = 6. 8 %) and the ALS-derived crown width has a RMSE of 1. 47 m (relative RMSE = 16. 4 %). The prediction performance of the ALS-DBH model achieves R 2 over 0. 80 with a RMSE of 4. 6 cm. The predicted carbon storage using ALS-modeled DBH corresponded to a RMSE of 142 kg (28. 6 %) and a bias of 14. 4 kg. Results suggest that ALS-based dendrometric parameter estimation and allometric models can yield consistent performance and accurate estimation. Citywide carbon storage estimation is derived in this study by extrapolating the values within the study area to the entire city based on the specific proportion of each land cover type in the entire city. The proposed workflow also reveals the potential of multispectral ALS data in estimating carbon storage at individual-tree level and mapping vegetation in the urban environment...|$|E
