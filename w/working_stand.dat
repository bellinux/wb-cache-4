The basic idea is to operate the combustion engine in its optimal regime. In this regime the engine has the highest efficiency and minimal smoke exhaust. This optimal regime {{is only a small}} portion of its operation area. Because the engine has to operate in this area, it is necessary to add a new converter to the hybrid-electric stand. The new converter must be allowed to buck and boost and must operate as a current source in this regime. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the sizing a PV based source capable of <b>working</b> <b>stand</b> alone. The {{objective}} {{in the design of}} a PV system is to provide reliable power supply to the load without interruptions and without wasting energy. Several methods for evaluating the achievement of the above objective were found in the literature. In the paper authors proposes a method to size, in one step, the source and the storage systems. In this way it is possible to achieve an optimal sizing with a consequent reduction of plant costs. The resulting system has to be capable of satisfying the load demand in all the weather conditions. Numerical simulations have been effected to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the capability of the sized system of supplying the load under real working conditions...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{deals with}} {{automotive}} hybrid and power splitting drives. Special {{attention is paid}} to electric power splitting. Well-proved dc power splitting drive is described. New idea to use a similar drive using ac machinery and power electronic converters is studied in Research Centre of internal combustion motors and automobiles JB. An experimental <b>working</b> <b>stand</b> was projected to research, to perform measurements and to serve for doctor students. Main text Expansion of automobile traffic brings new problems with gas emission and fuel consumption. Hothouse gas emission of the cars equipped with internal combustion engines (ICE – for instance gasoline or Diesel engine) brings ecological problems namely in big cities. Development of alternative car drives, based on electric energy stored in battery, offers solution only for vehicles covering short distances unfortunately. Energy density of batteries is too low in comparison with gasoline or oil for internal combustion engines. ICE has some specific attributes in contrast to the electric motor. Its high efficiency is accessible only in regime of higher output and it depends on operating point choice given by torque and speed...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model and the}} corresponding methods of designing the temperature fields formed in the strip at rolling in the mill with electrocontact technological heating have been developed. The principal parameters of the equipment of the electrocontact heating mill used for hot rolling tool steel strips have been determined. New structures of a current-leading stand, a <b>working</b> <b>stand,</b> a reel and other assemblies and units incorporated in the mill equipment have been devised, which permitted to implement the process of hot rolling thin strips from hardly-deformed steels and alloys. The experimental studies of the process have been carried out; they proved a high efficiency of producing thin strips from hardly-deformed steels and alloys on the electrocontact technological heating mill. Based {{on the results of}} the studies, a new mill 200 EKN with electrocontact technological heating of the strip has been designed, manufactured and installed at the Izhstal plant. The introduction of the mill 200 EKN into practice has made it possible to essentially reduce the working hours of the production of thin strips in coils from hardly-deformed steel and alloy gradesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To examine {{attitudinal}} {{changes of}} bar owners and staff regarding a smoke-free bar law. Design: Bar owners and staff were random selected and telephone interviewed in June 1998, shortly after a smoke-free bar law was enacted, and October 2002. Similar instruments {{were used in}} both surveys {{to collect data on}} attitudes related to secondhand smoke (SHS) and behaviours related to the smoke-free bar law. Participants: 651 and 650 respondents worked for either stand alone bars or combination bars. Measures: Preference of working in a smoke-free environment, concerns of the effect of SHS, and how to comply with the law. Results: The percentage of bar owners or staff <b>working</b> in <b>stand</b> alone bars who prefer to work in a smoke-free environment increased from 17. 3 % in 1998 to 50. 9 % in 2002 (p, 0. 001).
