5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. <b>Working</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> atmosphere of increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E

Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|Mimi and Smith {{were finally}} married on 15 September 1939. They bought a semi-detached house called Mendips—named after {{the range of}} hills—at 251 Menlove Avenue, in a middle class area of Liverpool. Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} extensive damage during World War II, {{and she said that}} she often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in the garden. During the war the government took over the Smiths' farmland for war work, and Smith was called up for service, but was discharged three years later, <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of the}} war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led Mimi to complain later that he was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E

Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though ten years older than Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed Baker to stay at his house at 263 Madison Avenue. Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.|$|E

25|$|In August 2008, Nintendo Power ranked Dragon Warrior IV the 18th best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, {{describing}} {{it as the}} peak of the NES' Dragon Quest series and praising it for its innovative five-act story that made it one of their favourite old-school role-playing games. Readers of Famitsu voted the game as the 14th best game of all time in a 2006 poll. In particular, critics noticed with interest that the game's third chapter, Torneko's, departed largely from standard RPGs by making the only goal to collect money and by allowing players to have Torneko simply <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> in-game store.|$|E

Eventually, it shows a scene of Moby dead in a parking lot, with a man checking his pulse. It then gone to the earlier scene that concludes the video: Moby <b>working</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> office while he was alive, {{but it has a}} green light to it, and everyone is unkind and emotionally distant.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} albums from the 1960s and 70s {{featuring}} common stylistic threads made a lifelong impact on Arjen. The dynamic and exciting music, emotionally driven lyrics, and an ensemble cast found in albums such as Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's Tommy, {{commonly referred to}} as rock operas, inspired Arjen to create one of his own. <b>Working</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environment where he could develop an album exactly as he wanted, Arjen intended to create his vision, making no compromises along the way. His vision manifested itself in The Final Experiment and, after being rejected by several different record labels, was picked up by a small Dutch record label. The project was financially burdensome, but through some subsidization from his father, it was seen through to completion, and was successful enough to warrant another Ayreon release.|$|E
