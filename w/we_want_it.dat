She left in 1934, after {{a dispute with}} the co-founder Col. Edwin Marshall Hadley, and it folded soon after {{due to lack of}} interest. With McCord's encouragement, her lectures were published in a local Wilmette newspaper in 1932, and then collected in a pamphlet entitled Red Revolution: Do <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>It</b> Here? Dilling claimed that the DAR printed and distributed thousands of copies.|$|E
25|$|This {{early work}} in {{historical}} analysis {{of law and}} legal thought laid the basis for Unger's contribution to the Critical Legal Studies movement. The movement itself {{was born in the}} late 1970s among young legal scholars at Harvard Law School who denounced the theoretical underpinnings of American jurisprudence, legal realism. The participants were committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality without the hidden interests and class domination of legal institutions. Two tendencies of the movement developed, one, a radical indeterminacy that criticized law as meaning anything <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to mean, and the other, a neo-Marxist critique that attacked legal thought as an institutional form of capitalism. Unger offered a third tendency, a constructive vision of rethinking rights based on individual emancipation and empowerment, and structural arrangements that would lend themselves to constant revision with the goal of creating more educational and economic opportunities for more people. He laid this out in The Critical Legal Studies Movement, which quickly earned him a following as the philosophical mentor and prophet of the movement.|$|E

One of the challenges that I posed to the production team was ... if we decided to play something different, if we decided to extend a part, whatever we decide to do, I want the artwork to change with the performance. So it needs to be malleable ...

[...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not.

500|$|During {{preparations}} [...] for {{the first}} German performance of Noye's Fludde in Ettal, planned for May 1959, {{the problem of the}} scarcity of handbells [...] became acute. Britten suggested that in the absence of handbells a set of tubular bells in E flat in groups of twos and threes could be played by four or six children with two hammers each to enable them to strike the chords. Britten was not present in Ettal, but he learned from Ernst Roth, of Boosey & Hawkes, that the Ettal production had substituted glockenspiel and metallophone for the handbells; according to Roth the bells in Carl Orff's Schulwerk percussion ensembles were [...] "too weak" [...] for the purpose. Britten later wrote to a friend: [...] "I am rather relieved that I wasn't there! – no church, no bugles, no handbells, no recorders – but they seem to have done it {{with a great deal of}} care all the same. Still I rather hanker after doing it in Darmstadt as <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> – even importing handbells for instance." ...|$|E
500|$|Hawley {{also brought}} his visual effects {{supervisor}} John Ross from Fargo. Ross coordinated multiple visual effects vendors for Legion, {{which he described}} as [...] "a bit of a crapshoot" [...] because artists were often not able {{to work on the}} same shot week-to-week. He noted that though [...] "hundreds of thousands of dollars" [...] was spent on major visual effect sequences for the show, [...] "we don’t dwell on that aspect. There’s a jeep that gets slammed down , which the characters hide behind before it gets flung back into the building, but we pan off it, just throwing it away, because the destruction isn’t the point of the scene." [...] He compared this mindset to M. Night Shyamalan's approach to superpowers in Unbreakable. When realizing characters' special abilities, Ross said it [...] "comes down to tying this fantastic beam coming out to somebody’s hand, and showing how it lights up a face and distorts the air as it travels across frame. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to look as much like a live interactive element as we can imagine it to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearing that {{introducing}} the character as an [...] " [...] to the boys" [...] would hinder {{their chances of}} successfully integrating her into the series, the writers intended that Ruby should be [...] "a character in [...] own right" [...] and deemed her an antagonist [...] "with [...] own interests and [...] own motives" [...] rather than a love interest to Sam or Dean, which they felt had been their mistake in their introduction of the widely disliked Jo Harvelle in the second season. While they were not planning on a romance between Ruby and either of the Winchesters in the third season, however, they were open to the possibility in the future, with Kripke saying, [...] "If the chemistry is there, {{and we see the}} sparks, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to happen, and the fans want it to happen, it'll happen." [...] Due to [...] "protective and occasionally nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant to introduce Ruby in [...] "small doses". Wanting fans to know the show would always be about Sam and Dean, and nothing else, he stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor is it about the four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the sequel will be shot in real time, Reeves stated, [...] "You see, that's a {{difficult}} part: <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be shot like the first {{but how can you}} continue that idea successfully for a second time?... We have a lot of affection for the original and the sequel can't just be the same thing. But that is tricky when {{you need to have a}} monster destroying stuff once again." ...|$|E

A subsequent study of digital rights management for e-books by Gal Oestreicher-Singer and Arun Sundararajan showed that relaxing some forms of DRM can be beneficial to digital rights holders because the losses from piracy are outweighed by the increases in value to legal buyers.|$|E
2500|$|... "The idea of benign or hostile space aliens {{from other}} planets visiting the eEarth [...] an {{emotional}} idea.
