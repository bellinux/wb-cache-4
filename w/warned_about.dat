5|$|In late 1968, {{the members}} of the Jimi Hendrix Experience were living in a rented house in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. One night bassist Noel Redding was <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> a pending visit from law enforcement, so he {{immediately}} phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell, who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and asked him to come over to the house so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs. They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house.|$|E
5|$|The Songshan Airport in Taipei {{was shut}} down due {{to the threat of}} Typhoon Wipha. All businesses, {{including}} the stock exchange, were closed for September18. Typhoon warnings were issued in northern areas of the island and residents were <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> the possibility of landslides in the mountainous regions. Accordingly, 169 people left landslide-prone areas. An additional 237 people were evacuated from the northern areas of Taiwan due to the storm. A code red alert was issued for the areas closest {{to the center of the}} cyclone. Nearly 4,300 Chinese fishermen sought refuge in Taiwan after being called back to port.|$|E

5|$|While {{the storm}} was passing near Dominica, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> {{the threat of the}} {{hurricane}} which would strike the island within a day or two. The advisory was sent via telegraph to 75police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours; this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio. Warnings were also posted for 12ports along the southern coast, causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port. Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312, and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. By comparison, the weaker 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3,000people.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, oil {{and mining}} {{operations}} in threatened regions were temporarily shut down. Already {{suffering from the}} impacts of Cyclones Clare and Daryl, residents were <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> the likelihood of flooding due to the already saturated grounds. The Bureau of Meteorology also issued tropical cyclone warnings {{for most of the}} Pilbara coastline on 28 February. The same day, the Fire and Emergency Services of Australia issued a Yellow Alert for Point Samson, Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, and Mardie. Residents in these areas were advised to evacuate if necessary and ensure that all cyclone preparations had been completed. Shelters were also opened for residents who sought need for one. Schools throughout the Pilbara region were also closed for several days {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{and their}} players {{pleaded guilty to}} the charges against them, but still {{received}} a £175,000 fine, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren, Martin Keown, Patrick Vieira and Ray Parlour were all suspended for between one and four matches: Lauren received a four-game ban – half of the potential ban he could have received – and a £40,000 fine; Keown was suspended for three matches and had to pay a £20,000 fine; Vieira and Parlour were given one-game bans and had to pay £20,000 and £10,000 respectively. Jens Lehmann was originally charged but this was later dropped. Ashley Cole was not suspended but was given a £10,000 fine. Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo both {{pleaded not guilty to}} their involvement in the incident, but after a five-hour hearing in December 2003, Giggs was handed a £7,500 fine and Ronaldo a £4,000 fine and both were <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> their future conduct.|$|E

Upon Rick's intensification to a Category4 hurricane, officials in Mexico raised the alert level in Guerrero, Jalisco and Michoacán to severe. In Sonora, the local government placed 14 municipalities under a blue alert, the pre-storm phase; the alert was upgraded to a yellow alert for the municipalities of Álamos, Benito Juárez, Navojoa, Etchojoa and Huatabampo on October 18.|$|E
5|$|The JNA, <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> {{reinforcements}} to the 137th Infantry Brigade, {{abandoned its}} plan to advance to Barilović. It reoriented its efforts to reach the Korana Bridge {{in the village of}} Malići, down the road from Gornji Velemerić and Carevo Selo (where its tanks were stopped the day before). The battle resumed in the morning when JNA tanks (supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and multiple rocket launchers) broke through positions held by the 2nd Guards Brigade at 1:00p.m., reaching Carevo Selo before they were stopped again by the HV. Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Brigade arrived from Zagreb to Duga Resa and were attached to the 137th Infantry Brigade. One company of the battalion was deployed to Vinica Hill, and a second was deployed west of Carevo Selo (where it relieved troops from the 2nd Guards Brigade).|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed {{heavily on}} his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him {{it was not a}} drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. Although Hendrix {{was one of the biggest}} stars in North America at the time, and the world's highest-paid performer, only a couple of Toronto newspapers carried the story. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he bribed a member of the Associated Press with a case of liquor in an effort to prevent the story from going out on the news wire.|$|E

5|$|The {{price of}} slaves varied in {{accordance}} with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 drachmas; while a workman at major works was paid one drachma per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 drachmas each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BC they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance, a large helot market was organized during the festivities at the temple of Apollo at Actium. The Acarnanian League, which {{was in charge of the}} logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part. Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against latent defects; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Although the CCC {{became a}} {{powerful}} political {{force in the}} following years, at the 8th National Congress in 1956 its inspectors were <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> abusing their power and becoming independent of their local party committees. Its power waned during the Great Leap Forward, but the CCC, the Secretariat and the Organisation Department became the chief weapons {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Leap to combat corruption and reverse verdicts on rightists. The CCC played its new role until the Cultural Revolution, a socio-political movement which lasted from 1966 until 1976, when it was affected by purges (partly due to its close ties to Peng Zhen, one of the first highly ranked officials purged during the Cultural Revolution). At the 9th National Congress in 1969 the CCC was abolished, removed from the party constitution and replaced by special-case organisations (such as the Central Case Examination Group) formed under Mao and Kang Sheng. Despite its abolition at the congress, little criticism was directed at the CCC during the Cultural Revolution; although CCC Deputy Secretary Min Yifan was criticised by the Red Guards, a revolutionary youth movement independent of the party (but inspired by Mao) during the Cultural Revolution, most of their disapproval focused on his career on local committees rather than the CCC. Talk of an internal party-control system would not resurface until the death of Mao and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} try every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing a large number of crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When crews of NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The crews were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the average operating height of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared dossiers for crews to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the lighting systems, such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. Crews were <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber crews of a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been <b>warned</b> <b>about</b> a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E
