30|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>negative</b> {{correlations}} between {{the price of a}} two-bedroom home and distance from a private university (−[*] 0.368) or a public university (−[*] 0.220). <b>We</b> also <b>found</b> <b>negative</b> {{correlations between}} the rent for a one-bedroom home and the distance from a private university (−[*] 0.311) or a public university (−[*] 0.203). A probable cause for the difference in correlations between public and private universities is that private university students may be willing to pay more rent to be closer to the university. These results also show that renting a home near a university has a slightly lower correlation compared to the sale of a home, implying a higher demand for buying a home. This may be accounted for by sales to investors for the purposes of renting out these homes. This possibility may be a subject for future research.|$|R

The data were collected using a survey involving 2, 068 Dutch medical specialists.

Understanding the factors that control coseismic failure of multiple asperities, and thus maximum magnitude, is central for seismic hazard assessment. To investigate the role of asperities size and spacing on maximum magnitude, seismicity rate, and percentage of synchronized ruptures, we use analog models simulating along-strike rupture behavior of megathrust earthquakes. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>negative</b> correlations between the barrier-to-asperity length ratio Db/Da and maximum magnitude and seismicity rate. Db/Da also controls the process of asperities synchronization along the megathrust. A permanent barrier behavior is observed for Db/Da > 0. 5.

Results <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>negative</b> symptoms were significantly more severe (p CEBPD, 8 q 11. 21), retinoid × receptor, alpha (RXRA, 9 q 34. 2), LIM homeobox protein 5 (LHX 5, 12 q 24. 13) and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK 11, 19 p 13. 3) are recurrently (incidence ≧ 16. 7 %) disrupted by CNVs.

This study examines {{the role of}} pleiotropy in explaining the link between {{cognitive function}} and psychiatric disorder. MethodsWe used two large genome-wide association study data sets on cognitive function—one from older age, n = 53, 949, and one from childhood, n = 12, 441. We also used genome-wide association study data on educational attainment, n = 95, 427, to examine the validity of its use as a proxy phenotype for cognitive function. Using a new method, linkage disequilibrium regression, we derived genetic correlations, free from the confounding of clinical state between psychiatric illness and cognitive function. ResultsWe found a genetic correlation of. 711 (p = 2. 26 e- 12) across the life course for general cognitive function. We also showed a positive genetic correlation between autism spectrum disorder and cognitive function in childhood (rg =. 360, p =. 0009) and for educational attainment (rg =. 322, p = 1. 37 e- 5) but not in older age. In schizophrenia, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> a <b>negative</b> genetic correlation between older age cognitive function (rg = −. 231, p = 3. 81 e- 12) but not in childhood or for educational attainment.
