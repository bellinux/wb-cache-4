25|$|Sterne's Writings, {{in which}} it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating {{plagiarist}} who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> originality, in <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.|$|R
60|$|For <b>want</b> <b>of</b> this <b>consideration,</b> the {{tradesman}} oftentimes drowns, as I {{may call}} it, even within his depth--that is, he sinks {{when he has}} really the substance at bottom to keep him up--and this is all owing to an adventurous bold spirit in trade, joined with too great a gust of gain. Avarice is the ruin of many people besides tradesmen; and I might give the late South Sea calamity for an example in which the longest heads were most overreached, {{not so much by}} the wit or cunning of those they had to deal with as by the secret promptings of their own avarice; wherein they abundantly verified an old proverbial speech or saying, namely, 'All covet, all lose;' so it was there indeed, and the cunningest, wisest, sharpest, men lost the most money.|$|R
60|$|Irritated by his obstinacy {{and gross}} <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> for my defenceless position, I forgot all doubts and scruples; and privately applied to Mr. Mannion to exert the {{influence}} {{which he had}} promised to use, if I wished it, in my behalf.|$|E
60|$|We {{were all}} the more angry with him for his {{selfishness}} and <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>consideration,</b> for Ellen, in her torrent of grief, had even disclosed that he had {{said she did not}} care for him--no one really in love ever scrupled about a mother's nonsense, etc., etc.|$|E

6000|$|Tell her aunt! There was a <b>want</b> <b>of</b> {{personal}} <b>consideration</b> {{to himself}} in this way of receiving his addresses which almost angered him. Tom Tringle {{was not in the}} least afraid of his mother,--was not even afraid of his father {{as long as he was}} fairly regular at the office in Lombard Street. He was quite determined to please himself in marriage, and was disposed to think that his father and mother would like him to be settled. Money was no object. There was, to his thinking, no good reason why he should not marry his cousin. For her the match was so excellent that he hardly expected she would reject him when she could be made to understand that he was really in earnest. [...] "You may tell all the world," [...] he said proudly. [...] "All I want is that you should love me." ...|$|R

His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to {{considerably}} more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and <b>want</b> <b>of</b> proper <b>consideration,</b> that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} improve {{diagnosis}} and refine prognosis {{in children with}} acute leukaemia is improving steadily. A growing number of tests can and are being performed on leukaemic cells. These include surface-marker analysis, DNA content, cytogenetics and studies of gene rearrangements. Increasingly large bone-marrow samples, now usually obtained under general anaesthesia, are required to make secure diagnoses. Ethical issues arise from three major areas. 1) Current research on leukaemia cells requested by the Medical Research Council is considered by local research ethics committees, but parents are not regularly given detailed information about or asked specifically to consent to such research; 2) substantial quantities of excess cells are stored indefinitely. This archive of stored material is a valuable resource for research {{but there has been}} little <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> the ethical issues which arise from this practice, and 3) there is a potential for pressure to obtain increasingly large samples. 'Creeping growth' in sample size is likely to continue unless ethics committees consider future research proposals in more detail. These issues deserve attention in order that worthwhile research and its publication are not impeded for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> ethical <b>consideration.</b> The implications extend beyond the field of childhood leukaemia...|$|R

40|$|A {{qualitative}} analysis of interview data with 41 rapists determined that five implicit theories (ITs) underlie rapists’ offense supportive beliefs/feelings/motives: (a) dangerous world (DW) —where men have feelings of generalized anger and/or resentment toward others; (b) women are dangerous—where men hold {{a set of}} attitudes that are hostile toward women; (c) women as sexual objects (WSO) —where women are seen as primarily sexual objects; (d) male sex drive is uncontrollable—where sexual urges are seen all consuming; (e) entitlement—where men {{feel that they can}} do exactly what they <b>want.</b> <b>Consideration</b> <b>of</b> whether DW or WSO ITs were present or absent indicated that three main groups could be identified: Group 1 : violently motivated—presence of DW and/or absence of WSO; Group 2 : sexually motivated—presence of WSO and/or absence of DW; Group 3 : sadistically motivated—presence of DW and WSO. These results are discussed in terms of treatment needs of rapists...|$|R

6000|$|This {{therefore}} is worthy <b>of</b> the <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> all sinking souls; of the souls that feel themselves descending into the pit. There {{is such a}} thing as this experienced among the godly. Some come to them (when tempted) when you will, they will tell you, they have no ground to stand on, their feet have slipped, their foundation is removed, and they fell themselves sinking, as into a pit that has no bottom (Psa 11:3). They inwardly sink, not for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> something to relieve the body, but for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> some spiritual cordial to support the mind.

60|$|The {{moment he}} came in sight of Alice he began to bark and yelp in such an eager way that the sounds {{produced}} {{might be described as}} an intermittent scream.

60|$|The {{reason why}} Mr. George {{did not like}} his friend Mr. Parkman's young wife was {{not because of any}} want of natural {{attractiveness}} in her person, or of amiableness in her disposition,--for she was beautiful, accomplished, and kindhearted. But for all this, from a <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> not uncommon among young ladies who are not much experienced in the world, she was a very uncomfortable travelling companion.|$|E
40|$|For <b>want</b> <b>of</b> a nail, {{the shoe}} was lost. For <b>want</b> <b>of</b> the shoe, {{the horse was}} lost. For <b>want</b> <b>of</b> the horse, the rider was lost. For <b>want</b> <b>of</b> the rider, the battle was lost. For <b>want</b> <b>of</b> the battle, the kingdom was lost. And all for the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> a nail. In some respects, this nursery rhyme {{summarizes}} the point of my brief essay on what I believe {{is one of the}} major problems in the manuscripts I review. Only instead of a missing nail, the problem is poor construct conceptualization. I chose this issue because it is one that has serious consequences for the validity of research in the discipline, but it is something that authors tend to overlook. As noted by Cook and Campbell (1979), there are four main questions that should be considered when evaluating the validity of a study’s findings. First, what are the particular cause-and-effect constructs involved? This is a question of construct validity. Second, is there a relationship between the presumed cause and effect? This question relates to statistical conclusion validity. Third, is the relationship causal? This question addresses the internal validity of the research and concerns whether the conditions for establishing causal priority of the causal variable over the effect variable have been established and whether the design of the study renders any rival explanations of the observed effect implausible. Fourth, how generalizable is this relationship across persons, settings, and times? Here the focus is on external validity. Even though all four types of validity are important, and indeed essential, authors often give far more attention to some of these questions than to others. Most authors give a great deal <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> to questions <b>of</b> internal and external validity (as they should), but far less to issues related to construct and statistical conclusion validity...|$|R

60|$|A silence {{broken only}} by the general {{compliments}} of the much gratified Tim, followed his departure, although another outbreak nearly occurred owing to the cook supplying raw meat for Mr. Green’s eye and refusing it for Joe’s. It was the lack <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> and feeling that affected Joe, not for the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> the beef, that little difficulty being easily surmounted by taking Mr. Green’s. The tumult was just beginning again, when it was arrested by the sound of angry voices above. Tim, followed by Joe, sprang up the ladder, and the couple with their heads at the opening listened with appreciative enjoyment to a wordy duel between Mrs. Tipping and daughter and the watchman.|$|R

He was suffering from a bad attack of headache, and a worse attack of ill-temper, and answered as irritably as he dared.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} in this remark that roused again the turmoil which had begun to subside within me. There was so much that was unjust and tyrannical, and--what perhaps touched me still deeper--there was such a <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> and respect in this behavior of Mr. Enderton's, that it brought to the front some very incongruous emotions.
