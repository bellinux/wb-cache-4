5|$|The isotope plutonium-238 has a {{half-life}} of 87.74years. It emits a {{large amount}} of thermal energy <b>with</b> <b>low</b> levels of both gamma rays/photons and spontaneous neutron rays/particles. Being an alpha emitter, it combines high energy radiation <b>with</b> <b>low</b> penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding. A sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238. One kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people <b>with</b> <b>low</b> working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people <b>with</b> <b>low</b> working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E

The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
