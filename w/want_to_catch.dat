500|$|... "Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews from critics, who considered {{it to be}} the greatest downloadable content pack of the game. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer considered [...] "Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] "a solid, thrilling, satisfying addition to an already expansive universe; one that leaves you on an appropriate note of hopeful melancholy." [...] He praised the amount of content in the pack, stating that it [...] "adds far more to the game than some of its disappointingly slender predecessors." [...] Game Revolution's Eduardo Reboucas said that the pack is [...] "a blast, especially for fans who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up with Liara and dissect the bits of story that were omitted in the main game." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantics David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common {{complaint}} to that point, stating, [...] "After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn’t that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out." [...] He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, if they lose interest, [...] "can take as long as they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month." [...] The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting [...] "A lot of this detail [...] good, {{but it could have been}} considerably compressed—none of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economical—and better—storytelling from its shows." [...] Sims concluded by saying, [...] "What’s most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn’t getting rid of this approach anytime soon. Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain’s motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all." [...] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider.com spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, [...] "By focusing so intently on making these series... much more grounded in a gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [...] on The CW), the problem is that they miss out on the key element: this [...] be fantastical entertainment." [...] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, [...] "The Defenders is far from perfect. But it’s an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 4 June 1745, Frederick trapped a joint {{force of}} Saxons and Austrians that {{had crossed the}} {{mountains}} to invade Silesia.

Pursuing the Austrians into Bohemia, Frederick caught the enemy on 30 September 1745 and delivered a flanking attack on the Austrian right wing at the Battle of Soor which set the Austrians to flight. [...] Once again, Frederick's stunning victories on the battlefield caused his enemies to seek peace terms. Under the terms of the Treaty of Dresden, signed on 25 December 1745, Austria was forced to adhere to the terms of the Treaty of Breslau giving Silesia to Prussia.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw {{gave the}} film four stars in September 2001, {{choosing}} {{it as the}} best film of the week.

[...] He notes that, among [...] "the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. It is as if the violence of Battle Royale is not a satire of society at all, but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence." [...] He concluded that, while some [...] "will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive", it [...] "is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candour, and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling." [...] Bryant Frazer of Deep Focus [...] gave it a B+ rating and called it [...] "a vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone." [...] British critic Jonathan Ross stated that [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> a wildly original and super-cool slice of entertainment before it gets remade and ruined by the Americans, then I suggest you try hard not to miss it" [...] and concluded that [...] "it's a wildly imaginative example of just what can be achieved in a teen movie."
