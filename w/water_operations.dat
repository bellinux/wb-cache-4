25|$|The basic Bensen Gyrocopter {{design is}} a simple frame of square {{aluminium}} or galvanized steel tubing, reinforced with triangles of lighter tubing. It is arranged so that the stress falls on the tubes, or special fittings, not the bolts. A front-to-back keel mounts a steerable nosewheel, seat, engine, and a vertical stabilizer. Outlying mainwheels are mounted on an axle. Some versions may mount seaplane-style floats for <b>water</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the war, Viper proved woefully {{inadequate}} in deep <b>water</b> <b>operations</b> {{against the}} larger, more heavily gunned British warships. On 17 January 1813 the 32-gun frigate HMS Narcissus captured Viper {{off the coast}} of Belize, British Honduras and took her to New Providence in the Bahama Islands. At the time of her capture Viper was armed with 12 guns, had a crew of 93 men and had been cruising for seven weeks off Havana, having made no captures.|$|E
25|$|The station's {{surviving}} {{facilities are}} part of Salem's Winter Island Marine Park. Salem Harbor was deep enough to host a seadrome with three sea lanes, offering a variety of take-off headings irrespective of wind direction unless {{there was a strong}} steady wind from the east. This produced large waves that swept into the mouth of the harbor, making <b>water</b> <b>operations</b> difficult. When the seadrome was too rough, returning amphibian aircraft would use Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Beverly. Salem Air Station moved to Cape Cod in 1970.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{version of}} the AMX-30 was fitted with Hispano-Suiza's HS-110 diesel engine, located {{in the rear of}} the hull. The [...] engine could be replaced on the field in 45 minutes, and produced , offering the tank a maximum velocity of [...] on roads. The fuel efficient engine, in conjunction with a total fuel capacity of , gave the AMX-30 a maximum road range of up to [...] The engine's drive is taken through a Gravina G.H.B.200C twin-plate centrifugal clutch. The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five reverse gears. This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30's major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually change gears at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain. The tank's weight is distributed over five double, aluminum-alloy, rubber-tyred road wheels on either side, propelled on [...] wide tracks. The tank could ford [...] deep water obstacles without preparation, up to [...] with minor preparation, and up to [...] with full preparation. Full preparation for <b>water</b> <b>operations</b> consisted of the addition of a snorkel tube, the installation of blanking plates, carried on the front of the hull, over the engine compartment's air intake louvers, and the installment of infra-red driving equipment, including a searchlight. In 1969 a single special dive training vehicle was adapted, nicknamed the AMX 30 Gloutte (from French faire glouglou, [...] "gurgle"), without engine and tracks, that over a ramp could quickly be lowered into a reservoir by a winch; it was equipped with an escape tube.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites. Its wing mounts downturned wing tips that incorporate floats for <b>water</b> <b>operations.</b> The standard engine used is the [...] Rotax 914 four-stroke turbocharged powerplant.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} vacuum-molded composites with the design goal of strength at a light weight. Its [...] span wing employs a Chris Mark 4 airfoil and mounts flaps.

By 2015 only the Subaru EA 81 and Rotax 912ULS were still offered. Floats for <b>water</b> <b>operations</b> are optional.|$|E
2500|$|About 15 {{bilateral}} and multilateral donor agencies support the Palestinian water sector. In 2006, the PWA complained that coordination between PWA and donors was [...] "still not successful" [...] {{and that some}} donors and NGOs were [...] "bypassing" [...] the PWA. Donor coordination mechanisms in the sector include Emergency Water, Sanitation and Hygiene group (EWASH) regrouping UN agencies and NGOs as well as Emergency <b>Water</b> <b>Operations</b> Center (EWOC) led by USAID. Both were established to coordinate the reconstruction after the 2002 Israeli incursions into the West Bank.|$|E
2500|$|The Husky {{features}} a braced high wing, tandem seating and dual controls. The structure is steel tube frames and Dacron covering {{over all but}} {{the rear of the}} fuselage, plus metal leading edges on the wings. The high wing was selected for good all-around visibility, making the Husky ideal for observation and patrol roles. [...] Power is supplied by a relatively powerful (for the Husky's weight) [...] Textron Lycoming O-360 flat-four piston engine turning a constant speed propeller. In 2015 a reversible MT Propeller was approved under a Supplementary Type Certificate for better control during floatplane <b>water</b> <b>operations.</b> [...] The Husky's high power-to-weight ratio and low wing loading result in good short-field performance.|$|E
