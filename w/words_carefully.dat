500|$|In Outliers, Gladwell {{interviews}} Gates, {{who says}} that unique access to a computer {{at a time when}} they were not commonplace helped him succeed. Without that access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be [...] "a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional", but that he might not be worth US$50billion. Gladwell chooses his <b>words</b> <b>carefully</b> to never mention that Gates' mother was on the board of directors of IBM with access to the whole of IBM, and not just an ordinary daughter of wealthy businessmen as he says. Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at The American Spectator and his more recent job at The Washington Post.|$|E
2500|$|According to Cohen's {{hometown}} paper, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, he was [...] "accused of upsetting the newfound {{atmosphere of}} civility in the House" [...] following the assassination attempt on Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Republicans, {{as well as}} many in the media and in the Jewish community, expressed outrage and demanded that Democrats condemn Cohen's comment. Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote that [...] "someone needs to carpet Cohen, pronto, for his rhetoric." [...] His remarks were also condemned by the National Jewish Democratic Council, which issued a statement saying that [...] "invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never acceptable—on either side of the aisle. Cohen’s comments and similar comments made by others are not helpful as our leaders and citizens conduct a joint effort to advance civility in our political discourse. We implore Cohen and all our leaders to choose their <b>words</b> <b>carefully</b> as we move forward." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kabary may be {{delivered}} {{by two or}} more mpikabary at the same occasion, and each one generally was nominated by and represents {{a portion of the}} audience present, as during hiragasy performances. [...] When this happens, kabary speech can take on somewhat competitive overtones as the speakers attempt to demonstrate their superior skills. The mpikabary typically addresses himself to the audience of his opponent, and while direct confrontation is generally frowned upon in polite society in the Highlands of Madagascar, if an opponent mpikabary makes an error {{in the form of the}} kabary or misstates an ohabolana, this is commonly pointed out in an indirect or delicate manner as evidence of greater mastery. [...] The use of indirect language such as proverbs is viewed as the more challenging, adult manner of speaking and demonstrates skill, while direct criticism, bluntness, hateful speech or anything that causes loss of face to the audience or a rival speaker is censured and despised as lacking in skill. [...] Kabary is generally the domain of men and not women, because women are believed and expected to speak in a more straightforward wayincluding the expression of anger that can cause loss of face to the speakerwhile men are expected to preserve face by taking the time to choose their <b>words</b> <b>carefully</b> when speaking to others. [...] Nonetheless, some women may exceptionally engage in kabary (for instance, all queens), although men represent the vast majority of mpikabary.|$|E

50|$|Chu spaces generalize {{the notion}} of topological space by {{dropping}} the requirements that the set of open sets be closed under union and finite intersection, that the open sets be extensional, and that the membership predicate (of points in open sets) be two-valued. The definition of continuous function remains unchanged other than having to be <b>worded</b> <b>carefully</b> to continue to make sense after these generalizations.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 20: 'Blasphemy.'--If {{the reader}} can refer to my papers on Fiction in the 'Nineteenth Century,' he will find this <b>word</b> <b>carefully</b> defined in its Scriptural, and evermore necessary, meaning,--'Harmful speaking'--not against God only, but against man, and against all the good works and {{purposes}} of Nature. The word is accurately opposed to 'Euphemy,' the right or well-speaking of God and His world; and the two modes of speech are those which going out of the mouth sanctify or defile the man.|$|R
5000|$|The Wish Giver: Three Tales of Coven Tree is a 1983 {{young adult}} or {{children}}'s book by Bill Brittain. The [...] "wish giver" [...] {{in the title}} refers to the enigmatic man who gives three children a wish to make their deepest dreams come true, but the wishes are not <b>worded</b> <b>carefully,</b> and go horribly wrong. The plot structure and moral of the book are strikingly {{similar to those of}} the traditional Faust legend and W. W. Jacobs's short story [...] "The Monkey's Paw." ...|$|R

6000|$|Speaking {{like an old}} residenter, Tommy {{explained}} that he had brought his sister to see the church, [...] "She's ta'en aback," [...] he said, picking out Scotch <b>words</b> <b>carefully,</b> [...] "because it's littler than the London kirks, but I telled her--I telled her that the preaching is better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thanks," [...] {{said the}} girl, raising her eyebrows and {{choosing}} her conventional <b>words</b> <b>carefully.</b> [...] "I--merely dropped in for--a slight refreshment."

25|$|Alpha mounted {{back up at}} 10:50am {{to drive}} back into town and try to assist Bravo Company. This request {{had come from the}} Ops Room and had been <b>worded</b> <b>carefully</b> so as not to sound like an order; only the {{commander}} on the ground could assess whether or not Alpha could be of any use. As they expected, they came under contact with heavy fire almost immediately and they had to de-bus from the DAF truck. An RPG was fired at the truck, but was deflected {{just in front of the}} vehicle by an electricity cable.|$|R

6000|$|... 'My God!' he said {{to himself}} bitterly as he took the pencil. He could not sign the {{abbreviated}} name his wife used towards him. He scribbled his surname, as he would have done to a stranger. As he watched the amiable, stout woman counting up his <b>words</b> <b>carefully,</b> pointing with her finger, he felt sick with irony.|$|E
6000|$|... "I came {{to meet my}} father--for one thing," [...] and {{the little}} pause might have had its significance, though Benicia who {{unrolled}} her fan was handicapped {{by the fact that}} she was speaking English and had to choose her <b>words</b> <b>carefully.</b> [...] "I am told that he is expected here some time to-night--but you are ill. It is needless to say--is it not?--that I am sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{should think}} you'd have run across one in all your riding around," [...] said Venters. He spoke slowly, {{choosing}} his <b>words</b> <b>carefully,</b> and he essayed a perfectly casual manner, {{and pretended to}} be busy assorting pieces of pottery. She must have no cause again to suffer shame for curiosity of his. Yet never in all his days had he been so eager to hear the details of anyone's life.|$|E

60|$|EDITH [austerely] I {{never said}} {{anything}} of the sort. I never stoop to mere vituperation: what would my girls say of me if I did? I chose my <b>words</b> most <b>carefully.</b> I said they were tyrants, liars, and thieves; and so they are. Slattox is even worse.|$|R
60|$|Cronshaw {{filled his}} glass again, {{and began to}} talk at length. He spoke with rotund delivery. He chose his <b>words</b> <b>carefully.</b> He mingled wisdom and {{nonsense}} in the most astounding manner, gravely making fun of his hearers at one moment, and at the next playfully giving them sound advice. He talked of art, and literature, and life. He was by turns devout and obscene, merry and lachrymose. He grew remarkably drunk, and {{then he began to}} recite poetry, his own and Milton's, his own and Shelley's, his own and Kit Marlowe's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cynthia," [...] he said slowly, [...] "even {{you shall}} {{not speak to}} me like that.

In affairs of this kind--in a matter of so much importance in my life," [...] he continued, choosing his <b>words</b> <b>carefully,</b> [...] "I am likely to know whether I am doing right or wrong. If my mother were alive, I am sure that she would approve of this--this friendship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because her {{mistress}} {{loves you}} still. Such {{a woman as}} this would like to absorb the whole affection of her mistress in herself. You laugh. She is a servant, and a common person. How can such a person conceive an affection so strong as to become a passion for one so superior? But it is true. It is perfectly well known, {{and there have been}} many recorded instances of such a woman, say a servant, greatly inferior in station, conceiving a desperate affection for her mistress, accompanied by the fiercest jealousy. Fanny Mere is jealous--and of you. She hates you; she wants your wife to hate you. She would like nothing better than to go back to her mistress with the proofs in her hand of such acts on your part--such acts, I say," [...] he chose his next <b>words</b> <b>carefully,</b> [...] "as would keep her from you for ever." ...|$|E

"Much, it seems, O Opener-of-Roads," [...] said Panda sternly, [...] "seeing {{that you}} were the doctor who smelt out Masapo, and that it was in your kraal that yonder woman hid herself while her lover, the Prince, my son, who is dead, went down to the battle, and that she was brought thence with you. Tell us, now, the nature of this muti, and, being wise, as you are, be careful to tell us truly, lest it should be said, O Zikali, that you are not a Nyanga only, but an umtakati as well. For then," [...] he added with meaning, and {{choosing}} his <b>words</b> <b>carefully,</b> [...] "perchance, O Zikali, I might be tempted to make trial of whether or no it is true that you cannot be killed like other men, especially as I have heard of late that your heart is evil towards me and my House." ...|$|E

50|$|A house {{concert in}} Wilmette became an annual festival. A single <b>word</b> placed <b>carefully</b> {{about the quality}} of a young singer sparked a band and a CD.

His songs spoke of friendship and he lived it.|$|R
