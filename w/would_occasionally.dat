5|$|Eruptions {{would likely}} {{continue}} {{for a period}} of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the flanks of the volcano and in valleys <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> be released to form debris flows. Major construction would be needed to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Philippine {{government}} {{sent the}} band {{to represent the}} commonwealth at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Loving retired {{for the third time}} the following year; he remained in Manila and <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> take up the baton as guest conductor.|$|E
5|$|Over {{subsequent}} years, Kimball <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> attend {{meetings in}} the Salt Lake Temple {{and was able to}} give assent or direction on matters of significance, such as the calling of Russell M. Nelson and Dallin H. Oaks to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1984, but he was otherwise mostly incapacitated.|$|E

5|$|This was Bowie's {{first tour}} where {{wireless}} microphone technology was available, allowing Bowie considerable freedom {{to move around}} the stage during a concert. This allowed him {{to interact with the}} dancers and musicians much more freely, and as such the set included 3-story high mobile scaffolding, onto which Bowie and his dancers <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> climb during the show.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{a sudden}} {{eruption}} in Beerenberg forced the immediate evacuation of the station. A Hercules was {{dispatched to the}} island and successfully landed on the strip. Thereafter the Hercules became the regular military aircraft at Jan Mayen. Aircraft gradually took over more of the transport to the island, and from 1973 all supplies except diesel and special freight was transported by ship. From 1975 the 333 Squadron <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> drop mail and supplies using the P-3 Orion {{as a supplement to}} the landings of the Hercules.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{origin of}} the Aylesbury duck is unclear. Before the 18thcentury, duck breeds were rarely {{recorded}} in England, and the common duck, bred for farming, was a domesticated form of the wild mallard. The common duck varied in colour, and as in the wild, white ducks <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> occur. White ducks were particularly prized, as their feathers were popular as a filler for quilts.|$|E

5|$|Wanting {{the best}} for her son, Elsie taught Grant song and dance when he was four, and was keen on him having piano lessons. She <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> {{take him to the}} cinema where he enjoyed the {{performances}} of Charlie Chaplin, Chester Conklin, Fatty Arbuckle, Ford Sterling, Mack Swain and Broncho Billy Anderson. Grant entered education when he was four-and-a-half and was sent to the Bishop Road Primary School, Bristol.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club {{and turned it into a}} research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E
5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from {{contact with the outside}} world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.|$|E
5|$|For {{the coming}} 1963season, manager Fred Hutchinson envisioned the same the role for Sisler, {{coming out of}} the bullpen with the idea that he <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> start. The Reds {{announced}} on February9 that Sisler had signed for the 1963season, although he did not make the Reds' NL club and was optioned to their class-AAA team, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 35games pitched for the Padres, he started six, had a 6–9record and a 3.40ERA in 90innings. On March18, 1964, it was announced that Sisler retired from baseball to join an Investment company.|$|E
5|$|In late 1814 {{and early}} 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman {{was living in}} Marylebone, an inner-city area of central London. Said to be the {{daughter}} of an unspecified noblewoman, she was supposedly young, wealthy and living in fashionable Manchester Square. In some reports she was described as the daughter of a noblewoman from Grosvenor Square. It was claimed that she <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> venture out of the house in a carriage, hidden by a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a window, or a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.|$|E

5|$|One {{check on}} a magistrate's power was his collegiality. Each magisterial office {{would be held}} {{concurrently}} by at least two people. Another such check was provocatio. Provocatio was a primordial form of due process. It was a precursor to habeas corpus. If any magistrate tried to use {{the powers of the}} state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> have their imperium extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a promagistrate), without officially holding that office.|$|E
5|$|The {{family and}} {{household}} slaves resided {{on the second}} floor of the mansion, while others lived in the stable. As with everywhere else had they lived, she cared nothing about public life, and instead worked with Eliza and the other servants to create a home that welcomed extended family members and personal friends of the Houstons. Houston <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> hire out some of his labor force. The first child born in the Texas governor's mansion was also the last of the Houston children; Temple Lea Houston was delivered on August 12, 1860. This last birth left the 41-year-old Margaret debilitated for almost two weeks, with a watchful Houston constantly by her side.|$|E
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
50|$|Daily <b>would</b> also <b>occasionally</b> {{serve as}} a {{panelist}} on the 1970s CBS game show The Match Game. After Richard Dawson's departure, Daily was a semi-regular for the final {{three years of the}} show's CBS and syndicated run.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} episode of Big Break, Virgo {{performed}} a trick shot dressed as Willie Thorne and missed the pot, while the contestant got it in. He <b>would</b> also <b>occasionally</b> mock various other players, including Jimmy White.|$|R
60|$|Then Farmer Griffith readily {{said that}} he <b>would</b> go up <b>occasionally</b> and see his landlord.|$|R
5|$|The climatic vault heist {{required}} {{four weeks}} of preparation with every scene and camera angle determined in advance. The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming. The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing {{the capabilities of the}} prop vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a Porsche Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower of sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} day of filming on June 23 was {{predominantly}} shot on the set representing {{the bridge of the}} Enterprise. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay. One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up her skirt throughout the shoot and <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> try to grope her using the puppet.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{remained}} with the Bruins {{for three more}} seasons. He {{was named to the}} NHL Second All-Star team twice more and was selected to play in the inaugural NHL All-Star Game in 1947. The Bruins made the playoffs all three seasons but were eliminated in the semi-finals in all of them. Brimsek was also a finalist for the Hart Trophy in 1947–48, finishing behind Buddy O'Connor of the Rangers. Personal problems plagued Brimsek during his final years in Boston. His 10-month-old son had died in January 1949, and his coach and longtime teammate, Dit Clapper, had resigned from his coaching duties. It did not also help that the Boston crowd <b>would</b> <b>occasionally</b> boo Brimsek for his play. After the 1948–49 season, Brimsek requested a trade from Boston to Chicago in order to be closer to home, and to the new blueprint business he had started there. Boston granted his request and he was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for cash. Brimsek only played one season with the Black Hawks, recording 22 wins, 38 losses and 10 ties in 70 games played. The team finished last in the standings. Brimsek's lone season with the Hawks was the only season where his team did not reach the playoffs. He retired {{at the conclusion of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s through the 1950s, Killy <b>would</b> also <b>occasionally</b> {{work as a}} {{production}} manager on such films as: Blood on the Moon (1948), The Big Steal (1949), Angel Face, Jet Pilot, and All Mine to Give (1958).|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} a variety/news {{magazine}} show for kids. Every week {{it would have}} a celebrity guest who the host <b>would</b> interview, <b>occasionally</b> a psychologist <b>would</b> speak about the challenges of growing up, and there would be comedy or musical routines.|$|R
