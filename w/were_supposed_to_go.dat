25|$|However, the {{improvement}} of De Witt's personal relations with the Prince and his mother came to nought when she suddenly died (24 December 1660), like her late husband also of smallpox. She appointed her brother Charles as William's guardian in her will. This gave the King of England formal stature to interfere in his nephew's education, and in Dutch affairs of state. At the same time, the negotiations about the treaty were not going well. Not only did Charles refuse to retract the Navigation Acts, but he even re-issued them in his own name. A further protectionist measure was the bill before the Cavalier Parliament to restrict fishing in a zone of ten miles from the English coast (though in those days territorial waters <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> no further than three miles).

500|$|In Halas's {{final season}} as an NFL coach, Sayers again starred. Sharing {{more of the}} rushing duties with other backs, such as Brian Piccolo, Sayers gained 880 yards with a 4.7-yard average per carry. His receptions were down as well. He had three kickoff returns for touchdowns on 16 returns, {{averaging}} 37.7 yards per return. Only rarely returning punts—he returned three all season—Sayers still managed to return one for a score against the San Francisco 49ers, {{a game in which}} he also returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown and scored a rushing touchdown on a rain-soaked field in San Francisco's Kezar Stadium. [...] "It was a bad field, but it didn't stop some people," [...] said 49ers coach Jack Christiansen, referring to Sayers' performance. Christiansen said that after Sayers' kickoff return, all punts <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out of bounds. But Sayers received the punt and ran 58 yards through {{the middle of the field}} for the score. In a November game against the Detroit Lions, a cutback by Sayers caused future hall of fame cornerback Lem Barney to fall over, after which Sayers sprinted for a 63-yard gain. Later in the game he returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. After the season, Sayers was invited to his third straight Pro Bowl, in which he returned a kickoff 75 yards and scored a three-yard rushing touchdown and again earned player of the game honors. Chicago finished in second place in the newly organized Central Division with a 7–6–1 record.|$|E

2500|$|The Haggadah Otzar Divrei HaMeforshim cites {{several other}} reasons for the custom of {{stealing}} the afikoman. According to Mekor Chaim - Chavos Yair, this custom demonstrates love for the mitzvah of afikoman. Rabbi Menashe Klein, the Ungvar Rebbe, says that this custom is a re-enactment of the biblical account of Jacob stealing the blessings that <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to his brother Esau. Midrash Pliah says that Isaac told Esau, [...] "Your brother came with trickery" [...] (Genesis 27:35), adding, [...] "and he took out the afikoman." [...] According to the Midrash, this account took place on Passover. Therefore, the children steal the afikoman to get the blessings, which are the present that they ask their fathers to buy for them.|$|E
