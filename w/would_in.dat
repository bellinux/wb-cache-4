Around 2,200,000 cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a gravitational field than they <b>would</b> <b>in</b> the absence of that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was seen as {{more than just the}} simple renaming of an international tendency that was already in existence.

As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, Velociraptor was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family Archaeopterygidae by at least one author (which <b>would,</b> <b>in</b> effect, make Velociraptor a flightless bird).|$|E

5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it <b>would,</b> <b>in</b> fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E
