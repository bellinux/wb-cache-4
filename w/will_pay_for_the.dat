25|$|The {{total cost}} of the Buenos Aires—Rosario—Córdoba line was {{calculated}} at US$ 4 billion. Four European firms presented themselves as bidders: Alstom (French), Siemens (German), CAF (Spanish) and Impregilo (Italian). Pre-contractual conditions stated that the national state <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole sum, but the firm in charge of the construction will finance 50%. When technical and financial bids were due in March 2007 only the Veloxia grouping of Alstom, Isolux Corsan, Iecsa and Emepa Group came forward, and the consortium was selected as preferred bidder on 20 June 2007.|$|E

As they worry about what may have happened to Elsa and what the Snow Queen has done since then, they are put in a trunk, which is then locked and dumped into the sea by Hans and Blackbeard so Hans {{and his brothers}} can take over Arendelle.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} HMOs—no matter {{whether a person}} is on Medicare or not—persons who enroll in a Medicare Advantage HMO cannot use certain {{specialist}} physicians or out-of-network providers without prior authorization from the HMO, except in emergencies. In almost all Medicare Advantage plans—HMO or otherwise—the beneficiary must choose a primary care physician (PCP) who will provide the referrals and the beneficiary must confirm that the plan authorizes the visit to which the beneficiary was referred by the PCP. As with all HMOs, {{this can be a}} problem {{for people who want to}} use out of network specialists or who are hospitalized and are forced to use out-of-network doctors while in the hospital. Enrolling in a Medicare Advantage PPO, if available, can help solve this dilemma, because many Medicare Advantage PPO plans permit a subscriber to use any physician or hospital without prior authorization, but at a somewhat higher expense. By law, however, if a patient's in-network physician orders tests or procedures or refers a patient to a specialist that are not available or provided by any in-network facility or specialist's office, the Medicare Advantage plan <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> patient's procedures or services at an out-of-network location and charge in-network cost-sharing to the patient, so long as the necessary services are normally covered by the plan (the beneficiary should still make sure he or she has authorization however).|$|E

[...] TxDOT only has $7.7 million of the $30 million required for construction costs. [...] Bexar County <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> balance of the project costs with TxDOT reimbursing the County when funds become available. [...] Relocation assistance is being provided to landowners to persuade them to sell their property for the highway. [...] With a shortage of funds and the right-of-way not purchased, {{there is no time}} table for construction. [...] Local opposition to the extension cite greater highway needs elsewhere, environmental concerns in the corridor, and a reluctance to sell land needed for the highway as chief concerns of the highway. [...] Once completed, the highway is believed to provide relief to nearby Loop 1604.|$|E

[...] Calgary <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> project initially, and later be repaid by Alberta and Brookfield Residential, who are developing the neighbourhood {{in the vicinity of}} the interchange. [...] Prior to a firm commitment for a portion of the funding by Brookfield, Alberta had been reluctant to front the estimated $50million in funding required for the project, though the city of Calgary had offered to pay for it in the interim as long as the money was paid back by the province. [...] The city had also considered contributing $20million in tandem with Brookfield, with the province paying for the remaining $30million. [...] City councillor Shane Keating stated in August2016 that development of the Seton neighbourhood will be hampered until the 212Avenue interchange is completed.|$|E

Peña Nieto was criticized for extending the invitation to Trump, and following the conference, journalist Jorge Ramos criticized Peña Nieto for not using the opportunity to publicly contradict Trump's campaign promise to make Mexico pay for his proposed Mexico–United States border wall, as well as Ramos called Trump's [...] "attacks on Latin American immigrants, his rejection of free trade agreements and his scorn for global organizations." [...] Despite this, Peña Nieto stated on his Twitter that he made it clear to Trump that Mexico would not pay for the wall, only to shortly after get a reply from Donald Trump saying: [...] "Mexico <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wall!"

2500|$|In January 2013, the Turkish {{parliament}} {{passed a}} law that permits use of the Kurdish language in the courts, albeit with restrictions. The law was passed by votes of the ruling AKP and the pro-Kurdish rights opposition party BDP, against criticism from the secularist CHP party and the nationalist MHP, with MHP and CHP deputies nearly coming to blows with BDP deputies over the law. In spite of their support in the parliament, the BDP was critical of the provision in the law that the defendants <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> translation fees and that the law applies only to spoken defense in court but not to a written defense or the pre-trial investigation. According to one source [...] {{the law does not}} comply with EU standards. Deputy prime minister of Turkey Bekir Bozdağ replied to criticism of the law from both sides saying that the fees of defendants who does not speak Turkish will be paid by the state, while, those who speak Turkish yet prefer to speak in the court in another language will have to pay the fees themselves. European Commissioner for Enlargement Stefan Füle welcomed the new law.|$|E
2500|$|Plans for the {{consolidated}} {{building at}} Enfield High School by the firm, Silver Petrucelli & Associates, and construction company, Gilbane, {{called for a}} four floor [...] "STEAM" [...] (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) wing addition to {{the south end of}} the building off A-wing which will include state-of-the-art science labs and classrooms. A-wing will see a [...] "like-new" [...] renovation, as well the rest of the facility, that would gut the entire building to its core structure and will construct updated classrooms. A grand lobby with a tiered glass enclosure is proposed for the main entrance. B-wing plans to house an expanded guidance department and career services office. Expansion to the gymnasium out of the north end of the building will result in renovated locker rooms and health classrooms; and cardio, wellness, and weight rooms. Expansion to the cafeteria and auditorium will double their size. Renovations to C-wing also include a second lobby for the performing arts music wing with expanded music classrooms, practice rooms, and offices. The entire building will be implemented with advanced technology and air-conditioning. Site-plans reworked campus landscaping, traffic flow, and parking spaces for faculty and students. The total cost of construction for the expansion and renovation to Enfield High School is approximately $103 million. However, with a reimbursement rate from the State of Connecticut at approximately 73% the town will pay a share of approximately $35 million, bonded over 20 years. The closing of Enrico Fermi High School as a school will result in approximately $2 million in savings each year. Plans state that savings from the closing of one high school <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 20 year bond, according to the Enfield Pre-Referendum High School Consolidation Committee. If the referendum did not pass, Enfield's two high schools would have remained open, but would have required limited renovations for updates to each facility at a cost of $50 million each, which would not be reimbursable by the state, in order to adhere to the State of Connecticut's new educational mandates that go into effect in 2017. Moreover, issues with Americans with Disabilities Act regulations had to be addressed in both buildings. The referendum went to town's voters in November 2012, and passed by a 2:1 margin.|$|E
