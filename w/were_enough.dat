5|$|In the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, St. Louis led the NHL with 43 assists, and his 60 points <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> {{to capture}} his second Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer. After the season, {{he was named}} a Second Team All-Star. With only 14 penalty minutes on the season, St. Louis also won his third Lady Byng Trophy.|$|E
5|$|The California {{defense was}} led by {{defensive}} back Donnie McCleskey, an All-Pac-10 selection who accumulated 99tackles—the most on the team—and 2interceptions during the regular season. The 99tackles <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to tie him for 14th place on California's all-time single-season tackle leaders list.|$|E
50|$|Swahili, {{like all}} other Bantu languages, has {{numerous}} noun classes. Verbs must agree in class with their subjects and objects, and adjectives with the nouns that they qualify. For example: Kitabu kimoja kitatosha (One book will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Mchungwa mmoja utatosha (One orange-tree will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Chungwa moja litatosha (One orange will <b>be</b> <b>enough).</b> There <b>is</b> also agreement in number. For example: Vitabu viwili vitatosha (Two books will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Michungwa miwili itatosha (Two orange-trees will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Machungwa mawili yatatosha (Two oranges will <b>be</b> <b>enough).</b> Class and number are indicated with prefixes (or sometimes their absence), which are not always the same for nouns, adjectives and verbs, {{as illustrated by the}} examples.|$|R

50|$|The relegation battle {{ended in}} {{disappointment}} for Wolves and Peterborough. The late goal for Crystal Palace against Peterborough meant that a 1-1 draw <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for Blackburn, a 2-0 win for Sheffield Wednesday over Middlesbrough <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> {{to secure their}} safety, a 1-0 defeat for Millwall against Derby County <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for them and a 2-2 draw between Huddersfield and Barnsley <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for both teams. Wolves lost 2-0 to Brighton, having started {{the day in the}} most difficult situation of the threatened teams.|$|R
5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Before its release, IGN {{was highly}} anticipating {{the final version}} of the game as they had played two {{previous}} versions of the game already. Concentrating on the multiplayer aspect of the game, they praised the developers for moving a solely platform game into the multiplayer genre so well. Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal was featured at the E3 games festival in 2004, where there was a playable demo. Only the multiplayer Siege mode and a single-player demo were available but they <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to get 1UP.com's award for best action game at E3.|$|E
5|$|Despite making {{just one}} goalless {{appearance}} as England failed to progress past the Euro 1992 group stages, Shearer was soon subject to an English transfer record-breaking £3.6million bid from Blackburn Rovers. Although {{there was also}} interest from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, Blackburn benefactor Jack Walker's millions <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to prise the striker from the Saints, and Shearer moved north to Ewood Park {{in the middle of}} 1992.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the points}} won by Moreno's second-place finish, Katusha {{were not able}} to win enough points to win the UCI World Tour rankings. The 60 points that Valverde won <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to secure the overall victory in the team's competition, as well as {{increasing}} his own margin of victory in the individual classification. Pinot's third-place finish earned him 70 points and moved him up to tenth place in the World Tour rankings, while the success of the Italian riders moved Italy ahead of both Colombia and Great Britain to finish second behind Spain in the national rankings.|$|E

The Symphonic Band also performed several other Dello Joio works, including Scenes from the Louvre, Variants on a Mediaeval Tune, and Fantasies on a Theme by Haydn. The National Intercollegiate Concert Band was conducted by Past Grand President Jay L. Slaughter, and performed Makovksy's Kappa Kappa Psi march and several other works.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Chelsea {{clashed with}} Real Betis. The opening game at Estadio Manuel Ruíz de Lopera was won with 2–1 after a Tore André Flo double, before a 3–1 win {{at home with}} goals signed by Frank Sinclair, Roberto Di Matteo and Zola <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to hand Chelsea an overall 5–2 victory. The final {{opposition}} in the semi-finals was Vicenza. Chelsea lost the away fixture 0–1, at Stadio Romeo Menti.

5|$|Significant Minoan remains {{have been}} found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer and tsunami level, and {{it is unclear whether}} the effects <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to trigger the {{downfall}} of the Minoan civilization. Some sites were abandoned or settlement systems significantly interrupted {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the eruption. As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans. Whether the effects <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to trigger the downfall of the civilization is intensely debated. The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period. The Mycenaeans were a military civilization. Using their functional navy and a well-equipped army, they were capable of an invasion. Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete. That demonstrates Mycenaean military influence not many years after the eruption. Many archaeologists speculate that the eruption caused a crisis in Minoan civilization, making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans.|$|E
5|$|The federal Conservatives {{proposed}} {{remedial legislation}} to override Manitoba, {{but they were}} blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights. Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes {{at the end of}} the day if there <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.|$|E

5|$|The {{second and}} final day was stopped and {{cancelled}} due to worsened weather, {{culminating in a}} high-speed fall on the outrun by Christof Duffner after he landed an unofficial, world record-equalling jump of 194m. Goldberger's efforts from earlier in the event <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to earn him a silver medal behind eventual winner Noriaki Kasai, who became the first non-European Ski Flying World Champion.

5|$|These two results <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> {{to advance}} Ireland to the Super 8 {{stage of the}} tournament.In their final group stage game, the West Indies beat them by eight wickets. In the Super 8 stage, they lost their four matches against England, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and Sri Lanka, but {{recorded}} a 74-run victory against Test playing nation Bangladesh, the 9th ranked team in the world. The team received a heroes' welcome in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Two {{victories}} – away to Aalborg {{and at home}} to Celtic – {{and four}} draws <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to secure passage to the knockout phase of the competition. Following a Celtic victory over Villarreal in the final group match, United went through as group winners. This meant that they would avoid Roma, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Porto and Juventus in the first knockout round; however, their potential opposition still included Internazionale, Lyon and Real Madrid. The draw paired Manchester United with José Mourinho's Internazionale, but since United had won their group, they were rewarded by having the second leg at home.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, ODST {{became the}} top-selling Xbox 360 game worldwide. The title {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, music, and story approach. Reviewers were divided {{on whether the}} relatively short campaign and included extras <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> to justify the game's US$60 price tag. The game was the top-selling title in the United States in September 2009, and sold more than 3million copies worldwide. Softpedia, Time, and Wired were among publications that declared the game one of the year's best.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He said that there <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised {{and said that the}} game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Lithuania {{asked the}} Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one {{was known as}} the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he thought there <b>were</b> <b>enough</b> Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to topple the Lithuanian government.|$|E
