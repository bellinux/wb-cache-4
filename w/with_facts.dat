At the UNABOM Task Force headquarters in San Francisco, Supervisory Special Agent Joel Moss immediately recognized similarities in the writings.

When combined <b>with</b> <b>facts</b> gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, that analysis provided the basis for a search warrant.|$|E
5|$|Bacon: A Love Story, A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat is a 2009 non-fiction {{book about}} bacon, written by American writer Heather Lauer. Lauer started the blog Bacon Unwrapped {{and a social}} {{networking}} site about bacon in 2005, after the idea came to her while she was out drinking with her two brothers; her online success inspired her to write the book, which describes curing and cooking bacon, gives over 20 bacon recipes, and analyzes the impact of bacon on popular culture. The text is interspersed <b>with</b> <b>facts</b> about bacon and bacon-related quips from comedian Jim Gaffigan.|$|E

25|$|Clearly, Wittgenstein did {{not want}} to be a behaviorist, nor did he want to be a cognitivist or a phenomenologist. He is, of course, {{primarily}} concerned <b>with</b> <b>facts</b> of linguistic usage.

25|$|The Office of Strategic Services was {{established}} by a Presidential military order issued by President Roosevelt on June 13, 1942, to collect and analyze strategic information required by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to conduct special operations not assigned to other agencies.

25|$|Scholars {{believe that}} the Nihon Shoki gives the {{invasion}} date of Silla and Baekje as the late 4th century. However, by this time, Japan was a confederation of local tribes without sophisticated iron weapons, while the Three Kingdoms of Korea were fully developed centralized powers with modern iron weapons and were already utilizing horses for warfare. It is very unlikely that a developing state such as Yamato {{had the capacity to}} cross the sea and engage in battles with Baekje and Silla. The Nihon Shoki is widely regarded to be an unreliable and biased source of information on early relations with Korea, as it mixes heavy amounts of supposition and legend <b>with</b> <b>facts.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hesselberg (689m {{above sea}} level) {{is the highest}} point in Middle Franconia and the Franconian Jura and is {{situated}} 60km south west of Nuremberg, Germany. The mountain stands isolated and far {{from the center of}} the Franconian Jura, in its southwestern border region, 4km to the north west of Wassertrüdingen. The mountain's first recorded name was Öselberg, which probably derived from öder Berg (bleak mountain). This name later changed to Eselsberg and finally to the current name Hesselberg. As a butte the mountain provides an insight into Jurassic geology. It has also witnessed an eventful history, many incidents were handed down from generation to generation and these mixed <b>with</b> <b>facts</b> have become legends.

25|$|In June 1977, NASA {{issued a}} fact sheet {{responding}} to recent {{claims that the}} Apollo Moon landings had been hoaxed. The fact sheet is particularly blunt and regards the idea of faking the Moon landings to be preposterous and outlandish. NASA refers to the rocks and particles collected from the Moon as being evidence of the program's legitimacy, as they claim that these rocks {{could not have been}} formed under conditions on earth. NASA also notes that all of the operations and phases of the Apollo program were closely followed and under the scrutiny of the news media, from liftoff to splashdown. NASA responds to Bill Kaysing's book, We Never Went to the Moon, by identifying one of his claims of fraud regarding the lack of a crater left on the Moon's surface by the landing of the lunar module, and refuting it <b>with</b> <b>facts</b> about the soil and cohesive nature of the surface of the Moon.|$|E

Churchill, who had been getting up to leave, stayed to listen and was heard to ask the Chief Whip, Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, who the promising young backbencher was. When summoned to 10 Downing Street on 7 May {{he claimed to have}} been half-expecting a reprimand for his refusal to serve a second term as a British representative at the Council of Europe, a job he found boring, but he was instead appointed Minister of Health, which was not a Cabinet position at that time.|$|E

25|$|Later {{attempts}} at discovering whether Lucas had actually killed anyone apart from Powell and Rich were complicated by Lucas's {{ability to make}} an accurate deduction that seemed to substantiate a confession. In one instance, he explained how he had correctly identified a victim in a group photograph through her wearing spectacles; a pair of glasses were {{on a table in}} a crime scene photo shown to him earlier. There were also suggestions that the interview tapes showed that, despite Lucas's supposedly low IQ, he had adroitly read the reactions of those interviewing him and altered what he was saying, thereby making his confessions more consistent <b>with</b> <b>facts</b> known to law enforcement. The most serious allegation against investigators, that they had let Lucas read case files on unsolved crimes and thus enabled him to come up with convincingly detailed confessions, made it virtually impossible to determine if, as some continue to suspect, he had been telling the truth to the Lucas Task Force about a relatively large number of the murders.|$|E

60|$|If {{the great}} {{benefits}} of scientific training are sought, {{it is essential}} that such training should be real: that is to say, that the mind of the scholar should be brought into direct relation <b>with</b> <b>fact,</b> that he should not merely be told a thing, but made to see by the use of his own intellect and ability that the thing is so and no otherwise. The great peculiarity of scientific training, that in virtue of which it cannot be replaced by any other discipline whatsoever, is this bringing of the mind directly into contact <b>with</b> <b>fact,</b> and practising the intellect in the completest form of induction; that is to say, in drawing conclusions from particular facts made known by immediate observation of Nature.|$|R
500|$|Coppola had {{a certain}} amount of {{personal}} affinity with the short-lived legacy of Preston Tucker.

Coppola included the involvement of Preston Tucker's children, grandchildren and members of the Tucker Estate during the development of Tucker in the late 1970s, as well as during filming in 1987. Coppola and Lucas acknowledged that they purposely intended to portray Tucker in an entirely sympathetic way. Both filmmakers each owned two Tuckers, although Lucas eventually sold one of his cars in September 2005 for $385,500. The Tucker Automobile Club made up of a legion of Tucker owners and collectors pronounced in their trade journal, TACA, that the [...] "basic theme of the movie is quite accurate..."

500|$|Most of the {{technical}} aspects of development—game direction, scripting, and programming—were handled by Hato alone, with fellow artist Damurushi assisting with some minor aspects of the script and art direction. Despite this, most of the roughly seven-month period Hato spent developing Hatoful from a one-off April Fools' gag to the finished product was dedicated to the construction of the narrative. Hato's approach towards the game's writing was [...] "to create something that seems ridiculous and crazy at first glance, but that once you look into the world, you would fall into the depth"; however, resolving the darker elements of the plot, particularly the Bad Boys Love scenario, <b>with</b> <b>facts</b> established in the quickly conceived and largely comedic pilot proved to be difficult for her, with inconsistencies in the overall timeline becoming a major concern.

500|$|The G-spot {{having an}} {{anatomical}} {{relationship with the}} clitoris has been challenged by Vincenzo Puppo, who, while agreeing that the clitoris {{is the center of}} female sexual pleasure, disagrees with Helen O'Connell and other researchers' terminological and anatomical descriptions of the clitoris. He stated, [...] "Clitoral bulbs is an incorrect term from an embryological and anatomical viewpoint, in fact the bulbs do not develop from the phallus, and they do not belong to the clitoris." [...] He says that clitoral bulbs [...] "is not a term used in human anatomy" [...] and that vestibular bulbs is the correct term, adding that gynecologists and sexual experts should inform the public <b>with</b> <b>facts</b> instead of hypotheses or personal opinions. [...] "litoral/vaginal/uterine orgasm, G/A/C/U spot orgasm, and female ejaculation, are terms that should not be used by sexologists, women, and mass media," [...] he said, further commenting that the [...] "anterior vaginal wall is separated from the posterior urethral wall by the urethrovaginal septum (its thickness is 10–12 mm)" [...] and that the [...] "inner clitoris" [...] does not exist. [...] "The female perineal urethra, which is located in front of the anterior vaginal wall, is about one centimeter in length and the G-spot is located in the pelvic wall of the urethra, 2–3 cm into the vagina," [...] Puppo stated. He believes that the penis cannot come in contact with the congregation of multiple nerves/veins situated until the angle of the clitoris, detailed by Georg Ludwig Kobelt, or with the roots of the clitoris, which do not have sensory receptors or erogenous sensitivity, during vaginal intercourse. He did, however, dismiss the orgasmic definition of the G-spot that emerged after Ernst Gräfenberg, stating that [...] "there is no anatomical evidence of the vaginal orgasm which was invented by Freud in 1905, without any scientific basis".|$|E
