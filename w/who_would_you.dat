500|$|Brubaker {{wanted to}} examine the reality of being a vigilante, and Kill or Be Killed focuses on the ramifications of {{violence}} {{and its effect on}} the Dylan’s loved ones. The demonic element to the story also allows Brubaker to play with the idea of [...] "If you had to kill a bad person, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> pick?" [...] Although Dylan becomes a murderer {{at the beginning of the}} story, Brubaker hopes the character's plight is sympathetic enough that readers will root for him. Dylan's arrangement with the demon has been interpreted as commentary on the War on Terror and the racially motivated violence publicised in the US in the two years prior to the book's publication.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1950–51 NBA season, Walter Brown, {{owner of}} the Boston Celtics, was desperate to turn around his {{struggling}} and financially strapped franchise, which was reeling from a 22–46 record. Brown, in characteristic candor, said to a gathering of local Boston sportswriters, [...] "Boys, I don't know anything about basketball. <b>Who</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> recommend I hire as coach?" [...] The group vociferously answered that he get the recently available Auerbach, and Brown complied. In the 1950 NBA draft, Auerbach made some notable moves. First, he famously snubbed Hall-of-Fame New England point guard Bob Cousy in the 1950 NBA draft, infuriating the Boston crowd. He argued that the flashy Cousy lacked the poise necessary to make his team, taunting him as a [...] "local yokel". Second, he drafted African-American Chuck Cooper, the first black player to be drafted by an NBA club. With that, Auerbach effectively broke down the color barrier in professional basketball.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2008, Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Institute for Global Economic Growth, {{wrote in}} The Washington Times: [...] "If {{you were asked}} to name one person who has enabled more people to gain wealth and {{security}} than any other person on the globe, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> name?

Were you her brother, I should say that you would be right--nay, that it would be your duty to endeavour to punish the outrage against the honour of your family. Were you openly betrothed to her, you would again have the right to punish her abductor; but, not being either her brother or her betrothed, neither reason nor public opinion would justify your doing so. Moreover, did you fight with him and kill him, you would incur the gravest resentment of the king; for, in fact, you would be impugning his justice, which has considered banishment from court to be a sufficient punishment for his offence. Not only was he a favourite of the king's, but he belongs, I understand, to a powerful family; <b>who</b> <b>would,</b> <b>you</b> may be sure, use their influence with the king to bring about your punishment, for the breach of the decree against duelling, and you would be fortunate if you escaped a long imprisonment." ...|$|E
