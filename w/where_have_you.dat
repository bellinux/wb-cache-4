Graham Bonnet's version of the song appears on the soundtrack of the 2009 Peter Jackson film The Lovely Bones..

2500|$|The Vanguard Press {{published}} Oates' first novel, With Shuddering Fall (1964), {{when she}} was 26 years old. In 1966, she published [...] "Where Are You Going, <b>Where</b> <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> Been?", a short story dedicated to Bob Dylan and written after listening to his song [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue." [...] The story is loosely based on the serial killer Charles Schmid, also known as [...] "The Pied Piper of Tucson". It has been anthologized many times and adapted as a film, Smooth Talk starring Laura Dern (1985). In 2008, Oates said that of all her published work, she is most noted for [...] "Where Are You Going, <b>Where</b> <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> Been?". Another early short story, [...] "In a Region of Ice" [...] (The Atlantic Monthly, August 1966), features a young, gifted Jewish-American student. It dramatizes his drift into protest against the world {{of education and the}} sober, established society of his parents, his depression, and eventually murder-cum-suicide. It was inspired by a real-life incident (as were several of her works) and Oates had been acquainted with the model of her protagonist. She revisited this subject in the title story of her collection Last Days: Stories (1984). [...] "In the Region of Ice" [...] won the first of her two O. Henry Awards. Her second novel was A Garden of Earthly Delights (1967), first of the so-called Wonderland Quartet published by Vanguard 1967 to 1971. All were finalists for the annual National Book Award.|$|E

2500|$|According to Alex Buchan, Abernethy's biographer, in the 19th century Royal Naval {{officers}} were almost always from the landed gentry {{and they had}} purchased their commissions. Certain of their superiority, they wrote accounts of their expeditions keeping the credit for themselves. Indeed, {{at the end of}} an expedition, commanders often required any records kept by the crew to be given to them for inclusion at their discretion in the official report. Possibly because of this Abernethy left no written records. According to Sir Joseph Hooker, a distinguished scientist, concerning crewmen, [...] "And <b>where</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> seen or heard that their services are in the least appreciated? The Admiralty have not as much as sent a letter of thanks to the men".|$|E
