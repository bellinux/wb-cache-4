25|$|The Western Wall {{served as}} the {{retaining}} wall {{of the first and}} second Temple. According to tradition, its sanctity is two-fold – it is the closest spot on earth to the location of the first and second Temples that Jews are allowed to access. Tradition holds that there are areas of the Temple Mount that are forbidden for any Jew in a state of ritual impurity to traverse. Since <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Temple now, we cannot expunge ritual impurity, thus should a Jew walk atop the Temple Mount, he or she may be defiling certain sacred areas. In addition to the proximity to the Temple Mount, tradition holds that the Western Wall was built by donations made by the poor of Israel and that such self-sacrifice confers a special protection to the site. The Temple Mount is now occupied by the Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. In Islamic tradition, Mohammed ascended to heaven from the Temple Mount.|$|E

Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Evidently Carthage {{also had}} an {{institution}} of elders who advised the Suffets, similar to the Roman Senate. [...] <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> name for this body. At times members would travel with an army general on campaign. [...] Members also formed permanent committees. [...] The institution had several hundred members from the wealthiest class who held office for life. [...] Vacancies were probably filled by co-option. [...] From among its members were selected the 104 Judges mentioned above. Later the 104 would come to judge not only army generals but other office holders as well. Aristotle regarded the 104 as most important; he compared it to the ephorate of Sparta with regard to control over security. In Hannibal's time, such a Judge held office for life. At some stage there also came to be independent self-perpetuating boards of five who filled vacancies and supervised (non-military) government administration.|$|E

However, the government canceled the gathering, saying it would be banning any and all public gatherings for an indefinite period {{to prevent the spread of}} the H1N1 flu virus. However, the head of the Circassian youth movement, Timur Jujuev, said [...] "All the public markets continue working on a regular basis, so where is the emergency? We are going to organize the demonstration even if we will need to wear surgical masks and even if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> license from the government.

2500|$|Tidal {{acceleration}} {{is one of}} the {{few examples}} in the dynamics of the Solar System of a so-called secular perturbation of an orbit, i.e. a perturbation that continuously increases with time and is not periodic. [...] Up to a high order of approximation, mutual gravitational perturbations between major or minor planets only cause periodic variations in their orbits, that is, parameters oscillate between maximum and minimum values. [...] The tidal effect gives rise to a quadratic term in the equations, which leads to unbounded growth. [...] In the mathematical theories of the planetary orbits that form the basis of ephemerides, quadratic and higher order secular terms do occur, but these are mostly Taylor expansions of very long time periodic terms. The reason that tidal effects are different is that unlike distant gravitational perturbations, friction is an essential part of tidal acceleration, and leads to permanent loss of energy from the dynamic system in the form of heat. In other words, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Hamiltonian system here.|$|E
60|$|It is clear, in {{the first}} place, {{that there can be}} no datum apart from a belief. A {{sensation}} which merely comes and goes is not a datum; it only becomes a datum when it is remembered. Similarly, in perception, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> datum unless we have a JUDGMENT of perception. In the sense in which objects (as opposed to propositions) are data, it would seem natural to say that those objects of which we are conscious are data. But consciousness, as we have seen, is a complex notion, involving beliefs, as well as mnemic phenomena such as are required for perception and memory. It follows that no datum is theoretically indubitable, since no belief is infallible; it follows also that every datum has a greater or less degree of vagueness, since there is always some vagueness in memory and the meaning of images.|$|E
