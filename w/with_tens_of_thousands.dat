The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended {{due to lack of}} access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed <b>with</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of laborers out of work.

L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E

However, when the track shifted further to the east, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for coastal areas of North Carolina, <b>with</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> removed from their homes.

5|$|At {{the head}} of the temple {{hierarchy}} was the high priest, who oversaw all the temple's religious and economic functions and in the largest cults was an important political figure. Beneath him might be as many as three grades of subordinate priests who could substitute for him in ceremonies. While these higher ranks were full-time positions from the New Kingdom onward, the lower grades of priesthood still worked in shifts {{over the course of the}} year. Whereas many priests did a variety of menial tasks, the clergy also contained several ritual specialists. Prominent among these specialized roles was that of the lector priest who recited hymns and spells during temple rituals, and who hired out his magical services to laymen. Besides its priests, a large temple employed singers, musicians, and dancers to perform during rituals, plus the farmers, bakers, artisans, builders, and administrators who supplied and managed its practical needs. In the Ptolemaic era, temples could also house people who had sought asylum within the precinct, or recluses who voluntarily dedicated themselves to serving the god and living in its household. A major cult, therefore, could have well over 150 full or part-time priests, <b>with</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of non-priestly employees working on its lands across the country. These numbers contrast with mid-sized temples, which may have had 10 to 25 priests, and with the smallest provincial temples, which might have only one.|$|E

The Japanese had moved 90 tanks, much of their artillery, and heavy weapons away from the beaches and into this region.

During the operation, the {{division was}} bombarded <b>with</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of rounds of field artillery fire, encountering Japanese armed with spears as it continued its fight across the island. Japanese also fought using irregular warfare techniques, relying on hidden cave systems, snipers, and small-unit ambushes to delay the advancing 7th Infantry Division.
