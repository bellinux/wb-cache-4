5|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} Barbara Metcalf, in TJ women were {{encouraged}} to participate {{since the beginning of}} the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (محرم), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats of <b>women</b> <b>sometimes</b> participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While <b>women</b> <b>sometimes</b> went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E

25|$|Many Christians {{and most}} Muslims {{who live in}} the cities wear European style clothes. In the countryside, <b>women</b> <b>sometimes</b> wear {{traditional}} colorful skirts and men wear a traditional sherwal (baggy trousers). Dress was historically Ottoman, but remains only as part of the folk culture. Today, almost all Lebanese wear Western clothing.|$|E
25|$|For {{reasons that}} are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she {{is to have a}} {{multiple}} birth naturally. It is theorized that {{this is due to the}} higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older <b>women</b> <b>sometimes</b> have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Women wore matanpushi, {{embroidered}} headbands, and ninkari, earrings. Ninkari was a metal {{ring with}} a ball. Women wore {{it through a}} hole in the ear. Matanpushi and ninkari were originally worn by men. However, women wear them now. Furthermore, aprons called maidari now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore maidari. <b>Women</b> <b>sometimes</b> wore a bracelet called tekunkani.|$|E

25|$|Making {{the baskets}} {{required}} great skill and knowledge in collecting and preparing the needed materials. Materials for weaving baskets {{changed with the}} seasons and years, so did the materials used for the baskets. The Pomo usually covered a basket completely with the vivid red feathers of the pleated woodpecker until the surface resembled the smoothness of the bird itself. With the feathers, 30-50 to every inch, beads were fastened to the basket’s border and hung pendants of polished abalone shell from the basket itself. Pomo <b>women</b> <b>sometimes</b> spent months or years making such gift baskets.|$|E
25|$|Kurtas {{are often}} worn with jeans. <b>Women</b> <b>{{sometimes}}</b> wear kurtas as blouses, usually over jeans pants. Jeans are sometimes preferred over pajamas or leggings {{as they are}} more durable for rough use. Most colours of kurtas match with blue jeans. In 2014, an Indian family court in Mumbai ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.|$|E
25|$|Tantō are {{generally}} forged in hira-zukuri style (without ridgeline), meaning that their sides have no ridge line and are nearly flat, unlike the shinogi-zukuri {{structure of a}} katana. Some tantō have particularly thick cross-sections for armor-piercing duty, and are called yoroi toshi. Tantō were mostly carried by samurai, as commoners did not generally wear them. <b>Women</b> <b>sometimes</b> carried a small tantō called a kaiken in their obi primarily for self-defense. Tantō were sometimes worn as the shōtō {{in place of a}} wakizashi in a daishō, especially on the battlefield. Before the advent of the wakizashi/tantō combination, it was common for a samurai to carry a tachi and a tantō as opposed to a katana and a wakizashi.|$|E

50|$|The Deer <b>Woman,</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{known as}} the Deer Lady, is a spirit in various forms of Native American mythology that is {{primarily}} associated with fertility and love.

25|$|Although forced-choice {{questionnaires}} show {{a statistically}} significant sex- difference, critics {{of the theory of}} evolved sex differences in jealousy question these findings. In consideration of the entire body of work on sex differences, Harris (2003) asserted that when methods other than forced-choice questionnaires are used to identify an innate sex difference, inconsistencies between studies begin to arise. For example, in a study by Sangrin & Guadango (2005), the authors found that <b>women</b> <b>sometimes</b> report feeling more intense jealousy in response to both sexual and emotional infidelity. The results of these studies also depended on {{the context in which the}} participants were made to describe what type of jealousy they felt, as well as the intensity of their jealousy. From this study, it is clear that context plays a role in the responses men and women give researchers and therefore how sex-differences are interpreted.|$|E
25|$|In many families, {{single or}} {{multiple}} middle names are simply alternative names, names honoring an ancestor or relative, or, for married <b>women,</b> <b>sometimes</b> their maiden names. In some traditions, however, {{the roles of}} the first and middle given names are reversed, with the first given name being used to honor a family member and the middle name being used as the usual method to address someone informally. Many Catholic families choose a saint's name as their child's middle name or this can be left until the child's confirmation when they choose a saint's name for themselves. Cultures that use patronymics or matronymics will often give middle names to distinguish between two similarly named people: e.g., Einar Karl Stefánsson and Einar Guðmundur Stefánsson. This is especially done in Iceland (as shown in example) where people are known and referred to almost exclusively by their given name/s.|$|E

500|$|David Foot quotes {{an unnamed}} cricketer {{saying that the}} two ruling passions of Hammond's life [...] "were his cricket bat and his genitals". His strong desire for women was noticed by team-mates from early in his career. Foot {{believes}} that Hammond had sexual relationships with many <b>women,</b> <b>sometimes</b> several contemporaneously, before and during his first marriage, some of which led to marriage proposals. This was widely known in cricket circles, prompting disapproval from figures such as Barnett.|$|E
500|$|Three Sisters Tavern, {{sometimes}} abridged as Three Sisters and nicknamed [...] "Six Tits", was a gay bar {{and strip}} club in Portland, Oregon, United States. The bar {{was founded in}} 1964 and began catering to Portland's gay community in 1997 following {{the deaths of the}} original owners. The business evolved into a strip club featuring an all-male revue. Also frequented by <b>women,</b> <b>sometimes</b> for bachelorette parties, Three Sisters was considered a hub of Portland's nightlife before closing in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} of travel, it was customary for many people, including women, to travel long distances. [...] Upper-class wives frequently accompanied their husbands on crusade or to tournaments, and many women traveled for social or family engagements; both nuns and laywomen would perform pilgrimages. When not on foot, women would usually travel on horseback or, if weakened or infirm, be carried in a wagon or a litter. [...] If roads permitted, <b>women</b> <b>sometimes</b> rode in early carriages developed from freight wagons, pulled by three or four horses. After the invention of better suspension systems, travel in carriages became more comfortable. [...] Women of the nobility also rode horses for sport, accompanying men in activities that included hunting and hawking.|$|E

5000|$|In {{medieval and}} ancient {{philosophy}} the Wheel of Fortune, or Rota Fortunae, {{is a symbol}} of the capricious nature of Fate. The wheel belongs to the goddess Fortuna, who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel - some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls. Fortune appears on all paintings as a <b>woman,</b> <b>sometimes</b> blindfolded, [...] "puppeteering" [...] a wheel.|$|R
500|$|Types of <b>Women,</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{translated}} {{simply as}} Women or rendered as Semonides 7, is an Archaic Greek satirical poem written by Semonides of Amorgos {{in the seventh}} century BCE. The poem is {{based on the idea that}} Zeus created men and women differently, and that he specifically created ten types of women based on different models from the natural world. Semonides' poem was influenced by Hesiod's story of Pandora, told in both his Works and Days and his Theogony. [...] The poem survives due to its inclusion in Joannes Stobaeus' Anthology. [...] Despite the poem's length and its interest as evidence as to early Greek attitudes towards women, it has received little scholarly attention and has generally been considered to be of little literary merit.|$|E
500|$|William {{introduced}} Fanny to climbing {{after their}} marriage, {{and together they}} spent many summers in the White Mountains in New Hampshire; here she summited Mount Washington (...) several times. Climbing in the Northeastern United States allowed Fanny to develop her abilities together with other women. Unlike European clubs, American climbing clubs in the White Mountains allowed women members and encouraged women to climb. They promoted a new vision of the American woman, one who was both domestic and athletic, and Workman took to this image with enthusiasm. By 1886, <b>women</b> <b>sometimes</b> outnumbered men on hiking expeditions in New England. In her paper on the gender dynamics of climbing in the region, Jenny Ernie-Steighner states that this formative experience shaped Workman's commitment to women's rights, pointing out that [...] "no other well-known international mountaineers of the time, male or female, spoke as openly and fervently about women's rights". However, both of the Workmans disliked the provincial nature of life in Worcester, where they resided, and yearned to live in Europe. After both Fanny's and William's fathers died, leaving them enormous estates, the couple embarked on their first major European trip, a tour of Scandinavia and Germany.|$|E
