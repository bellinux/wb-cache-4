5000|$|For <b>World</b> <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Day</b> 2017 Pincott {{collaborated with}} the International Fund for Animal Welfare {{in an attempt to}} help {{bring an end to the}} Ivory trade. On International Women's Day 2017 Pincott was {{acknowledged}} by associates of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland, Australia, as [...] "blazing a trail for elephants as well as women working in conservation". In late March 2017, almost 3 years after leaving her Hwange elephant work, Pincott was still being acknowledged by the Zimbabwe press for her [...] "profound dedication to the Presidential Elephants", in a country increasingly known for hostility towards conservationists who speak out against wildlife-related corruption. In May 2017, after a male big-game hunter was crushed to death in Hwange when an adult female elephant, felled by gunfire, landed on him, Pincott reasoned in an interview that it was [...] "likely" [...] to be a known Presidential Elephant female that was shot in this hunting party incident, and highlighted the ongoing ineffectuality of Mugabe's Presidential Decree. This was further highlighted in late-June 2017 when a new bout of cyanide poisoning in Presidential Elephant areas in Hwange was revealed, which Pincott spoke about in another interview.|$|E
5000|$|This one-hour All the President's Elephants {{documentary}} {{was filmed}} with Pincott in Hwange in 2011, by the South African production company Triosphere. It {{is the story}} of Pincott's life, work and intimate relationship with the Presidential Elephants of Zimbabwe, showcasing these Hwange elephants and some of the problems they face. It includes her wire snare removal work with colleagues called in to dart well-known injured elephants using a Tranquillizer gun. It also features Pincott's work recommending and encouraging President Robert Mugabe to reaffirm his commitment to this flagship clan of elephants, which bears his identity, in an effort to secure their future. The subsequent 'Presidential Decree Reaffirmation' ceremony, attended by then-Minister of the Environment Francis Nhema on behalf of President Robert Mugabe, was held in Hwange in August 2011 and was included in the filming. All the President's Elephants premiered at the 2012 Durban International Film Festival, where it was considered among the best on show. During an interview with Pincott in 2013 ScreenAfrica - Africa's leading broadcast and film publication - called the film [...] "touching and profound...beautifully emphasising the deep relationship between Pincott and the elephants". This documentary focusing on Pincott's wild elephant work and relationships won 'Outstanding Contribution to Nature' in 2013, with the judges commenting how [...] "very moving" [...] it was [...] "to see how closely people and elephants can be mentally connected", and expressing their respect and appreciation for Pincott's elephant conservation work. Among other nominations and selections including 'Best TV Wildlife Program' at the South African Film and Television Awards 2013, it was shortlisted as a finalist in the prestigious 2016 International Elephant Film Festival - where the world's best elephant films from the previous nine years were celebrated. This event, which involved both the United Nations (UN) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), was organised to raise global awareness of the various challenges facing the African and Asian elephants, as a highlight of UN <b>World</b> <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Day</b> 2016. The distinguished panel of international judges included the United States Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, South Africa's Minister of Environmental Affairs and the Director-General of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

40|$|Online {{contests}} {{are getting}} more popular as means to empower youth and encourage their participation in developmental issues. This research explores the phenomenon of using online contests under the topic of development to empower youth. The theoretical framework is constructed from Paulo Freire’s theories of empowerment and critical consciousness. The empirical study of this research analysed the “call for entry” webpages of three online photo contests for youth. The cases are “Capture Corruption – Global Photo Competition” by Transparency International in 2015; “Through young eyes – photo competition for UN <b>World</b> <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Day</b> 2017 ” by CITES Secretariats and “ 2017 Global Education Monitoring Report Youth Photo Contest” by UNESCO in 2017. The study applied Norman Fairclough’s three-dimensional framework for critical discourse analysis to investigate the texts and four photos in the webpages. The analysis located three significant types of discourse: motivational discourses, self-efficient discourse and participatory discourse. However, the linguistic method and extent of empowering varied among the three contests. Disempowering content was also recognised in one case. Based on the findings from analysis, {{in the light of}} theoretical framework, there was a link between the contests’ “call for entry” webpages and empowerment theory. In particular, motivational discourses contributed to youth psychological empowerment while self-efficient discourse and participatory discourse were part of youth critical consciousness development...|$|E
