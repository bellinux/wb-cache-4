5|$|Before public release, <b>work</b> <b>units</b> {{go through}} several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's <b>work</b> <b>units</b> are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum {{can be used to}} differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad <b>work</b> <b>units.</b>|$|E

5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv <b>work</b> <b>units,</b> designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 <b>work</b> <b>units,</b> they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv <b>work</b> <b>units</b> when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP <b>work</b> <b>units.</b> This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Work teams (also {{referred}} to as production and service teams) are continuing <b>work</b> <b>units</b> responsible for producing goods or providing services for the organization. Their membership is typically stable, usually full-time, and well-defined. These teams are traditionally directed by a supervisor who mandates what work is done, who does it, and in what manner is it executed. Work teams are effectively used in manufacturing sectors such as mining and apparel and service based sectors such as accounting which utilize audit teams.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, with the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky, on August 30, 1862, rumors of an impending Confederate attack on Cincinnati began to circulate. Richmond was one hundred miles to the south of Cincinnati, and no organized Union troops lay between the two cities. An attack by Confederate Colonel John Hunt Morgan, who had led his cavalry on a raid behind Union lines in Kentucky the previous month, was also feared. On September 2, the men of Cincinnati were organized into <b>work</b> <b>units</b> to build fortifications around the city.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home {{can use the}} {{parallel}} computing abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single <b>work</b> <b>units</b> proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in {{the same amount of}} time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors. A 2007 publication in the Journal of Molecular Biology relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the villin protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.|$|E
40|$|Public {{organizations}} {{are interested in}} how to improve their performance. Performance in a <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> can also influence employee job satisfaction due to positive expectations based on higher performance. Thus, our study attempts to investigate if organizational performance {{has an impact on}} employee motivation under the premise that employees who perform better in a <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> expect greater professional recognition and rewards. By using data from the 2013 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), we find that employees who perceive higher levels of performance in a <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> have a higher level of job satisfaction. This paper further shows that performance perception based on rewards is also positively related to job satisfaction. However, underrepresented groups (female and non-white), older employees and mid-level (work experience from 6 to 14 years) employees are less satisfied with higher <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> performance. Finally, employees in the distributive agency category are more satisfied with <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> performance while those in the regulatory agency category are less satisfied with <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> performance. In conclusion, organizations should recognize particular characteristics of employees to develop the policies related to performance management, and effectively utilize these policies in order to attract and retain proficient workers. </p...|$|R

There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the Holzfällerkommando ("woodcutter unit") cut and chopped firewood, and the Tarnungskommando ("disguise unit") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 Wohnlager residential compound contained barracks for about 700 Sonderkommandos which, when combined with the 300 Totenjuden living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{distributed}} computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing {{contributions to the}} project through a credit system. All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more <b>work</b> <b>units</b> from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released. Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though {{through the use of}} a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority. Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines. This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} pioneered {{the use of}} {{graphics}} processing units (GPUs), PlayStation3s, Message Passing Interface (used for computing on multi-core processors), and some Sony Xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computing methods. As part of the client–server model network architecture, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (<b>work</b> <b>units),</b> complete them, and return them to the project's database servers, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to test the mediating role of work satisfaction {{in the relationship between}} <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> climate and labour productivity. Two <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> climate facets are examined: goals and service orientation. Longitudinal data obtained from more than 14, 000 employees in 171 branches of a financial services organization provided no evidence for work satisfaction as a mediator of the relationship between <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> climate and productivity. An increase in service orientation and an increase in goals orientation are both associated with an increase in work satisfaction. An increase in work satisfaction is not associated with an increase in productivity, thereby precluding a mediation effect. An increase in service orientation is related to increased labour productivity, but an increase in goals orientation is not. In addition, relationships across time are reported and interpreted. In this study no evidence was found for work satisfaction as an intermediary mechanism, however, results highlight the importance of differential effects of the two <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> climate facets on work satisfaction and labour productivity.

25|$|In past Chinese society, {{the family}} {{provided}} every individual's support, livelihood, and long-term security. Today the state guarantees such security {{to those with}} no families to provide for them, and families and <b>work</b> <b>units</b> share long-term responsibility for the individual. The role of families has changed, but they remain important, especially in the countryside. Family members are bound, in law and custom, to support their aged or disabled members. The state, acting through <b>work</b> <b>units,</b> provides support and benefits only when families cannot. Households routinely pool income, and any individual's standard of living depends {{on the number of}} household wage earners and the number of dependents. In both cities and villages, the highest incomes usually are earned by households with several wage earners, such as unmarried adult sons or daughters.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this feature {{is that the}} computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking {{that at least two}} different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit. Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, {{due to the lack of}} central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large <b>work</b> <b>units</b> (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning <b>work</b> <b>units</b> when a given node fails to report its results in expected time.|$|E
