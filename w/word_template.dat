[...] "The {{judgment}} established the truth of allegations that Belford High School and Belford University are fake schools that do not actually exist." [...] Court documents from McClusley v. Belford University revealed that Belford University was run by 30-year-old Salem Kureshi from his apartment in Karachi, Pakistan. The court found that Kureshi [...] "operates a sophisticated internet ripoff scheme through various websites, which falsely represent {{the existence of an}} accredited and legitimate high school, whose diplomas will be widely accepted by employers, professional associations, other schools, colleges and universities". Kureshi has created 44 online universities and more than 100 promotional websites. [...] "With an inkjet printer, a Microsoft <b>Word</b> <b>template,</b> and a few cheap websites, Kureshi became an overnight millionaire." [...] He earns over $70 million per year [...] "selling fake diplomas". He is currently involved in a class action lawsuit over his involvement with Rochville University. Although a U.S. District Court ordered its website to be shut down, as of February 25, 2013, Belford University continues to operate from an alternate website address.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} proposed {{here was}} for an Arabic speech recognition application, {{concentrating on the}} Lebanese dialect. The system starts by sampling the speech, which was the process of transforming the sound from analog to digital and then extracts the features by using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The extracted features are then compared with the system's stored model; {{in this case the}} stored model chosen was a phoneme-based model. This reference model differs from the direct <b>word</b> <b>template</b> matching, where speech features that are extracted from the input are directly compared to the word templates. Each <b>word</b> <b>template</b> in the direct matching model was stored as a vector of feature parameters. Thus, when the vocabulary size of the ASR system becomes large, the memory size for the <b>word</b> <b>template</b> will become humongous. In contrast, the model used here was phoneme-like template matching. Word templates are stored as phoneme-like template parameters. Thus, the memory size for the word templates will not grow as fast as that of the direct matching model. Key words: Arabic language, speech recognition and template matchin...|$|E

For each language studied, a <b>word</b> shape <b>template</b> and a <b>word</b> frequency <b>template</b> are firstly constructed based on the proposed word shape coding scheme. Identification is then accomplished based on Bray Curtis or Hamming distance between the word shape code of query images and the constructed word shape and frequency templates.

In constructing the input for the recognition systems, various digital signal processing routines that transform the raw speech signal into a comparable <b>word</b> <b>template</b> format are examined. Word boundary detection is investigated, and an algorithm was developed to automatically separate each digit from the collected speech samples. A "dynamic time warping" procedure provides the template matching system with the ability to time align two templates, in contrast to the "temporal flow" neural network model, which contains a network of delay links to represent temporal relationships.

We present a predominantly top-down model for phonemic restoration. The model uses a missing data speech recognition system to recognize speech utterances as word sequences and activates <b>word</b> <b>templates</b> corresponding to the words containing the masked phonemes. An activated template is dynamically time warped to the noisy word and is then used to restore the speech frames corresponding to the masked phoneme, thereby synthesizing it.
