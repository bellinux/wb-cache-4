The Chicago Sun-Times review said [...] "I never once thought anyone would be able to create an engaging and entertaining video game around the fiction and philosophy of Ayn Rand, but that is essentially what 2K Games has done... the rare, mature video game that succeeds in making you think while you play".|$|E

500|$|Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{believed}} that {{some elements of}} the film were deliberate self-references to Michael Bay's own sense of under-appreciation after the backlash to the second film: [...] "After {{a few hours of}} seeing Shia get dissed, overlooked and mistreated, the message becomes clear: Shia, as always, is a stand-in for Michael Bay. And Bay is showing us just {{what it felt like to}} deal with the ocean of Haterade—the snarking, the Razzie Award, the mean reviews—that Revenge of the Fallen unleashed." [...] She went on to say that the film's frequent, often jarring shifts in tone were an intentional endorsement of Michael Bay's own filmmaking style. [...] "Tone is for single-purpose machines. Consistency is for Decepticons. Michael Bay's ideal movie shifts from action movie to teen comedy to political drama with the same well-lubricated ease that his cars become men. By the time you've finished <b>watching,</b> <b>you</b> will speak Michael Bay's cinematic language." ...|$|E

[...] His stage was not to be merely [...] "a masquerade"; he continued: [...] "No, brothers. If I have arrived at having a stage, I want it to be a school for you. In youth you didn't have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, <b>watching</b> <b>you,</b> feel my heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you, too, shall cry – while my heart shall be glad." [...] Nonetheless, his [...] "war with the public" [...] was based on understanding that public. He would also write, [...] "I wrote Di kishefmakhern (The Witch) in Romania, where the populace – Jews as much as Romanians – believe strongly in witches." [...] Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.|$|E

500|$|... "4 in the Morning" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani and Kanal, who was also {{responsible}} for its production, while Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent provided additional production. Described as a 1980s-inspired midtempo synthpop ballad, the track's instrumentation includes a [...] "light" [...] keyboard, which [...] "runs tie the song together from intro through break", a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] has a midtempo beat, which according to some critics is [...] "perfect for a slow dance". Stefani's vocals throughout the song's chorus presents a [...] "fast-talking" [...] approach. Lyrically, [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] talks about transparency in a romantic relationship, with the protagonist pleading for a lover to make up his mind. Bill Lamb of About.com added that the song also deals with a relationship on the edge, which {{can be seen in}} the lines: [...] "I'm lying here in the dark, I'm <b>watching</b> <b>you</b> sleep, it hurts a lot."

500|$|The album {{opens with}} Bono and The Edge's {{acoustic}} [...] "Original of the Species" [...] (2004). Turlington {{said of the}} track, [...] "Bono wrote the song with his daughters in mind. It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm <b>watching</b> <b>you</b> take your steps forward and I'm supporting your independence, {{but at the same}} time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' Any parent can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice {{at the start of the}} track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start. He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that their dad contributed to such a meaningful project.|$|E
