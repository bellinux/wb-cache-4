But Gebser {{says that it is}} a task that we cannot choose to ignore without losing ourselves. This means that our so-called [...] "objective thinking" [...] is not without consequences, is not innocent. That to live [...] "objectively" [...] means to give life to the horrors of nihilism combined with the know how of highly [...] "efficient" [...] weapons. It means that [...] "objectivity" [...] gets applied to [...] "engineering humanity" [...] whether it is in the behavioral sciences or the physical sciences. He asks of us whether or not we have had our fill of those horrors yet. Are <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> settle into the comfort of our daily life or to take on the process of change? He offers as a guiding note that just as there is also a time to act, there is also the much neglected time of contemplation. In a world where know-how is overvalued, simple knowing must also be nurtured. Furthermore, he knew that thought was never simply a mental exercise restricted to one's writing. He calls upon us to realize that we are what we think.|$|E

[...] He further wrote that, the video [...] "similarly gazes inwards towards the nation" [...] that results in a visual experience {{that could be seen}} in the visual for Billy Joels 1989 single, [...] "We Didnt Start the Fire". Times Nolan Feeney thought that some of the presented historical moments [...] "challenges readings of the song as a pure ode to the land of opportunity". Quartzs Flanagin disagreed with the critics who thought the video and the song were contradictory. According to him, [...] "The message is clear: the life of the American immigrant is full of contradictions. To embark for the United States, illegally or with visa in hand, as a strawberry-picker or a pop-star, is an endeavor fueled by hope. But new arrivals often face intense social push back." [...] Adam Fleischer of MTV News noted that [...] "those clips span decades, relate to numerous situations and evoke an array of emotions", and eventually agreed with Feeney. Michelle Geslani of Consequence of Sound wrote, [...] "Its a gripping visual that seems to pose the question: How far are <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> go to protect this so-called Land of Opportunity?"The video has since been nominated for the Best Video With A Social Message at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
5000|$|In his mostly {{negative}} {{review for}} New York magazine's books section, Sam Anderson struck {{a note of}} disappointment, puzzlement, and confusion. In Anderson's opinion, Point Omega is [...] "latest of a recent stretch of post-Underworld metaphysical anti-thrillers—The Body Artist, Cosmopolis, Falling Man—DeLillo's writing has reached {{a whole new level}} of narrative inertia". For Anderson, the novel's [...] "glacial aesthetic" [...] and seemingly slow moving non-plot of the novel is a major fault: [...] "the closest the book comes to real action is when Elster's daughter shows up—although “shows up” is a strong phrase to use for a character who hardly seems to exist at all. When she disappears, mysteriously — the only major event of the novel — it seems like a formality." [...] The experience of reading a [...] "late-phase DeLillo" [...] novel, according to Anderson, makes him [...] "feel like a late-phase DeLillo character: distant, confused, catatonic, drifting into dream worlds, missing dentist appointments, forgetting the meanings of basic words, and staring at everyday objects as if they were holy relics." [...] However, Anderson admits that [...] "this disorientation might explain why I can’t quite make up my mind about Point Omega", suggesting some positives and elaborating that [...] "the strongest material in Point Omega is only tangentially related to the book’s main story, and is essentially just art criticism" [...] (referring to the bracketing chapters that begin and end the book). Anderson further remarks on the novel's style: [...] "DeLillo is, after Beckett and Robbe-Grillet, the indisputable master of grinding a plot to the brink of stasis and then recording its every last movement. Point Omega seems like a logical endpoint of that quest." [...] But Anderson goes on to ask with some concern, [...] "how much further into the desert of plotlessness is DeLillo willing to go, and how far are <b>we</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> follow? Where else can he possibly take the novel?" [...] Anderson finally concludes on a negative note: [...] "I get the sense that he wants his oeuvre to culminate in a pure act of attention, and I’m not convinced that the novel is the best medium in which to do that. As a raging DeLillo fan, I’d be more excited to see him branch out to another genre—an experimental autobiography, or essayistic micro-observations of his favorite art and literature—than write another short novel about detached and largely interchangeable characters." ...|$|E
