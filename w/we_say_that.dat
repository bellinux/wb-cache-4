The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E

50|$|Many medieval {{philosophers}} {{made use}} {{of the idea of}} approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes. For example, <b>we</b> should not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God exists in the usual sense of the term, all <b>we</b> can safely <b>say</b> is <b>that</b> God is not nonexistent. <b>We</b> should not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God is wise, but <b>we</b> can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God is not ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). <b>We</b> should not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God is One, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being.|$|R

5000|$|Wishing (boulēsis) is not deliberation. <b>We</b> cannot <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{what people}} wish for is good by definition, and {{although}} <b>we</b> could <b>say</b> <b>that</b> what is wished for is always what appears good, this {{will still be}} very variable. Most importantly <b>we</b> could <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a worthy (spoudaios) man will wish for what is [...] "truly" [...] good. Most people are misled by pleasure, [...] "for it seems to them to be a good, though it is not".|$|R
50|$|An apple {{sitting on}} a table is in a {{relation}} to the table it sits on. So <b>we</b> can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there is a relation between the apple and the table: namely, the relation of sitting-on. So, some <b>say,</b> <b>we</b> can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> that relation has being. For another example, the Washington Monument is taller than the White House. Being-taller-than is a relation between the two structures. <b>We</b> can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> that relation has being as well.

25|$|Even in curved space, Minkowski {{space is}} still a good {{description}} in an infinitesimal region surrounding any point (barring gravitational singularities). More abstractly, <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{in the presence of}} gravity spacetime is described by a curved 4-dimensional manifold for which the tangent space to any point is a 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Thus, the structure of Minkowski space is still essential in the description of general relativity.|$|E
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> no one {{may help}} the mother obtain an abortion, {{we fail to}} {{acknowledge}} the mother’s right over her body (or property). Thomson says {{that we are not}} personally obligated to help the mother but this does not {{rule out the possibility that}} someone else may act. As Thomson reminds, the house belongs to the mother; similarly, the body which holds a fetus also belongs to the mother.|$|E
25|$|Charge is the {{fundamental}} property of forms of matter that exhibit electrostatic attraction or repulsion {{in the presence of}} other matter. Electric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge e; <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> electric charge is quantized. Michael Faraday, in his electrolysis experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge. Robert Millikan's oil drop experiment demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge.|$|E

25|$|An optimal {{solution}} need not exist, for two reasons. First, if two constraints are inconsistent, then no feasible solution exists: For instance, the constraints x≥2 and x≤1 cannot be satisfied jointly; in this case, <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the LP is infeasible. Second, when the polytope is unbounded {{in the direction}} of the gradient of the objective function (where the gradient of the objective function is the vector of the coefficients of the objective function), then no optimal value is attained.|$|E
25|$|In spacetime terms, {{the path}} of a {{satellite}} orbiting the Earth is not dictated by the distant influences of the Earth, Moon and Sun. Instead, the satellite moves through space only in response to local conditions. Since spacetime is everywhere locally flat when considered on a sufficiently small scale, the satellite is always following a straight line in its local inertial frame. <b>We</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the satellite always follows along {{the path of}} a geodesic. No evidence of gravitation can be discovered following alongside the motions of a single particle.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the same}} as the {{definition}} of the derivative for real functions, except that all of the quantities are complex. In particular, the limit is taken as the complex number z approaches z0, and must have the same value for any sequence of complex values for z that approach z0 on the complex plane. If the limit exists, <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> f is complex-differentiable at the point z0. This concept of complex differentiability shares several properties with real differentiability: it is linear and obeys the product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.|$|E

25|$|One change we did {{not need}} to make as part of this {{interchange}} was to complement. <b>We</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> complement is a self-dual operation. The identity or do-nothing operation x (copy the input to the output) is also self-dual. A more complicated example of a self-dual operation is (x∧y) ∨ (y∧z) ∨ (z∧x). There is no self-dual binary operation that depends on both its arguments. A composition of self-dual operations is a self-dual operation. For example, if f(x, y, z) = (x∧y) ∨ (y∧z) ∨ (z∧x), then f(f(x, y, z), x, t) is a self-dual operation of four arguments x,y,z,t.|$|E
25|$|Many {{complexity}} {{classes are}} defined using {{the concept of}} a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y, X is no more difficult than Y, and <b>we</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> X reduces to Y. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.|$|E
25|$|Again {{there are}} {{technical}} {{issues relating to}} spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, {{the solution to the}} problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function θ(x). <b>We</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum pnbsp&=nbsp&h/λ, which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of V and A.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.|$|E
