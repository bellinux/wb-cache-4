6000|$|And he {{sat for a}} {{long time}} that evening under a large lime-tree on a knoll above the Serpentine. There was very little breeze, just enough to keep alive a kind of whispering. What if men and women, when they had lived their gusty lives, became trees! <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> who had burned and ached were now {{spreading}} over him this leafy peace--this blue-black shadow against the stars? Or were the stars, perhaps, the souls of men and women escaped for ever from love and longing? He broke off a branch of the lime and drew it across his face. It was not yet in flower, but it smelled lemony and fresh even here in London. If only for a moment he could desert his own heart, and rest with the trees and stars! ...|$|E

50|$|According to his followers, Sangjenim {{differed}} from other prophets {{in that he}} not only spoke about the future but, through his spiritual work, actually transformed it. One way of understanding this is the Butterfly Effect in Edward Lorenz's Chaos Theory. According to that theory, a butterfly flapping its wings in America could cause or prevent a tornado in Indonesia. This of course illustrates the improbability of predicting any event in a highly complex system due {{to the difficulty of}} knowing all variables. But, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> were enlightened to the point of omnipotence? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> did know all the variables? Such a person could not only predict the future, but with the rippling effect of seemingly small actions could actually change the future.|$|E

[...] "And for some reason, we just forgot about it and never really played it. I don’t know why. Michael just happened to luckily enough have it on tape. He says, ‘I’ve got this great stuff for that song and none of us even remember playing it. So we cut it here in Seattle when we did the record. I think it’s probably the most R.E.M.-ish sounding thing on the record. Literally, Michael was watching one of those talk shows and I think the subject was ‘People judge me by the way I look’ or something. Whereas I, when I have the misfortune to look for two minutes at one of those Oprah, Geraldo things, I just get revolted at everyone concerned: the audience, me. Michael actually looked at it and felt like, ‘Gosh, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone’s</b> actually trying to communicate something to these people and this person who’s in this awful, tacky, degrading situation?’ So it’s written from that perspective. And I think probably having done press conferences in the past and being in those kinds of situations, there might be a little empathy from experience that we’ve had.” ...|$|R

The tenth season finale had a [...] "different" [...] approach, which executive producer Gary Glasberg explained to be because [...] "we did multiple episodes {{that could have been}} season-enders this season — the car crash, killing Ziva’s dad, the revenge factor of killing Bodnar. It was one thing after another and because of that, I wanted to do something different for the actual season finale." [...] About the storyline in the episode, Glasberg said [...] "One of the things we really started to think about was, 10 seasons into a show — 234 episodes — were so many cases, so many opportunities and ways that Gibbs handled things but maybe crossed some lines in the way that he handled them. And someone had to have noticed that somewhere along the way. There are people who are paying attention and <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> — an investigator who was out for his own reasons — decided that this was the opportunity and the moment to go after them and basically say, ‘You can’t keep doing this.’ Ziva going after Bodnar was just sort of the straw that broke the camel’s back." ...|$|E

That's essentially the dilemma faced by advocates of test-driven development (TDD). The TDD paradigm argues that the basic cycle of developing code and then testing it to make sure it does what it's supposed to do-something drilled into most of us from the time we began learning software development- isn't the most effective approach. TDD replaces the traditional "code then test" cycle. First, you develop test cases for a small increment of functionality; then you write code that makes those tests run correctly. After each increment, you refactor the code to maintain code quality...|$|E
