5|$|At these speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E

One author has suggested that the spike was attached to a venom gland, but this has not been accepted, as the spike was not hollow, nor were there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom.|$|E
5|$|A 1754 {{enactment}} introduced up to {{one year}} imprisponment for carrying of daggers and pocket pistols ("tercerols") as well as tough sentencing for cases of attacking or resisting law enforcement with use of these weapons.

The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of post-independence Latin America, dictatorships have been {{relatively}} commonexamples range from Paraguay's José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in the 19th century to Chile's Augusto Pinochet in the 20th. In this context, Latin American literature has been distinguished by the protest novel, or dictator novel; the main story is based around the dictator figure, his behaviour, characteristics and {{the situation of the}} people under his regime. Writers such as Sarmiento used the power of the written word in order to criticize government, using literature as a tool, an instance of resistance and as a <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> repression.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E

The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy. This was the most militarily active era of the Roman Republic.|$|E

5|$|Torpedo {{capability}} {{was always}} considered paramount. The lack of suitable aircraft and shortage {{of the weapon}} itself resulted in the strike arm of Coastal Command being severely handicapped. As late as 10 December 1941 the torpedo resources {{were given to the}} Fleet Air Arm (FAA) which would receive 75 percent of all torpedoes. Torpedoes were sensitive and highly costly in production terms. The weather conditions off enemy coasts made their use more complicated and the depth of the water was considered too shallow. It was also uneconomical to use the <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> low-tonnage shipping, Coastal Command's main target. Aside from that, the Beaufort torpedo-bomber was being posted overseas from August 1941 onwards.|$|E
5|$|A {{culture of}} {{violence}} {{rooted in the}} deep conflicts that split the countryside during the revolution would repeatedly erupt throughout the whole {{second half of the}} 20th century. The term 'social revolution' has been applied to a range of mostly violent activities of the left that included both altruistic attempts to organise real revolution and simple expressions of revenge, resentment and assertions of power. Violence was one of the many lessons learned during the Japanese occupation, and figures identified as 'feudal', including kings, regents, or simply the wealthy, were often attacked and sometimes beheaded. Rape became a <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> 'feudal' women. In the coastal sultanates of Sumatra and Kalimantan, for example, sultans and others whose authority had been shored-up by the Dutch, were attacked as soon as Japanese authority left. The secular local lords of Aceh, who had been the foundation of Dutch rule, were executed, although most of Indonesia's sultanates fell back into Dutch hands.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E

5|$|In RAF service, the Harrier {{was used}} in close air support (CAS), reconnaissance, and other ground-attack roles. The {{flexibility}} of the Harrier led to a long-term heavy deployment in West Germany as a conventional deterrent and potential strike <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> Soviet aggression; from camouflaged rough bases the Harrier was expected to launch attacks on advancing armour columns from East Germany. Harriers were also deployed to bases in Norway and Belize, a former British colony. No. 1 Squadron was specifically earmarked for Norwegian operations {{in the event of}} war, operating as part of Allied Forces Northern Europe. The Harrier's capabilities were necessary in the Belize deployment, as it was the only RAF combat aircraft capable of safely operating from the airport's short runway; British forces had been stationed in Belize for several years due to tensions over a Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory; the forces were withdrawn in 1993, two years after Guatemala recognized the independence of Belize.|$|E
5|$|In September 1915, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) {{was formed}} to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a {{proposal}} was made to the War Office {{for the formation of}} a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigade—a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions. Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun batteries. In the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating defensive <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> attacking infantry. They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired over the heads and from the flanks of the advancing infantry and behind the German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to the front.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{eccentric}} member of staff is Alan Statham (Mark Heap), an overbearing, stuttering and pedantic consultant radiologist, whose everyday actions regularly border on insanity.

Their relationship is an open secret, with student doctor Boyce (Oliver Chris), often {{using it as a}} <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> them, bullying Alan constantly. Joanna's human resources staff also use it against her, in particular Kim Alabaster (Sally Bretton), who has a bad attitude towards most of the people she meets, and Naughty Rachel (Katie Lyons), who earned her nickname due to her love of sex. The other HR staff include Harriet Schulenburg (Olivia Colman), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage, and Karen Ball (Lucinda Raikes), who divides her time between doing much of the office's work, trying to attract Martin's affections, and being bullied by Kim and Rachel.|$|E

5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own Eye is a potent <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> Ra, and Ra's Eye {{is one of the}} few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the Eye of Ra from its master during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the Eye of Ra is another point of overlap with the Eye of Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil {{could be used as}} both a political and economic <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> other nations, {{at least in the short}} term.|$|E
5|$|By spring 1944, the Me 262 was {{sufficiently}} ready for operational service. By this time, Galland faced rivalries amongst the Luftwaffe command over {{how best to}} employ the aircraft. Dietrich Peltz, commander of the IX. Fliegerkorps (9th Air Corps), {{wanted to use the}} aircraft as a <b>weapon</b> <b>against</b> a future Allied landing in France. Peltz saw the aircraft as an ideal fast bomber which could evade the overwhelming numbers of Allied piston-engine fighters and attack the landing grounds. Peltz also wished to use highly trained bomber pilots who he felt could better serve as home defence fighter pilots in place of the overextended and overworked Jagdwaffe. Their blind-weather experience and training, and background in multi-engine aircraft made them ideal for these operations in his view. In the first five months of 1944, Peltz' conventional bomber force had suffered a significant defeat over England in Operation Steinbock but it did not dull his appetite for offensive action or dent his reputation with Göring. Galland argued against his suggestion. Instead, Galland thought the bomber corps should be disbanded and its pilots converted onto fighters. Göring adopted Peltz' idea to impress Hitler and regain his waning influence.|$|E
