500|$|Cinematographer Gabriel Beristain, {{returning}} from the One-Shot, used a combination of modern digital technology and traditional analog techniques to replicate the feel of classic films that are set in the 1940s, but to also have the convenience and consistency of modern technology. Beristain uses the Arri Alexa digital camera, along with Leica Lenses and silk-stocking diffusion nets, the latter on which he recalled [...] "I had last used in the 1980s in England on videos and commercials. I remembered that they were fantastic. In combination with the Leica lenses, the look is very classic, {{very much like a}} 1940s film. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> I said, 'This is absolutely Marvel,' and [...] agreed." [...] For the series' lighting, Beristain again mixed modern and traditional, using LED fixtures to recreate classic Hollywood lighting. He called his lighting of Atwell [...] "an homage to the great cinematographers who lit Lauren Bacall and Grace Kelly." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} {{structured}} as a cinematic peep show and voyeurism that portrays Madonna as a stripper. According to Mondino, the peep show {{was his idea}} since at that time, [...] "we were into a period where we were experimenting [...] some kind of freedom about the body, about sexuality and stuff". He {{wanted to have a}} [...] "naive and sweet" [...] feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna. They built the set from scratch, including the frontal part with the ticket booth. Although it looked fake, Mondino liked it saying [...] "I like the fakeness of it. I haven't seen it for a long time, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> once again, I said, 'It's so na√Øve'. It's kind of badly done, which I like, compared to today. We didn't have the same equipment, people are more skillful today, but there's something sweet about it." [...] Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig, and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive. But Madonna wanted Mondino's opinion on the whole ensemble, who replied that she would look better as a blonde. So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only.|$|E
500|$|The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought {{critical}} praise: [...] "Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical {{beauty and}} sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open." [...] When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after {{a long period of}} theatrical neglect, Tempos critic Robert Stein responded to ENO's 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that [...] "Adams's triumph... consists really in taking a plot chock-full of talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation... making a satisfying and engaging piece." [...] Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of The Guardian wrote that [...] "from its early visual coup {{with the arrival of the}} plane, Sellars' production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form". In Jeal's view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that [...] "Nixon in China is a great American Opera. I suspected that it was a significant work <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in 1987; I was ever more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today I am certain that it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, actor Kevin Kennedy {{who played}} Curly Watts in soap opera Coronation Street, which was EastEnders biggest {{television}} rival, criticised {{the character of}} Lofty. Kennedy claimed that Lofty was a direct copy of his character Curly: [...] "As far as i'm concerned, Lofty was a straight lift. It really annoyed me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Lofty even had the same hairstyle and glasses as Curly, {{he had the same}} caring but dithering nature. It was a perfect copy." [...] Curly first appeared in Coronation Street in 1983, just under two years before Lofty first appeared in EastEnders in 1985.|$|E
2500|$|Special effects {{director}} Eiji Tsuburaya {{was planning}} on working on other projects {{at this point in}} time such as a new version of a [...] fairy tale film script called Kaguyahime (Princess Kaguya), but he postponed those to work on this project with Toho instead since he was such a huge fan of King Kong. He stated in an early 1960s interview with the Mainichi Newspaper, [...] "But my movie company has produced a very interesting script that combined King Kong and Godzilla, so I couldn't help working on this instead of my other fantasy films. The script is special to me; it makes me emotional because it was King Kong that got me interested in the world of special photographic techniques <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in 1933." ...|$|E

2500|$|In another Verhoeven film‚Äîthe erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)‚Äî {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I knew {{that we were going to}} do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E
