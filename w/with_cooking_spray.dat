50|$|As {{with all}} dogs, the Boykin Spaniels require daily {{exercise}} and regular grooming. Clipping the coat regularly is recommended {{especially if the}} dog is in the field, as the soft coat collects foxtails and briars. Spraying the dog <b>with</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> is also recommended to help defend against tangles in the long fur.|$|E
50|$|Cooking spray {{has other}} culinary uses besides being applied to cookware. Sticky candies such as Mike and Ike {{that are often}} sold in bulk vending {{machines}} may be sprayed <b>with</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> {{to keep them from}} sticking together in the machines. Coating the inside of a measuring cup with the spray allows sticky substances such as honey to pour out more easily. Vegetables may be sprayed before seasoning to make the seasonings stick better.|$|E
50|$|Muffin tins and muffin pans are {{typically}} metal bakeware which has round bowl-shaped depressions into which muffin batter is poured. Muffin tins or pans can be greased <b>with</b> butter or <b>cooking</b> <b>spray,</b> {{to lessen the}} issue of batter sticking to the pan. Alternatively, muffin cups or cases are used. Cups or cases are usually round sheets of paper, foil, or silicone with scallop-pressed edges, giving the muffin a round cup shape. They {{are used in the}} baking of muffins to line the bottoms of muffin tins, to facilitate the easy removal of the finished muffin from the tin. The advantage to cooks is easier removal and cleanup, more precise form, and moister muffins; however, using them will prevent a crust from forming.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, <b>cooking</b> <b>spray,</b> {{which is}} made from various types of oils {{combined}} with lecithin (an emulsifier), may use nitrous oxide as a propellant. Other propellants used in <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> include food-grade alcohol and propane.|$|R
50|$|Mike and Ikes and Hot Tamales, {{also a good}} seller, degrade in humid environments. Spraying a large plastic spoon with an unflavored, {{non-stick}} <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> {{and then}} stirring the candy around until it has a shiny look to it can prevent the pieces from sticking together. It {{is important not to}} use too much <b>cooking</b> <b>spray,</b> or the candy will seem greasy.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cooking</b> <b>spray</b> is a spray {{form of an}} oil as a lubricant, {{lecithin}} as an emulsifier, and a propellant such as food-grade alcohol, nitrous oxide, {{carbon dioxide}} or propane. <b>Cooking</b> <b>spray</b> is applied to frying pans and other cookware to prevent food from sticking. Traditionally, cooks used butter, shortening, or oils poured or rubbed on cookware. [...] Most <b>cooking</b> <b>sprays</b> have less food energy per serving than an application of vegetable oil, because they are applied in a much thinner layer: US regulations allow many to be labelled [...] "zero-calorie"; in the UK sprays claim to supply [...] "less than 1 calorie per serving". Popular US brands include Pam, Crisco, and Baker's Joy. Sprays are available with plain vegetable oil, butter and olive oil flavor.|$|R

25|$|The gas is {{approved}} {{for use as}} a food additive (also known as E942), specifically as an aerosol spray propellant. Its most common uses in this context are in aerosol whipped cream canisters, <b>cooking</b> <b>sprays,</b> and as an inert gas used to displace oxygen in order to inhibit bacterial growth when filling packages of potato chips and other similar snack foods.|$|R
50|$|Crisco is a {{brand of}} {{shortening}} produced by The J.M. Smucker Company popular in the United States. Introduced in June 1911 by Procter & Gamble, {{it was the first}} shortening to be made entirely of vegetable oil. Additional products marketed by Smucker under the Crisco brand include a <b>cooking</b> <b>spray,</b> various olive oils, and other cooking oils, including canola, corn, peanut, olive, sunflower, vegetable and blended oils.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, No Name diverged {{from its}} {{original}} plain packaging as red lettering and various product illustrations were added. Meanwhile, a 1987 segment of the CTV Television Network show Live It Up! took {{the position that the}} line’s product packaging wasn't doing enough to adequately distinguish relatively harmless <b>cooking</b> <b>sprays</b> from more dangerous cleaning products. During that same program, a Loblaw executive presented the company’s solution - a No Name spray canister with a red cap to indicate potentially harmful contents.|$|R
50|$|Pope married Chicago ad man Howard Charles Ballenger II in April 1949, and {{the pair}} moved to Chicago, where they raised two sons. She starred as a {{panelist}} {{on the television}} show Down You Go in the 1950s, did numerous radio spots, and was also the spokeswoman for Pam <b>Cooking</b> <b>Spray.</b> Following {{the death of her}} husband in 1986, Pope moved to Los Angeles, where she served {{as the director of the}} Hollywood office of the American Humane Association. She remarried in 1988 and retired to Stuart, Florida.|$|R
50|$|Cooking {{is done on}} a {{charcoal}} grill. The grates are greased with pork fat, bacon, oil, butter or <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> {{in order to prevent}} sticking. While the meat is gently cooked over light to medium heat, it is basted after every turn with the marinade or with beer, sprayed directly from a gently shaken bottle. This serves to improve the taste and prevents a drying of the meat on the cooking surface. Moreover, the cooking temperature is regulated by gently spraying beer directly on the charcoal; the rising steam helps to cook and flavour the meat.|$|R
50|$|International Home Foods was an American manufacturer, {{distributor}} and marketer of food products, {{acquired in}} June 2000 by ConAgra Foods in a $2.9 Billion dollar deal. Its best known brands were Chef Boyardee pasta products, PAM <b>cooking</b> <b>spray,</b> Bumble Bee Seafood, and Gulden's mustard. International Home Foods {{was formed in}} Nov. 1996 when American Home Products spun off its food business, which was acquired by Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and C. Dean Metropoulos & Co. The latter paid $1.2 Billion to acquire 80% of International Home Foods, and grew it to annual sales of about $2.2 billion before the ConAgra acquisition.|$|R
50|$|Wealthy {{adolescents}} {{were the first}} to use inhalants and being addicted to them, often using them to alleviate depression. In terms of addiction, inhalants are ordinary household products such as cleaners, <b>cooking</b> <b>sprays,</b> fabric protectors, paint thinner and adhesives and solvents. Because of the low cost of Rugby and other inhalants, poor people (especially inexperienced youths) use them to relieve hunger pains and common poverty health problems. “Rugby Boys” (also called “Solvent Boys”) and even girls do the sniffing in the streets. The chemical is placed in a plastic bag, and inhaled from the bag to achieve euphoria.|$|R
50|$|Generally a slow, hard drying epoxy {{is used as}} bedding for a rifle. The epoxy should dry {{very hard}} to {{withstand}} recoil and prevent flexing of the action. The epoxy should not shrink or expand after hardening. Several epoxies are designed for outdoor use {{where they need to}} expand and contract with changes in temperature. These epoxies are not suitable for rifle bedding. Some epoxies are supplied with coloring additives to allow the epoxy color to match the stock color. Most other epoxies are only available in one or two colors. Some epoxies will come with release agent, otherwise <b>cooking</b> <b>spray,</b> car wax or shoe polish can be used instead.|$|R
50|$|Lecithin {{can easily}} be {{extracted}} chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether, benzene, etc., or extraction can be done mechanically. It is usually available from sources such as soybeans, eggs, milk, marine sources, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in nonstick <b>cooking</b> <b>spray.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Meyerhoff also {{organized}} {{several companies}} outside his advertising agency {{to develop new}} products. One company he owned developed PAM, a substitute for fats or oils that can be sprayed on pots and pans. This food enabler {{was born in the}} mid-1950s, when Meyerhoff was looking for a side business. He advertised for ideas, and heard from two chemists who had developed something like a <b>cooking</b> <b>spray.</b> First, Meyerhoff had the formula perfected so it could be sprayed; then he campaigned for grocers to shelve PAM in the baking aisle with the flours, not the aerosol section next to insecticides and hair spray. The name PAM is an initialism for [...] "Product of Arthur Meyerhoff." ...|$|R
50|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{were once}} {{often used as}} propellants, but since the Montreal Protocol came into force in 1989, they have been {{replaced}} in nearly every country due to the negative effects CFCs have on Earth's ozone layer. The most common replacements are mixtures of volatile hydrocarbons, typically propane, n-butane and isobutane. Dimethyl ether (DME) and methyl ethyl ether are also used. All these have the disadvantage of being flammable. Nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are also used as propellants to deliver foodstuffs (for example, whipped cream and <b>cooking</b> <b>spray).</b> Medicinal aerosols such as asthma inhalers use hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA): either HFA 134a (1,1,1,2,-tetrafluoroethane) or HFA 227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) or combinations of the two. Manual pump sprays {{can be used as}} an alternative to a stored propellant.|$|R

50|$|The Brown Bobby machine resembled and {{operated}} {{similar to a}} waffle iron. Its surfaces were made of aluminium and were prepared for baking by coating with paraffin, though users today would most often use <b>cooking</b> <b>spray.</b> The machine had a high (600 watt/surfaces connected in parallel) and a low (300 watt/surfaces connected in series) setting. Cooking was done on the high setting, the low setting was for allowing the machine to remain idle. Machines were available as either a single (aka Brown Bobby Junior) for US$52 or as two machines riveted together into a single unit for US$100. Since these machines are no longer manufactured they are prized by their owners and often handed down to subsequent generations to continue a tradition of Brown Bobby making, especially during the holidays.|$|R

5000|$|Inhalants are gases, aerosols, or {{solvents}} {{that are}} breathed in and absorbed through the lungs. While some [...] "inhalant" [...] drugs {{are used for}} medical purposes, {{as in the case}} of nitrous oxide, a dental anesthetic, inhalants are used as recreational drugs for their intoxicating effect. Most inhalant drugs that are used non-medically are ingredients in household or industrial chemical products that are not intended to be concentrated and inhaled, including organic solvents (found in cleaning products, fast-drying glues, and nail polish removers), fuels (gasoline (petrol) and kerosene), and propellant gases such as Freon and compressed hydrofluorocarbons that are used in aerosol cans such as hairspray, whipped cream, and non-stick <b>cooking</b> <b>spray.</b> A small number of recreational inhalant drugs are pharmaceutical products that are used illicitly, such as anesthetics (ether and nitrous oxide) and volatile anti-angina drugs (alkyl nitrites).|$|R
