40|$|In {{this paper}} {{two sets of}} states, related with the Holevo {{capacity}} and <b>with</b> the <b>minimal</b> output entropy of a quantum channel, are considered. It is shown that these sets have special hereditary property {{in the case of}} tensor product channel. This property implies interesting conclusions about the structure of these sets and, hence, about the optimal ensembles and the states <b>with</b> the <b>minimal</b> output entropy. In particular, it is shown that among states <b>with</b> the <b>minimal</b> output entropy there exist states, whose partial traces are multiple of projectors. In the case of two qubit channels this implies that nonadditivity of the minimal output entropy is equivalent to the assertion that all states <b>with</b> the <b>minimal</b> output entropy for tensor product channel are maximally entangled. By using this observation the sufficient conditions for additivity of the minimal output entropy is obtained and applied to a particular pairs of channels...|$|R

40|$|Version 0. 0 Abstract. Continuing {{the study}} of divisibility theory of arithmetical rings started in [1] and [2] we show that the divisibility theory of arithmetical rings <b>with</b> one <b>minimal</b> prime ideal is axiomatizable as Bezout monoids <b>with</b> one <b>minimal</b> m-prime filter. In particular, every Bezout monoid <b>with</b> one <b>minimal</b> m-prime filter is order-isomorphic to the {{partially}} ordered monoid with respect to inverse inclusion, of principal ideals in a Bezout ring with a smallest prime ideal. Although this result {{can be considered as}} a satisfactory answer to the divisibility theory of both semi-hereditary domains and valuation rings, the general representation theory of Bezout monoids is still open. 1...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September22. The wave traveled westward <b>with</b> <b>minimal</b> tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving {{in the same direction as}} the upper-level winds.|$|E

Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically followed closely by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home <b>with</b> <b>minimal</b> monitoring.|$|E

5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted <b>with</b> <b>minimal</b> vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E

Unlike the US, which had a vibrant FM radio scene, in 1976 Australia only had ABC FM and a few community FM stations which primarily played classical music. Commercial AM stations, playing pop and rock music, dominated the local airwaves. The group established their reputation with live performances, exposure in print media, and word of mouth, <b>with</b> <b>minimal</b> Australian radio promotion.|$|E
