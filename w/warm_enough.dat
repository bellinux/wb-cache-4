5|$|In {{the tropics}} {{there is little}} {{variation}} in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds. There is evidence that this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{temperatures}} around Arran in Summer average around 14°C and is <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> {{for swimming}} mainly with protective gear (weather permitted), winter sea temperatures are around 7°C/8°C reaching its low in early Spring due to water retaining heat {{for longer than}} air.|$|E
5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E

5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E
5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> to remain ice-free even in winter.|$|E
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E

50|$|Big brown bats {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter months, often in different locations from their summer roosts. Winter roosts tend to be natural subterranean locations such as caves and underground mines where temperatures remain stable; where {{a large majority of}} these bats spend the winter is still unknown. If the weather <b>warms</b> <b>enough,</b> they may awaken to seek water, and even breed.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{widespread}} {{outbreaks of}} mountain pine beetle {{in the western}} U.S. and Canada. [...] Since 2000, the climate at high elevations has <b>warmed</b> <b>enough</b> for the beetles to reproduce within whitebark pine, often completing their life cycle within one year and enabling their populations to grow exponentially. Entire forest vistas, like that at Avalanche Ridge near Yellowstone National Park’s east gate, are expanses of dead gray whitebarks. Scientists have attributed this recent warming trend to man-made global warming.|$|R
5|$|The first {{advisory}} {{from the}} NHC was issued at 11:00AST on October4; at this time, {{the system was}} officially named Grace, the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm featured relatively deep convection around an eye-like feature. Although Grace was over waters normally not <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> for tropical cyclone development, low wind shear allowed the convection to persist. A steady northeastward track {{was taken by the}} storm in response to a southerly flow over the northwestern Atlantic. The storm intensified slightly as it moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures, with winds estimated at 65mph (100km/h) early on October5; operationally it was held at 70mph (110km/h), but was downgraded due to uncertainties in the storm's intensity as it was progressing over cold waters.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine regions that are <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E
5|$|Otis began {{gradually}} entering cooler ocean waters, {{although the}} National Hurricane Center noted {{in one of}} its discussions on the system that the environment was still <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> to support a stronger storm. The hurricane continued drifting northwestward, and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status. At the time, maximum sustained winds were at 105mph (165km/h) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Hours later, however, it began to weaken, a trend that continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air. The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2, and the center of circulation was separated from the convective activity. Otis weakened to a tropical storm and drifted erratically toward the north-northwest as a result of weak steering currents. Over increasingly cold waters, the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low-level clouds. It became a remnant low pressure area the next day. The system abruptly turned southeastward and drifted parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5.|$|E
50|$|As the {{temperature}} continues to drop, {{the water on}} the surface may get cold enough to freeze and the lake/ocean begins to ice over. A new thermocline develops where the densest water (4 °C) sinks to the bottom, and the less dense water (water that is approaching the freezing point) rises to the top. Once this new stratification establishes itself, it lasts until the water <b>warms</b> <b>enough</b> for the 'spring turnover,' which occurs after the ice melts and the surface water temperature rises to 4 °C. During this transition, a thermal bar may develop.|$|R
40|$|Two lots of pigs were self-fed, free choice, whole sorghum {{grain and}} a mixed protein supplement. Each lot {{contained}} 10 pigs. In one lot, the whole sorghum grain was fed dry, in the other, it was automatically fed into water <b>warmed</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent freezing. The protein supplement fed both lots consisted of 4 parts tankage, 4 parts soybean meal, 1 part cottonseed meal, and 1 part alfalfa meal. To each ton of supplement was added 27 pounds of antibiotic Aurofac (Aureomycin) and one half pound of zinc oxide...|$|R
50|$|Although Chinese road {{builders}} {{remained in}} Laos {{through the end}} of the Laotian Civil War, Routes 45 and 19 were never quite linked, so the North Vietnamese could not transit Laos to its far northwest. The new Chinese routes were not extended to Luang Prabang. After the war's end, the Lao People's Democratic Republic invited a Chinese extension of their road construction to the former royal capital. The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia soured the deal in 1979, with the Chinese road builders invited to leave Laos. Post 1990, the political climate had <b>warmed</b> <b>enough</b> for the Lao to invite roadwork bids from Chinese firms in Yunnan.|$|R
5|$|Researchers {{believe that}} much of the low {{northern}} plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial. In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the Curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> in the past to support bodies of liquid water.|$|E
5|$|To get to Ottawa, several {{thousand}} miles away, the club {{had to get}} to Whitehorse by overland sleigh, catch a train from there to Skagway, Alaska, then catch a steamer to Vancouver, B.C. and a train from there to Ottawa. On December 18, 1904, several players set out by dog sled and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a 330-mile trek to Whitehorse. At first the team made good progress, but the weather turned <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> to thaw the roads, forcing the players to walk several hundred miles. The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road. At Whitehorse, the weather turned bad, causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their steamer in Skagway. The next one could not dock for three days due to the ice buildup. The club found the sea journey treacherous, and it caused seasickness amongst the team. When the steamer reached Vancouver, the area was too fogged in to dock, and the steamer docked in Seattle. The team from there caught a train to Vancouver, from which it left on January 6, 1905, arriving in Ottawa on January 11.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance developed in late November, and two disturbances {{formed in the}} first few weeks of January. In the duration between when Iletta developed on January23 and when Tropical Cyclone Josie formed on February9, another two {{tropical disturbance}}s formed, and the final two developed after Lisette originated in late February. The first, Tropical Disturbance M1, formed on May11 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and later crossed into the Australian region to intensify into Tropical Cyclone Rhonda. The final disturbance of the season originated from a persistent area of convection near the equator on July19, northeast of Diego Garcia. With <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> water temperatures, the system developed further, becoming Tropical Depression M2 on July20, the first July depression since 1971. That day, the JTWC classified the storm as Tropical Cyclone 01S. As the JTWC considers the tropical cyclone year to begin on July1, and the MFR considered it beginning on August1 at the time, the storm was in different cyclone years in different agencies. Estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested that the system approached tropical storm status on July21 after a central dense overcast formed, although the MFR only estimated peak 10minute winds of 55km/h (35mph). Moving southwestward and later to the west, the depression began weakening due to wind shear on July23, and dissipated two days later. At the time, July was within the annual tropical cyclone year, although a change in policy shifted the end of the tropical cyclone year to June30, beginning in 2002.|$|E

These plants do not thrive as well {{in other parts of}} the state. The eastern prickly pear grows well in many portions of the state.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific oyster prospered in Pendrell Sound, {{where the}} surface water is {{typically}} <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> for spawning in the summer. Over the following years, spat spread out sporadically and populated adjacent areas. Eventually, possibly following {{adaptation to the}} local conditions, the Pacific oyster spread {{up and down the}} coast and now is the basis of the North American west coast oyster industry. Pendrell Sound is now a reserve that supplies spat for cultivation.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} {{of life in}} the form of microorganisms such as methanogens is among possible, but as yet unproven sources. Methanogens do not require oxygen or organic nutrients, are non-photosynthetic, use hydrogen as their energy source and carbon dioxide (CO2) as their carbon source, so they could exist in subsurface environments on Mars. If microscopic Martian life is producing the methane, it probably resides far below the surface, where it is still <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> for liquid water to exist.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{completion}} of malolactic fermentation means [...] the winemaker {{can make a}} postfermentation SO2 earlier to protect the wine from oxidation and spoilage microbes (such as Acetobacter).

50|$|In {{electron}} microscopy (EM), samples are imaged in an ultra-high vacuum. Such a vacuum {{is incompatible with}} biological samples such as cells; the water would boil off, and the difference in pressure would explode the cell. In room-temperature EM techniques, samples are therefore prepared by fixation and dehydration. Another approach to stabilize biological samples, however, is to freeze them (cryo-{{electron microscopy}}). As in other cryo-electron microscopy techniques, samples for ECT (typically small cells (e.g. Bacteria or Archaea) or viruses) are prepared in standard aqueous media and applied to an EM grid. The grid is then plunged into a cryogen (typically ethane) so efficient that water molecules do {{not have time to}} rearrange into a crystalline lattice. The resulting water state is called “vitreous ice” and preserves native cellular structures, such as lipid membranes, that would normally be destroyed by freezing. Plunge-frozen samples are subsequently stored and imaged at liquid-nitrogen temperatures so that the water never <b>warms</b> <b>enough</b> to crystallize.|$|R
50|$|Ticks {{are very}} hardy creatures and I. scapularis is no exception. They will be active {{even after a}} {{moderate}} to severe frost, as daytime temperatures can <b>warm</b> them <b>enough</b> to keep them actively searching for a host. In the spring, they {{can be one of}} the first invertebrates to become active. Deer ticks can be quite numerous and seemingly gregarious in areas where they are found.|$|R
25|$|Smog {{can form}} {{in almost any}} climate where {{industries}} or cities release large amounts of air pollution, such as smoke or gases. However, it is worse during periods of warmer, sunnier weather when the upper air is <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> to inhibit vertical circulation. It is especially prevalent in geologic basins encircled by hills or mountains. It often stays {{for an extended period}} of time over densely populated cities or urban areas, and can build up to dangerous levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogen}} rust fungus or Puccinia lagenophorae and the Cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae {{have both}} been used and studied {{in an attempt to}} control infestation of Senecio vulgaris. One study showed that rust fungus infected Senecio vulgaris survived and actually used more of the available soil nutrients. The cinnabar moth eats groundsel between June and August, but the seeds germinate and the plant grows as soon as the ground is <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> (and after a warm rain), making this an insufficient control almost everywhere groundsel can be found.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies have}} {{suggested}} the potential for life to survive using deliquescing salts. These, similarly to the lichens, use the humidity of the atmosphere. If the mixture of salts is right, they may support liquid water at times of high atmospheric humidity, with salts dilute enough {{to be capable of}} supporting life. This water would be <b>warm</b> <b>enough</b> (warmer than about -25°C) but cold enough so that it doesn't immediately evaporate in the thin Martian atmosphere. The salts and perchlorates required are known to exist on Mars, though whether they occur in the correct mixtures to support these marginally habitable deliquescing droplets and thin layers of salty brines is unknown.|$|E
