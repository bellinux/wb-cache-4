5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. <b>Water</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to <b>water</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E

40|$|The {{rheology}} and hydro-mechanical interactions at the iceâ€“bed interface form {{an important}} component of the glacier system, influencing glacier dynamics and the formation of till. We demonstrate that the sand-rich till at Briksdalsbreen in Norway, undergoes deformation throughout the year. On the bulk rheology scale, till deformation exhibits elastic behaviour during the winter, when <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> are low; and linear viscous behaviour after a critical yield stress of 35 kPa, when <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> are high during the spring and summer. On the clast and matrix scale, low <b>water</b> <b>pressures,</b> correspond with high case stress variability and till temperatures. Meltwater driven, stick-slip, glacier velocity increases were transmitted through a relatively strong till grain network, causing brittle deformation. Intermediate <b>water</b> <b>pressures,</b> during late summer were linked to intermediate case stress variability and high till temperatures associated with the heat generated from stick-slip motion. High <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> in the till were associated with low case stress variability and low, meltwater controlled, till temperatures, and occurred in the spring and autumn. Once the till was saturated, the ductile till absorbed any stick-slip velocity increases. We discuss, with examples, the different till forming processes associated with these changing conditions, demonstrating that the resultant till will represent a complex amalgamation of all of these processes. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of a deep}} excavation {{is especially}} influenced by the strength and deformability of the soil located {{in front of the}} retaining walls, below the bottom of the excavation. In fine-grained, low-permeability soils, it is usually assumed that the excavation is carried out in undrained conditions, resulting in a significant decrease of the pore <b>water</b> <b>pressures.</b> This effect is beneficial, because the effective stresses are kept nearly at their initial values, but has a transient nature: depending on the problem layout, on the soil permeability and on the rapidity of the construction process, the negative excess pore pressure may dissipate in a time span comparable to that needed to complete the construction. For design purposes, it is essential to consider reasonable values of the pore <b>water</b> <b>pressures,</b> to ensure a satisfactory performance of the construction avoiding at the same time excessive conservatism. This paper illustrates the results of a parametric study, in which finite-element analyses were carried out to evaluate the excess pore <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> induced by excava-tions and to asses the effects of their variation with time. The mechanical behaviour of the clayey soils was described using a constitutive model based on hardening plasticity, that is reasonably accurate in simulating the generation of excess pore <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> in undrained conditions. The results of this study are used to provide practical indications about the values of excess pore <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> to be considered for design...|$|R

5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor.

By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E

While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E

The evolution during shaking of lateral displacements, plastic strains and pore <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> sheds some light on the complex interplay of several simultaneously occurring phenomena: the development of oscillatory inertia forces on the wall, in phase or out of phase with the backfill soil and water pressures; the simple-shear seismic deformation of the soil and the ensuing initial development of positive excess pore <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> in the backfill and the foundation soil; the extensional deformation developing in the 'active wedge' behind the wall, with the ensuing generation of negative excess pore water pressures; and the continuous dissipation and redistribution of <b>water</b> <b>pressures.</b> The conventional generalised Mononobe - Okabe theory is also reviewed, and extensive comparisons are made with the numerically computed effective and <b>water</b> <b>pressures</b> against the wall.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> of surrounding environment on fracture toughness of rock is clarified, {{based on the}} results of a series of semi-circular bend (SCB) test under various <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressures.</b> The rocks used in the test are Kumamoto andesite and Kunnum basalt, and the range of <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> is from 10 - 3 to 103 Pa. The results obtained in this paper are summarized as follows: 1) Elastic modulus at 60 % of maximum load depends on <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressure,</b> and decreases with increasing <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressure.</b> 2) Fracture toughness depends on <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressure,</b> and decreases with increasing <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressure.</b> The tendency of {{influence of}} <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> on fracture toughness is the same as that on uniaxial compressive strength or tensile strength. The relation between fracture toughness and <b>water</b> vapor <b>pressure</b> can be represented as: KIC=Î²p-m where Î² is a constant and -m is the slope of the approximated line on the logarithmic graph. The value m is 0. 013 for Kumamoto andesite and 0. 012 for Kunnum basalt, respectively. 3) Based on above results for the SCB test, models for load-displacement curve and for relation between crack velocity and stress intensity factor are suggested. 4) The time until fracture was calculated under the assumption of the crack velocity V= Î±KIn and the above equation, where Î± is a constant and n is stress corrosion index.
