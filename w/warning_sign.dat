After Bart breaks down crying, Homer finally has had enough: he decides to dig a tunnel and rescue Bart himself. Groundskeeper Willie sees this and joins Homer, starting an excavation operation. Bart is finally rescued with help from Sting and other residents, and Willie puts up a small <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> near the well to prevent future accidents.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreck of}} the SS Vina, a cargo steamer built in 1894, {{can be seen at}} low tide. In 1944, she was {{anchored}} offshore for use as an RAF target when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her. After the war, some of the wreck was salvaged as scrap. The remains of the Vina are accessible at low tide, but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> to predators.|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{detecting}} and categorizing early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> {{of aggressive}} behavior in child psychiatric units. We analyzed 575 violent incident report forms {{and developed a}} coding scheme consisting of 16 <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> From the 575 incident report forms, a total of 1087 signs were coded. Most common <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were 'restlessness' (21. 2 %), 'not listening' (15. 2 %) and 'anger' (9. 8 %). These were also the most prevalent <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> for the severe incidents. Although <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> differ for each individual child, this study indicates that there are common <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> for imminent aggressive incidents in child psychiatric facilities...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{literature}} on the recognition of the early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of schizophrenia. The occurence of psychotic relapse is characteristic of schizophrenia. Preventing psychotic relapse is important in the treatment for patients with schizophrenia. Identifying early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> can reduce the incidence of psychotic relapse. It is important to make a clear conceptual distinction between early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> and psychotic symptoms. Studies indicate that between 5 0 % to 70 % of people experience early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> over a period of one to four weeks prior to a relapse. Early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of schizophrenia show a mixture of psychotic and non-psychotic symptoms. Early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were identified as hallucinations, suspiciousness, change in sleep, anxiety, anger-hostility, disruptive inappropriate behaviour, depression, suicidal ideas, nervousness, increased tension, cognitive inefficiency. Systematic monitoring of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> is an important part of the treatment strategy. The time interval between the first early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> and psychotic relapse is long enough to give sufficient opportunity to apply early intervention strategies...|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives. The Forensic Early Warning Signs of Aggression Inventory (FESAI) was {{developed}} to assist nurses and patients in identifying early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> and constructing individual early detection plans (EDP) {{for the prevention of}} aggressive incidents. The aims of this research were as follows: First, to study the prevalence of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of aggression, measured with the FESAI, in a sample of forensic patients, and second, to explore whether there are any types of <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> typical of diagnostic subgroups or offender subgroups. Background. Reconstructing patients’ changes in behaviour prior to aggressive incidents may contribute to identify early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> specific to the individual patient. The EDP comprises an early intervention strategy suggested by the patient and approved by the nurses. Implementation of EDP may enhance efficient risk assessment and management. Design. An explorative design was used to review existing records and to monitor frequencies of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> Methods. Early detection plans of 171 patients from two forensic hospital wards were examined. Frequency distributions were estimated by recording the early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> on the FESAI. Rank order correlation analyses were conducted to compare diagnostic subgroups and offender subgroups concerning types and frequencies of <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> Results. The FESAI categories with the highest frequency rank were the following: (1) anger, (2) social withdrawal, (3) superficial contact and (4) non-aggressive antisocial behaviour. There {{were no significant differences between}} subgroups of patients concerning the ranks of the four categories of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> Conclusion. The results suggest that the FESAI covers very well the wide variety of occurred <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> reported in the EDPs. No group profiles of <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were found to be specific to diagnosis or offence type. Relevance to clinical practice. Applying the FESAI to develop individual EDPs appears to be a promising approach to enhance risk assessment and management...|$|R
25|$|The {{importance}} of a <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> is emphasised by the red border drawn around it and the triangular shape. Some warning sings {{do not have a}} red border like sharp deviation.

40|$|Objective: Early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of {{aggression}} refers to recurring changes in behaviors, thoughts, perceptions, {{and feelings of}} the patient that {{are considered to be}} precursors of aggressive behavior. The early recognition of these signs offers possibilities for early intervention and prevention of aggressive behaviors in forensic patients. The Forensic Early <b>warning</b> <b>Signs</b> of Aggression Inventory (FESAI) was developed to assist nurses and patients in identifying and monitoring these early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> {{of aggression}}. Methods: The FESAI was developed by means of qualitative and quantitative strategies. One hundred seventy six early detection plans were studied to construct a list of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of aggression. Inventory drafting was done by merging and categorizing early <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> Forensic nursing professionals assessed face validity, and interrater agreement was tested. Results: The investigation of early detection plans resulted in the FESAI, which contains 44 early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of aggression subdivided into 15 main categories. The face validity of the form was very good, and the interrater agreement was satisfactory. Conclusions: Preliminary findings indicate that the FESAI provides a useful listing of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of aggression in forensic patients. It may facilitate the construction of early detection plans for the prevention of aggressive behaviors in forensic psychiatry...|$|R

25|$|Before the Hatlestad Slide, Norway {{maintained}} a liberal policy {{when it came}} to housing construction on hills. The area of the afflicted housing units were therefore not surveyed for landslide risk before construction was commenced in the sixties, and the risk of landslides did not become known until later. After construction was finished, there were several incidents of rocks dislodging from the cliff and hitting the road. The rocks did not cause material damage or personal injury, and the municipality took no action besides setting up a <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> by the road. Despite repeated complaints from Hatlestad's residents about this problem and the general risk of landslides, the municipality did not secure the area, stating that securing land against landslides {{is the responsibility of the}} property owner. However, an order given to the property owners to secure the hill were never responded to, and the case was never resolved.|$|E
25|$|Like Hawke before him, Keating benefited while prime {{minister}} from a split Liberal Party. Shortly after the 1993 election, John Hewson was replaced as Liberal Leader by Alexander Downer, whose leadership was quickly marred by gaffes and controversies within months. After continuous poor polling, Downer resigned in 1995 {{and was replaced}} by John Howard, who had previously led the Liberals from 1985 to 1989. Although at first showing no improvement, under Howard the Coalition soon regained momentum to move back ahead of Labor in opinion polls, and Keating was unable to wrest back the lead again. The first <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> of a serious swing away from Labor came in March 1995, when Labor lost Canberra in a by-election. Later in 1995, the Queensland Labor Party barely held onto its majority at the state election, before losing it altogether in a 1996 by-election. That by-election took place a week after Keating had called the 1996 election; the very public defeat severely hampered the launch of the Labor campaign, and the campaign was never able to regain momentum.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the level of}} knowledge regarding risk factors and <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> for stroke and heart attack among White and African American adults in Michigan and to quantify racial disparities. METHODS: Knowledge of stroke and heart attack risk factors and <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> was assessed by {{using data from the}} 2004 Michigan Behavioral Risk Factor Survey. Prevalence estimates of knowledge were generated, and statistical differences in knowledge between Whites and African Americans were assessed. Adequate knowledge was defined as knowing 3 correct <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> or risk factors. Logistic regression models were used to quantify the racial disparity in knowledge while controlling for potential confounding. RESULTS: Whites had substantially higher levels of adequate knowledge of risk factors (stroke: 31. 6 % vs 13. 8 %; heart attack: 52. 6 % vs 24. 3 %) and <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> (stroke: 30. 0 % vs 17. 2 %; heart attack: 29. 3 % vs 13. 8 %) compared with African Americans (all observed differences were significant at P <. 05). The odds of adequate knowledge of risk factors (stroke: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2. 9; heart attack: AOR 3. 4) and <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> (stroke: AOR 2. 0; heart attack: AOR 2. 4) were significantly higher for Whites than for African Americans. CONCLUSION: A strong racial disparity in the knowledge of stroke and heart attack risk factors and <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> exists among Michigan adults. Communitywide public education programs in conjunction with targeted interventions for at-risk populations are necessary to produce meaningful improvements in the awareness of stroke and heart attack risk factors and <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> among Michigan adults...|$|R
