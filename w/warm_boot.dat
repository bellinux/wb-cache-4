50|$|Finding a {{definition}} for <b>warm</b> <b>boot,</b> however, {{is more of}} a challenge. All aforementioned sources indicate that a <b>warm</b> <b>boot</b> is initiated by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination; all except Tulloch (2002) mention that a warm reboot does not perform POST. Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) specifies that for a warm reboot to occur, BIOS must be the recipient of the key combination. Microsoft Support article 102228 takes a more technical approach and defines a <b>warm</b> <b>boot</b> a result of invoking INT 19h, a BIOS interrupt call; the Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination {{is only one of the}} ways. According to Grimes (2001), malware may prevent or subvert a <b>warm</b> <b>boot</b> by intercepting Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination and prevent it from reaching BIOS. Windows NT family of operating systems also does the same and reserves the key combination for its own use. Soper (2004) asserts that Windows restart command initiates a <b>warm</b> <b>boot,</b> thus contradicting Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) that believes the same action performs a cold boot.|$|E
50|$|Technical sources {{describe}} two contrasting {{forms of}} reboot known as cold reboot (also cold boot, hard reboot or hard boot) and warm reboot (also <b>warm</b> <b>boot,</b> soft reboot or soft boot) although {{the definition of}} these forms slightly vary between sources.|$|E

An example of this implementation is the Phoenix FirstBIOS, which uses Boot Engineering Extension Record (BEER) and Protected Area Run Time Interface Extension Services (PARTIES). Another example is the Gujin installer which can install the bootloader in BEER, naming that pseudo-partition /dev/hda0 or /dev/sdb0; then only cold boots (from power-down) will succeed because <b>warm</b> <b>boots</b> (from Control-Alt-Delete) {{will not be able to}} read the HPA.|$|R

5000|$|The BIOS {{begins its}} POST when the CPU is reset. The first memory {{location}} the CPU tries to execute {{is known as}} the reset vector. In the case of a hard reboot, the northbridge will direct this code fetch (request) to the BIOS located on the system flash memory. For a <b>warm</b> <b>boot,</b> the BIOS will be located in the proper place in RAM and the northbridge will direct the reset vector call to the RAM. (In earlier PC systems, before chipsets were standard, the BIOS ROM would be located at an address range that included the reset vector, and BIOS ran directly out of ROM. This is why the motherboard BIOS ROM is in segment F000 in the conventional memory map.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Outside {{the domain}} of IBM {{compatible}} PCs, the types of boot may not apply. According to Sue Loh of Windows CE Base Team, Windows CE devices support three types of boots: Warm, cold and clean. A <b>warm</b> <b>boot</b> discards [...] "program memory" [...] area. A cold boot also discards the contents of [...] "storage memory" [...] area (also known as [...] "object store"). A clean boot erases all forms of storage memories for the device. However, since these areas do not exist on all Windows CE devices, users are only concerned with two forms of reboot: One that resets the volatile memory and one that wipes the device clean and restores factory settings. For example, for a Windows Mobile 5.0 device, the former is a cold boot and {{the latter is a}} clean boot.|$|E

5000|$|The Apple IIc Plus had {{comprised}} {{three new}} features {{compared to the}} IIc. The first and most noticeable feature was {{the replacement of the}} 5.25-inch floppy drive with the new 3.5-inch drive. Besides offering nearly six times the storage capacity (800 KB), the new drive had a much faster seek time (three times faster) and button-activated motorized ejection. To accommodate the increased data flow of the new drive, specialized chip circuitry called the MIG, an acronym for [...] "Magic Interface Glue", was designed and added to the motherboard along with a dedicated 2 KB static RAM buffer (the MIG chip is the only exception to there being no new technological developments present in the machine). The second most important feature was a faster 65C02 processor. Running at 4 MHz, it made the computer faster than any other Apple II, including the IIGS. Apple licensed the Zip Chip Apple II accelerator from third-party developer Zip Technologies and added to the IIc Plus; instead of the all-in-one tall chip design, Apple engineers broke out the design into its core components and integrated them into the motherboard (a 4 MHz CPU, 8 KB of combined static RAM cache, and logic). The CPU acceleration was a last-minute feature addition, which in turn made the specialized circuitry for the use of a 3.5-inch drive unnecessary at full CPU speed as the machine was now fast enough to handle the data flow; that circuitry was left in place and put into operation nonetheless to support 1 MHz mode. By default the machine ran at 4 MHz, but holding down the 'ESC' key during a cold or <b>warm</b> <b>boot</b> disabled the acceleration so it could run at a standard 1 MHz operation — necessary for older software that depended on timing, especially games. The third major change was the internalization of the power supply into the Apple IIc Plus's case, utilizing a new miniature design from Sony (gone was the infamous [...] "brick on a leash" [...] external supply).|$|E

40|$|This {{questionnaire}} survey was initiated to acquire information for prepration {{of a series}} of field studies. The paper deals with questions that were related to the thermal responses of the feet and footwear performance. The questionnaire was sent to a harbour, a telecommunication company and a customs office. At the harbour most of the workers used footwear with warm lining during winter. Half of them used also footwear without lining occasionally or regularly. The telecommunication workers used <b>warm</b> <b>boots</b> and one of them used footwear without lining occasionally while at customs all the workers regularly wore footwear without lining. Most cold injuries were reported in toes. Half of the workers were dissatisfied with their clothing. The footwear was considered to be the worst. 47 % of the workers (harbour 50 %, telecommunication 31 % and customs 75 %) had experienced problems with footwear in the cold climate. The most common problems connected with footwear were feeling cold in feet (30 of 43) followed by risk to slip (16) and wet (15) or sweaty (12) feet. Slipping was considered as the next biggest problem after cold: 30 workers had slipped and 22 had fallen during last two winter seasons. In five cases falls had ended with an injury: ligament injury, caudal vertebrae contusion, muscle strain and tooth injury, foot sprain and lumbago. According to the responders the problem with footwear was low insulation that resulted in cold feet. Better communication between workers and employers could be helpful for purchasing in footwear according to the workers’ needs.

40|$|A {{series of}} field studies at cold {{workplaces}} were initiated. This paper {{deals with a}} study at a harbour and the main {{attention is paid to}} the thermal responses of the feet and footwear performance. The study was carried out in February. Eight male workers were the subjects. They were selected among volunteers who carried out four different jobs in pairs. The <b>warm</b> winter <b>boots</b> were provided by the experimenters. The insulation of a boot (size 41) was measured on a thermal foot model and was 0. 34 m 2 °C/W. One subject used his own shoes with an estimated insulation of about 0. 23 m 2 °C/W. The subjects used one pair of thin socks (about 75 g/pair). Temperature sensors were taped to the second toe and dorsal foot. The workers were observed during the whole workday. The foot skin temperatures stayed relatively high, usually over 30 °C, except in the subject with shoes whose foot skin temperature was mostly below 30 °C. The lowest toe temperatures were occasionally around 17 - 18 °C, but commonly they were higher than 25 °C. The sweat accumulation in the footwear was at average 20 g per day and foot (1. 3 - 3. 8 g/h). Around 2 g of that stayed in the socks {{at the end of the}} day. The footwear was generally considered comfortable. Still, problems with the footwear were: difficulty to walk, limited mobility and poor fit, limiting effect on work ability, cold feet (the subject with shoes) and sweaty feet. The provided boots had too high insulation for the particular weather conditions (4 to 8 °C). The shoe insulation seemed not to be enough (one subject). Under the studied climatic and work conditions the recommended insulation would be between 0. 25 and 0. 30 m 2 °C/W...|$|R
40|$|Present {{standard}} on safety footwear (EN 344) checks the insulation only {{at one point}} in the shoes by means of measuring the temperature change. A method that uses thermal foot model allows to measure footwear insulation simultaneously at various locations and for whole footwear as well. In the present work the method of heated foot model was developed further. It is possible to simulate sweating and evaluate reduction of insulation of footwear due to wetting and evaporative heat loss. The conditions with various sweat rates, wear length and foot motion were tested. Footwear with various insulation levels (from thin rubber boots to thick winter boots) was evaluated. Some footwear was manufactured both with and without steel toe cap and this allowed to study the thermal effect of steel toe cap in different conditions. Comparative studies between various methods (thermal foot model, humans, EN 344) for evaluating footwear thermal properties/insulation were carried out. Field studies were carried out for evaluation of footwear and feet conditions in real wear situation. The insulation of footwear can vary depending on region and insulation level of the footwear. Heavy winter boots had lowest insulation in toe zone and thin boots had heel zone as the coldest region. Sweat rates of 3 g/h can reduce footwear insulation considerably (9 - 19 % depending on initial dry insulation). At higher sweat rates (10 g/h) the reduction could be up to 36 %. Combined effects of sweating, walking and wind could reduce insulation by about 45 %. Reduction was bigger in <b>warm</b> winter <b>boots.</b> Only small amount of moisture evaporates from winter footwear during use. Insulation reduction levelled off over longer periods of use. The reduction can be calculated by simple equations. The thermal foot model gave similar insulation values as measured on human subjects in thermal comfort. The insulation values were used for validation of a mathematical model for foot skin temperature prediction. The results obtained with a thermal foot model give more useful information on footwear than does the present standard for footwear thermal testing. Thus, the thermal foot method is recommended for use as a standard. A steel toe cap in a footwear seems to have no influence on insulation, but may modify the heat losses from the foot. The influence could be related to the “after effect” that probably depends on the mass of steel toe cap and its thermal inertia. Some recommendations for use and choice of footwear are given...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{discussing}} some {{results of the}} bigger experiment that was conducted in order to study the effect of different sweat rates (3, 5 and 10 g/h) on footwear insulation. During the study series some tests with 8 -hour sweating were carried out. A thermal foot model was used for testing. The model is divided into 8 zones and had 5 “sweat glands”. A thin sock was donned on foot model for better water distribution. The flow rate to the five “sweat glands” corresponded to 5 g/h, i. e. 40 g per day in total. The test lasted for 12 hours: 1 hour to stabilise the heat losses {{in the beginning of}} the test, 8 hours for wet tests and 3 hours for dry test in the end. The last 3 hours were added to see what happens when water distribution is stopped. The footwear was chosen to cover a wide range of insulation levels from thin rubber boot to winter boot for extreme cold. Each boot had its own sock of the same type. Footwear was weighed before the test, after 8 hours of wet measurements and at the end. Data from the last 10 minutes of each half hour was used for the insulation calculation. It appeared that the insulation change within the first 1. 5 hours corresponded to most of the total reduction during the 8 -hour sweating in <b>warm</b> winter <b>boots.</b> The next 6. 5 hours reduced the insulation only 4 - 5 % more in WS and 8 - 9 % in SM. The insulation reduction levelled off in the long test. This indicates that a balance was reached between the water supply and the evaporation and water transport. In the rubber boot BS this balance was not reached. BS had not much capacity to absorb and transport the water further from the foot. The sock became more wet and favoured further cooling. Even when sweating was stopped the insulation did not improve much. From this point of view the leather boot functioned much better. The winter footwear and the leather boot gained back a considerable amount of insulation within the 3 hours of dry measurements. The water was absorbed and transported further away from the foot. The sock became relatively dry. This demonstrates the importance of keeping the layers near body dry. Although, the amount of water in the boot was still relatively high, for example, 36. 6 g in WS, the total insulation at 11 th hour was only 7. 5 % lower than dry insulation. This suggests that changing socks after heavy activity can be an effective way to keep feet warm over the day. The morning after the long test, the footwear was weighed again. The most moisture was left in a winter boot WS. Considering the slow drying of WS, it could be recommended to use special shoe dryers. Otherwise, the water collection by the end of the work week could become quite high. That would in worst case make the socks wet already when donning the footwear...|$|R
60|$|Day {{after day}} passed, and nothing came of it. A steamer or two started, but {{although}} we expressed our willingness {{to sleep on}} deck, and put up with any accommodation whatever, no room could be found. One of our number, hopeless and disgusted, took passage in the last Peninsular and Oriental steamer, and is probably at the present moment wandering about Aden, praying for a passage across. I thought it better to wait here until I could be taken direct to our destination. At last came the intelligence that our horses could be put on board a sailing-ship. This was something done, and I felt really thankful when, after a long day’s work, I left the ship’s side, leaving the horses and their syces on board. Indeed, the servant question {{is one of the}} most serious of those which present themselves to the mind of an intending Abyssinian expeditionist. It is not difficult to get one. You only have to speak, to get half-a-dozen servants and syces. But you know, both by the warnings of your friends and by your own instincts, that so many applicants, so many rogues. It is at present the very best profession in Bombay to get hired to a master going to Abyssinia, and to disappear two days before he leaves with his purse and any other portable valuables which may come handy. My first servant, a mild Hindoo of engaging aspect, was seized with a pulmonary affection, while his brother, who was servant to a friend of mine, was at the last moment melted by the tears of an aged and despairing mother, and both left us; but not until some hours after their departure did we find that they had, of course accidentally, carried away with them a considerable amount of specie and small valuables. When at last a servant is obtained who really does mean to go to Abyssinia, there is no little trouble to be gone through with him. He must have a month’s, or perhaps two months’, pay in advance. He must have an arrangement made for the payment of the greater part of his wages to his family during his absence. He must be provided, at your expense, with <b>warm</b> clothes, <b>boots,</b> blankets, &c.; and all this with the strong chance of his bolting at the last moment. One of my syces alarmed me greatly by not turning up on the morning when the horses were to be embarked; but he finally appeared upon the landing-stage just as they were being slung into a lighter, three hours after the time named. Whether he or any of the syces finally accompanied the horses I am unable to say, as the ship, instead of sailing that afternoon as positively settled by the authorities, was detained three or four days; and it is very probable that during that time the syces slipped ashore with their warm clothes, advance of wages, &c. This painful question cannot be solved until the ship with the horses arrives at Annesley Bay. Another four or five days passed, and then came the welcome order to go at once on board the General Havelock, which was to start the next day at noon. On board we accordingly went, but found, as we anticipated, that there was no chance of her starting for that day at any rate. The usual conflict of departments was taking place. Some department had ordered a force of twenty European soldiers and fifty Sepoys belonging to the transport train to come on board. This they did. Then came a committee of some other department, and questioned whether the Havelock was fit to carry this force, and whether they had not better be transferred to some other ship. Finding that the men’s things were all below, it was determined to leave them as they were. Then the same committee, with a view, I suppose, of making the vessel more comfortable, determined to send three and a half tons of gunpowder on board, and with this intent sent a carpenter in the course of the afternoon, who took down the only available bath, and prepared to convert the same into a powder-magazine. The next morning the same carpenter came on board and brought some more tools, and then returned to shore. In the afternoon he fetched the tools away. In the mean time one department had sent the water-lighter alongside; but another department had sent no tanks on board to receive it. Presently that department sent some tanks, but as it had not occurred to it to measure the hatchways, the tanks were considerably larger than the opening down which they had to go, so they had to be taken away and a fresh set of tanks brought on board. Then, long after dusk, the water-ship again came alongside, and we took in our water. In the mean time we went ashore to the department which had sent us on board, to ask when it was probable that the Havelock would really sail. We were assured by that department that she had already started, and we had great difficulty in persuading it that she was still at anchor, and likely to remain so. The next morning, the powder not having arrived, and nothing more having been heard either of it or of the carpenter, our captain got up steam and started; and it is by no means improbable that the powder, with one or two committees of departments, are at present cruising about Bombay harbour looking for the Havelock. And yet ours is an absolutely favourable example, for a steamer last week was detained six days after the date of the embarkation of its passengers. And if this confusion exists now, when only one or two vessels are starting a-week, what a scene of confusion will it be when the main body of the force sails! It always is so, and always will be so, as long as our army is managed by a set of independent departments, who have no concert whatever between them. We have here the quartermaster-general’s department, the commissariat, the land-transport, the marine, the adjutant-general’s department, the ordnance, and so on ad infinitum. Military men are the first and loudest to complain of this multiplication of offices without union or concert, which work together well enough in quiet times, but which in emergencies paralyse each other’s efforts, and cause a confusion in exact proportion to their own number. It needs some military reformer of an iron will, and an assured parliamentary support, to put an end to all this, to do away with the independence of the various departments of the service, and to make them all subordinate branches of the adjutant-general’s office; so that a general upon service may give his orders to his adjutant-general only, and the latter may instruct the officers of the departments under him as to what should be done. All indents and orders should be given to him alone, and he should be responsible for the working of the several branches. In some respects it turned out to be as well that we had not started at the time named, for at night, when the rations were served out to the troops, it was found that both the porter and arrack, which form a somewhat important part of a soldier’s rations, had not been sent on board by the commissariat. Great was the consternation. However, fortunately next day, while departments were skirmishing over water and water-tanks, and the carpenter was going and coming with his tools, there was time to send to the commissariat, and for them to repair their error.|$|R
