60|$|I, in the meanwhile, was glancing {{round the}} room and soon spied a <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard</b> which had {{obviously}} been deliberately screened by the bedstead. While my companion was bringing the whole majesty of the law to bear upon the miscreant's denegations I calmly dragged the bedstead aside and opened the cupboard door.|$|E
60|$|I demanded Theodore! My friend, my comrade, {{my right}} hand! I {{had seen him}} not ten minutes ago, {{carrying}} in his arms this very dog, whom I had subsequently found inside a <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard</b> beside a blood-stained coat. Where was Theodore? Pointing an avenging finger at the red-headed reprobate, I boldly accused him of having murdered my friend {{with a view to}} robbing him of the reward offered for the recovery of the dog.|$|E
60|$|The {{enormous}} iron padlock on {{the doors}} of the <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard</b> was the only object in the room on which the eye could rest without becoming afflicted by the miserable unloveliness of forms and the poverty of material. Unsaleable in the ordinary course of business on account of its noble proportions, it had been ceded to the Professor for a few pence by a marine dealer in the east of London. The room was large, clean, respectable, and poor with that poverty suggesting the starvation of every human need except mere bread. There was nothing on the walls but the paper, an expanse of arsenical green, soiled with indelible smudges here and there, and with stains resembling faded maps of uninhabited continents.|$|E

50|$|Most {{cabinets}} {{incorporate a}} top of some sort.

60|$|An {{ejaculation}} from my quivering throat {{brought the}} gendarme to my side. Crouching {{in the dark}} recess of the <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard</b> was Carissimo--not dead, thank goodness! but literally shaking with terror. I pulled him out as gently as I could, for he was so frightened that he growled and snapped viciously at me. I handed him to the gendarme, for {{by the side of}} Carissimo I had seen something which literally froze my blood within my veins. It was Theodore's hat and coat, which he had been wearing when I chased him to this house of mystery and of ill-fame, and wrapped together with it was a rag all smeared with blood, whilst the same hideous stains were now distinctly visible {{on the door of the}} cupboard itself.|$|E
60|$|When he met me at {{the corner}} of the Rue Beaune he was on his way to the Rue Guénégaud, hoping to {{exchange}} Carissimo for five thousand francs. When he met me, however, he felt that the best thing to do for the moment was to seek safety in flight. He had only just time to run back to the hotel to warn Mme. Sand of my approach and beg her to detain me at any cost. Then he flew up the stairs, changed into his disguise, Carissimo barking all the time furiously. Whilst he was trying to pacify the dog, the latter bit him severely in the arm, drawing a good deal of blood--the crimson scar across his face was a last happy inspiration which put the finishing touch to his disguise and to the hoodwinking of the police and of me. He had only just time to staunch the blood from his arm and to thrust his own clothes and Carissimo into the <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard</b> when the gendarme and I burst in upon him.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the myths}} told about a man enveloped in black robes before {{miraculously}} turning into this creature. After the transformation, the demon boar roams around the village, scratching its body against the <b>wall,</b> door, <b>cupboard,</b> or furniture. Magically the belongings of the villagers, such as money, gold, and jewellery will disappear and be magically carried away by the Babi Ngepet. If the mission was successful, by the time Babi Ngepet safely returns home and transforms back into human form, the black robes will be filled with the stolen money or jewellery.|$|R

The medals were unable to be recovered, but fortunately the sword has remained in the Lovemore family.|$|E
5000|$|These {{buildings}} {{may have}} influenced Pabst, but the most direct influence {{seems to have been}} British designer Bruce James Talbert. Talbert's Gothic Forms Applied to Furniture, Metal Work and Decoration for Domestic Purposes was published in Boston in 1873. The Pabst cabinet's [...] "roof," [...] columns, and corbels are closely related to a Talbert <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard</b> (plate 12, below); and the cameo-carved panels of its upper doors seem to be copied from the doors of a Talbert cabinet (plate 20, below).|$|E
60|$|He {{jumped up}} and {{prepared}} to go: all his limbs still seemed quite stiff with his long sleep, especially his neck, for he could not move his head easily, and he laughed at his own stupidity at being still so drowsy that he kept knocking his nose against the <b>wall</b> or <b>cupboards.</b> The squirrels and guinea pigs ran whimpering after him, as though {{they would like to}} go too, and he begged them to come when he reached the door, but they all turned and ran quickly back into the house again.|$|R
50|$|House at 316 South Mills Avenue. The parcel {{that this}} house sits on is {{partially}} {{within the city}} of Montclair. This house was built in 1932 by Raymond Yerkes. During the two years that this house was under construction, Yerkes was living in Pomona. Yerkes was helped by Stys and another neighbor, Merle Mead. The house was built of stone as well as concrete forms from construction sites of Pomona College. A railroad tie was used to support the large window in the living room. In 1938, the garage was converted into a studio. The interior <b>walls</b> and <b>cupboards</b> of the studio were made of wood recovered from a railroad car.|$|R
50|$|The apartments were {{equipped}} with built-in furniture, and specially designed storage <b>walls</b> with various <b>cupboards</b> with sliding doors, which {{were designed by}} Charlotte Perriand in collaboration with Atelier Le Corbusier.

50|$|The {{largest and}} most {{imposing}} of the buildings at Glendalough, the cathedral had several phases of construction, the earliest, consisting of the present nave with its antae. The large mica-schist stones which can be seen up to {{the height of the}} square-headed west doorway were re-used from an earlier smaller church. The chancel and sacristy date from the late 12th and early 13th centuries. The chancel arch and east window were finely decorated, though many of the stones are now missing. The north doorway to the nave also dates from this period. Under the southern window of the chancel is an ambry or <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard</b> and a piscina, a basin used for washing the sacred vessels. A few metres south of the cathedral an early cross of local granite, with an unpierced ring, is commonly known as St. Kevin's Cross.|$|E
50|$|Audley's Castle {{consists}} of a tower set within a yard (technically known as a bawn) which is enclosed by a thin wall, with a simple gate. It is protected on its south side by a rocky cliff. The stone walls of the bawn {{have been reduced to}} low foundations, but its rectangular plan can still be traced. In the south-east area of the bawn are the foundations of an outhouse, probably a barn or servants quarters, and the tower house is at the north corner of the bawn. The south-east face of the tower house is dominated by two projecting square turrets, linked by an arch at parapet level (a machicolation), through which objects could be dropped on anyone attacking the door in the south turret below. The ground floor room is entered through a small lobby which has a murder-hole in its roof. The room is lit by narrow window loops and has a <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard</b> and a chute for slops. The south turret contains a spiral stair which leads to the two upper chambers and the roof.|$|E
50|$|In Pursuit of Beauty, a major {{exhibition}} of Aesthetic Movement decorative arts, was mounted at MMA in 1986. The cover of its catalogue was {{a photograph of}} the cabinet. Contributor Marilynn Johnson wrote:The most successful American interpretations of the Talbert style of Modern Gothic furniture were apparently the result of a collaboration between a highly skilled Philadelphia cabinetmaker and carver, DANIEL PABST, and FRANK FURNESS, a Philadelphia architect. Furniture believed to have been produced by Pabst and Furness includes a desk that was handed down in the Furness family, at least two suites of furniture owned by Theodore Roosevelt, and, most impressive of all, a cabinet that has only recently come to light. Its rooflike pediment, angular base, chamfered edges, truncated columns, elaborate strap hinges, and decorated door panels all link this cabinet to the Modern Gothic furniture of British architect-designers such as Burges. The scrolling, finely carved brackets, however, specifically suggest the form of Talbert's <b>wall</b> <b>cupboard,</b> and the cutaway pattern of stylized flowers on the upper doors is reminiscent of the decoration on a sideboard that relates closely to the Holland and Sons sideboard of 1867 and is illustrated as number 20 in Gothic Forms. Talbert's work may well have been the source for the design of the cabinet.|$|E
60|$|At length, with a lamp in one hand, he {{mounted to}} his new apartment. It was large, low, and {{somewhat}} dark. The window looked upon the moat, and although it was so high up, it was heavily barred. The bed was luxurious, with one pillow of down and one of lavender, and a red coverlet worked in a pattern of roses. All about the <b>walls</b> were <b>cupboards,</b> locked and padlocked, and concealed from view by hangings of dark-coloured arras. Dick made the round, lifting the arras, sounding the panels, seeking vainly to open the cupboards. He assured himself that the door was strong and the bolt solid; then he set down his lamp upon a bracket, and once more looked all around.|$|R

60|$|Wilmet was aghast at first, but a hint from Alda {{made her}} acquiesce, not with {{blushing}} consciousness, {{but with the}} perception that the way of the world was against the retention of the lodger; and sorry as she was to lose Mr. Audley, her housewifely mind was not consoled, but distracted, by calculations on the difference of expenditure. Again she tried to beg herself off from her visit, in the dread that Felix would go and take some impracticable house in her absence--some place with thin <b>walls,</b> no <b>cupboards,</b> and no coal-hole; and she was only pacified by his solemn promise to decide on no house without her. She went away in an avalanche of kisses and tears, leaving Geraldine with a basketful of written instructions for every possible contingency, at which the anxious maiden sat gazing anxiously, trying to store her mind with its onerous directions.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of services, {{based on current}} location of objects is growing. This is because Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) cannot provide object position inside buildings. In modern era the Location Based Services (LBS) are tremendously dependent on Indoor Positioning System (IPS). Parallel RPROP and greedy algorithm were combined for development of IPS using Received Signal Strength (RSS) in heterogeneous environment, the environment comprised of human activity, <b>walls</b> material, <b>cupboards,</b> and various type of surveying machines etc. The propagation of Wi-Fi signal varies directionally, therefore to cope with direction changes in signals; this proposed model produces three sets of weights, which could be considered best for easting, northing and height respectively. Proposed model was trained with 75 % of collected data and tested on remaining 25 % data. Distance error between known points and predicted coordinates was used for accuracy assessment. Through experiments a maximum accuracy of 0. 87 m was achieved and {{it was found that}} median error was less than mean error. Median error between known points and predicted coordinates was about 3. 32 m and their mean error was about 4. 62 m, which is satisfactory as far as 3 D position determination is concerned. On the basis of results the use of parallel RPROP and greedy algorithm for 3 D position determination in heterogeneous environment is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} costs of laboratory environments such as mobile robots and the specialization of research groups increase {{the demand for}} collaboration between different research groups. Although the Internet {{can be regarded as}} the most important medium for cooperation over large distances, it does not provide the necessary bandwidth for the transmission of video-streams required for example during a tele-experiment with a mobile robot. In this paper we present a combination of a tele-experimentation environment for autonomous mobile robots (RTL) with a minimal rendering tool-kit for virtual reality (MRT-VR). The RTLsystem includes means for bridging transmission gaps by using simulation techniques to predict the robots actions and supports automatic viewpoint selection for virtual cameras in the MRT-VR system. The MRT-VR allows the on-line visualization of experiments in a virtual environment. MRTVR additionally supports natural navigation of the user through the 3 D virtual environment in various aspects. It includes a collision detection to avoid that users get inside of objects such as <b>walls</b> or <b>cupboards</b> and supports climbing of stairs. Additionally users can select different viewpoints or even automatically follow the robot during its operation. Finally it supports the synchronization of the viewpoints for distributed observers. This paper demonstrates, that by combining both techniques an improved visualization quality with respect to the precision of the simulation and the ease of operation of tele-operated systems is obtained. 1...|$|R

60|$|A Misty {{evening in}} mid-October; a top room {{in one of}} the small dingy houses {{on the north side of}} Moon Street, its floor {{partially}} covered with pieces of drugget carpet trodden into rags; for furniture, an iron bed placed against the <b>wall,</b> a deal <b>cupboard</b> or wardrobe, a broken iron cot in a corner, a wooden box and three or four chairs, and a small square deal table; on the table one candle in a tin candlestick gave light to the two occupants of the room. One of these a woman sitting in a listless attitude before the grate, fireless now, although the evening was damp and chilly. She appeared strong, but just now was almost repulsive to look at as she sat there in her dirty ill-fitting gown, with her feet thrust out before her, showing her broken muddy boots. Her features were regular, even handsome; that, however, was little in her favour when set against the hard red colour of her skin, which told of habitual intemperance, and the expression, half sullen and half reckless, of her dark eyes, as she sat there staring into the empty grate. There were no white threads yet in her thick long hair that had once been black and glossy, unkempt now, like everything about her, with a dusky dead look in it.|$|R
6000|$|A {{pleasant}} room {{it was as}} {{any party}} need desire to muster in on a cold November evening. The fireplace alone was a picture: a wide and deep recess with a low brick altar in the middle, where great logs of dry wood sent myriad sparks up the dark chimney-throat; and over the front of this recess a large wooden entablature bearing this motto, finely carved in old English letters, 'Fear God and honour the King'. And beyond the party, who formed a half-moon with their chairs and well-furnished table round this bright fireplace, what a space of chiaroscuro for the imagination to revel in! Stretching across {{the far end of}} the room, what an oak table, high enough surely for Homer's gods, standing on four massive legs, bossed and bulging like sculptured urns! and, lining the distant <b>wall,</b> what vast <b>cupboards,</b> suggestive of inexhaustible apricot jam and promiscuous butler's perquisites! A stray picture or two had found their way down there, and made agreeable patches of dark brown on the buff-coloured walls. High over the loud-resounding double door hung one which, from some indications of a face looming out of blackness, might, by a great synthetic effort, be pronounced a Magdalen. Considerably lower down hung the similitude of a hat and feathers, with portions of a ruff, stated by Mrs. Bellamy to represent Sir Francis Bacon, who invented gunpowder, and, in her opinion, 'might ha' been better emplyed.' ...|$|R
