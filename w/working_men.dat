5|$|The {{following}} year, Shaftesbury House, a large five-storey brick hostel for <b>working</b> <b>men</b> {{and woman}} opened. It was designed in 1936 by George Clark Robb, senior architectural assistant to Livett, and after its closure, was converted in 2006-7 to the sustainable Green House.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, unbearably {{inadequate}} {{housing and}} overcrowded neighborhoods pushed <b>working</b> <b>men</b> {{out of the}} home and into saloons where they congregated for drink and discussion. Wealthy capitalists wishing {{to strike a balance between}} the demands of labor and desires of capital looked to Robert Owen's example. George Pullman and William Halliday implemented a policy of tolerance in their towns identical to that of Robert Owen. The peaceful atmosphere in Pullman and Hallidayboro can be attributed in part to the absence of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|The {{primitive}} early mines of Cornwall and Devon {{probably were}} operated by local extended families, with the men, {{women and children}} all <b>working.</b> <b>Men</b> and boys probably worked both above the surface and below ground, and women and girls worked only above ground; there is no archaeological evidence for women and children working underground in Bronze Age Britain, although some mines from the period contain tunnels so small that only children or very short adults could have worked in them.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. <b>Working</b> <b>men</b> would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E

25|$|From 1860–63 Huxley {{developed}} his ideas, presenting them in lectures to <b>working</b> <b>men,</b> {{students and the}} general public, followed by publication. Also in 1862 a series of talks to <b>working</b> <b>men</b> was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets, later bound up as a little green book; the first copies went on sale in December. Other lectures grew into Huxley's most famous work Evidence as to Man's place in Nature (1863) where he addressed the key issues long before Charles Darwin published his Descent of Man in 1871.|$|E

25|$|The Indian House/Trade Store : A common {{sight in}} Hudson's Bay Company posts, {{this was the}} point of trade for fur brought by natives who bartered them for European goods.

25|$|The Men's Quarters : Directly {{opposite}} of the Rowand House on the fort's courtyard, several apartments make up the residence of the Hudson's Bay Company's labourers. Some quarters are also the workspace of the fort's skilled tradesmen.

25|$|At this time, due {{to having}} lost the British colonies after long warfare and {{especially}} the violent excesses of the French Revolution, British society was tense because of fears of open revolution. Reformers were considered more suspect than in other periods.

25|$|In the 1892 General Election, held in July, three <b>working</b> <b>men</b> {{were elected}} without {{support from the}} Liberals, Keir Hardie in South West Ham, John Burns in Battersea, and Havelock Wilson in Middlesbrough, the last of whom {{actually}} faced Liberal opposition. Hardie owed nothing to the Liberal Party for his election, and his critical and confrontational style in Parliament caused him to emerge as a national voice of the labour movement.|$|E

25|$|As {{the nineteenth}} century came to a close, working-class {{representation}} in political office became a great concern for many Britons. Many who sought the election of <b>working</b> <b>men</b> and their advocates to the Parliament of the United Kingdom saw the Liberal Party as the main vehicle for achieving this aim. As early as 1869, a Labour Representation League had been established to register and mobilise working-class voters on behalf of favoured Liberal candidates.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prolific}} collector of Ruskiniana was John Howard Whitehouse, who saved Ruskin's home, Brantwood, {{and opened it}} as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established Bembridge School, on the Isle of Wight, and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to Michael Ernest Sadler wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas. Ruskin College, an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for <b>working</b> <b>men,</b> was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and Charles A. Beard.|$|E

Darrow said that his first duty was to his clients, and that he did whatever needed to raise the funds for the best defense possible.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} a new for the Russian anthropology {{concept of}} the «working man», introduced in the Urals along with the propagation of a social and political movement «For the Working Man Protection»; the semantic content of the «man» and «labor» notions being observed {{as well as the}} process and problems of the <b>working</b> <b>man</b> formation in the modern world. The author emphasizes the asymmetry of the socio-economic and vocational educational infrastructure, along with the contradictions between the labor market demands for the technical and technological profile workers and the existing educational qualification structure of vocational schools. In author's opinion, the disorganization of labor training in comprehensive school and deficiencies of vocational education hinder the process of the industrial <b>working</b> <b>man</b> formation. The professional orientation system is criticized for being unable {{to meet the demands of}} modern economy and provide the young people with the adequate {{concept of the}} working career. For overcoming the above problems affecting the <b>working</b> <b>man</b> formation, the paper recommends modernization of the labor training system in comprehensive schools, reformation of vocational training, and renovation of professional orientation system. The special emphasis is given to the continuing training of the <b>working</b> <b>man.</b>  </p...|$|R
