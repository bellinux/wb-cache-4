5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{a number of books}} owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for {{a large part of the}} day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} June 342 BC, Philip {{set off on}} <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a long-planned expedition into Thrace. The {{campaign was}} to last for two years, {{but other than that}} his forces were large, and that he fought several battles, the ancient sources contain very few details. Undoubtedly Philip's primary aim was to depose Kersebleptes, who according to Diodorus had been causing problems for the Greeks on the Chersonese, once and for all. Philip ended the campaign by marrying Meda of Odessos, daughter of a king of the Getae, which has been taken to suggest that Philip campaigned not just in Thrace, but in the valley of the Hebrus, and north of the Great Balkan range of mountains, near the Danube.|$|E

5|$|The {{maker of}} the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There are a number of goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} illuminated manuscripts, both sacred and secular, survive from this early period. Classical authors, including Virgil (represented by the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus) and Homer (represented by the Ambrosian Iliad), were illustrated with narrative paintings. Illuminated biblical manuscripts of this period survive only in fragments: for example, the Quedlinburg Itala fragment is {{a small portion of}} <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a lavishly illustrated copy of 1 Kings.|$|E
25|$|In 811 {{the monastery}} was {{devastated by the}} Vikings but the {{destruction}} was not permanent and the annals of the monastery continued to be recorded for several following centuries. After the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1179, Tallaght and its appurtenances were confirmed to the Diocese of Dublin and became {{the property of the}} Archbishop. The complete disappearance of every trace of <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an extensive and well organised monastic settlement can only be accounted for by the subsequent history of the place, the erection and demolition of defensive walls and castles, and the incessant warfare and destruction that lasted for hundreds of years.|$|E

25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E
500|$|Trade {{contacts}} with Byblos, {{on the coast}} of modern-day Lebanon, are suggested by a fragmentary stone vessel unearthed in the city and bearing the inscription [...] "King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Djedkare [...] forever". A biographical inscription discovered in the tomb of Iny, a Sixth Dynasty official, provides further evidence for an Egyptian expedition to Byblos during Djedkare's reign. Iny's inscription relates his travels to procure lapis lazuli and lead or tin for pharaoh Merenre, but starts by recounting <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> similar events taking place under Djedkare.|$|E
500|$|Appreciation of Nils Strindberg's role {{seems to}} be growing, both for the fortitude with which the untrained and {{unprepared}} student kept photographing, in <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{a more or less}} permanent state of near-collapse from exhaustion and exposure, and for the artistic quality of the result. Out of the 240 exposed frames that were found on Kvitøya in waterlogged containers, 93 were saved by John Hertzberg at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Strindberg's former workplace. In his article, [...] "Recovering the visual history of the Andrée expedition" [...] (2004), Tyrone Martinsson has lamented the traditional focus by previous researchers on the written records—the diaries—as primary sources of information; he renewed his claim for the historical significance of the photographs.|$|E
50|$|Set in {{the year}} 2155 (2157 in some later versions), when {{children}} learn individually at home using a mechanical teacher, the story tells of eleven-year-old Margie Jones, whose neighbor Tommy finds a real book. The book tells about a time when children learned by age group in large schools that were not merely designated rooms in private houses as {{in the year}} 2157. Margie and Tommy discuss <b>what</b> it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> like to study together with a real person as a teacher, and though at first Margie is skeptical about the notion, {{by the end of}} the story she daydreams about <b>what</b> it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> like and 'the fun they had'.|$|R

500|$|By 1419 Henry V {{occupied}} much of Normandy {{and demanded}} an {{oath of allegiance}} from the residents. The new Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, allied with the English, putting enormous pressure on France and Isabeau, who remained loyal to the King. In 1420 Henry sent an emissary to confer with the Queen, after which according to Adams, Isabeau [...] "ceded to <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a persuasively posed argument by Henry V's messenger". [...] France had effectively been left without an heir to the throne, even before the Treaty of Troyes. Charles VI had disinherited the Dauphin, whom he considered responsible for [...] "breaking the peace for {{his involvement in the}} assassination of the duke of Burgundy"; he wrote in 1420 of the Dauphin that he had [...] "rendered himself unworthy to succeed to the throne or any other title". Charles of Orléans, next in line as heir under Salic law, had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Agincourt and was kept in captivity in London.|$|E
500|$|Castello di Botestagno [...] (also {{known as}} Podestagno) was a medieval fort {{perched on a}} rock in {{the valley of the}} river Boite, a little further north of Cortina, in the town of Prà del Caštel. It is {{believed}} that it was first erected as a stakeout during conflict with the Lombards between the seventh and eighth centuries, with the aim of dominating the three valleys that converge beneath it: the Boite, the Val di Fanes and the Val Felizon. The corner stone, however, probably dates to the 11th century. It was held by the Germans until 1077, and then by the patriarchs of Aquileia (12th century) and Camino (13th century), until Botestagno became the seat of a captaincy. It then passed into Venetian hands and finally to the Habsburgs. During the eighteenth century the castle lost importance gradually, until it was auctioned in 1782 by order of Emperor Joseph II. Today the fort has now almost completely disappeared; only the remnants of <b>what</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the wine cellars and the foundations remain, now weathered and largely covered up by vegetation.|$|E

Others question the motivation of the Massachusetts Executive Council. Some suggest Spooner was executed because the community opposed her father's British Loyalist stance. John Avery Jr., the deputy secretary and leader of the Massachusetts Executive Council, who signed Spooner's death warrant, belonged to a group of Patriots called the Loyal Nine, who formed the innermost circle of the Sons of Liberty, and was a step-brother of the murder victim.|$|E

2500|$|Trott {{called a}} meeting of Nassau's {{governing}} council, likely arguing that interloping was a fairly common crime and not a sufficient reason for turning away the men, whose presence now aided Nassau's security.
