5|$|Originally, {{the club}} favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding {{a fistful of}} dollars. The club {{officials}} were all set to go with this until News Limited's Lachlan Murdoch told them to go <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However co-CEOs Chris Johns and John Ribot decided {{to go with the}} themes lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E

These are included in a separate list in Appendix 1. However, all abbreviations carry an increased risk for confusion and misinterpretation and should be used cautiously.|$|E
500|$|Lacroix {{felt that}} with Unbreakable TNA [...] "truly {{cemented}} the formula needed for delivering great pay per views." [...] He concluded with [...] "TNA's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action, {{catering to the}} variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans." [...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. Now, this is the part where I go into a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was." [...] Regarding the Four Way Elimination match, Lacroix believed Johnny Candido's participation was [...] "a nice gesture", but wonder [...] "if they could have come up <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> preferably outside of the match." ...|$|E

50|$|McCullough {{suffered}} a heart attack in November 2012, leaving him in critical condition. His death was mistakenly reported on Ronan Collins's RTÉ Radio 1 show on 7 November and the BBC also apologised after prematurely reporting his death. In an interview <b>with</b> website <b>Something</b> <b>Else,</b> Denny Seiwell, who had played with McCullough in Wings, stated that it was doubtful McCullough would make a complete recovery.|$|R
2500|$|Akutaq {{is served}} on all special occasions. Like Yup'ik dance, akutaq {{is not an}} {{everyday}} dish. It is a special treat, an honor to receive and a responsibility to give. [...] "Mouse akutak" [...] is made from roots found in mouse holes. Only {{a portion of the}} mouse's stored roots is taken, and some people replace the roots <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> the mouse can eat.|$|E
2500|$|Einstein deemed {{that all}} {{fundamental}} interactions in nature {{can be explained}} in a single theory. Unified field theories were numerous attempts to [...] "merge" [...] several interactions. One of formulations of such theories (as well as field theories in general) is a gauge theory, a generalization {{of the idea of}} symmetry. Eventually the Standard Model (see below) succeeded in unification of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. All attempts to unify gravitation <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> failed.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{creating}} a molecule with the halogen substituted <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> one can completely eliminate both the halogen and a nearby hydrogen, thus forming an alkene by dehydrohalogenation. For example, with bromoethane and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in ethanol, the hydroxide ion HO− abstracts a hydrogen atom. [...] Bromide ion is then lost, resulting in ethylene, H2O and NaBr. Thus, haloalkanes {{can be converted}} to alkenes. [...] Similarly, dihaloalkanes {{can be converted to}} alkynes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] she exclaimed, and {{considered}} him <b>with</b> amusement and <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> [...] "Do {{you know that}} you are almost droll? You rise unblushing from the dregs of life in which I find you, and shake off the arm of that theatre girl, to come and preach to me." ...|$|R

60|$|The riders behind Bostil laughed. Wetherby's {{face was}} there in the door, not amused, but hard <b>with</b> scorn and <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Slone felt a sickening, terrible gust of passion. It fairly shook him. And as the wave {{subsided}} the quick cooling of skin and body pained him like a burn made with ice.|$|R
2500|$|He made it aboard {{safely and}} later commented: [...] "Fortunately {{the men in}} charge were taken up <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> and did not pay much attention. Besides, it was dark, and so {{they would not have}} seen who was a man and who a woman." [...] From his vantage point in the lifeboat, only [...] away from the sinking ship, he heard the cries of those still aboard and what he {{described}} as [...] "extraordinary sounds", seemingly four distinct explosions, when the ship broke up. He described what he heard and saw as Titanic went under: ...|$|E
2500|$|Once dressed, they {{assemble}} a flying boat called [...] "The Flyboat" [...] from classroom objects: a flying disc for a body, felt marker caps as rocket exhausts, a marble, wheels, the mast, and {{a sheet of}} paper for the sail. In some episodes, the Wonder Pets will instead opt for a different mode of transportation such as sub called the [...] "Flysub", which they will construct using additional objects in the classroom or they will modify the Flyboat in some way either out of necessity (such as replacing one of the pieces of the Flyboat <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else)</b> or some other reason. Usually, the Wonder Pets encounter some sort of obstacle before leaving the classroom. The solution is invariably similar to the action they will need to take to save the animal in trouble.|$|E
2500|$|The {{intellectual}} scholarship regarding postmodernism {{and architecture}} is closely {{linked with the}} writings of critic-turned-architect Charles Jencks, beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay [...] "The rise of post-modern architecture" [...] from 1975. His magnum opus, however, is the book The Language of Post-Modern Architecture, first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions. Jencks {{makes the point that}} Post-Modernism (like Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture {{it is not just a}} reaction to Modernism but what he terms double coding: [...] "Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects." [...] Furthermore, Post-Modern architects would for economic reasons by compelled to make use of contemporary technology, hence distinguishing such architects from mere revivalists. Among the Post-Modern architects championed by Jencks were Robert Venturi, Robert Stern, Charles Moore, Michael Graves, Leon Krier, and James Stirling.|$|E

60|$|Miss Blimber {{paused to}} see how Paul {{received}} this news. Being undecided whether six three-fourths meant six pounds fifteen, or sixpence three farthings, or six foot three, or three quarters past six, or six somethings that he hadn't learnt yet, <b>with</b> three unknown <b>something</b> <b>elses</b> over, Paul rubbed his hands and looked straight at Miss Blimber. It happened to answer as well as anything else he could have done; and Cornelia proceeded.|$|R
50|$|While a {{significant}} amount of research supports the existence of the self-reference effect, the processes behind it are not well understood. However, multiple hypotheses have been introduced, and two main arguments have been developed: the elaborative processing hypothesis and the organizational processing hypothesis. Encodings in reference to the self are so elaborate because of the information one has about the self. Information encoded with the self is better remembered than information encoded <b>with</b> reference to <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R

50|$|There is a {{fundamental}} issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia <b>with</b> respect to <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.|$|R
50|$|Bond then sustains amnesia in the {{aftermath}} of his attack with Blofeld and is believed dead by his superiors; in reality, he comes to believe he is a fisherman and lives with Kissy for several months. Kissy decides that she will not stop him if he decides to pursue his true identity, but will encourage the cover story that allowed him to stay <b>with</b> her until <b>something</b> <b>else</b> happens. When Bond decides to leave for Russia, believing the answers to his identity are there, Kissy does not follow; unknown to Bond, she is pregnant with his child.|$|R

Her {{emotional}} state is usually placid, except when Yume is doing <b>something</b> <b>with</b> someone <b>else</b> without her. She and Yume share an expressive yuri love, even kissing in public occasionally. When it comes to Yume's affections, Yuuki is very territorial, emitting a dangerous aura whenever Yume is doing something fun without her.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Baker, [...] "but"--he {{stopped with}} a hesitating laugh and some little confusion.

I saw your name in it, and I {{gathered}} from your message that you wished to see me here. I sent my note to your hotel--and then went on <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Pray pardon me. Is this a professional consultation? For your own sake, I sincerely hope not!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The show starred Sean McCann as Noah Tomten, {{a former}} old salt, {{who now runs}} an antique shop, the NODDY Shop (this stood for, [...] "Notions, Oddities, Doodads and Delights of Yesterday"). His catchphrases {{included}} [...] "What in tarnation?!" [...] and [...] "Great Neptune's Ghost!", usually whenever he was excited about something. It also starred Jayne Eastwood as his scatter-brained sister, Agatha Flugelschmidt, who runs a hat shop {{next door to the}} Noddy shop. One of her catchphrases included [...] "Oh, pish-posh!", usually whenever she disagreed <b>with</b> <b>something</b> that someone <b>else</b> said.|$|R

Matt Quintal dived, also caught hold of the fish {{with both hands and}} worked his two thumbs deep into its gills. By the process called {{treading}} water, the two soon regained the surface. Sarah Quintal seized Dan McCoy by the hair, Bessy Mills made a grasp at Matt and caught him by the ear, while John Adams made a grab at the fish, got him by the nose, thrust a hand into his mouth, which was wide open <b>with</b> surprise or <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> as well it might be, and caught it by the tongue.|$|R

Washington DC musician and author Ian Svenonius attends Branchage to give a storytelling walking tour across Jersey's 'moon landscape' tidal flatlands. Zoologist and on-line filmmaker Lucy Cooke talks about her work with sloths.

[...] (These words were spoken vacantly, as if her mind was occupied <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> My first impression of her suggested {{that she was a}} weak, good-natured woman, and that she must have originally occupied a station in the humbler ranks of life.) ...|$|E
40|$|Metaphor {{refers to}} {{transfer}} of meaning of an entity to another {{due to the}} similaries between the two entities. By applying metaphorical thinking, one can describe <b>something</b> <b>with</b> reference to <b>something</b> <b>else</b> as there are similar characteristics {{in a particular way}} between the two things. The expression of you’re my sun is derived as the person concerned is regarded as if s/he were the sun that gives light and power in one’s life as the sun does in reality. The new worldview derived by metaphorical thinking indicates creativity where a new idea is derived from limited and conventionally known sources by the engineers, technologists and artists. The newly created idea in turn potentially leads to innovation where the new idea is further developed to process, product or service with economically, socially or culturally added values. In this way, metaphorical thinking is a means of enhancing idea engineering...|$|R
5000|$|Both {{negative}} and constructive criticism have their appropriate uses, but {{often it is}} considered a requirement of criticism that they are combined. Thus, it is often considered that those who find fault <b>with</b> <b>something</b> should also offer an option for putting it right. More generally, any rule for behavior of any kind usually implies both [...] "do's" [...] and [...] "don't s". Doing something usually also implies not doing <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> and, not doing something, often implies doing <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> There is therefore a conscious choice [...] "to do this, or do that", but not {{both at the same}} time.|$|R
5000|$|Caitlin Kittredge {{graduated}} from college {{with a degree in}} English. She has cited Raymond Chandler, Neil Gaiman, and H.P. Lovecraft as inspirations. Kittredge is a fan of film noir, classic pulp novels, and comic books. She describes herself as [...] "a skeptical believer in the <b>Something</b> <b>Else.</b> There's too much strange in this world for me to totally discount the possibility of <b>Something</b> <b>Else</b> being out there. But at the same time, I'm the first person to try and debunk any supernatural stuff that people claim is going on around them. I, personally, had one completely terrifying encounter <b>with</b> <b>something</b> supernatural that I still can't explain…hence my lack of 100% skepticism." ...|$|R
