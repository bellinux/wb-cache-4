40|$|We {{investigated}} if {{calorie restriction}} (CR) preserved skeletal muscle oxidative capacity <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> after accounting for life span extension by CR, and determined if mitochondrial content, mitochondrial DNA integrity, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator- 1 a (PGC- 1 a) were involved. Ad libitum-fed (AL) and CR animals representing young adult, late middle age, and senescence were studied. Whereas citrate synthase and complex IV activities were lower in plantaris and gastrocnemius muscle of young adult CR animals, {{in contrast to}} the 15 %– 40 % decline in senescent AL animals, there was no decline <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> in CR animals. There was no decline in citrate synthase protein in gastrocnemius <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> in either group, suggesting that CR preserves oxidative capacity <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> by protecting mitochondrial function rather than content. This protection was independent of mitochondrial DNA damage between groups. However, there was a slower decline in PGC- 1 a gene expression <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> in CR versus AL animals, suggesting a better maintenance of mitochondrial biogenesis <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> in CR animals.

This {{research}} has been performed to investigate the effect of ageing onto the grain refinement of 82 wt%Cu- 13. 5 wt%Al- 4. 5 wt%Ni- 0. 1 wt % misch metal alloy <b>with</b> <b>ageing</b> temperature and time. The variation of transformation temperature <b>with</b> <b>ageing</b> {{has been found to}} be heavily dependent on ageing time and temperature. In the second reversed transformation cycle, the temperature of Ms point decreases <b>with</b> <b>ageing</b> time at 300, but no variation at 100. The temperature of As point increases <b>with</b> <b>ageing</b> time at both temperatures. After the second reversed transformation cycle, the transformation temperature does not show any significant changes in martensitic phase <b>with</b> <b>ageing,</b> the temperature of Ms point being the same afterwards. Parent phase after ageing appears to show M 18 R and N 2 H martensitic phases depending on the ageing time and temperature.

40|$|Fat {{distribution}} changes <b>with</b> <b>aging.</b> Inherent {{changes in}} fat cell progenitors may contribute because fat cells turn over throughout life. To define mechanisms, gene expression was profiled in preadipocytes cultured from epididymal and perirenal depots of {{young and old}} rats. 8. 4 % of probe sets differed significantly between depots, particularly developmental genes. Only 0. 02 % differed <b>with</b> <b>aging,</b> despite using less stringent criteria than for comparing depots. Twenty-five genes selected based on fold change <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> were analyzed in preadipocytes from additional young, middle-aged, and old animals by polymerase chain reaction. Thirteen changed significantly <b>with</b> <b>aging,</b> 13 among depots, and 9 with both. Genes involved in inflammation, stress, and differentiation changed <b>with</b> <b>aging,</b> as occurs in fat tissue. Age-related changes were greater in perirenal than epididymal preadipocytes, consistent with larger declines in replication and adipogenesis in perirenal preadipocytes. Thus, age-related changes in preadipocyte gene expression differ among depots, potentially contributing to fat redistribution and dysfunction...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases <b>with</b> <b>age.</b> Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E

40|$|Compared to {{chimpanzees}} (Pan troglodytes), {{the onset}} of aging appears to be delayed in the human species. Herein, we studied human-chimpanzee orthologous gene pairs to investigate the selective forces acting on genes associated <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> in different model systems, which allowed us to explore evolutionary hypotheses of aging. Our results show that aging-associated genes tend to be under purifying selection and stronger-than-average functional constraints. We found little evidence of accelerated evolution in aging-associated genes in the hominid or human lineages, and pathways previously related to aging were largely conserved between humans and chimpanzees. In particular, genes associated <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> in non-mammalian model organisms and cellular systems appear to be under stronger functional constraints than those associated <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> in mammals. One gene that might have undergone rapid evolution in hominids is the Werner syndrome gene. Overall, our findings offer novel insights regarding the evolutionary forces acting on genes associated <b>with</b> <b>aging</b> in model systems.
