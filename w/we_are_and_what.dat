2500|$|Vocalist/guitarist Alex Gaskarth {{said the}} EP helped the band gain new fans, {{while at the}} same time {{allowing}} them time to progress musically. Gaskarth also said that the group did not want to [...] "feel pressured or rushed" [...] to make an album. Opting to release the EP instead [...] "made the most sense as far as where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do". To support its release, the group appeared on a number of Warped Tour dates, as well as touring with Amber Pacific. Gaskarth revealed the band was aiming to enter the recording studio in the winter. In December, the group performed a number of shows. At one of these, they played three new tracks: [...] "Let It Roll", [...] "Dear Maria, Count Me In" [...] and [...] "Remembering Sunday".|$|R
50|$|A core of Capps’ {{teaching}} {{was the idea}} that our words have power and that we must change <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> saying <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> thinking.

500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious of who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits...we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves...We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E

In 2009, these three organisations were combined as one department by the University – initially termed ‘The Public Arts’ but later renamed ‘Live at LICA’ – with Matt Fenton overseeing this unification. In August 2015 Live at LICA was rebranded to 'Lancaster Arts at Lancaster University' to avoid confusion with the department of LICA, then director Jamie Eastman stated that; [...] "This new name and logo communicates who we are, where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we’re offering." ...|$|E

[...] Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) has protested against {{the conference in}} Orlando, questioning both its methodology and supposed success. In regards to the conference, Dobson has stated that [...] "Gay activists come with preconceived notions about who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we believe and about the hate that boils from within, which is simply not true. Regardless of what the media might say, Focus on the Family {{has no interest in}} promoting hatred toward homosexuals or anyone else. We also don't wish to deprive them of their basic constitutional rights... The Constitution applies to all of us." [...] Dobson strongly opposes the movement to legitimize same-sex relationships. In his book Bringing Up Boys, Dobson states, [...] "he disorder is not typically 'chosen.' Homosexuals deeply resent being told that they selected this same-sex inclination in pursuit of sexual excitement or some other motive. It is unfair, and I don't blame them for being irritated by that assumption. Who among us would knowingly choose a path that would result in alienation from family, rejection by friends, disdain from the heterosexual world, exposure to sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, and even a shorter lifespan?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where who we are as a congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We want to raise up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We {{want to be in a}} denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving full speed ahead in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they never thought to visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them the wrong idea about who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We want to be in a denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors."

Robot's press contribution has forced us to acknowledge what stammerers <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> but also gave us some lessons free of charge." [...] Although noting that [...] "my generation has read, adored and even pastiched" [...] Alexandru Robot, the same commentator concludes that the Robot's early death gave his creative destiny [...] "a pale and vague virtuality", rendering irrelevant the encouragements Robot had received after his debut from Romanian critics (Călinescu, Eugen Lovinescu). Making reference to the fascination of younger writers in the 1960s, he also argued: [...] "The interwar was sending through him a sample of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> could <b>be,</b> <b>and</b> so retied a string that had been so brutally torn apart". Among the Moldovan authors particularly influenced by Robot's avant-garde writings, and whose contribution resisted communist aesthetics, Igor Ursenco cites Vladimir Beșleagă and Aureliu Busuioc.|$|R
