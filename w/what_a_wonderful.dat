500|$|Merry Christmas boasted {{a variety}} of musical arrangements, sounds and genres. Carey's goal was to provide an album {{that would have a}} [...] "Christmas feel", {{providing}} a mixture of soulful tracks, as well as fun and joyous holiday treats. The song [...] "Jesus, Oh <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Child", was described as an original track that [...] "really took flight". The song was recorded in a church, with many live back-up singers and children playing tambourines and other melodious instruments. The goal was to produce a [...] "real church flavored song", in which Afanasieff played the keyboards and allowed Carey's voice to [...] "cut loose". According to Chris Nickson, Carey's love of gospel music came through on the track, writing, [...] " [...] led the band without pushing herself forward, letting the song develop and work out, trading lines with the chorus until, after the crescendo, the musicians moved into a fast double time to the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{signed with}} Columbia Records in 2007. Columbia {{released}} <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Time, her second holiday collection, in October 2007. [...] "Hold On" [...] was released {{as the lead}} single.|$|E

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>a</b> {{wide and}} <b>wonderful</b> {{prospect}} {{opened up to}} view from this lofty point! Ridge after ridge sloped up to the Wyoming hills, and these in turn raised their bleak, dark heads toward the mountains, looming pale and gray, with caps of snow, in the distance. Out beyond the ridges, indistinct in the glare, stretched an illimitable expanse, gray and dull--that was the prairie-land. An eagle, lord of all he surveyed, sailed round and round in the sky.|$|R
2500|$|Rowling {{has said}} Lockhart {{is the only}} {{character}} she has ever based on a real-life person. Lockhart was inspired by an unrevealed acquaintance who was [...] "even more objectionable than his fictional counterpart" [...] and [...] "used to tell whopping great fibs about his past life, all of them designed to demonstrate <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful,</b> brave and brilliant person he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|The dark {{theme of}} the album was {{balanced}} by [...] "Every Little Thing", which Unterberger describes as a [...] "celebration of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> girl the guy has". McCartney said of the song: [...] "'Every Little Thing', {{like most of the}} stuff I did, was my attempt at the next single... but it became an album filler rather than the great almighty single. It didn't have quite what was required." [...] Musicologist Walter Everett says the chorus' incorporation of [...] "leaden" [...] parallel fifth harmonies, supported by Starr's timpani, was the inspiration for a proto-heavy metal version of the song recorded by the English progressive rock band Yes in 1969.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{was raised}} in the Church of Christ. According to Thompson, his values come from [...] "sitting around the kitchen table" [...] with his parents, and from the Church of Christ. While talking to reporters in South Carolina, Thompson said, [...] "I attend church when I'm in Tennessee. I'm [...] in McLean right now. I don't attend {{regularly}} when I'm up there." [...] On occasion, Thompson attended Vienna Presbyterian Church in Vienna, Virginia. He did not speak much about his religion during his campaign, saying, [...] "Me getting up and talking about <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> person I am and that sort of thing, I'm not comfortable with that, and I don't think it does me any good." ...|$|E
50|$|Soon after graduating, {{he wrote}} {{numerous}} dōjinshi {{and was an}} assistant to numerous manga artists, prior to making his debut as a professional manga artist. In 1986, Tsuruta made his professional debut, authoring his first manga series, the short work, Hiroku te suteki na uchū ja nai ka (a.k.a. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> Big <b>Wonderful</b> Universe It Is), which was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Morning seinen magazine, set {{in a world where}} the land was sinking into water. Tsuruta has cited that the inspiration to this debut work of his came during a train journey from Tokyo to the ocean at Odawara, during which he had seen numerous rice paddies and thought of the possibility of a train line passing through the ocean, after which he wanted to create a work where he could use this image.|$|R

2500|$|In part, {{the tension}} {{resulted}} from the historical coincidence of the first viable African American presidential candidate and the first viable woman candidate, running {{against each other in}} the same nomination race. One South Carolina pastor lamented that he had been waiting all his life for either [...] "first" [...] to happen and said, [...] "I really hate that they had to run {{at the same time in}} the same election. It just makes <b>what</b> should be <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> situation very stressful for folk like me. I never imagined you could have too much of a good thing." [...] After the Clinton-Obama tension on this matter, one Democrat said, [...] "After Iowa, Obama was the post-racial candidate who appealed to all of our better natures. Now he's a black politician, and she's a woman. And it is back to politics as usual." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{this same}} {{hermaphrodite}} specimen of I. quadrivalvis, the two ovigerous lamellæ contained some hundreds of larvæ {{in the first}} stage of development, which were liberated from their enveloping membranes by a touch of a needle: they were about the 16/1000ths of an inch in length, and presented all the usual characters of larvæ at this period. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> truly <b>wonderful</b> assemblage of beings of the same species, but how marvellously unlike in appearance, did this individual hermaphrodite present! We have the numerous, almost globular larvæ, with lateral horns to their carapaces, with their three pair of legs, single eye, probosciformed mouth and long tail:--we have the somewhat larger larvæ in the last stage of development, much compressed, boat-formed, with their two great compound eyes, curious prehensile antennæ, closed rudimentary mouth and six natatory legs so different from those {{in the first stage}}:--we have the two attached males, with their bodies reduced almost to a mouth placed on the summit of a peduncle, with a minute, apparently single eye shining through the integuments, without any carapace or capitulum, and with the thorax as well as the legs or cirri rudimentary and functionless:--lastly, we have the hermaphrodite, with all its complicated organisation, its thorax supporting six pairs of multi-articulated two-armed cirri, and its well-developed capitulum furnished with horny valves, surrounding this wonderful assemblage of beings. Unquestionably, without a rigid examination, these four forms would have been ranked in different families, if not orders, of the articulated kingdom.|$|R
