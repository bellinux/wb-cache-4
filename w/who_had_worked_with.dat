Andrew Ellicott, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> L'Enfant surveying the city, was then tasked with completing the design. Though Ellicott made revisions to the original plans, including changes to some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.|$|E

5|$|Tommy Lee Jones was {{originally}} considered for another role that was ultimately {{cut from the}} film and Stone who decided to cast him as Shaw. In preparation for the film, Jones interviewed Garrison on three different occasions and talked to others <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Shaw and knew him.|$|E
5|$|Burges's team of {{craftsmen}} at Castell Coch {{included many}} <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> him at Cardiff Castle and elsewhere. John Chapple, his office manager, designed {{most of the}} furnishings and furniture, and William Frame acted as clerk of works. Horatio Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, painting extensive murals at the castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls, together with another long-time collaborator, the Italian sculptor Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
5|$|During the transition, Agnew hired a staff, {{choosing}} several aides <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> him as county {{executive and}} as governor.

5|$|Merwin {{succeeded in}} making Startling popular and successful, and the {{bimonthly}} schedule was resumed in 1947. At the start of 1952 Startling switched to a monthly schedule; this was unusual in that Startling was notionally junior to Thrilling Wonder, its sister magazine, which remained bimonthly. Merwin left shortly before this switch, in order {{to spend more time}} on his own writing. He was replaced by Samuel Mines, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Standard's Western magazines, though he was a science fiction aficionado.|$|E
5|$|Simon {{has stated}} that he {{originally}} set out to create a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective and public school teacher <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Simon on projects including The Corner (2000). Burns, when working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using surveillance technology, had often been frustrated by the bureaucracy of the Baltimore Police Department; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian {{sociologist}} Umar Kayam, who {{had served}} on the Jakarta Art Council with Djajakusuma, described the director as highly disciplined. Biran described him as having a fiery temper which could be triggered suddenly, yet quick to calm when the trigger was removed; this sentiment was echoed by several people <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Djajakusuma. Coverage in the film magazine Djaja described him as hardworking and highly dedicated to his craft, {{to the point of}} forsaking romantic relationships.|$|E

5|$|The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was Lang's second {{film for}} the company Nero-Film and {{producer}} Seymour Nebenzal. The film {{would be the last}} film collaboration between Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Lang on all his directorial efforts since Destiny. Lang's relationship with von Harbou was ending and the two would file divorce papers during 1933. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner returned to work with Lang. Their film credits together include M, Spies and Destiny.|$|E
5|$|The title Leave Home {{refers to}} the Ramones leaving New York City to go on tour around the world. The album cover was {{designed}} by Moshe Brakha, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> the Rolling Stones to yield the Black and Blue (1976) cover art, and would later work with artists like Devo and Iron Maiden. The back cover of the album was a drawing of a bald eagle by graphic designer Arturo Vega. The image would soon become the band's logo.|$|E
5|$|Coffin died on September 16, 1877 {{at around}} 2:30p.m. {{at his home}} in Avondale, Ohio. His funeral was held at the Friends Meeting House of Cincinnati. The Cincinnati Daily Gazette {{reported}} that the crowd was too large to be accommodated indoors; hundreds had to remain outside. Four of Coffin's eight pallbearers were free blacks <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> him on the Underground Railroad. Coffin was interred in Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery in an unmarked grave. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who died four years later on May 22, 1881, is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery as well.|$|E

5|$|Cory {{served as}} the film's main director, as he had more {{experience}} with animation, comedy, and children's entertainment, while Todd served as co-director. Montgomery and Stutzman were joined by Disney animation veteran David Lovegren as producers on the film, and Cory's and Todd's sister Katie Hooten joined as an associate producer. Tony Leech, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> the Edwards brothers on Chillicothe, was initially hired as an editor, but gained story input as well. He eventually proved to be so valuable to the production that {{he was given a}} role as co-director.|$|E
5|$|For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out {{to recruit}} some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada. The first was George Volkoff at the University of British Columbia, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Robert Oppenheimer on the physics of neutron stars. They also tried to recruit Harry Thode from McMaster University, but found that Harold Urey from the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories was also {{interested}} in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with mass spectrography, and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J. Carson Mark, Phil Wallace and Leo Yaffe.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} do justice to the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided to build their own studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} for the series {{originated}} in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, and turned to Tom Kenny, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!, but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.|$|E
