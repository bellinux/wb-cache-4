5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of the colossal heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E

25|$|On January 6, the 3rd Army {{headquarters}} {{found itself}} under fire. Hafiz Hakki Pasha ordered a total retreat. On January 7, the remaining forces began their march towards Erzurum. The resulting Battle of Sarikamish became a stunning defeat. Only 10% of the Army managed to retreat {{back to its}} starting position. After this, Enver gave up command. The Armenian volunteer units <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> a factor in their defeat, as they challenged the Ottoman operations during critical times, and his experience {{may have been one}} of the catalysts that led the Three pashas, of which one was Enver, to their decision to conduct the Armenian Genocide only a few months later. Enver blamed this defeat on Armenians living in the region actively siding with the Russians after his return to Constantinople.|$|E

25|$|The Palas were {{patrons of}} Mahayana Buddhism. A few sources written much after Gopala's death mention {{him as a}} Buddhist, {{but it is not}} known if this is true. The {{subsequent}} Pala kings <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> Buddhists. Taranatha states that Gopala was a staunch Buddhist, who had built the famous monastery at Odantapuri. Dharmapala made the Buddhist philosopher Haribhadra his spiritual preceptor. He established the Vikramashila monastery and the Somapura Mahavihara. Taranatha also credits him with establishing 50 religious institutions and patronising the Buddhist author Hariibhadra. Devapala restored and enlarged the structures at Somapura Mahavihara, which also features several themes from the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. Mahipala I also ordered construction and repairs of several sacred structures at Saranath, Nalanda and Bodh Gaya. The Mahipala geet ("songs of Mahipala"), a set of folk songs about him, are still popular in the rural areas of Bengal.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1744 Edwards, in his sermons on Religious Affections, had plainly intimated his dislike of this practice. In the same year, he had {{published}} in a church meeting the names of certain young people, members of the church, who were suspected of reading improper books, and also {{the names of those}} who were to be called as witnesses in the case. It has often been reported that the witnesses and accused were not distinguished on this list, and so the entire congregation was in an uproar. However, Patricia Tracy's research has cast doubt on this version of the events, noting that in the list he read from, the names <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> distinguished. Those involved were eventually disciplined for disrespect to the investigators rather than for the original incident. In any case, the incident further deteriorated the relationship between Edwards and the congregation.|$|E
25|$|There was {{disagreement}} over this move between the navy's admirals (headed by Alfred von Tirpitz) and Bethman-Hollweg. Backed by Army Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn, Kaiser Wilhelm II endorsed the Chancellor's solution, and Tirpitz and the Admiralty backed down. The German restriction order of 9 September 1915 stated that attacks were only allowed on ships that <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> British, while neutral ships {{were to be}} treated under the Prize Law rules, and no attacks on passenger liners were to be permitted at all. The war situation demanded {{that there could be}} no possibility of orders being misinterpreted, and on 18 September Henning von Holtzendorff, the new head of the German Admiralty, issued a secret order: all U-boats operating in the English Channel and off the west coast of the United Kingdom were recalled, and the U-boat war would continue only in the North sea, where it would be conducted under the Prize Law rules.|$|E

25|$|This kind {{of damage}} made life in Fort Jackson a misery when {{combined}} with constant flooding from high water within the fort. The crew could be safe from mortar fragments and falling debris only within the dank and partially flooded casemates. Lack of shelter, food, blankets, sleeping quarters, drinkable water, along with the depressing effects of days of heavy, unanswered shelling were hard to bear. When combined with sickness and the ever-present corrosive fear, conditions <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> a drain on morale. These factors contributed to the mutiny of the Fort Jackson garrison on April 28. This mutiny began a subsequent collapse of resistance downriver from the city. Fort St. Phillips was also surrendered, the CSS Louisiana blown up and even the Confederate fleet on Lake Pontchartrain was destroyed to avoid capture. The general collapse of morale began with the mutiny and greatly simplified the occupation of New Orleans by the Union navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of match scorecards became common from the 1772 season and three 1772 cards have survived. Small played {{in all three}} matches and was easily the season's highest runscorer with 213 in his six innings. The only other player to exceed 100 was William Yalden who made 136, also in six innings. In the first match of the season, Small scored 78 for Hampshire against All-England out of a team total of 146. In the second innings, he scored 34 out of 79 and his team won by 53 runs, an illustration of his enormous value to Hampshire. His innings of 78 was the highest individual score definitely recorded to that time. Although higher scores such as Richard Newland's 88 in 1745 and Small's own 140-plus in 1768 have been mentioned in the sources, {{it is not clear}} if those <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> made in one innings or if they were match totals. Small's 78 is therefore the startpoint of the progressive world record for the highest individual innings in senior cricket.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman 3rd Army {{started with}} 118,000 {{fighting}} men. It {{was reduced to}} 42,000 effective soldiers in January 1915, with an additional 12,000 in the Erzurum fortress garrison. 25,000 Turkish troops had become casualties even before the battle started, 30,000 frozen bodies were found by the Russians after the battle, and the entire Third Army was reduced {{to no more than}} 12,500 men. There are conflicting figures for Ottoman casualties, though {{it is clear that the}} Ottoman casualties <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> huge, and the military hospitals of the Erzurum area were overflowed with wounded and sick. Sources do not agree on what should be included in the final sum. The Turkish official history and medical records states 23,000 KIA, 10,000 died in hospitals, 7,000 prisoners, 10,000 seriously wounded, for some 50,000 total irrecoverable casualties. Another estimate given by the German Commandant Larcher is 90,000 dead and 40,000–50,000 captured, which is often repeated in modern recountings of the battle. However, such figures are considered unreliable, both because they exceed the total strength of the entire Third Army and because the actual Chief of Staff of the Third Army (also a German), Lieutenant Colonel Guse, gave casualties as 37,000 dead and 7,000 missing based on operational returns. Artillery loses were 12 field artillery pieces and 50 mountain artillery.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{grape vines}} planted in Washington State were at Fort Vancouver in 1825 by traders {{working for the}} Hudson's Bay Company {{but it is not}} known for sure whether wine was ever produced from these plantings. The first people who <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> known to produce wine were German and Italian immigrants who planted their wine grapes in Washington during the 1860s and 1870s. Washington {{was one of the first}} states to usher in the start of Prohibition, going dry in 1917 and shutting down most of the state's wine production. Some scattered grape growers stayed afloat during this period selling grapes to home winemakers but nearly all the state's commercial wines went out of business. Following the end of Prohibition, Washington's fledgling wine industry was based primarily on fortified sweet wine production made from the Vitis Labrusca variety Concord. The Nawico and Pommerelle wineries were the most widely recognized producers, making millions of gallons each year of sweet jug wine made from Concord and other varieties. In the 1950s, the planting of Vitis vinifera saw an increase spearheaded, in part, by the work of Dr. Walter Clore and Washington State University which conducted a series of trials on which grape vines could produce the best wine in various soils and climates of Washington.|$|E
25|$|The {{two parts}} of town were divided into encomiendas for a very short time, but in 1537 the {{entirety}} would be declared a city by the Spanish Crown, receiving its coat of arms in 1540. However, {{there is evidence that}} the division of the city was recognized since the early colonial period. The Franciscans established themselves in San Pedro first, with the San Gabriel monastery because this was the power center of the city and at first the monks were not sufficient to be spread out around the entire city. This early emphasis on the San Pedro side, along with the settling of the Spanish population almost exclusively here, resulted in this side of the city becoming mixed race (mestizo) early in the colonial era. Evidence of political distinctions can be found as early as 1548, but in 1714, the two halves <b>were</b> <b>definitely</b> separated when San Andrés was made an Indian Republic. This separation would cause political and economic problems between the two halves of the city, but still coexisting in matters of religion. The two municipalities were established by 1861. However, the two halves never completely split and the two municipalities formed a partial union called the Distrito Cholula de Rivadavia in 1895, with the appendage in honor of Bernardino de Rivadavia. As such, San Pedro is part of what is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Americas.|$|E
