25|$|In the 1940s, Frische also {{directed}} {{several of her}} own stories including Kriminalassistant Bloch (Detective Bloch), En ny dag gryr (A New Day Dawns) and Så mødes vi hos Tove (<b>We</b> <b>Meet</b> at Tove's). She also performed on screen {{as well as in}} Cabaret theater shows. In the 1940s, Frische also popularized the comedy character of Snøvle-Sofie which she performed for a weekly radio program. The character was often transferred to Frische's films as a whining, but tough gossip, such as the surly housemaid she played in <b>We</b> <b>Meet</b> at Tove's.|$|E

25|$|But {{different}} writers present different {{images and}} ideas. The Synoptic Gospels (in {{spite of their}} many differences) introduce several important ideas, {{two of which are}} related to Greco-Judaic notions of knowledge/gnosis by virtue of being mental acts: purity of heart, in which we will to see in God's light; and repentance, which involves allowing God to judge and then transform us. Another key idea presented by the Synoptics is the desert, which is used {{as a metaphor for the}} place where <b>we</b> <b>meet</b> God in the poverty of our spirit.|$|E
25|$|In their imaginative use of {{traditional}} iconography the artists {{put us in}} touch with a wealth of theological tradition that had developed over centuries and had marked with its symbols the meditative road into the depth dimension. Behind the pictures in these volumes <b>we</b> <b>meet</b> not only the theology of an individual Christian but also a theology expressive of the collective witness of many generations who drew their strength from the contemplation of the realities to which their symbols pointed. There is nothing that could prevent a miniature from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves from becoming an effective help of Christian meditation today.|$|E
25|$|The caricatures provide {{not only}} {{insights}} into the public perception of Darwin's evolutionary theory but also played an essential part in its dissemination and popularisation. During the 1860s and 1870s the kinship between ape and man was doubted more frequently than in later decades where this idea received a wider acceptance. Today <b>we</b> <b>meet</b> the evolutionary theory on T-shirts {{in the form of}} graphic arts. Quite often, it is the lifestyle of modern man that is ridiculed. The monkey is now only depicted as the underdeveloped stage of the human and does not function as the caricature of human behaviour any more. Likewise, Darwin has lost his prominent position as a motif for caricatures.|$|E

25|$|It {{is through}} Vandiyathevan that <b>we</b> <b>meet</b> {{most of the}} {{characters}} in the novel such as Arulmozhivarman, the prince whom all the people loved, and Periya Pazhavetturayar, the chancellor who married Nandhini (the main conspirator) when he was sixty. During his youth, Aditya Karikalan {{had fallen in love with}} Nandhini, but she turned vengeful after Aditya Karikalan killed Veerapandyan (who was probably her lover. It was a confusion which revolves in the story, but later in the story it was revealed as her father) and vowed to destroy the Chola dynasty. We also meet Kundavai Devi, who after hearing the news of the conspiracy sends Vandiyathevan to Sri Lanka to give a message to Arulmozhivarman to come back immediately.|$|E
25|$|Episode one, 'Tony', is an {{ensemble}} piece that introduces {{the characters and}} the format. <b>We</b> <b>meet</b> the effortlessly attractive, popular and intelligent Tony as he arranges for his friends to attend a party held by upper-class girl Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat). The second episode, 'Cassie', focuses on Cassie's final visit to an eating disorder clinic {{under the supervision of}} Abigail's mother Dr Stock. In her day-to-day life, she hallucinates messages instructing her to eat which seem to come from Sid, for whom she develops feelings. Jal's episode follows her attempt to win BBC Young Musician of the Year, and her strained relationship with her famous musician father. When a drug dealer 'Mad Twatter' smashes her clarinet as pay back for Sid not giving him money for drugs he bought, Jal's father sees to it he will not bother the gang again. In 'Chris', Chris' mother abandons him, leaving £1,000 in cash. He blows the money on a party, and is eventually helped into temporary student accommodation by his psychology teacher, Angie (Siwan Morris). Episode five, 'Sid', shows Sid's struggle with his parents' break-up while Tony organises a scheme to set him up with Michelle. A heartbroken and fragile Cassie attempts suicide by drug overdose.|$|E
