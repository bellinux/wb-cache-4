5|$|Holmenkolbanen had {{built-up}} large debts {{in building}} the underground section to Nationaltheatret, including large amounts of compensation to house-owners <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> buildings damaged during construction. To finance their debt, the Akersbanerne-owned Smestad Line was transferred to Holmenkolbanen on 16 November 1933, with Akersbanerene taking over the majority of shares in Holmenkolbanen. The latter remained listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. From 4 January 1937, Bærumsbanen took over the operation of trams on the Østensjø Line, though the ownership of the line remained with Akersbanerne. Oslo Sporveier started operating trolleybus lines from 1939. On 1 October 1944, Oslo Sporveier bought Bærumsbanen and took over {{the operation of the}} Lillaker and Østensjø Lines. On 1 January 1948, the municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged, and on 31 May 1949, the two municipally-owned companies, Oslo Sporveier and Akersbanerne, merged, taking the name of Oslo Sporveier. The following year, Oslo Sporveier took over Ekebergbanen. In 1975, Oslo Sporveier bought all {{but a few of the}} shares in Holmenkolbanen, and at the same time took over operation of all the suburban lines.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1958, Nasser formed a {{tripartite}} committee consisting of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and Salah Bitar to oversee developments in Syria. By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> own ideas about how Syria should be run. He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected {{to the introduction of}} Egyptian agricultural reform in Syria, as well as communists. Following the Lebanese election of Fuad Chehab in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably. On 25 March 1959, Chehab and Nasser met at the Lebanese–Syrian border and compromised on an end to the Lebanese crisis.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Swabian League had {{completed}} its recruitment, and undertook {{a raid on}} Dornach on March 22, but suffered a defeat against numerically inferior Swiss troops {{in the battle of}} Bruderholz that same evening. In early April, both sides raided each other's territories along the Rhine; the Swiss conquered the villages of Hallau and Neunkirch in the Klettgau west of Schaffhausen. A larger attack of the Swabian League took place on April 11, 1499: the Swabian troops occupied and plundered some villages on the southern shore of Lake Constance, just south of Constance. The expedition ended in a shameful defeat and open flight when the Swiss soldiers, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> main camp just a few miles south at Schwaderloh, arrived and met the Swabians in the battle of Schwaderloh. The Swabians lost more than 1,000 soldiers; 130 from the city of Constance alone; and the Swiss captured their heavy equipment, including their artillery.|$|E
5|$|Most slaves {{worked as}} {{plantation}} laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most {{small and medium-sized}} farms employed free workers. Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> own slaves. While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of slaves {{who appeared to be}} of European descent—the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations between male slave owners and their female mulatto slaves. Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. Slaves were regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed slaves were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E
5|$|Evanton is {{in close}} {{proximity}} to the site of Balconie Castle, an old seat of the Mormaers and Earls of Ross. By the early modern period, the area was dominated by the Munros of Foulis (Foghlais), <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> Foulis Castle just a few kilometres away. Indeed, the latter began to bury their family at Kiltearn after 1588. The Cille place-name in Kiltearn tells us {{that there had been a}} very ancient Gaelic church near Evanton, like all Cille place-names, founded before 800. The current Gaelic name Cill Tighearna ("Church of the Lord") is probably a corruption of an older form, both because the name formation is unusual in being dedicated to the Lord Himself, and because the form given in 1227 is Kiltierny, suggesting some kind of connection to Tigernach in Ireland. Other suggestions have included a dedication to St Ternan. The church lay next to the lordly residence of Balconie. By the later Middle Ages, Balconie was one of the five lordships of Ross, as well as an individual seat of the Earls of Ross. Place-name evidence suggests that the site may once have been a Pictish residence. A charter granted by Aodh, Earl of Ross in 1281 records the name Petkenny, but a charter of 1333 refers to a location called Balkenny. The development of the name Pitlochry, where Pictish Pit- is replaced by Gaelic Baile, suggests the names are the same, but the great early twentieth century toponymist William J. Watson was doubftful.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch East India Company {{had founded}} the Cape Colony on the {{southern}} tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large Afrikaner (or Boer) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the Flanders Campaign. British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the Orange Free State (1854–1902). In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two Boer Republics following the Second Boer War (1899–1902).|$|E
5|$|Robert Hartwell {{notes that}} in the Northern Song dynasty there were two types of elites who {{dominated}} the civil service: a founding elite and a professional elite. The founding elite consisted of the North China military governors of the 10th century, their associates, personal staffs, and bureaucrats who {{had served in the}} capitals of the administrations of the previous Five Dynasties. The professional bureaucracy consisted of elite families who had established residence in Kaifeng or subordinate capitals, claimed prestigious clan ancestry, had intermarried with other prominent families, had members in higher offices over generations, and periodically dominated Song government until the 12th century. The prominent families of this professional elite accounted for 18 of the 11th century chancellors, the highest official post. From 960 to 986, the founding military elite from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei represented 46% of fiscal offices, people from districts in Songzhou—the military governorship of the founding emperor—represented 22% of fiscal offices, and those from Kaifeng and Luoyang filled 13% of fiscal posts. In the same period, the founding elite and professional elite filled over 90% of policy-making positions. However, after 983, when the south had been conquered and consolidated into the empire, a semi-hereditary professional elite gradually replaced the founding elite. After 1086 not a single family of the founding elite had a member in either policy-making or financial positions. Between 998 and 1085, the 35 most important families of the professional elite represented only 5% of the families that had members in policy-making offices, yet they disproportionately held 23% of these positions. By the late 11th century the professional elite began to break apart as a distinguishable status group aiming for civil service. They were replaced by a multitude of local gentry lineages <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> children pursue a slew of different professions other than official careers. Hartwell states that this shift of power {{was the result of the}} professional elite's lineage strategies being undermined by the rise of factional partisan politics in the latter half of the 11th century.|$|E

25|$|Although {{opinions}} differ, others {{suggest that}} sexual activity {{is an essential}} part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex. Sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction. In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity according to one particular research study. In a rural upstate New York community, a cross-sectional study of teenagers was completed in 2008 and 2009. Teenagers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17. Furthermore, teenagers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.|$|E
