40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of e-waste in a landfill can release {{persistent organic pollutants}} POPs including polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs into the environment. PCBs are a family of more than 200 chemical compounds congeners each of which consists of two benzene rings and one to ten chlorine atoms. This study investigated use of water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes for phytoremediation of landfill leachate <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> <b>PCB.</b> Landfill leachate was simulated in the laboratory by spiking water samples with PCB to obtain concentrations of 5 10 and 15 amp 956 gL which were in one to two orders of magnitude above the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA limit of 0. 5 amp 956 gL or 0. 5 ppb. Water hyacinth plants were grown in 2 L samples of the PCB spiked water for 15 days and evaluated for tolerance and bioaccumulation of PCB. Phytoremediation of PCB spiked water by the plants was evaluated by measuring the change in concentration of PCB. The plants tolerated PCB concentrations {{in the range of}} 5 to 15 amp 956 gL without depicting any serious adverse effect except for change in root color and an initial wilting of peripheral leaves. Water hyacinth reduced the concentration of PCBs in the leachate over 15 days from 15 to 0. 42 amp 956 gL for the 15 amp 956 gL initial concentration sample and to below the GCMS detection limit of 0. 142 amp 956 gL for the 10 and 5 ugL initial concentration samples. Bioaccumulation of PCB in the plant tissue was evaluated through solid phase extraction and testing of samples for PCB with GCMS. Bioaccumulation of PCBs at a concentration of 0. 179 amp 956 gg was observed in the water hyacinth roots for the 15 amp 956 gL sample but none was detected for the lower initial PCB concentration and shoots. The study demonstrated potential of water hyacinth plants in phytoremediation of PCBs in e-waste leachate...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple method was {{developed}} for screening polychlorinated biphenyls in transformer oil. The method is based on liquid-liquid extraction in methanol and subsequent direct gas chromatography-mass spectrometric determination. The extent of methanol polarity allows to extract the PCBs, co-extracting a minimum amount of the apolar oil components, thus avoiding the time-consuming steps involving in sample preparation. Since the regulation established internationally for <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> is 50 mg kg- 1, the method rapidly determines whether the transformer oil is PCBs-contaminated or not. In order to reach the best conditions for extraction a multivariate optimization was carried out considering two significant variables: volume of methanol and extraction time. Under optimum conditions, recoveries of Aroclor 1256 and Aroclor 1260 were between 80 and 100 %, and precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, was from 2 to 4 %. The method was applied to real samples polluted with PCBs...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) air {{concentrations}} remain surprisingly high in parts of Africa and Asia. These are regions where PCBs were never extensively used, but which are implicated as recipients of obsolete products and <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> and other industrial organic contaminants, such as halogenated flame retardants (HFRs). We hypothesize {{that there may be}} different trends in emissions across the globe, whereby emissions of some industrial organic contaminants may be decreasing faster in former use regions (due to emission reductions combined with uncontrolled export), at the expense of regions receiving these substances as obsolete products and wastes. We conclude that the potential for detrimental effects on the environment and human health due to long-range transport by air, water, or wastes should be of equal concern when managing and regulating industrial organic contaminants. This calls for a better integration of life-cycle approaches in the management and regulation of industrial organic contaminants in order to protect environmental and human health on a global scale. Yet, little remains known about the amounts of industrial organic contaminants exported outside former use regions as different types of wastes because of the often illicit nature of these operations...|$|R
40|$|This {{initial report}} is being {{submitted}} pursuant to Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) {section} 761. 75 (c) to request authorization {{to allow the}} disposal of transuranic (TRU) <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (<b>PCBs)</b> which are duly regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Approval of this initial report will not affect the disposal of TRU or TRU mixed wastes that do not <b>contain</b> <b>PCBs.</b> This initial report also demonstrates how the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) meets or exceeds the technical standards for a Chemical Waste Landfill. Approval of this request will allow the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to dispose of approximately 88, 000 cubic feet (ft 3) (2, 500 cubic meters [m 3]) of TRU <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs</b> subject to regulation under the TSCA. This approval will include only those PCB/TRU wastes, which the TSCA regulations allow for disposal of the PCB component in municipal solid waste facilities or chemical waste landfills (e. g., PCB remediation waste, PC B articles, and bulk PCB product waste). Disposal of TRU waste by the DOE is congressionally mandated in Public Law 102 - 579 (as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Pub. L. 104 - 201, {{referred to as the}} WIPP Land Withdrawal Act [LWA]). Portions of the TRU <b>waste</b> inventory <b>contain</b> hazardous <b>waste</b> constituents regulated under 40 CFR Parts 260 through 279, and/or PCBs and PCB Items regulated under 40 CFR Part 761. Therefore, the DOE TRU waste program must address the disposal requirements for these hazardous waste constituents and PCBs. To facilitate the disposal of TRU <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> hazardous <b>waste</b> constituents, the owner/operators received a Hazardous Waste Facility Permit (HWFP) from the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) on October 27, 1999. The permit allows the disposal of TRU wastes subject to hazardous waste disposal requirements (TRU mixed waste). Informational copies of this permit and other referenced documents are available from the WIPP website. To facilitate the disposal of TRU <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>PCBs,</b> the owner/operators are hereby submitting this initial report containing information required pursuant to the Chemical Waste Landfill Approval requirements in 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 (c). Although WIPP is defined as a miscellaneous unit and not a landfill by the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act, WIPP meets or exceeds all applicable technical standards for chemical waste landfills by virtue of its design and programs as indicated in the Engineering Report (Attachment B). The layout of this initial report is consistent with requirements (i. e., Sections 2. 0 through 12. 0 following the sequence of 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [c][i] -[ix] with sections added to discuss the Contingency and Training Plans; and Attachment B of this initial report addresses the requirements of 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [b][1] through [9] in this order). This initial report includes a description of three proposed changes that will be subject to ''conditional approval. '' The first will allow the disposal of remote-handled (RH) PCB/TRU waste at WIPP. The second will allow the establishment of a central confirmation facility at WIPP. The third will allow for an increase in contact-handled Working Copy Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Initial Report for PCB Disposal Authorization DOE/WIPP 02 - 3196 (CH) waste storage capacities. These proposed changes are discussed further in Section 3. 3 of this initial report. ''Conditional approval'' of these requests would allow these activities at WIPP contingent upon: - Approval of the HWFP modification (NMED) and Compliance Certification Application (CCA) change request (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]) - Inspection of facility prior to implementing the change (if deemed necessary by the EPA) - Written approval from the EPA This initial report also includes the following three requests for waivers to the technical requirements for Chemical Waste Landfills pursuant to 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 (c) (4) : - Hydrologic Conditions (40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [b][3]) - Monitoring Systems (40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [b][6]) - Leachate Collection (40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [b][7]) The details explaining the purpose and scope of these waivers are addressed by Attachment B to this initial report...|$|R

40|$|The waste {{management}} and environmental compliance group (NMT- 7) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has initiated {{a project to}} build a computer-based system for tracking inventory, storage and disposal information for hazardous and radioactive waste and contaminated byproducts. This project, the Waste Inventory Tracking System (WITS), will initially be used in TA- 55 (which includes the Los Alamos National Laboratory Plutonium Facility) and the Chemical and Metallurgy Research (CMR) building where wastes are generated. The system handles numerous waste types with variation in size, disposal method, and hazard classification including: low level waste such as room trash (compactable waste), SEG waste (non-compactable), and over-sized waste, mixed waste, hazardous and chemical waste, universal <b>waste,</b> and <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> asbestos and <b>PCB's.</b> WITS {{is designed to provide}} up-to-date location, status, content information, radioactivity analyses, and other inventory information for every waste item and container managed by NMT- 7. The system will support comprehensive reporting capabilities and cradle-to-grave audit trails. WITS is intended to facilitate handling of waste by NMT- 7 staff to help minimize waste disposal costs, ensure compliance with applicable regulations, and standardize {{waste management}} methodologies and practices. This paper compares current management practices with revised methodologies supported by WITS. It shows how automating inventory tracking helps achieve these goals...|$|R

40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) must manage <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (<b>PCBs)</b> in {{accordance}} with Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requirements and as prescribed in a Federal Facilities Compliance Agreement (FFCA) between DOE and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). PCB-containing wastes are currently stored in the PORTS process buildings where they are generated. DOE proposes to modify and expand the Waste Accountability facility (X- 7725 A) at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS), Piketon, Ohio, to provide a central storage location for these wastes. The proposed action is needed to eliminate the fire and safety hazards presented by the wastes. In this EA, DOE considers four alternatives: (1) no action, which requires storing wastes in limited storage areas in existing facilities; (2) modifying and expanding the X- 7725 A waste accountability facility; (3) constructing a new PCB waste storage building; and (4) shipping PCB wastes to the K- 25 TSCA incinerator. If no action is taken, PCB-contaminated {{would continue to be}} stored in Bldgs X- 326, X- 330, and X- 333. As TSCA cleanup activities continue, the quantity of stored waste would increase, which would subsequently cause congestion in the three process buildings and increase fire and safety hazards.

In the UK, for example, it is estimated that over 90 % of PCB emissions arise from leaks from transformers and capacitors and from fragmentising operations (APARG, 1995).
