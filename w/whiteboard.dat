The idea was originally drawn onto a <b>whiteboard,</b> after the drawing remained in the developer's office for a few days it was decided that it would be the next project undertaken by the team. Off-Road Velociraptor Safari received positive reviews from gaming websites for its macabre humor and gameplay, though it was noted that the game had not been fully optimized on release, causing the game to run slowly on less modern machines.|$|E

40|$|After {{many weeks}} of {{completing}} preliminary searches, I decided to research Interactive <b>whiteboards.</b> I {{have always been}} interested in classroom technology. This interest recently increased since I had an opportunity to “play around ” with a SMART board in a technology class I took this summer. This experience along with my curiosity to learn more about Interactive <b>whiteboards</b> in hopes of creating a presentation to convince the leadership in my school to purchase Interactive <b>whiteboards</b> for classroom use are the major reasons that led me to pursue Interactive <b>whiteboards</b> as my research topic. As I began to search, I quickly found that Interactive <b>whiteboards</b> can yield a variety of search results. Therefore, I decided to specifically focus on the effects Interactive <b>whiteboards</b> have on student motivation in the learning process. I chose to address this particular issue because I feel that it would be major player in the leadership’s decision {{as to whether or not}} the boards would be purchased. It is my hope that through creating a compilation of a variety of research-based articles showing how Interactive <b>whiteboards</b> affect student motivation in the learning process, my school’...|$|R
5|$|The team {{employs the}} {{differential}} diagnosis method, listing possible etiologies on a <b>whiteboard,</b> then eliminating most of them, usually {{because one of the}} team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out. Typically, the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless; this usually causes further complications, but—as the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidence—eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly. House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character. Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.|$|E

40|$|Although keeping {{patients}} informed {{is a part}} {{of quality}} hospital care, inpatients often report they are not well informed. The authors placed <b>whiteboards</b> in each patient room on medicine wards in their hospital and asked nurses and physicians to use them to improve communication with inpatients. The authors then examined the effect of these <b>whiteboards</b> by comparing satisfaction with communication of patients discharged from medical wards before and after <b>whiteboards</b> were placed to satisfaction with communication of patients from surgical wards that did not have <b>whiteboards.</b> Patient satisfaction scores (0 - 100 scale) with communication improved significantly on medicine wards: nurse communication (+ 6. 4, P <. 001), physician communication (+ 4. 0, P =. 04), and involvement in decision making (+ 6. 3, P =. 002). Patient satisfaction scores did not change significantly on surgical wards.

40|$|Abstract. Many active {{learning}} based physics courses use <b>whiteboards</b> as {{a space for}} groups to respond to prompts based on short lab activities, problem solving, or inquiry-oriented activities. <b>Whiteboards</b> are volatile; once erased, the material is lost. Tablet PCs and software such as Ubiquitous Presenter {{can be used as}} digital <b>whiteboards</b> in {{active learning}} classes. This enables automatic capture and archiving of student work for online review by students, instructors, and researchers. We studied the use of digital <b>whiteboards</b> in an active-learning introductory physics course at California State University, San Marcos. In this paper we examine the archival features of digital whiteboards’, and characterize the use of these features by students and instructors, and explore possible uses for researchers and curriculum developers...|$|R

This paper provides a preliminary {{review of the}} current state of evidence for the effect of electronic <b>whiteboards</b> on care processes and patient outcomes. A literature search was performed for the dates 1996 to 2014 on MEDLINE, EMBASE, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and the ACM Digital Library. Thirteen papers, describing 11 studies, meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The majority of studies took place in the Emergency Department. While studies looked at the impact of electronic <b>whiteboards</b> on the process of care, there is an absence of evidence concerning impact on patient outcomes. There is a need for robust research measuring the impact of electronic <b>whiteboards</b> on inpatient care...|$|R

25|$|A <b>whiteboard</b> grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a {{television}} show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is bad. They try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope that all this will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E

The tool makes the writings tidy by using the chunks in the character level and replays efficiently the writing processes by using the chunks in the sentence level. ...|$|R
