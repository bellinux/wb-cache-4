25|$|Heidegger himself, who is {{supposed}} to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why he left it unfinished.|$|E
25|$|Taken together, {{proponents of}} {{reconciliation}} ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination {{of a large}} percentage of the earth's area as a sign that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely. For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic fertilizer is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use. Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable socio-ecological system and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.|$|E
