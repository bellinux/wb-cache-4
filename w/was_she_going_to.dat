6000|$|Not {{a muscle}} of the man's frame moved, and yet his large heart beat fast in his deep chest. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell him? Was {{irremediable}} mischief done? ...|$|E
6000|$|Gyp, who {{was sitting}} at her bureau, seemed to be adding up the counterfoils in her cheque-book. She did not turn round, and Fiorsen paused. How <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> receive him? ...|$|E
60|$|He went beside her, {{his soul}} clenched, his body unsatisfied. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make this easy triumph over him? For him, there was now no self-bliss, only pain and {{confused}} anger.|$|E
5000|$|As her parents, we {{know how}} <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> <b>She's</b> not hard on herself; she's just always looking to get better. We go to the games now and we’re excited. Like, ‘What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?’ That's the fun part of it: What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? Horace Pugh, father ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Amy, what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] asked Mrs. March, well {{pleased at}} Laurie's {{decision}} {{and the energy}} with which he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so {{very glad}} to hear it," [...] said Vogelstein, who decidedly, for his career, had promise. [...] "And <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She said: [...] "Poor face!" [...] then {{covered her}} own. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cry, and torture him still more? But, instead, she only murmured: [...] "But you HAVE reached me!" [...] swayed towards him, {{and put her}} lips to his.|$|E
60|$|As I {{approached}} her, I {{happened to}} be putting on my gloves. She stopped me; and, taking my right arm, lifted my hand toward her face. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kiss it? or to bite it? Neither. She smelt it like a dog--and dropped it again with a hoarse chuckling laugh.|$|E
60|$|Ursula's heart sank. Everybody {{seemed so}} cocksure and so bossy. How <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{get on with}} such jolty, jerky, bossy people? And Miss Harby had not spoken a word to {{the man at the}} table. She simply ignored him. Ursula felt the callous crude rudeness between the two teachers.|$|E
6000|$|Heaven above! Why {{did you not}} deep those cursed sugar-tongs out of [...] her sight? How <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{get through}} it if you frighten her [...] like this? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{told me you}} {{had been}} very kind in helping her. I daresay I should have heard more, if I had not fallen asleep. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Has {{she come}} to sit upon Quilp's knee,' said the dwarf, {{in what he}} {{meant to be a}} {{soothing}} tone, 'or <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed in her own little room inside here? Which is poor Nelly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{these words}} {{she lifted her}} eyes and looked him {{straight}} in the face. There seemed a certain pride and nobility in her {{he had not seen}} before, though her beautiful brown eyes were troubled, and there was a mark of pain on her brow. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell him? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{deposited}} {{our young}} {{friend on the}} floor. She took her doll, and {{stood for a moment}} deep in thought. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do next? We were not kept long in suspense. She suddenly put her little hot fat hand into mine, and tried to pull me after her out of the room.|$|E
60|$|Had she no curiosity? <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let pass what Auguste had hinted? Lifting up her skirts, {{she swung}} round and faced me. In her eyes was a calmness more {{baffling}} than the light I had seen there but a moment since. How to begin I knew not, and yet I was launched.|$|E
6000|$|KNOX. Who {{wants to}} turn her out? But <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ruin us? To let {{everybody}} know of her disgrace and shame? To tear me down from the position Ive made for myself and you by forty years hard struggling? ...|$|R
40|$|Vicky 2 ̆ 7 s Veishea enthusiasm <b>is</b> {{bubbling}} over. <b>She</b> sold pass {{books in}} March, helped on committees during April {{and now she}} 2 ̆ 7 s down to the fundamental problem confronting every coed anticipating the annual Iowa State exposition. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> wear to the horse show, the concert, Vodvil or the track meet? What can <b>she</b> wear that <b>is</b> comfortable, pretty and up-to-the-moment...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, that {{is where}} we are going; at least, Constance <b>is.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work at her {{painting}} while I pay a round of visits. Wont you come with us?" ...|$|R
60|$|Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to?</b> She {{was going}} to a place called Roxham; here it was written on the ticket. She {{was going to}} be {{companion}} to a dear young lady, very rich, like all the English, whom she had met when she had travelled with her French family to Jersey, a Miss Lee.|$|E
60|$|But <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fulfill her {{deliberate}} intention? She {{began to}} be afraid of herself, and to find out a certain difficulty in doing as she liked. Already her assertion of independence in evading his advances had been carried farther than was necessary, and she was thinking with some anxiety what she might do on the next occasion.|$|E
6000|$|She {{said nothing}} to him, only just smiled. And the look of {{knowledge}} in her eyes seemed, for the moment, to be contained in another look: a look of faith, and at last happiness. Aaron's heart stood still. No, in her moment's mood of faith and at last peace, life-trust, he was perhaps more terrified of her than in her previous sinister elegance. His spirit started and shrank. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask of him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We want to {{know how}} she feels about to-night; what report she makes of her nerves, her anticipations; how she looked, what she had on, up to six o'clock. Gracious! if I could see her I should know what I wanted, and so would she, I guess!" [...] Mr. Pardon exclaimed. [...] "You must know something, Mrs. Luna; it isn't natural you shouldn't. I won't inquire any further where <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> because that might seem a little pushing, if she does wish to {{withdraw}} herself--though I am bound to say I think she makes a mistake; we could work up these last hours for her! But can't you tell me any little personal items--the sort of thing the people like? What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have for supper? or <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak--a--without previous nourishment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know that; but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> break down. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{drag out}} the engagement, {{in the hope}} of making me relent." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is about}} the {{phenomenon}} of groupies, and takes a dismissive attitude toward them ("Think I'll let her keep on <b>going,</b> wherever it <b>is</b> <b>she's</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> / Give her an autograph and tell her 'It's been nice knowing you'"... "It won't take much time / Before I get her off my mind").|$|R
6000|$|Should she {{choose to}} elevate {{herself in the}} social circle by living as {{ordinary}} very rich people live, she could not hope to elevate her friends in that way, although she would be glad {{enough to do it}} in many cases, and there would be a gap between them which would surely grow wider and wider; and yet here was this money coming in upon her in a steady stream day by day, and how <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make herself happier with it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, Jon; let's talk." [...] She {{sat down}} on the window-seat, Jon on his bed. She had her profile turned to him, and the beauty and grace of her figure, the {{delicate}} line of the brow, the nose, the neck, the strange and as it were remote refinement of her, moved him. His mother never belonged to her surroundings. She came into them from somewhere--as it were! What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say to him, who had in his heart such things to say to her? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girl did}} as she was told. She opened her coat. The room was delightfully warm, almost overheated. A sense of rest crept over her. For the first moment since the awful shock, her nerves seemed quieter. Gradually {{she began to feel}} almost as though she were passing into sleep. She started up, but sank back again almost immediately. She was {{conscious}} that Quest had laid down the letters which he had been pretending to read. His eyes were fixed upon her. There was a queer new look in them, a strange new feeling creeping through her veins. <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep?...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{particular}} reason! Why, the Antelope is a privateer; and if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cruise about, {{that means}} that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight, and he may get shot." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, Soo-jeong (...) , Yoon-hoo's ex-girlfriend, {{returns to}} Korea as a divorcee {{with her son}} from her {{previous}} marriage. Soo-jeong asks Yoon-hoo's mother what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do if her son is Yoon-hoo's child. Yoon-hoo is shocked, and Gook-hwa comes to know about Soo-jeong's identity. Later on when Soo-jeong's lie is exposed, and Yoon-hoo proposes to Gook-hwa.|$|R
5000|$|Sue Nicholson was {{reported}} by TV3 News as having enraged {{the family of a}} deceased subject (Sarah Niethe) of one of the episodes. The family said Nicholson was wrong to say the case was solved, and that Nicholson couldn't even pronounce the surname of the deceased properly, [...] "so how <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> contact her?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was sure}} that the Pasmers wished to have the affair on again, and part of her fascination with a girl whom she neither liked nor {{approved}} was her belief that Alice's health had broken under the strain of her regrets and her despair. She did not get better from the change of air; she grew more listless and languid, and more dependent upon Mrs. Brinkley's chary sympathy. The older woman asked herself again and again what made the girl cling to her? <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask her finally to intercede with Dan? or was it really a despairing atonement to him, the most disagreeable sacrifice she could offer, as Mr. Brinkley had stupidly suggested? She believed that Alice's selfishness and morbid sentiment were equal to either.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{convinced}} that it could mean nothing to another, although somehow to him it conveyed not only Katharine herself but all those states of mind which had clustered round her since he first saw her pouring out tea on a Sunday afternoon. It represented by its circumference of smudges surrounding a central blot all that encircling glow which for him surrounded, inexplicably, {{so many of the}} objects of life, softening their sharp outline, so that he could see certain streets, books, and situations wearing a halo almost perceptible to the physical eye. Did she smile? Did she put the paper down wearily, condemning it not only for its inadequacy but for its falsity? <b>Was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> protest once more that he only loved the vision of her? But it did not occur to her that this diagram {{had anything to do with}} her. She said simply, and in the same tone of reflection: ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{precisely}} {{what happened after}} {{that has been the}} most impossible thing to disinter. I have given all the things that Melville remembered were said, I have linked them into a conversation and checked them by my cousin's afterthoughts, and finally I have read the whole thing over to him. It is of course no verbatim rendering, but it is, he says, closely after the manner of their talk, the gist was that, and things of that sort were said. And when he left Chatteris, he fully believed that the final and conclusive thing was said. And then he says it came into his head that, apart from and outside this settlement, there still remained a tangible reality, capable of action, the Sea Lady. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? The thought toppled him back into a web of perplexities again. It carried him back into a state of inconclusive interrogation past Lummidge's Hotel.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{certain that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive <b>to</b> Seattle. <b>She</b> wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive anywhere! <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> freight the car back to Minneapolis, and herself go back by train--Pullman!--drawing-room! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> faint; <b>she</b> {{would make}} herself bear up. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do {{something}} to get Moses out of this snare,--but what? At last they rose.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay in Paris--yes!" [...] he said. [...] "If <b>she</b> <b>is</b> really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Brazil, {{it matters}} little what she does. A Parisian, of course, would never bring his womankind here." ...|$|R
