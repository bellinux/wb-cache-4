25|$|The Old South took honor {{particularly}} seriously. Southerners in the Old South held {{themselves to}} their own sets of social codes. An affront to a Southerner's honor, if serious enough, was resolved by a duel. Dueling was originally a European custom, later adopted by the United States. Dueling was not technically legal in the United States, but {{it was difficult to}} enforce the laws written against it, especially in the Old South. Usually only men engaged in duels; their opponents were men they perceived to be equals. Public opinion for dueling varied: some thought it was a barbaric and backwards custom, while others believed it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> legitimate way of dealing with affronts to honor.|$|E
25|$|Later in the quarter, Chargers punter Bryan Wagner's 40-yard punt {{from his}} own 9-yard line gave the 49ers the ball at the San Diego 49. San Francisco then marched on a 9-play drive to score on Young's fourth {{touchdown}} pass, an 8-yard toss to Watters with 4:44 left in the half, making the score 28–7. The Chargers then took the ensuing kickoff and drove 62 yards from their own 25-yard line to the San Francisco 13, featuring a 33-yard gain on a screen pass from Stan Humphries to Eric Bieniemy, San Diego's longest play of the game. But after three incomplete passes, one of which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> thrown Humphries pass that Mark Seay dropped in the end zone, {{they were forced to}} settle for kicker John Carney's 31-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 28–10.|$|E

The Buddha statue fell down and later became chipped, and the monks, after removing the stucco around the statue, discovered that the image <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> made Buddha image from a solid piece of green jade. The image was moved a few time to various temples, first to Lampang, then to Chiang Mai, from where it was removed by prince Chao Chaiyasetthathirat to Luang Prabang, when his father died and he ascended the throne of both Lanna and Lan Xang, in 1551. The statue remained the it to his new capital of Lan Xang in Vientiane in the 1560s. The statue remained there for twelve years. King Chaiyasetthathirat then shifted it to his new capital of Lan Xang in Vientiane in the 1560s. He took the Emerald Buddha with him and the image remained in Vientiane for 214 years until 1778.|$|E

At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was acquainted that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from {{the hundreds of thousands}} of tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B+, {{explaining}} that he believed it to be mainly an original story; what kept him from promoting it to the [...] "elusive 'A' level–something no Fringe episode has yet done for me" [...] was the ending, which was [...] "like something out of dozens of mediocre cop shows". Despite this, Murray found it and the asylum storyline to be [...] "compelling". Conversely, UGO Networks was critical of the episode, writing [...] "Fringe continues to wobble in story quality.

[...] She went on to say Northanger Abbey was made to be a television movie and commented that it was more fun than the book. The San Francisco Chronicle's David Wiegand wrote [...] "Persuasion is a bigger challenge to try to squeeze into 90 minutes, the real difference between that film and Northanger is the latter's consistency of high-quality performances, a careful and attentive adaptation by Andrew Davies and solid direction by Jon Jones." [...] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, James Walton observed [...] "Northanger Abbey <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> acceptable costume drama – but not one that ever really caught fire."

500|$|Wes Archer {{directed}} [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington", {{which was}} one of the first episodes to feature the Simpson family traveling to a real-life location. Because much of the episode takes place outside of Springfield, new background and character designs had to be animated. The Simpson family visits several real-life landmarks in Washington, which the animators were able to draw with the help of photographs from the animation studio's library. The Simpsons director David Silverman grew up in the Washington area so he was able to help out with the designs. Marge's voice actor, Julie Kavner, said she loved the charm of the family [...] "just being on a trip and experiencing the hotel room they're staying at, and the integrity of Bart's character. You know, you just want to kill him for doing all those tricks and pranks." [...] Jean believes this is one of the secrets of the show's success, the fact that it is about a family and the writers can use experiences from their own or their family's life as an inspiration in their writing. He thought [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> constructed episode in that sense.|$|E
500|$|Neil Geinzlinger of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "it may not {{stay in the}} public eye long because this movie is {{probably}} not going to put up Twilight-like numbers," [...] adding that [...] "the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status, which is odd, since the producers include Will Ferrell." [...] Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune suggested that this film should have been made 30 years ago by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell, while instead [...] "the Hansel and Gretel we’re left with runs out of its magic potion far too early to let us enjoy its wicked possibilities." [...] A more positive comparison to Raimi and Campbell's Army of Darkness was made by Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press, who gave it three out of five [...] "witch hazels" [...] and wrote: [...] "I'm not sure if witches are the next vampires/zombies, or if the hinted-at franchise potential has any legs, but this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> vulgar way to spend 90 minutes." [...] Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote that Hansel and Gretel [...] "works best as an unapologetic B-movie action flick" [...] and [...] "feels like a first film in a franchise that’s meant to set up the main characters and conflicts, which can then be fleshed out in sequels" [...] but [...] "the problem is that there isn't enough here to warrant a return trip to this semi-magical land." [...] Richard Corliss of TIME agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "one might be enough — too much, for some tastes." ...|$|E

2500|$|He was, however, {{settled in}} life, {{or at least}} might have been so, {{somewhat}} early. In 1647 his father resigned his rangership in his favor, and arranged a marriage for him with Marie Héricart, a girl of fourteen, who brought him 20,000 livres, and expectations. She {{seems to have been}} both beautiful and intelligent, but the two did not get along well together. There appears to be absolutely no ground for the vague scandal as to her conduct, which was, for the most part, raised long afterwards by gossip or personal enemies of La Fontaine. All that can be positively said against her is that she was a negligent housewife and an inveterate novel reader; de la [...] Fontaine himself was constantly away from home, was certainly not strict in point of conjugal fidelity, and was so bad a man of business that his affairs became involved in hopeless difficulty, and a financial separation of property (separation de biens) had to take place in 1658. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> amicable transaction {{for the benefit of the}} family; by degrees, however, the pair, still without any actual quarrel, ceased to live together, and for the greater part of the last forty years of de la Fontaine's life he lived in Paris while his wife remained in Chateau Thierry which, however, he frequently visited. One son was born to them in 1653, and was educated and taken care of wholly by his mother.|$|E

2500|$|The Marquis de Sade viewed Gothic fiction as a {{genre that}} {{relied heavily on}} magic and phantasmagoria. In his {{literary}} criticism Sade sought to prevent his fiction from being labeled [...] "Gothic" [...] by emphasizing Gothic's supernatural aspects as the fundamental difference from themes in his own work. But while he sought this separation he believed the Gothic played a necessary role in society and discussed its roots and its uses. He wrote that the Gothic novel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> natural, predictable consequence of the revolutionary sentiments in Europe. He theorized that the adversity of the period had rightfully caused Gothic writers to [...] "look to hell for help in composing their alluring novels." [...] Sade held the work of writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe high above other Gothic authors, praising the brilliant imagination of Radcliffe and pointing to Lewis' The Monk as without question the genre’s best achievement. Sade nevertheless believed that the genre was at odds with itself, arguing that the supernatural elements within Gothic fiction created an inescapable dilemma for both its author and its readers. He argued that an author in this genre was {{forced to choose between}} elaborate explanations of the supernatural or no explanation at all and that in either case the reader was unavoidably rendered incredulous. Despite his celebration of The Monk, Sade believed that {{there was not a single}} Gothic novel that had been able to overcome these problems, and that a Gothic novel that did [...] would be universally regarded for its excellence in fiction.|$|E
2500|$|The Rocky Cut raid set {{the stage}} for the final act of the James–Younger Gang: the famous Northfield, Minnesota raid on September 7, 1876. The target was the First National Bank of Northfield, which was far outside of the gang's usual territory. The idea for the raid came from Jesse and Bob Younger. Cole tried to talk his brother out of the plan, but Bob refused to back down. Reluctantly, Cole agreed to go, writing to his brother Jim in California to come home. Jim Younger had never wanted {{anything}} to do with Cole's outlaw activities, but he agreed to go out of family loyalty. The Northfield bank was not unusually rich. According to public reports, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> ordinary rural bank, though rumors persisted that General Adelbert Ames, son of the owner of the Ames Mill in Northfield, had deposited $50,000 there. Shortly after the robbery, Bob Younger declared that they had selected it because of its connection to two Union generals and Radical Republican politicians: Benjamin Butler and his son-in-law Adelbert Ames. General Ames had just stepped down as Governor of Mississippi, where he had been strongly identified with civil rights for freedmen. He had recently moved to Northfield, where his father owned the mill on the Cannon River and had a large amount of stock in the bank. One of the outlaws [...] "had a spite" [...] against Ames, Bob said. Cole Younger said much the same thing years later and recalled greeting [...] "General Ames" [...] on the street in Northfield just before the robbery.|$|E
