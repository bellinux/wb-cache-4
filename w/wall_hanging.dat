5|$|Before the 13th century, {{instances}} of Europeans going to China or of Chinese going to Europe are virtually unknown, {{with a few}} exceptions. Euthydemus I, Hellenistic ruler of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom in Central Asia during the 3rd century BC, led an expedition into the Tarim Basin (modern Xinjiang, China) in search of precious metals. Greek influence as far east as the Tarim Basin at this time {{also seems to be}} confirmed by the discovery of the Sampul tapestry, a woolen <b>wall</b> <b>hanging</b> with the painting of a blue-eyed soldier, possibly a Greek, and a prancing centaur, a common Hellenistic motif from Greek mythology. However, it is known that other Indo-European peoples such as the Yuezhi, Saka, and Tocharians inhabited the Tarim Basin before and after it was brought under Han Chinese influence during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC). Lucas Christopoulos presents an argument that the influence of Hellenistic art in China stretches back to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), before the establishment of the Silk Road. Christopoulos contends that Hellenistic influences in Chinese art were undoubtedly introduced by the period of the Three Kingdoms (220–265) and the sudden influx of Greco-Buddhist art from the Kushan Empire in Central Asia. Yet ancient ceramics from sites at Khotan bear clear influence from the Hellenistic Kingdom of Ptolemaic Egypt, with styles non-existent in Kushan art. This has led Christopoulos to assume the presence of peoples not only from the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom but also Greeks, Saka, and Indian people from the Indo-Greek Kingdom based at Taxila (Pakistan).|$|E

2500|$|In the chancel {{the scenes}} of Adam and Eve cover the west wall above the chancel arch. They include an unusual trompe-l'œil {{representation}} of the Temptation, {{made to look like}} a textile <b>wall</b> <b>hanging.</b> Other scenes show the pair hiding their nakedness, sitting back to back, and lamenting after the fall. Eve is depicted being tempted by the forbidden fruit by a wyvern-like serpent, and milking a cow. This last scene is a unique depiction of Eve. [...] The figures are [...] "violent and elongated [...] as distorted as a Russian ikon, and Ian Nairn noted the [...] "diagrammatic sketching in of belly and buttocks is brilliant".|$|E
2500|$|After being {{inspired}} by the film Ordinary People, Chapman returned to Hawaii, telling his wife he had been obsessed with killing Lennon. He showed her the gun and bullets {{but she did not}} inform the police or mental health services. He made an appointment to see a clinical psychologist but before it occurred he flew back to New York on December 6, 1980. At one point, he considered committing suicide by jumping from the Statue of Liberty. Chapman says the message [...] "Thou Shalt Not Kill" [...] flashed on the TV at him and was also on a <b>wall</b> <b>hanging</b> put up by his wife in their apartment. On the night before the murder, Chapman and his wife discussed on the phone about getting help with his problems by first working on his relationship with God.|$|E

60|$|The {{rest was}} {{comparatively}} easy, for {{taking off his}} linen robe, Japhet knotted it once or twice, and let it down to us. By the help of this improvised rope, with Orme supporting me beneath, I, too, was dragged up to the coping of the wall. Then both of us pulled up Oliver, who, without a word, swung himself over the <b>wall,</b> <b>hanging</b> to Japhet's arms, and loosing his hold, {{dropped to the ground}} on the farther side. Next came my turn. It was a long fall, and had not Oliver caught me I think that I should have hurt myself. As it was, the breath was shaken out of me. Lastly, Japhet swung himself down, landing lightly as a cat. The lamps he had already dropped to us, and in another minute they were all lighted, and we were speeding down the great cavern.|$|E
