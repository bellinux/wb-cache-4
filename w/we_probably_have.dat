For what inducement has a butcher to spend money and time in making his slaughter-house decent, sanitary and humane above the standard of his fellows? To do that will only make him poor and insolvent.

6000|$|Arrived at our destination, {{we built}} a but and {{prepared}} for a stay of some days--I to shoot and skin [...] "Maleos", and Mr. Goldmann and the Major to hunt wild pigs, Babirusa, and Sapi-utan. The place is situated in the large bay between the islands of Limbe and Banca, and consists of steep beach {{more than a mile}} in length, of deep loose and coarse black volcanic sand (or rather gravel), very fatiguing to walk over. It is bounded at each extremity by a small river with hilly ground beyond, while the forest behind the beach itself is tolerably level and its growth stunted. <b>We</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> here an ancient lava stream from the Klabat volcano, which has flowed down a valley into the sea, and the decomposition of which has formed the loose black sand. In confirmation of this view, it may be mentioned that the beaches beyond the small rivers in both directions are of white sand.|$|E
60|$|Guesses at the undiscovered must {{necessarily}} be vague, but my anticipations {{fall into two}} groups, and first I am disposed to expect a great systematic increment in individual human power. <b>We</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> no suspicion as yet {{of what may be}} done with the human body and mind by way of enhancing its effectiveness I remember talking to the late Sir Michael Foster upon the possibilities of modern surgery, and how he confessed that he did not dare for his reputation's sake tell ordinary people the things he believed would some day become matter-of-fact operations. In that respect I think he spoke for very many of his colleagues. It is already possible to remove almost any portion of the human body, including, if needful, large sections of the brain; it is possible to graft living flesh on living flesh, make new connections, mould, displace, and rearrange. It is also not impossible to provoke local hypertrophy, and not only by knife and physical treatment but by the subtler methods of hypnotism, profound changes can be wrought in the essential structure of a human being. If only our knowledge of function and value were at all adequate, we could correct and develop ourselves in the most extraordinary way. Our knowledge is not adequate, but it may not always remain inadequate.|$|E

5000|$|I {{believe that}} <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> lost the culture war. That doesn't mean {{the war is}} not going to continue, and that it isn't going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our {{victories}} fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important.Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture.What I mean by separation is, for example, what the homeschoolers have done. Faced with public school systems that no longer educate but instead 'condition' students with the attitudes demanded by Political Correctness, they have seceded. They have separated themselves from public schools and have created new institutions, new schools, in their homes.I {{think that we have to}} look at a whole series of possibilities for bypassing the institutions that are controlled by the enemy. If we expend our energies on fighting on the [...] "turf" [...] they already control, we will probably not accomplish what we hope, and we may spend ourselves to the point of exhaustion.|$|E

[...] Throughout the second and third season, Cameron Monaghan teased the return of the character and finally on August 2016, Stephens confirmed the character's return, citing that it was their intention to bring him back and [...] "You'll have these underground movements that have started to talk about Jerome and what he represented and how he's going to come back like in the days of John the Baptist" [...] and [...] "he plays into the idea of transformation. When he comes back, you want to see that new version. That next step forward." [...] Monaghan also explained that after the death of Jerome in the second season, the producers were liking the idea and planned on bringing him back in the third season but the original idea included Hugo Strange or the Dollmaker involved in his resurrection.|$|E
