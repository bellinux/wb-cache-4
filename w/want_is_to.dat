500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joining Boone and Eisley at the Project Prayer rally were Walter Brennan, Lloyd Nolan, Rhonda Fleming, Gloria Swanson, and Dale Evans. Boone declared, [...] "what {{the communists}} <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> subvert and {{undermine}} our young people.... I {{believe in the}} power of aroused Americans, I believe in the wisdom of our Constitution.... the power of God." [...] It was noted that Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Mary Pickford, Jane Russell, Ginger Rogers, and Pat Buttram had endorsed the goals of the rally and would also have attended had their schedules not been in conflict.|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{of using}} an initial {{property}} {{is to set up}} the problem in terms of some auxiliary category E, and then identify that what we <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find an initial object of E. [...] This has an advantage that the optimization—the sense that we are finding the most efficient solution—means something rigorous and is recognisable, rather like the attainment of a supremum. [...] The category E is also formulaic in this construction, since it is always the category of elements of the functor to which one is constructing an adjoint. In fact, this latter category is precisely the comma category over the functor in question.|$|E

2500|$|Boros {{preferred}} {{to refer to}} himself an advocate of base running: [...] "I've always been a strong advocate of base running, not necessarily base stealing, but base running. Because ultimately, you win because you score more runs, and what I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be 90-feet smarter and 90-feet more aggressive than the other team." [...] Always {{a student of the}} game, Boros' attitude toward the stolen base had changed by 1986. In an interview that year, Boros said: [...] "The science against stealing has evolved radically in {{the last four or five}} years. That has made it tougher than ever to steal. Pitchers have quicker deliveries, step off and quick pitch, hold the ball. Catchers pitch out much more often. Now you've got pitching coaches with stopwatches timing pitchers' deliveries, while other coaches are timing catchers' throws to second base." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Duncan Smith {{said that}} the Government would {{encourage}} people to work for longer by making it illegal for companies to force staff to give up work at 65, and by bringing forward the planned rises in the age for claiming the state pension. Duncan Smith told The Daily Telegraph that pension reforms were intended to [...] "reinvigorate retirement". [...] "People are living longer and healthier lives than ever, {{and the last thing}} we <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> lose their skills and experience from the workplace due to an arbitrary age limit," [...] he said. [...] "Now is absolutely the right time to live up to our responsibility to reform our outdated pension system and to take action where the previous government failed to do so. If Britain is to have a stable, affordable pension system, people need to work longer, but we will reward their hard work with a decent state pension that will enable them to enjoy quality of life in their retirement." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, she {{approached}} Harry James, offering {{to work for}} him under one condition: that she be permitted to sing more than one chorus. Although James was looking for a more jazz-oriented singer, he allowed Forrest to audition. The band voted her in and she was hired. Several decades later, Forrest explained in an interview, [...] "Harry James was wonderful. When I joined him, I said, 'There's only one condition: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't care about arrangements. The one thing I <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> start a chorus and finish it. I want to do verses, so don't put me up for a chorus {{in the middle of an}} instrumental.' He said, 'You got it,' and that was it." [...] She also told writer George T. Simon, [...] "I'll always remain grateful to Artie and Benny. But they had been featuring me more like they did a member of the band, almost like another instrumental soloist. Harry, though, gave me just the right sort of arrangement and setting that fit a singer. It wasn't just a matter of my getting up, singing a chorus, and sitting down again." [...] In his book, The Big Bands, Simon explained that Harry James constructed [...] "the arrangements around his horn and Helen's voice, establishing warmer moods by slowing down the tempo so that two, instead of the usual three or more choruses, would fill a record ...many an arrangement would build to a closing climax during Helen's vocal, so that she would emerge as its star." [...] It was with the Harry James Orchestra that Helen recorded what are arguably her most popular numbers, including [...] "I Had the Craziest Dream" [...] in 1942, and 1941's [...] "I Don't Want to Walk Without You." [...] In 1942, Helen also appeared with the Harry James Band in the Hollywood film Springtime in the Rockies, starring Betty Grable.|$|E
