The end of the series marked the first time in 18 years that no new Star Trek episodes were scheduled for broadcast, and Enterprise was the first live-action series of the franchise since The Original Series to last less than seven years. Braga said at a talk to students in Los Angeles shortly after the news of the cancellation was released that [...] "After 18 straight years on the air and 750-some episodes the current run of Star Trek is over. <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> It needs a rest". He added that he wasn't sure how long Star Trek would be off the air, but called it a [...] "gestation" [...] instead of a [...] "cancellation".|$|E

After the match, Roddick praised his opponent. [...] " [...] hits {{this way and}} this way kind of equally and he can hit it from inside out and running to it, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for him, bad {{for the rest of}} us". A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. [...] "I don't really understand what I did. It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run. [...] "He changed my game. He changed my mind. He changed everything. When I play and I see him in the stands, it gives me confidence. I can play relaxed." ...|$|E

The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did. You can't escape it here [...] I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more times today than I did when I was mixing it. <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing...</b> Ever since the Rihanna song did well, {{a lot of people want}} to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E

60|$|These are awful words enough--that God should {{hate and}} loathe what {{he himself had}} appointed; that what would be, one would think, {{one of the most}} natural and most {{pleasant}} sights to a loving Father in heaven--namely, his own children worshipping, blessing, and praising him--should be horrible in his sight. There is something very shocking in that; at least to Church people like us. If we were Dissenters, who go to chapel chiefly to hear sermons, it would be easy for us to say--'Of course, forms and ceremonies and appointed feasts are nothing to begin with; they are man's invention at best, and may therefore be easily enough an abomination to God.' But we know that they are not so; that forms and ceremonies and appointed feasts are good things {{as long as they have}} spirit and truth in them; that whether or not they be of man's invention, they spring out of the most simple, wholesome wants of our human nature, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> and not a bad one, for God made it in his own likeness, and bestowed it on us. We know, or ought to know, that appointed feast days, like Christmas, are good and comfortable ordinances, which cheer our hearts on our way through this world, and give us something noble and lovely to look forward to month after month; that they are like landmarks along the road of life, reminding us of what God has done, and is doing, for us and all mankind. And if you do not know, I know, that people who throw away ordinances and festivals end, at least in a generation or two, in throwing away the Gospel truth which that ordinance or festival reminds us of; just as too many who have thrown away Good Friday have thrown away the Good Friday good news, that Christ died for all mankind; and too many who have thrown away Christmas are throwing away--often without meaning to do so--the Christmas good news, that Christ really took on himself the whole of our human nature, and took the manhood into God.|$|E
