5|$|The Cologne War (1583–88) {{devastated the}} Electorate of Cologne, a {{historical}} ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire, within present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, in Germany.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{ensemble}} lay in an amateur group of high-placed courtiers who performed for each other <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke's informal musica secreta in the 1570s. The ensemble evolved into an all-female group of professional musicians, the concerto delle donne, who performed formal concerts {{for members of the}} inner circle of the court and important visitors. Their signature style of florid, highly ornamented singing brought prestige to Ferrara and inspired composers of the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Troilus' romance {{developed}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male-centred conventions of courtly love {{and thus the}} focus of sympathy was to be Troilus and not his beloved. As different authors recreated the romance, they would interpret it in ways affected both by the perspectives of their own times and their individual preoccupations. The story as it would later develop through the works of Boccaccio, Chaucer and Shakespeare is summarised below.|$|E

5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle itself, {{the failure}} of the Red Army to {{properly}} regroup during the prelude to the battle and the ability of the Germans to effectively collect intelligence on Soviet movements {{played an important role in}} the outcome. Poor Soviet performance in the north and equally poor intelligence-gathering at the hands of Stavka and front headquarters, also eventually spelled doom for the offensive. Nonetheless, despite this poor performance, it underscored a dedicated evolution of operations and tactics within the Red Army which borrowed and refined the pre-war theory, Soviet deep battle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the court}} in Ferrara, a {{collection}} of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, {{which led to the}} formation of the concerto delle donne, performed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to {{the court in}} 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{complete}} list of Vice-Presidents of the Philippines, who were inaugurated as Vice-President of the Philippines following the ratification of a constitution that explicitly declared the existence of the Philippines. The inclusion of Mariano Trías in the list is disputed, for Trias was chosen as vice-president at the Tejeros Convention, and again as vice-president for the short-lived Republic of Biak-na-Bato, which was dissolved after the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and Aguinaldo's exile. Neither the reassumption of power by Emilio Aguinaldo when the revolution was resumed in May 1898 nor his formal proclamation and inauguration as President under the First Philippine Republic in 1899 were regimes that provided for a vice-presidency. The vice-presidency <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Philippine government was formally created by the constitution in 1935.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} storyline {{involving}} Ric Flair, Michaels faced Flair in a Career Threatening {{match at}} WrestleMania XXIV, in which he won by performing Sweet Chin Music and thus ending Flair's career. Afterwards, Batista confronted Michaels about his actions at WrestleMania, calling him selfish and egotistical. The two faced off at Backlash with Chris Jericho as the guest referee. Michaels won after faking a knee injury and performing Sweet Chin Music. Jericho then confronted Michaels on this matter, in which Michaels admitted to faking the injury in order to defeat Batista. Michaels then defeated Jericho at Judgment Day. At One Night Stand, Michaels lost to Batista in a stretcher match, thus ending their feud. On the June 9 episode of Raw, Michaels was attacked by Chris Jericho during his talk show segment, The Highlight Reel, being thrown directly through a television screen. The following week, it was revealed that, <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storyline, Michaels had suffered a detached retina. At The Great American Bash, a match between Michaels and Jericho was scheduled, in which Jericho assaulted Michaels' eye, which caused Jericho to win by referee stoppage.|$|E
5|$|Thermopylae {{is arguably}} the most famous battle in European ancient history, {{repeatedly}} referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.|$|E
