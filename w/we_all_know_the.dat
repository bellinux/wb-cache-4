5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Hinkley of The New York Daily News {{rated the}} pilot {{three out of}} five stars, stating [...] "The story and the {{chemistry}} work, but periodically the action feels rushed, as if <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> drill and {{we might as well}} get it over with. Future episodes may correct that, because they'll need less setup work." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety stated [...] "On paper, [...] "Hawaii Five-0" [...] appears destined for can't-miss success, offering a pre-sold name, an attractive cast and a stunning location," [...] but felt the millions spent on the pilot [...] "doesn't necessarily indicate smooth sailing, relying as it does on playful banter (more like frat-boy hazing) between the leads that grows tiresome even before the hour's over." [...] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News felt it was [...] "a huge let down," [...] and was critical of the cast's performance, in particular O'Loughlin and Caan.|$|E
500|$|TV Squad's Bob Sassone {{hoped that}} the storyline {{involving}} Jack and Elisa would be over, [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> relationship isn't going anywhere." [...] He, however, noted {{that it was not}} a [...] "bad subplot" [...] with the pairing of Kenneth and Tracy, but that his [...] "favorite part" [...] of [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] was Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) impersonation of singer Michael McDonald. James Poniewozik for Time was not a fan of Salma Hayek's character, as she was not [...] "adding much to the show." [...] Poniewozik wrote that her character in this episode was the first time she seemed to be a [...] "fully contributing part of the ensemble." [...] Jack's scene in the church, along with him once claiming he was God in a deposition—a reference to Alec Baldwin's role in the film Malice (1993)—was well received, with Canning concluding that these traits make for [...] "an instant classic Jack Donaghy moment." ...|$|E
60|$|I need hardly {{say that}} thenceforward every Wednesday {{afternoon}} was {{spent at the}} widow's tavern. Strangely, neither Matthew or my two friends, or myself, spoke to each other of the sentiment that filled us in reference to Ninon. Yet <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> thoughts and feelings of the others; and each, perhaps, felt confident that his love alone was unsuspected by his companions.|$|R
60|$|The ghost {{story had}} always been hushed up in the family, {{especially}} since <b>the</b> duel, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> resemblance of the picture would be scouted by our elders; but perhaps this gave us the more pleasure in dwelling upon it, while we agreed that poor Margaret ought to be appeased by Griffith's prowess {{on behalf of the}} Fordyces.|$|R

6000|$|... "That is true enough. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> thieving loons. But men {{remember}} the injuries they have suffered, {{better than those}} they have inflicted; and they will count Allan Baird's death {{as more than a}} set-off for a score of their own forays." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> new hotel {{near the}} station, {{where it is}} always gusty, going up the lane which is always muddy, where we are sure to arrive at night, and where we make the gas start awfully when we open the front door. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> {{flooring}} of the passages and staircases that is too new, and the walls that are too new, and the house that is haunted by the ghost of mortar. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> doors that have cracked, and the cracked shutters through which we {{get a glimpse of}} the disconsolate moon. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> new people, who have come to keep the new hotel, and who wish they had never come, and who (inevitable result) wish WE had never come. We all know how much too scant and smooth and bright the new furniture is, and how it has never settled down, and cannot fit itself into right places, and will get into wrong places. We all know how the gas, being lighted, shows maps of Damp upon the walls. We all know how the ghost of mortar passes into our sandwich, stirs our negus, goes up to bed with us, ascends the pale bedroom chimney, and prevents the smoke from following. We all know how a leg of our chair comes off at breakfast in the morning, and how the dejected waiter attributes the accident to a general greenness pervading the establishment, and informs us, in reply to a local inquiry, that he is thankful to say he is an entire stranger {{in that part of the}} country and is going back to his own connexion on Saturday.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what can}} we do? How is the Queen's Government to be carried on?"

6000|$|... "As to mésalliance, there's {{no blood}} on any side," [...] said Lady Pentreath. [...] "Old Admiral Arrowpoint {{was one of}} Nelson's men, you know--a doctor's son. And <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> how <b>the</b> mother's money came." ...|$|R

Mr. Parsons, I appeal to you, as a clergyman of the Church of England, is it not painful to hear her putting forward Jones's asthma, when <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> true fact is that Ponto's tastes are so aristocratic that he can't take exercise with an under servant, and the housekeeper is too fat to waddle.

60|$|This {{telegram}} gave Maitland, in his excited state, {{more trouble}} to construct than {{might have been}} expected. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> wondrous badness of post-office pens or pencils, and how they tear or blot the paper when {{we are in a}} hurry; and Maitland felt hurried, though {{there was no need for}} haste.

Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss; for <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for {{nothing so much as}} to be on good terms with her children." ...|$|E
60|$|Arthur's {{love had}} come upon {{her as a}} surprise, but it had found a perfect home. All the days and hours that she had spent in his company, had, unknown to herself, been mysteriously {{employed}} in preparing a habitation to receive it. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> beautiful Bible story of the Creation, how first there was an empty void, and the Spirit brooding on the waters, then light, and then life, and last, man coming to turn all things to his uses.
