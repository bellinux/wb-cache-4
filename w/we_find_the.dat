As {{the seat of}} authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction of}} fiscal and current account balances in open economies subject to monopolistic competition with sticky price-setting behavior, adjustment costs for investment, and distortionary labor income taxes. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> that <b>the</b> elasticity of exports {{with respect to the}} real exchange rate influences the correlation between the balances. In particular, in simulations with recurring shocks to productivity, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> that <b>the</b> balances are positively correlated for a range of export elasticities. However, for simulations with recurring real government expenditure shocks, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> that <b>the</b> balances are positively correlated under high export elasticity but negatively correlated under low export elasticity. ...|$|R
