In 1932 Cavendish laboratory scientists John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split the atomic nucleus, James Chadwick discovered the neutron, and Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini confirmed the existence of the positron.|$|E
5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.|$|E

25|$|A second transcription, done <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the key, {{but often}} less accurately, was {{completed}} in 1875 by Mynors Bright and published in 1875–1879. This added about a third to the previously published text, but still left only about 80% of the diary in print. Henry B.

This research has now resumed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> modern-day technology; among the possible drag-reducing mechanisms being studied for human use are skin compliance, biopolymers, and boundary-layer heating.|$|E

25|$|He {{strongly}} opposed the communists that {{had left the}} socialist party in January 1921, and felt certain sympathy for fascism in its initial phase. Like many other intellectuals and politicians of all persuasions, he saw fascism as an extreme defence against the dangers of Bolshevism, but condemned its recourse to violence. In August 1921 he applauded the agreement between socialists and fascists {{to put an end}} to the civil war. His death on 2 September 1921, saved him from, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> hindsight, an embarrassing adhesion of fascism.|$|E

25|$|Benjamin K.

The biggest positive result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster could be renewed {{public support for the}} commercialization of renewable energy technologies. In August 2011, the Japanese Government passed a bill to subsidize electricity from renewable energy sources. The legislation will become effective on July 1, 2012, and require utilities to buy electricity generated by renewable sources including solar power, wind power and geothermal energy at above-market rates.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Reformation {{had spread}} {{throughout}} Carinthia {{and the majority}} of the population had turned Protestant. The Habsburg archduke Ferdinand II, regent of Inner Austria and later Holy Roman Emperor intended to exterminate Protestantism in his hereditary lands and therefore furnished the Jesuit College at Graz <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the Millstatt monastery. From 1598 onwards the Jesuits pushed the Counter-Reformation by convincing as well as forcing the local inhabitants to return to the Catholic belief. The history of the monastery came to an end, when the Jesuit order was suppressed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773.|$|E
