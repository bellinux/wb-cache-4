The decision will boost agriculture and allied sectors, manufacturing, logistics, integrated cold chains, refrigerated transportation and food processing facilities in a big way." [...] Criticising the BJP-organised opposition, Gogoi claimed that these parties who had {{just a few years}} ago dubbed opening up retail as good for India, are now singing a different tune.|$|E
2500|$|Both sides {{considered}} the judgment a victory. Vivid Entertainment founder and co-chairman Steven Hirsch {{said in a}} statement that he is pleased with the decision regarding the enforcement questions, but plans to appeal the part of the ruling that upholds the measure. He stated, [...] "We won most everything we sought to be determined unconstitutional with Measure B. We are, however, disappointed the Court found it necessary to rewrite a portion of the measure in order to salvage a small portion of the measure and refused, at this time, to accept the adult industry’s own regulations by imposing an unfunded mandate upon the county by AHF." [...] AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein stated, [...] "Today’s ruling that requiring condoms in porn is constitutional is just a tremendous, tremendous victory, one that <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to safeguard the health and safety of those adult performers working in the industry." [...] Vivid filed an appeal.|$|E

5000|$|More {{pressure}} to plea bargain may {{be applied in}} weak cases (where there is less certainty of both guilt and jury conviction) than strong cases.

6000|$|The {{direct loss}} to France {{caused by the}} Pébrine in {{seventeen}} years cannot be estimated at less than fifty millions sterling; and if we add to this what Redi's idea, in Pasteur's hands, has done for the wine-grower and for the vinegar-maker, and try to capitalise its value, we shall find that it <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards repairing the money losses caused by the frightful and calamitous war of this autumn.

In laying out these ideas, the essay proceeds as follows: first, a very basic, oft-privileged definition {{of sustainable development}} is put forward; second, I make clear how sustainability’s golden rule is formulable from basic moral considerations that explain why sustainable development should be pursued at all; and lastly, I deduce some of the general implications sustainability’s golden rule has for sustainable development...|$|R

The object of these levels is to move around the screen, flying through hoops, destroying lines of enemies and scattered enemies in a set time limit.

60|$|The stimuli {{may be of}} any description: {{the only}} {{important}} matter {{is that all the}} faculties should be kept working to prevent their perishing by disuse. If the faculties are few, very simple stimuli will suffice. Even that of fleas <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way.</b> A dog is continually scratching himself, and a bird pluming itself, whenever they are not occupied with food, hunting, fighting, or love. In those blank times there is very little for them to attend to besides their varied cutaneous irritations. It is a matter of observation that well washed and combed domestic pets grow dull; they miss the stimulus of fleas. If animals did not prosper through the agency of their insect plagues, it seems probable that their races would long since have been so modified that their bodies should have ceased to afford a pasture-ground for parasites.|$|E

Miss Penge was now a great heiress, having had her lawsuit {{respecting}} certain shares in a Welsh coal-mine settled since we last saw her. As all the world knows she came {{from one of the}} oldest Commoner's families in the West of England, and is, moreover, a handsome young woman, only twenty-seven years of age. Lady Penwether thinks that she is the very woman to be mistress of Rufford, and I do not know that Miss Penge herself is averse to the idea. Lord Rufford has been too lately wounded to rise at the bait quite immediately; but his sister knows that her brother is impressionable and that a little patience <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way.</b> They have, however, all agreed at the hall that Arabella's name shall not again be mentioned.|$|E

We will lead them out beyond the town, we don't {{want to make a}} circus of {{ourselves}} in the streets; besides, if you get chucked, you will fall softer there than you would on the road. But first of all we will give them a feed of corn. You see they are skeary of us at present. Indian horses are always afraid of white men at first, just as white men's horses are afraid of Indians.

A large cutter comes round the coast once a month, to pick up the hands from the various receiving-ships, and as often as not she <b>goes</b> back with <b>a</b> hundred. And a rum lot you will think them. There are jail-birds who have had the offer of release on condition that they enter the navy; there are farm-labourers who don’t know one end of a boat from the other; there are drunkards who have been sold by the crimps when their money has run out; but, Lord bless you, it don’t make much difference what they are, they are all knocked into shape before they have been three months on board. I think, however, you will have a better time than this.
