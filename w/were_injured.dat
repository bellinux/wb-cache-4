40|$|AbstractThis study investigates {{determinants}} of {{the probability that}} an individual onboard a ship of a given shipping line will <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> (given that the ship {{is not involved in}} an accident). A Probit regression statistical model is used to investigate such determinants when ships are in port and on given types of containerships. Probit estimation results suggest that an individual is less likely to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> in port onboard a ship that is larger in size and underway, but more likely to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> if involved in a fall. An individual is less likely to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> onboard a containership with AMO union officers if it is larger in size and during the daytime. An individual is less likely to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> onboard a containership with MEBA and MMP union officers if it is larger in size, when the weather is clear and when he/she is wearing steel-toed safety boots...|$|R
