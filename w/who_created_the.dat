5|$|Author Marilyn Cannaday has {{suggested}} that Doc Savage, the pulp hero from the 1930s and 1940s, was {{based in part on}} Savage's life, or at least his name.

5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} invent the key system of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> key system that is now used for the transverse flute. Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system because {{it was based on}} that used for flute.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} major Final Fantasy game for mobile devices, Before Crisis was {{designed}} as a gameplay and multiplayer experience unique to the platform. It is {{the first major}} project directed by Hajime Tabata, <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> initial concept at the request of Tetsuya Nomura for a game that had the Turks as protagonists. The music was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, originally a sound arranger at Square Enix. It was highly successful upon release, registering 200,000 users and being accessed over one million times. Western critics have generally praised the title, but due to issues involving the capacity of mobile devices in the west, it has not been released outside Japan.|$|E

Choi oversaw all of the menus prepared for the film and created the Cuban sandwiches that formed a central part of the storyline.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the Devon and Somerset Badger Club {{was founded}} by Arthur Blake Heinemann <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> first breed {{standard}} {{for this type of}} terrier. The club was formed with the aim of promoting badger digging, rather than fox hunting. By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier. The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, van Meegeren {{gave up his}} {{architecture}} {{studies and}} concentrated on drawing and painting at the art school in The Hague.

5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E
5|$|In May, Toby Jones entered final {{negotiations}} to play Arnim Zola. Iron Man director Jon Favreau said a younger Howard Stark {{would appear in}} the film, played by Dominic Cooper. Atwell revealed that Tommy Lee Jones would {{have a role in}} the film. By June, Neal McDonough was in talks to play Dum Dum Dugan. Four days later, he confirmed he was taking the part. The same day, Stanley Tucci joined the cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine, the scientist <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> super-soldier serum. In November 2013, McDonough revealed that he is signed to appear in multiple projects for Marvel, not limited to films.|$|E

5|$|The first Georgian {{script was}} {{included}} in Unicode Standard in October, 1991 {{with the release of}} version 1.0. In creating the Georgian Unicode block, important roles were played by German Jost Gippert, a linguist of Kartvelian studies, and American-Irish linguist and script-encoder Michael Everson, <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> Georgian Unicode for the Macintosh systems. Significant contributions were also made by Anton Dumbadze and Irakli Garibashvili (not to be mistaken with the former Prime Minister of Georgia Irakli Garibashvili).|$|E
5|$|The title monster was {{designed}} by production designer Richard Cassarino, <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> suit for $500, and was built over a diver's wetsuit. Conditions inside the suit were very hot; combined with the humid weather, this caused Clarke, who performed his own stunts in the film, to sweat profusely. The original mask is currently owned by archivist and occasional actor Bob Burns. Cassarino later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad, and also was responsible for designing the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966).|$|E
5|$|Thomas Tompion was {{the first}} English clockmaker with an {{international}} reputation {{and many of his}} pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as George Graham who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury pendulum, and his pupil Thomas Mudge <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> first lever escapement. Famous clockmakers of this period included Joseph Windmills, Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and Christopher Pinchbeck who used the Pinchbeck alloy.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created unofficial patches and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in ResidualVM, and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version. One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the tank-style controls to a point and click-style interface. Schafer noted they created the game with tank-style control as it was popular with other games like Resident Evil at the time, but recognized it did not work well within the adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> point-and-click modification to obtain access to his code to incorporate into the remastered version.|$|E
5|$|In early 1999, Yoshiki Okamoto, {{then head}} of Capcom's screenwriter {{subsidiary}} Flagship, proposed his idea of remaking the original The Legend of Zelda for the Game Boy Color to Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer at Nintendo <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> series. Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, and held on to his concept of bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience {{the merits of the}} original Zelda, but also as a test for the development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if {{it turned out to be}} successful.|$|E
5|$|In {{the idea}} of Matt Bozon, <b>who</b> <b>created</b> <b>the</b> game's {{universe}} based on Erin's character, at the beginning, the game was planned for the SNES or PC. He and Erin pitched the game with help from veteran programmer Jimmy Huey, who worked with WayForward at the time. After the completion of Xtreme Sports, Voldi Way, the founder and owner of WayForward, greenlit a Game Boy Color version of the game. As Huey had already built a graphics engine for Xtreme Sports, this engine was adapted to suit Shantaes needs. This allowed the game to showcase rare effects on GBC games, like parallax scrolling and transparency effects. In {{the first four months}} of development, the team created most of the animation, and Huey programmed an art-capturing tool that allowed to take full-colored animation frames, turn them into three-colour chunks and reassemble the whole on the GBC's screen.|$|E
