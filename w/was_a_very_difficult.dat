The representative of the Greek Government, who gave evidence before the Commission on 7 September, estimated the number of Greek victims to be in the region of 2000. Some 900 bodies had already been recovered by that time. An English witness put this number at about 400. A French officer conducting an on-the-spot investigation several days after the events took place put the number of victims at 1500 to 2000 Greeks and 1200 to 1500 Turks, however acknowledging that estimating the number of Turkish victims <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> task.|$|E

Franco has said painting was the [...] "outlet" [...] he needed in high school, and he [...] "has actually been painting longer than he has been acting". His paintings were displayed publicly {{for the first time}} at the Glü Gallery in Los Angeles, from January 7, through February 11, 2006. He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin. He enjoys reading on the set of his films. Pineapple Express producer Judd Apatow has said of him: [...] "He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading The Iliad on set. We still haven't read The Iliad. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> book. With him, it was always James Joyce or something".|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one {{there is not much}} you can do. I was lucky to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Dunglass's {{appointment}} Chamberlain was generally seen as {{the heir to the}} premiership, and in 1937 the incumbent, Stanley Baldwin, retired, and Chamberlain succeeded him. He retained Dunglass as his PPS, a role described by the biographer D R Thorpe as [...] "the right-hand man... the eyes and ears of Neville Chamberlain", and by Dutton as [...] "liaison officer with the Parliamentary party, transmitting and receiving information and [...] his master informed of the mood on the government's back benches". This was particularly important for Chamberlain, who was often seen as distant and aloof; Douglas Hurd wrote that he [...] "lacked the personal charm which makes competent administration palatable to wayward colleagues– a gift which his parliamentary private secretary possessed in abundance". Dunglass admired Chamberlain, despite his daunting personality: [...] "I liked him, and I think he liked me. But if one went in {{at the end of the}} day for a chat or a gossip, he would be inclined to ask 'What do you want?' He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> man to get to know." ...|$|E

During this long time for finding a publishing partner, No One Lives Forever [...] "mutated constantly in order to please prospective producers and marketing departments. The game actually started off as a mission-based, anime-inspired, paramilitary action thriller intended as a spiritual sequel to Shogo and ended up as a 60s spy adventure in the tradition of Our Man Flint and countless other 60s spy movies and shows." [...] This final theme for the game was settled on through discussions with Fox Interactive, the final publisher of NOLF. (Parts of the initial [...] "paramilitary action thriller" [...] concept evolved into F.E.A.R., another Monolith game, released after the NOLF series, in 2005.) Monolith's producer for the game, Samantha Ryan said that before the deal was signed, [...] "here was a period where Monolith was two weeks from death.
