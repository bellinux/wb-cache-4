5000|$|The 90A Aronde was {{produced}} in Australia from 1956 by Northern Star Engineering which, along with Continental and General Distributors, had been contracted to assemble the model from CKD kits, using local content. In July 1959, Chrysler Australia announced that future production of the Aronde would be undertaken at its factories in Adelaide. [...] In late 1959 the P60 was introduced, selling alongside the 90A well into 1960, and a five-door P60 station wagon was introduced in late 1961. The wagon, which was unique to Australia, {{was based on the}} four-door sedan and featured an extended roof-line and a tail-gate fitted with a <b>wind-down</b> <b>window.</b> Australian production of the Aronde ceased in 1964.|$|E
50|$|The {{front windows}} and the doors {{remained}} {{the same as the}} Celica but the roof line was extended to cover the rear passenger seats and then continued as a thin spine {{to the rear of the}} car. On each side of the spine a centre hinged gull wing window completed the roof and continued down to the waistline. A large integral roll bar completed the rear and also held up the rear of the roof spine. The tail lights and rear indicators shown through many small round holes in the rear face of the bodywork. Unusually for Celicas, the rear bumper had cut-outs to house red reflectors and reversing lights. A 1 metre wide tail gate with a frameless <b>wind-down</b> <b>window</b> occupied the centre of the rear. The centre section of the bumper moved with the tail gate instead of being fixed directly to the body.|$|E
50|$|Styling was {{up-to-date}} with sharply formed {{edges and}} large rectangular headlights. The front bumper covered only the corners, allowing the grill {{to be much}} more prominent than normal. The roof line terminated behind the large door on each side. Above the rear waistline were a pair of side hinged clam shell doors covering the entire rear section. An integrated roll bar terminated the body work and also formed a place for the clam shell doors to seal. The clam shell doors met each {{in the middle of the}} roof with no centre support. When the doors were raised you could stretch a tent between them. Two adults could sleep in the tent section and another two adults could sleep on the front seats, which could fold down flat. Finally, the rear section included a full width tail gate with a <b>wind-down</b> <b>window</b> nestled under the rear roll bar.|$|E
50|$|The Acadiane {{was also}} fitted with <b>wind-down</b> <b>windows</b> in the driver's and passenger's doors. The Dyane car had horizontally-sliding windows.|$|R
50|$|Howard Darrin {{continued}} to build special orders in his Hollywood shop. The bodies contracted out were convertible Victorias, four-seaters {{with a low}} profile but with <b>wind-down</b> <b>windows</b> in their doors.|$|R
50|$|Features such as <b>wind-down</b> <b>windows</b> {{were seen}} as a {{necessary}} step forward to meet competition and achieve good sales in the important US market, where {{the vast majority of}} TR4s were eventually sold. Dealers had concerns that buyers might not fully appreciate the new amenities, therefore a special short run of TR3As (commonly called TR3Bs) was produced in 1961 and '62.|$|R
50|$|The 6000 was a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with a fuselage {{constructed of}} steel tube {{and covered in}} fabric. In keeping with its intended luxury market, the fully enclosed cabin was insulated and soundproofed, and included <b>wind-down</b> <b>windows.</b> The basic model was priced at $12,000, but numerous options were offered that could nearly double that price; actor Wallace Beery's aircraft cost him $20,000 and was the most expensive Model 6000 built.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{the pilot}} was above the {{extension}} shaft, he was placed higher in the fuselage than in most contemporary fighters, which, in turn gave the pilot a good field of view. Access to the cockpit was via sideways opening [...] "car doors", one on either side. Both had <b>wind-down</b> <b>windows.</b> As only the right-hand door had a handle {{both inside and outside}} this was used as the normal means of access and egress. The left-hand door could be opened only from the outside and was for emergency use, although both doors could be jettisoned. In operational use, as the roof was fixed, the cockpit design made escape difficult in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|The new TR4 {{body style}} {{did away with}} the cutaway door design of the {{previous}} TRs to allow for <b>wind-down</b> (roll-up) <b>windows</b> in place of less convenient side-curtains. The angular rear allowed a boot (trunk) with considerable capacity for a sports car.|$|R
50|$|In February 2014 Volkswagen {{introduced}} {{a modified version}} of the Up for Latin America. The Brazilian-built Up differs from its European counterpart in length (it is 65 mm longer), thanks to revisions to the floorpan's rear section to accommodate a larger fuel tank (50L instead of Europe's 35L), a full-sized spare wheel and increased cargo space. All versions have revised tailgates with a painted metal section (like the Seat Mii's and Å koda Citigo's) instead of the dark glass trim used in Europe. The 5-door Brazilian Up also uses a different rear door design with sectioned glass and <b>wind-down</b> <b>windows.</b> The South American model retains the European version's safety levels with a five-star crash rating and ample use of high-strength steel elements.|$|R
50|$|The {{saving grace}} for Chrysler {{at this time}} was the French Simca Aronde - a popular 4-cylinder compact car which Chrysler Australia {{assembled}} from CKD kits at their Forestville factory. Local engineers developed an Aronde station wagon unique to Australia, with a then-novel <b>wind-down</b> rear <b>window</b> and tailgate. (Chrysler USA had acquired an interest in Simca in 1958, the basis for sourcing of this car). The assembly and marketing of Simca Aronde and Vedette models by Chrysler Australia was announced on 1 July 1959.|$|R
2500|$|The Typhoon {{was first}} {{produced}} with forward-opening [...] "car door" [...] style cockpit doors (complete with <b>wind-down</b> <b>windows),</b> with a transparent [...] "roof" [...] hinged to {{open to the}} left. The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing. From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed [...] "The Coffin Hood"), the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was R7803. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later [...] "car-door" [...] canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration. Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending {{the introduction of the}} new [...] "bubble" [...] canopy and cut-down dorsal fairing, the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a whip aerial further back on the rear fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} unusual and innovative, being {{based on a}} strong central keel that incorporated the armament, cockpit, and engine. Two strong fuselage beams to port and starboard {{formed the basis of}} the structure. These angled upwards fore and aft to create mounting points for the T9 cannon and propeller reduction gearbox and for the engine and accessories respectively. A strong arched bulkhead provided the main structural attachment point for the main spar of the wing. This arch incorporated a fireproof panel and an armor plate between the engine and the cockpit. It also incorporated a turnover pylon and a pane of bullet-resistant glass behind the pilot's head. The arch also formed the basis of the cockpit housing; the pilot's seat was attached to the forward face as was the cockpit floor. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage nose was formed from large removable covers. A long nose wheel well was incorporated in the lower nose section. The engine and accessories were attached {{to the rear of the}} arch and the main structural beams; these too were covered using large removable panels. A conventional semi-monocoque rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure.Because the pilot was above the extension shaft, he was placed higher in the fuselage than in most contemporary fighters, which, in turn gave the pilot a good field of view. Access to the cockpit was via sideways opening [...] "car doors", one on either side. Both had <b>wind-down</b> <b>windows.</b> As only the right-hand door had a handle both inside and outside this was used as the normal means of access and egress. The left-hand door could be opened only from the outside and was for emergency use, although both doors could be jettisoned. In operational use, as the roof was fixed, the cockpit design made escape difficult in an emergency.|$|R
5000|$|An unusual variant {{unique to}} New Zealand, {{available}} for some years, was a [...] "van", basically the manual Avenger wagon {{with a flat}} rear floor in place of rear seats and fixed, rather than <b>wind-down,</b> rear door <b>windows.</b> This, and rival models, was introduced around 1975 to get around strict post-oil crisis government hire purchase laws {{in the country that}} required a 60 per cent deposit for a new car with only 12-month terms versus 25 per cent and three years for a light commercial vehicle, which is what these so-called [...] "vans" [...] were classified as.|$|R
