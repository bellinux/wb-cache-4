40|$|Many people, {{particularly}} in Africa, suffer various conditions from eating bitter cassava which contains poisonous cyanogens. As well as poisoning, which sometimes causes death, these conditions include konzo, an irreversible paralysis of the legs, which affects mainly {{children and young}} women, impaired neurocognition in children, tropical ataxic neuropathy in older people, and aggravation of iodine deficiency disorders (such as goitre and cretinism) in iodine deficient areas. The <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> removes residual cyanogens, and is an additional method of processing cassava flour after its preparation {{by one of the}} traditional <b>methods.</b> The <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> is simple and easy to use, the traditional thick porridge (fufu or ugali) made from the treated flour tastes very good, and the method is readily accepted by rural women in East and Central Africa. Regular use of the <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> by rural women in 13 villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo has prevented konzo amongst more than 9, 000 people. We recommend that the <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> be used as an additional method to traditional methods to remove cyanogens from cassava flour in tropical Africa...|$|R
50|$|In 2010 the <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> {{was taught}} to the women in Kay Kalenge village, Popokabaka Health Zone, Bandundu Province, DRC, where there were 34 konzo cases. The women used the method and during the {{intervention}} there were no new konzo cases and the urinary thiocyanate content of the school children fell to safe levels. Konzo had been prevented {{for the first time}} ever in the same health zone in which it had first been discovered by Dr Trolli in 1938. Fourteen months after the intervention ceased the village was visited again. It was found that there were no new cases of konzo, the school children had low urinary thiocyanate levels, the <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> was still being used and it had spread by word of mouth to three nearby villages. It is important to teach the women that konzo is due to a poison present in their food, to get them to regularly use the <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> and posters are available in 13 different languages as a teaching aid as an additional method to remove residual cyanogens.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSix {{villages in}} Boko Health Zone, Bandundu Province, DRC, were studied with 4588 people, 144 konzo cases and konzo prevalences of 2. 0 – 5. 2 %. Konzo {{incidence}} is increasing rapidly in this area. Food consumption scores {{were obtained from}} the households with konzo and the mean % malnutrition calculated for each village. Urine samples were obtained from 50 school children from each village and % high urinary thiocyanate content (> 350 μmol/L) determined. The experimental data relating % konzo prevalence (%K) to % children with high urinary thiocyanate content (%T) and % malnutrition (%M) for the six villages were fitted to an equation %K= 0. 06 %T+ 0. 035 %M. This confirms that konzo is due to a combination of high cyanide intake and malnutrition. The village women used the <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> to remove cyanogens from cassava flour. During the 9 -month intervention there were no new cases of konzo; cyanide in flour had reduced to WHO safe levels and mean urinary thiocyanate levels were greatly reduced. To prevent konzo at least 60 – 70 % of women should use the <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> regularly. The <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> is now accepted by the World Bank, FAO and WHO as a sensitive intervention. Four successful konzo interventions have involved nearly 10, 000 people in 13 villages, the cost is now $ 16 per person and the methodology is well established...|$|R
40|$|A simple <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> used to {{significantly}} reduce the % total cyanide remaining (TCR) in cassava was evaluated for its applicability to flaxseed. An optimal simple <b>wetting</b> <b>method</b> (SWM) in terms of time, temperature, and exposed surface area (SA) depth was developed for reducing the % TCR in ground flaxseed. The optimal parameters were a treatment time of 12 h, an ambient temperature of approximately 22 °C, and an increased exposed SA achieved through spreading the wetted flaxseed mixture out to a thin depth of 0. 5 cm. General mixed model analysis confirmed that the variables time and SA were significant factors in minimizing the %TCR in the optimal model. Pairwise comparison showed that the 0. 5 cm depth had the greatest effect. The desirable lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) was significantly retained, as determined by HPLC quantification of pre- and post-processing levels...|$|R

Dry-handled ash is often recycled into useful building materials. Wet disposal has been preferred due to economic reasons, but increasing environmental concerns regarding leachate from ponds has decreased the popularity of wet disposal. The <b>wet</b> <b>method</b> consists of constructing a large [...] "pond" [...] and filling it with fly ash slurry, allowing the water to drain and evaporate from the fly ash over time. Ash ponds are generally formed using a ring embankment to enclose the disposal site. The embankments are designed using similar design parameters as embankment dams, including zoned construction with clay cores. The design process is primarily focused on handling seepage and ensuring slope stability.|$|E
