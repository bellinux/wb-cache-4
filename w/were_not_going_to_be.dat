5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also {{spent a lot of time}} changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, as {{electrification}} of the East Coast Main Line {{was under}} way, British Rail realised {{that the new}} Mark 4 carriages for the Class 89 and 91 locomotives <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> finished {{in time for the}} introduction of electric services on the East Coast Main Line so, in late 1987, a total of eight Eastern Region power cars (Numbers 43013/014/065/067/068/080/084/123) conversions (on 43014/123) were carried out at the Derby Engineering Development Unit, whilst the other six (43013/065/067/068/080/084) were converted by the diesel repair shop at Stratford to have the lower valancing removed and buffers fitted.|$|E

It has seen simple pie throwing in earlier series, various sport based themes, a murder mystery, and also many episodes where the presenters have pretended that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> throwing muck muck. For the end of Series 3, there was a surprise This Is Your Muck Muck sketch (a spoof of This Is Your Life), which involved many of Dick and Dom's family and friends, In Series 4 a Creamy Muck Muck bingo game was hosted by Dancing Brian (Ian Kirkby).|$|E

25|$|At his {{afternoon}} situation {{conference on}} April 22, Hitler {{fell into a}} tearful rage when he realised that his plans of the day before <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> implemented. He declared {{that the war was}} lost, blamed the generals and announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then kill himself. In an attempt to coax Hitler out of his rage, the Chief of Staff of the OKW, General Alfred Jodl, speculated that the Twelfth Army, which was facing the American forces, could move to Berlin because the Americans already on the Elbe River were unlikely to move further east. Hitler immediately seized upon the idea and within hours, the army's commander, General Walther Wenck, was ordered to disengage from the American forces and move the Twelfth Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the Ninth Army moved west, it could link up with the Twelfth Army. In the evening, Heinrici was given permission to make the linkup.|$|E
25|$|In 1611, {{her father}} was working with Agostino Tassi to {{decorate}} the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome, so Orazio hired the painter to tutor his daughter privately. During this tutelage, Tassi raped Artemisia. Another man, Cosimo Quorli, was also involved. After the rape, Artemisia continued to {{have sexual relations with}} Tassi, with the expectation {{that they were going to}} be married and with the hope to restore her dignity and her future. Tassi reneged on his promise to marry Artemisia. Nine months after the rape, when he learnt that Artemisia and Tassi <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married, Orazio pressed charges against Tassi. Orazio also claimed that Tassi stole a painting of Judith from the Gentileschi household. The major issue of this trial was the fact that Tassi had taken Artemisia's virginity. If Artemisia had not been a virgin before Tassi raped her, the Gentileschis would not have been able to press charges. During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio’s paintings. During the trial, Artemisia was subjected to a gynecological examination and torture using thumbscrews to verify her testimony. At the end of the trial Tassi was exiled from Rome, although they never carried out the sentence. The trial influenced the feminist view of Artemisia Gentileschi during the late twentieth century.|$|E

Sutherland described the film production as [...] "exciting" [...] because, [...] "It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so we <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that three large destroyers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built, the idea that Dubrovnik might operate {{with a number of}} smaller destroyers persisted.

[...] During [...] "The Reporter," [...] Parks and Recreation editor Dean Holland {{developed}} an editing technique that would be used {{throughout the rest of the}} series. During the scene in which Leslie reacts to quotes read to her by the reporter, Amy Poehler improvised a number of jokes, many of which <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used. Holland thought they were all funny, so he created a brief montage inter-cutting several of the lines into the same scene.|$|E
500|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Army, Blandy agreed to crowd more ships into the immediate target area than the Navy wanted, but he refused USAAF Major General Curtis LeMay's demand that [...] "every ship must have a full loading of oil, ammunition, and fuel." [...] Blandy's argument was that fires and internal explosions might sink ships that would otherwise remain afloat and be available for damage evaluation. When Blandy proposed an all-Navy board to evaluate the results, Senator McMahon complained to Truman that the Navy should not be [...] "solely responsible for conducting operations which might well indeed determine its very existence."

500|$|The Super Furry Animals had {{attempted}} to make a hit record with a commercial sound with their previous release, 1999's Guerrilla. The record's singles failed to hit the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, so the band decided to go on [...] "pop strike". The group had written several Welsh-language songs during sessions for Guerrilla, and opted to release them as a coherent album rather than issue [...] "token Welsh songs" [...] as b-sides—reasoning that, if their English pop songs <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played on the radio they may as well release Welsh pop songs that would not get played on the radio. Singer Gruff Rhys stated that, although the decision to release a Welsh language album was not an explicitly political statement, he does feel the record is a [...] "stand against globalisation". Recording largely took place at Ofn Studios, Llanfaelog, Anglesey in 1999, with the band sharing production duties with Gorwel Owen. The [...] "lo-fi" [...] album cost just [...] to make, {{in contrast with the}} [...] "excessive expense" [...] of Guerrilla, and was recorded almost entirely live.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} August it {{was obvious}} that the {{organizations}} in Saskatchewan and Manitoba <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready in time for the 1923 crop, and the committee decided to proceed alone. It determined that if farmers representing half of Alberta's total wheat acreage agreed to pool their crop by September 15, the pool would proceed. Brownlee believed that this was an impossible objective. [...] Despite the experimental and unproven nature of the model and the as-yet nonexistent organization that was to execute it, this objective was met. [...] The Alberta Wheat Pool was born. By the following year's harvest, comparable organizations had formed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and a Central Selling Agency (CSA) was formed to sell all three provinces' wheat. [...] The CSA's first president, Alexander James McPhail (whom Brownlee helped select), offered Brownlee the position of CSA general manager, at the attractive salary of $20,000 per year (a figure that Brownlee had helped set). At the urging of his government colleagues and the UFA leadership, both of who felt his continued presence in Edmonton was vital to the UFA government's hold on power, he declined; he was instead made the CSA's general counsel. [...] Brownlee was also heavily involved {{in the creation of a}} livestock pool and three dairy pools, as a sort of [...] "poolmania" [...] hit Alberta farmers.|$|E
500|$|Usher had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} album entitled All About U, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful My Way (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including [...] "T.T.P.", [...] "U R the One" [...] and [...] "Pop Ya Collar". Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000 to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that {{he returned to the}} studios to record new songs, stating [...] "I didn't want that to be the way my record was remembered or the way I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better" [...] while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is [...] "practically a new album". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public {{for the first time at}} his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001.|$|E
