5|$|These dates {{correspond}} {{with the end}} of the Battle of Konigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> responsible for the loss of the Amber Room.|$|E
5|$|The labor {{strike was}} unsuccessful, and the miners {{went back to}} work within a couple of months. The {{national}} Knights of Labor organization refused to support the Carbon strike and the hold out by white miners in Rock Springs following the Rock Springs Riot. The organization avoided supporting the miners along the Union Pacific Railroad, because it did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> condoning the violence at Rock Springs. When the Union Pacific Coal Department reopened the mines, it fired 45 white miners connected to the violence.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E

25|$|However, Switzerland did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an {{obstacle}} to closer tax cooperation among EU-member states and decided to support the international efforts to adequately tax cross-border investment income. The retention tax agreed with the European Union (EU) in the taxation of savings income agreement is a suitable and efficient means of doing so. The EU is committed to eliminating existing loopholes in the system of taxation of savings income. Switzerland has expressed to the EU its willingness in principle to correspondingly adjust the taxation of savings income. Here {{it should be noted}} that Switzerland has adopted the OECD standard on administrative assistance and that the Federal Council rejects the automatic exchange of information. Since July 1, 2005, Switzerland has charged a withholding tax on all interest earned in the personal Swiss accounts of European Union residents.|$|E
25|$|After Jordan {{lost control}} of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers) moved their bases to Jordan and stepped up their attacks on Israel and Israeli {{occupied}} territories. One Israeli retaliation on a PLO camp based in Karameh, a Jordanian town along the border with the West Bank, developed into a full-scale battle. It is believed that Israel had wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support for the PLO. After failing to capture Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, Israeli forces withdrew or were repulsed, but not before destroying the Karameh camp and sustaining relatively high casualties. The perceived joint Jordanian-Palestinian victory in the 1968 Battle of Karameh led to an upsurge of support in the Arab World for Palestinian fighters in Jordan. The PLO in Jordan grew in strength, and by the beginning of 1970 the fedayeen groups started to openly call for the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy. Acting as a state within a state, the fedayeen disregarded local laws and regulations, and even attempted to assassinate King Hussein twice, leading to violent confrontations between them and the Jordanian army. Hussein wanted to oust the fedayeen from the country, but hesitated to strike because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> massacring the Palestinians. PLO actions in Jordan culminated in the Dawson's Field hijackings incident on 10September 1970, in which the fedayeen hijacked three civilian aircraft and forced their landing in Zarqa, taking foreign nationals as hostages, and later bombing the planes in front of the international press. Hussein saw this as the last straw, and ordered the army to move.|$|E

Quinn considered delaying the Steam release, as she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> taking advantage of Williams' death.

500|$|During the battle, the British had {{captured}} General John Sullivan. [...] Admiral Howe {{convinced him to}} deliver a message to Congress in Philadelphia, and released him on parole. [...] Washington also gave his permission, and on September 2 Sullivan told the Congress that the Howes wanted to negotiate, and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held. [...] This created a diplomatic problem for Congress, which did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> aggressive, which is how some representatives felt a direct rejection of the appeal would appear. [...] Consequently, Congress agreed to send a committee {{to meet with the}} Howes in a move they did not think would bear any fruit. [...] On September 11, the Howe brothers met with John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Rutledge in the Staten Island Peace Conference. [...] It had exactly the outcome the Americans expected.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1789 French Revolution, {{relations}} between the new French Republic and the American administration of President George Washington became strained. [...] In 1792, France and the rest of Europe went to war, a conflict in which Washington declared American neutrality. [...] However, both France and Great Britain, the major naval powers in the war, seized ships of neutral powers (including those of the United States) that traded with their enemies. [...] With the Jay Treaty, ratified in 1795, the United States reached an agreement on the matter with Britain that angered members of the Directory that governed France. [...] The French Navy consequently stepped up its efforts to interdict American trade with Britain. [...] By the time John Adams assumed the presidency in early 1797, the matter was reaching crisis proportions. [...] In March 1797, not long after assuming office, President Adams learned that Charles Cotesworth Pinckney had been refused as U. S. minister because of the escalating crisis, and that American merchant ships had been seized in the Caribbean. [...] Popular opinion in the United States on relations with France was divided along largely political lines: Federalists took a hard line, favoring a defensive buildup but not necessarily advocating war, while Republicans expressed solidarity with the Republican ideals of the French revolutionaries and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> cooperating with the Federalist Adams administration. Jefferson looked at the Federalists as monarchists who were linked to Britain and therefore hostile to American values.|$|E
