2500|$|The first {{thoughts}} and attempts I made to practice [...] were suggested by a question which {{occurred to me}} in 1946 as I was convalescing from an illness and playing solitaires. The question was <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> that a Canfield solitaire laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? After {{spending a lot of}} time trying to estimate them by pure combinatorial calculations, I wondered whether a more practical method than [...] "abstract thinking" [...] might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays. This was already possible to envisage with the beginning of the new era of fast computers, and I immediately thought of problems of neutron diffusion and other questions of mathematical physics, and more generally how to change processes described by certain differential equations into an equivalent form interpretable as a succession of random operations. Later , I described the idea to John von Neumann, and we began to plan actual calculations.|$|E

40|$|Deleterious {{mutations}} of the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 {{genes are}} a major risk factor {{for the development of}} breast and ovarian cancers. 1 – 4 Mutation tests for these two genes commonly are now offered in specialised clinics. 5, 6 As a result, a large number of women with personal or family histories of breast or ovarian cancer seek genetic counselling. Accurate evaluation of the probability that a woman carries a germline pathogenic mutation at BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 therefore is essential to help counsellors and those being counselled to decide whether testing is appropriate. In this context, the questions of practical interest are: Given <b>the</b> pedigree, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of a mutation being present? and <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of <b>the</b> DNA laboratory finding a mutation...|$|R

[...] Le Monde wrote that the [...] "Obama phenomenon" [...] could serve as an example to all French political parties. [...] At another French paper, Le Figaro, an editorial by Paul-Henri du Limbert said the French could [...] "learn a lesson" [...] from Obama's election: [...] "We reproached “Sarkozy the American” for loving the country, its values and its way of life, but today we have realized that this wasn't such a terrible lack of good taste." [...] Magdalena Środa, writing for Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza, said she envied Americans their Obama: [...] "I envy Americans their political engagement, which doesn't exhaust itself with the act of voting or posting election fliers. Americans debate, go door to door and travel to different states in order to convert others to their point of view. This is how a political culture is born and a capital of social trust is established, which, irrespective of who wins the election, remains an important national asset - a thing Poland still painfully lacks."

5000|$|On August 27, 2015 The Wedding {{posted on}} their {{official}} Facebook page {{that they are}} confirming a hiatus the following message was posted. [...] "Hey y'all. Been a minute! It's time to reconnect and break the silence. It's no secret that we fell off the map without a trace a couple years ago. We've {{gotten a lot of}} questions about the status of the band, what happened, and what's next. The truth is, we haven't made a statement thus far because there hasn't been anything to state. We never intended for the last tour we did to have been our last tour. We wrapped it up, headed on home as usual, and settled in until the next one. But between then and now I guess [...] "life" [...] just happened. Members got married, members had babies, members got cool job opportunities and started businesses, members began the adoption process, members filled in for other bands, members moved to new cities; and before we knew it two years had gone by and we still hadn't booked that next tour. That brings us to today.No, we didn't break up. We just went on an unplanned indefinite hiatus (to put it in [...] "band" [...] terms). For those that followed the band since the beginning you know we were road dogs. 200+ shows a year for nearly a decade. We were almost never home. And we liked it that way. We've all learned to love being home, too. It's been more of a struggle to adjust for some than others but all in all this is a good season. Will we play shows again? Maybe. Will we make another record? Maybe. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances?</b> To be honest, I don't think any of us have any idea. Touring and records cost a lot of money, more than we have. But I do know this: we talk about it often. Yes, talk is cheap, but talk keeps it in the realm of possibility.I tell you this not to give you false hope if you are into our band, but to let you know that if you are reading this then we care about you and we care that you care if we make music again. Whether it happens or not, please know that while we were a full-time band, you guys handed us the time of our lives on a silver platter. Yeah, we roughed it hard in a van driving through the night and playing smokey bars and sleeping on floors for a decade yada yada yada, but we really had the time of our lives. And the ONLY reason we could stay on the road is because you cared about our music and spent your hard earned money on show tickets and merchandise and records. That will never be unappreciated. More importantly, you showed up and connected with us, and gave us the opportunity to have a real connection with you, as we all connected with the bigger picture. We were definitely a live band. If you never got to see it, I don't know whether you are lucky or I should feel sorry for you because it was always messy. A loud messy chaotic rock n roll hurricane, every night, whether for 100 people that were into it or 1,000 people that hated it, we went hard and loved every minute.We are all still close, even in different states, as this is much more than a band to us. This is a brotherhood. And brotherhoods don't just fade out. So to answer your question, once and for all, no matter what: The Wedding will never die.

40|$|Abstract Background Hidden Markov {{models and}} hidden Boltzmann models are {{employed}} in computational biology {{and a variety of}} other scientific fields for a variety of analyses of sequential data. Whether <b>the</b> associated algorithms <b>are</b> used to compute an actual probability or, more generally, an odds ratio or some other score, a frequent requirement <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> error statistics of a given score <b>be</b> known. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> that random data would achieve that score or better? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> that a real signal would achieve a given score threshold? Results Here we present a novel general approach to estimating these false positive and true positive rates that is significantly more efficient than are existing general approaches. We validate the technique via an implementation within the HMMER 3. 0 package, which scans DNA or protein sequence databases for patterns of interest, using a profile-HMM. Conclusion <b>The</b> new approach <b>is</b> faster than general naïve sampling approaches, and more general than other current approaches. It provides an efficient mechanism by which to estimate error statistics for hidden Markov model and hidden Boltzmann model results. </p...|$|R
