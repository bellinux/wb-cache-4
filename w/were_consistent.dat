40|$|We {{introduce}} a natural generalization of Borel 2 ̆ 7 s Conjecture. For each infinite cardinal number κ, let BCκ denote this generalization. Then BCℵ 0 {{is equivalent to}} the classical Borel conjecture. Assuming the classical Borel conjecture, ¬BCℵ 1 {{is equivalent to the}} existence of a Kurepa tree of height ℵ 1. Using the connection of BCκ with a generalization of Kurepa 2 ̆ 7 s Hypothesis, we obtain the following consistency results: 1.

5|$|The {{occupation}} {{coincided with}} a religious revival in Belgium which had always been overwhelmingly Catholic. The Primate of Belgium, Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier, became {{an outspoken critic of}} the German occupation regime. Mercier published a celebrated pamphlet entitled Patriotisme et Endurance (Patriotism and Endurance) on Christmas Day 1914 which called for civilians to observe occupation laws only which <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> with Belgian patriotism and Christian values. The pamphlet attacked the authority of the German occupying government, stating that any rule legitimised by force alone should not be obeyed.|$|E
5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> with a perfect explosion.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{consistency}} of ZF is not provable in ZF, the weaker notion [...] is interesting in set theory (and in other sufficiently expressive axiomatic systems).

5|$|Around 25–33% {{of white}} dwarfs have metal lines in their spectra, which is notable because any heavy {{elements}} in a white dwarf should sink into the star's interior in just {{a small fraction of}} the star's lifetime. The prevailing explanation for metal-rich white dwarfs is that they have recently accreted rocky planetesimals. The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the metal lines. For example, a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> with those of a differentiated, rocky planet whose mantle had been eroded by the host star's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase.|$|E
5|$|At around 7:00a.m. on 9 March 2014, the Mexican Army and Navy pinpointed Moreno González's {{whereabouts}} in Tumbiscatío, Michoacán.

Mexico's Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) officially confirmed his identity through DNA examinations and fingerprint identification. The results <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> with law enforcement files. While investigators conducted the autopsy {{at a hospital in}} Apatzingán, more than 150 law enforcement officers from the Army, Navy, Federal Police, and the PGR cordoned the area to prevent organized crime members from attempting to steal his body. Post-mortem reports indicated that Moreno González died of two gunshot wounds on his thorax. On 12 March 2014, his corpse was transferred to Morelia under tight security for further testing. At the time of his death, the drug lord was wanted by the Mexican government for charges relating to drug trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping, murder, and theft.|$|E
5|$|However, a newer study {{compared}} incidence {{rates of}} skull lesions in Triceratops and Centrosaurus {{and showed that}} these <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head; as Centrosaurus was {{more closely related to}} Styracosaurus and both genera had long nasal horns, the results for this genus would be more applicable for Styracosaurus. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease.|$|E

5|$|Morchella sextelata is morphologically {{indistinguishable from}} several other morel {{species in the}} M.elata clade, {{including}} M.septimelata, M.brunnea, M.angusticeps, and M.septentrionalis. M.septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution: M.brunnea is found in non-burned forests of western North America; M.angusticeps is found east of the Rocky Mountains; and M.septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution (about 44°N northward) in eastern North America. M.septimelata, however, also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable from M.sextelata. Although there are subtle differences {{in the structure of}} the sterile ridges between the species, the authors were not confident that enough specimens had been examined to establish that these differences <b>were</b> <b>consistent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} that the severity of Frank's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion.

5|$|The {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, {{and his wife}} Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip. Princip {{was one of a}} group of six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by Danilo Ilić, a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia. The assassins' motives <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia. The assassination led directly to the First World War when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design.

5|$|The {{military}} occupation of Kampuchea had profound consequences for Vietnamese foreign policy. Since gaining independence in 1954, the Vietnamese communist perspective {{on foreign policy}} had been dominated {{by the need to}} maintain a world order of two camps, communist and non-communist. Indeed, the treaties of friendship that Vietnam signed with the Soviet Union, Laos and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea <b>were</b> <b>consistent</b> with that view. However, the ideological motivations of the Vietnamese communist leadership were proven to be limited and heavily flawed, as demonstrated by the 1979 condemnation of Vietnam after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime. In the years that followed, the Vietnamese Government was left isolated from the world and its efforts to rebuild the country were handicapped by the lack of aid from the capitalist Western nations. Furthermore, the presence of Vietnamese military forces in Cambodia became an obstacle which prevented the normalisation of diplomatic ties with China, the United States and the member nations of ASEAN.|$|E
