5000|$|Following {{development}} of the A470 in the late 1960s, its distinct <b>winding</b> <b>head</b> gear in blue with very long backstays supported by transitional struts, became a distinct welcoming sign for travellers towards Merthyr Tydfil.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the fact, {{that the}} winding should be mostly {{positioned}} {{parallel to the}} winding flange, meeting an orthogonality condition, {{it is necessary to}} adjust the winding width to the number of turns per layer of the winding. In particular for noncircular shaped coil cross-sectional areas, it is desired to locate the crossover area to the small side of the coil body, also called <b>winding</b> <b>head.</b> This is due to the fact, that noncircular coils are being mounted on a sheet metal package or in a circular arrangement. The coils should be rather small, in order to avoid a contact with the neighboring coil or the sheet metal package. For orthocyclic round coils three winding geometries can be defined: ...|$|E

50|$|After {{inserting}} {{the winding}}, rework on the stator or the winding ends {{needs to be}} performed. Usually, the multitude of connecting lines is separated manually and bundled according to the different phases. Both winding ends are tied up with an adhesive tape or strap in the further course of the finishing. When using a high operating voltage, the partial winding of each phase must be insulated against the respective adjacent phase with foil or insulation paper. To ensure that the winding heads are positioned exclusively {{at the back of}} the stator, both of them must be molded. This is either executed by using an enameled wire receiving a bonding electric current during molding or by cold forming which is followed by impregnation. The creation of a certain <b>winding</b> <b>head</b> shape allows a rotor to be installed or a stator to be inserted into the housing afterwards.|$|E
50|$|To {{efficiently}} wind {{the pole}} shoes lying close together of electronically commutated multipole three-phase motors, {{they will be}} coated with insulation and directly wound with the needle winding method. A needle with a nozzle that is placed at a right angle to the direction of movement travels in a lifting motion passing the stator packs through the groove channel between the two neighboring poles of the motor to drop the wire in the desired place. The stator is then turned at the reversal point on the <b>winding</b> <b>head</b> by one tooth pitch so that the previous process can run again in reverse order. With this winding technology a specific layer structure can be realized. The disadvantage is {{that there must be}} a clearance between two adjacent poles with a size of at least the nozzle diameter. The nozzle diameter is about three times the diameter of the winding wire. The space between two adjacent poles can therefore not be filled completely.|$|E
50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with distributed winding {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the asynchronous machine with distributed winding can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to concentrated winding, not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the stator slots covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the stator slots that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete phase winding during the same time.Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the insertion tool that the coil groups are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large <b>winding</b> <b>head</b> that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|E

40|$|Digital {{fabrication}} tools, specifically {{additive manufacturing}} systems, have consistently advanced in efficiencies such as print speed, gantry size, material cost {{and ease of}} use. However most of these systems remain limited {{in their ability to}} enable automated mixing and extrusion of multiple materials with variable properties on large scales. This thesis focuses on the first steps of realizing this enabling technology by operating across two distinct trajectories. The first aims at digitally controlling precision path placement of material with high levels of tunability through analog mixing, while the second explores do-it-yourself tool customization, compactness, portability and the possibility of fabrication node-to-node communication. Inspired by the silkworm's ability to spin highly sophisticated and tunable material architectures, the aim of this thesis is to develop an enabling technology for digital fabrication requiring high levels of material tunability in product and architectural scales. Specifically, I designed, developed, built and evaluated an array of six unique customizable and compact deposition heads for tunable material properties. Amongst those tools is a freeform extrusion head for tunable geometry without the need for auxiliary support structure; a fast thread deposition head and a fiber <b>winding</b> <b>head</b> for tunable compressive and tensile strength respectively; a portable cable-suspended paste droplet extrusion head for tunable drop size of paste material; and a chitosan gel extrusion head for tunable plasticity using biomaterials. Operating across the two trajectories of tunability and portability, this thesis argues that highly tunable, compact and portable extrusion heads developed within a Fab Lab environment can support variable property printing of one or more materials outside of commercial based systems. This capability will in the future enable the digital fabrication of larger-scale prototypes, sustainable products and architectural structures inspired by nature in Fab Lab settings. by Jared Smith Laucks.

5000|$|In {{the extreme}} cases {{springing}} may cause severe fatigue cracking of critical structural details, especially in moderate to rough head seas with low peak periods. Vibration is normally more easily excited by waves {{in ballast condition}} than in cargo condition. The converse may also be true since some ships experience more <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> and waves in ballast conditions, while other ships may experience more <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> and waves in cargo condition, thereby vibrating less overall.|$|R

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} equations {{of motion}} with wind shear terms were {{used to analyze the}} stability and motions of a jet transport. A positive wind shear gives a decreasing <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> or changes a <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> into a tail wind. A negative wind shear gives a decreasing tail wind or changes a tail <b>wind</b> into a <b>head</b> <b>wind.</b> It was found that wind shear had very little effect on the short period mode and that negative wind shear, although it affected the phugoid, did not cause stability problems. On the other hand, it was found that positive wind shear can cause the phugoid to become aperiodic and unstable. In this case, a stability boundary for the phugoid was found that is valid for most aircraft at all flight speeds. Calculations of aircraft motions confirmed the results of the stability analysis. It was found that a flight path control automatic pilot and an airspeed control system provide good control in all types of wind shear. Appendixes give {{equations of motion}} that include the effects of downdrafts and updrafts and extend the longitudinal equations of motion for shear to six degrees of freedom...|$|R

The severity of these reductions increased as the mean head-wind value of the profile increased. When constant-groundspeed approaches were made in the same wind profiles, there were no losses in landing capacity. In an analysis of mean <b>head</b> <b>winds,</b> it was determined that in a mean <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> of 35 knots, the landing capacity using constant-airspeed approaches was 13 % less than for the no wind condition.
