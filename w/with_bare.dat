5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' livers <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E

25|$|Boxing {{experienced}} a revival in Britain around the 17th century. Many bouts were fought <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> knuckles {{and with no}} standard rules until Jack Broughton introduced boxing rules known as Broughton's Law in the 18th century, where the gloves were used for practice purposes only. However, many boxers still chose to fight <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> knuckles until 1867 when gloves were mandated by the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.|$|E
25|$|The art of Mathura {{features}} frequent sexual imagery. Female images <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> breasts, nude {{below the}} waist, displaying labia and female genitalia are common. These images are more sexually explicit {{than those of}} earlier or later periods.|$|E

25|$|Alain Robert's autobiography, <b>With</b> <b>Bare</b> Hands, {{was first}} {{published}} in English in 2008. It features his development into a famous urban climber from his days as a child and gives a deep insight into his philosophy and how he managed to overcome his disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Many {{nucleophilic}} substitutions occur {{more easily}} not <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> pyridine but with pyridine modified with bromine, chlorine, fluorine, or sulfonic acid fragments that then become a leaving group. So fluorine {{is the best}} leaving group for the substitution with organolithium compounds. The nucleophilic attack compounds may be alkoxides, thiolates, amines, and ammonia (at elevated pressures).|$|E

25|$|The {{church of}} Sant'Ignazio {{remained}} unfinished <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> ceilings even after its consecration in 1642. Disputes {{with the original}} donors, the Ludovisi, prevented {{the completion of the}} planned dome. Pozzo expediently proposed to make an illusionistic dome, when viewed from inside, by painting on canvas. It was impressive to viewers, but controversial; some feared the canvas would soon darken.|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{and many}} of its {{chemical}} compounds, especially organomercury compounds, can also be readily absorbed through direct contact <b>with</b> <b>bare,</b> or in some cases (such as methylmercury) insufficiently protected, skin. Mercury and its compounds are commonly used in chemical laboratories, hospitals, dental clinics, and facilities involved in the production of items such as fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, and explosives.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{the core}} (metal)-shell (dielectric) {{nanoparticle}} has demonstrated a zero backward scattering with enhanced forward scattering on Si substrate when surface plasmon {{is located in}} front of a solar cell. The core-shell nanoparticles can support simultaneously both electric and magnetic resonances, demonstrating entirely new properties when compared <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> metallic nanoparticles if the resonances are properly engineered.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{displaying}} {{of female}} breasts is not regarded as immodest. Balinese women {{can often be}} seen <b>with</b> <b>bared</b> chests; however, a display of the thigh is considered immodest.

25|$|The tomb bat prefers {{sites where}} there is {{overhead}} shelter, but are situated in exposed positions for easier take off. T. mauritianus's natural roosting locations include the trunks of palm trees, caves, and crevices. With the arrival of humans, they have adapted {{to a variety of}} new locations such as the sides of buildings and, as their name implies, tombs. They prefer buildings <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> brick surfaces as opposed to painted ones, as it offers better grip. They choose their day roosts so that take-off is unhindered by obstacles inhibiting flight.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to find conspicuous variations amongst individuals <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> eyes, definite features are unique to each individual. For example, the abdominal spots on males of P. dominula vary in sizes, locations, and patterns. They act as sexually selective signals and also are used to determine social hierarchy within the colonies. Males with smaller, regular patterns of spots were more aggressive and dominant over those that had larger, irregular patterns. Similarly, morphology of females also varies between individuals. The larger and the more scattered the clypeus marks on the foundress are, the higher the chance for her to be dominant over other females.|$|E
25|$|However, the spruce {{dominated}} forest (some birch) {{covers a}} much larger area, and Nord-Trøndelag is the second largest timber producing county in Norway (after Hedmark). The forest and highland in Nord-Trøndelag is one of few places in Norway with four species of deer (moose, roe deer, red deer and reindeer). There are mountains near the border with Sweden, and coastal mountains <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> rock at the northern coast. The spruce forests occurs even at the coast, where some areas are classified as temperate rainforest (boreal rainforest, see Scandinavian coastal conifer forests). There are several national parks in the county, among them Blåfjella–Skjækerfjella National Park (one {{of the largest in}} Norway), Børgefjell National Park (partly), Lierne National Park and Skarvan and Roltdalen National Park (partly).|$|E
60|$|He scolded Numa {{and tried}} to drive the great beast away; but only angry growls rewarded his efforts. He tore small {{branches}} from a nearby limb and hurled them at his ancient enemy. Numa looked up <b>with</b> <b>bared</b> fangs, grinning hideously, {{but he did not}} rise from his kill.|$|R
60|$|Van Horn {{had missed}} nothing of it. Before, in his time, {{he had seen}} young dogs frightened into genuine fits by their first {{encounters}} with heaven-filling, sky-obscuring, down-impending sails.

25|$|An unusual feeding {{strategy}} {{is that of}} the oxpeckers of Africa. They perch on living animals and glean parasites from the animals' hides. On furry animals, such as buffalo, giraffe, and donkey, these birds run their bills through the fur of the animal, using a scissors-like motion to extract ticks and lice from near the skin. When they pull the insect out {{to the end of the}} fur, they catch it and eat it. (On animals <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> hides, such as rhinoceros and hippopotamus, oxpeckers pick at any open wounds the animals happen to have, consuming blood and pus, and possibly keeping the wounds free of maggots.) Historically, rhinoceros and other large wild mammals have been among the favored hosts, but as the populations of large mammals in the African savanna have declined in modern times, the population and range of both red-billed and yellow-billed oxpecker have also changed, and now the birds will use donkeys and domestic cattle as hosts.|$|E

500|$|When Olmsted first {{examined}} the property, {{he saw a}} field filled <b>with</b> <b>bare</b> trees and decided to maintain its character by creating a meadow surrounded by trees. [...] His plan for the park called for sheep to graze {{as a means of}} keeping the grass short. Cornell convinced Olmsted to include sporting areas, although Olmsted wanted a more natural feel to the park, which included a [...] lake. [...] The Western division was renamed Washington Park in 1881.|$|E
