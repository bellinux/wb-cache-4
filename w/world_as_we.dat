The data was gathered from four practicing person-centred counsellors using semi-structured interviews and subsequently analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Findings from the data showed that our friendships are impacted both negatively but largely positively by our training. Emerging themes include notions such as outgrowth and the collision of <b>worlds</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> try to integrate our changes into our lives. A major theme was that we become enriched by our new ways of relating and seek this out from all our friendships and that our friendship landscape necessarily changes <b>as</b> <b>we</b> consciously engage with the core conditions.

In Tippett's words, this is an attempt [...] to deal [...] "with those fundamental matters that bear upon man, his relationship with Time, {{his place in the}} <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it and in the mysterious universe at large". The oratorio was commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra for its centenary, and was one of several of Tippett's late compositions that were premièred in America.|$|E
500|$|The {{season has}} {{received}} largely positive reviews from critics.

Each takes place in a fantastical land peopled with strange, somewhat disturbing characters and has at its center a young male person or person-like thing making his way in that world with the help of unusual, not always reliable, mentors." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the show is [...] "not unlike CN's earlier Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, about a boy and his imaginary friend, though darker and stranger and even less connected to the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it."

500|$|In {{speculative}} fiction, extrapolation allows {{writers to}} focus {{not on the}} way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called [...] "cognitive estrangement": the recognition that what we are reading is not the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.|$|E
500|$|Introspectively, {{the world}} of {{conscious}} experience seems to have considerable structure. [...] Immanuel Kant asserted that the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> perceive it is organized according {{to a set of}} fundamental [...] "intuitions", which include object (we perceive the world as a set of distinct things); shape; quality (color, warmth, etc.); space (distance, direction, and location); and time. Some of these constructs, such as space and time, correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics; for others the correspondence is not as clear. Understanding the physical basis of qualities, such as redness or pain, has been particularly challenging. David Chalmers has called this the hard problem of consciousness. Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable, because qualities ("qualia") are ineffable; that is, they are [...] "raw feels", incapable of being analyzed into component processes. Other psychologists and neuroscientists reject these arguments. For example, research on ideasthesia shows that qualia are organised into a semantic-like network. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that the}} relationship between a physical entity such as light and a perceptual quality such as color is extraordinarily complex and indirect, as demonstrated by a variety of optical illusions such as neon color spreading.|$|E
500|$|Sunsoft was not {{interested}} in the game for PC, and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn felt like {{they did not have to}} second-guess their choices and could [...] "explore the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were designing" [...] and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in Myst and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they wanted to make sure that clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: [...] "once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven’t done a good job. But if they blame themselves, then we have." ...|$|E

500|$|The B-52's and R.E.M. became by far {{the most}} famous musical {{products}} of Athens in the 1980s, when both bands launched a string of hits. Their roots in the city's local scene go back to the 1970s and early 1980s. The B-52's formed after a St. Valentine's Day party in 1977. The members had little musical knowledge, but performed new wave music with a cheeky and humorous image and sound. They were known for their campy thrift store fashion, and their unusual and eye-catching music videos for hits like [...] "Rock Lobster" [...] and [...] "Love Shack". Though the B-52's were the first Athens band to achieve national prominence, their popularity was soon eclipsed by R.E.M.. The future members of the band R.E.M. moved to Athens to work and/or attend the University of Georgia, including bassist Mike Mills and former drummer Bill Berry. The group began performing as R.E.M. in 1980. They became locally prominent, and released a single, [...] "Radio Free Europe", that was a major college rock hit. Their popularity grew with a series of singles, EPs and albums that made R.E.M. the top underground band in the country, finally breaking into the mainstream with 1987's [...] "The One I Love" [...] and [...] "It's the End of the <b>World</b> <b>as</b> <b>We</b> Know It (And I Feel Fine)". By 1991's Out of Time album— which featured vocals by Kate Pierson of The B-52s— and its acclaimed follow-up Automatic for the People (named after the motto of Weaver D's, a local Athens soul-food eatery), R.E.M. had become one of the world's biggest rock bands. The band's style went through many evolutions but originally had a jangle pop sound and harmonies often compared to folk-rock band The Byrds; singer and songwriter Michael Stipe is known for obscure, allusive lyrics delivered in a monotonous drone. The success of R.E.M. and the B-52's brought attention from major labels and music media to Athens, and many local bands received a career boost.|$|E

Thus panentheism separates itself from pantheism, positing the extra claim that God exists above and beyond the <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it.
