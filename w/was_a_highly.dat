5|$|The Eurymedon <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> {{significant}} {{victory for}} the Delian League, which probably ended {{once and for all}} the threat of another Persian invasion of Greece. It also seems to have prevented any Persian attempt to reconquer the Asiatic Greeks until at least 451 BC. The accession of further cities of Asia Minor to the Delian league, particularly from Caria, probably followed Cimon's campaign there.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station {{was a source of}} electricity for local homes. The building of a power station brought major environmental improvements to what <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{hindered}} by knee injuries in {{his senior season}} in high school, Croyle <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> recruited prospect by Louisiana State University, Florida State University, and the University of Alabama. On the night Croyle was ready to announce his decision to attend Florida State, {{he changed his mind}} and chose Alabama, his father's alma mater, instead. In Croyle's four years playing for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team, he set numerous school records, and was a finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award. Croyle led the Crimson Tide to the 2006 Cotton Bowl Classic and was named the game's offensive MVP.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began after}} the release of Tales of Eternia in 2000, taking {{approximately}} two years to complete, and was the last Tales game to be developed by the original Wolfteam before it became Namco Tales Studio. The scenario was handled by Japanese writing company Gekko, the characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, and the music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura. The PSP port was made after a similar port of Eternia met with commercial success. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> anticipated game, and Namco promoted it heavily in the months prior to release. The game sold over 700,000 units by January 2003, and received critical acclaim from both Japanese and western critics.|$|E
5|$|Governor John P. Richardson {{had been}} elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with {{opposition}} from Tillman's farmers. As {{had been done to}} Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> talented stump speaker, and when given the opportunity to debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to coaching, Auerbach <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> effective mentor; several players coached by Auerbach would become successful coaches themselves. Bill Russell won two titles as Auerbach's successor, Tom Heinsohn won {{a pair of}} championships as a Celtics coach in the 1970s, K.C. Jones led the Celtics to two further titles in the 1980s, and Bill Sharman coached the Los Angeles Lakers to their first title in 1972. In addition, prototypical sixth man Don Nelson had a highly successful coaching career and joined his mentor Auerbach as one of 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his batting, Brown <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> regarded fieldsman known for his fitness. He developed his skills through persistent training with professional sprinters {{in order to improve}} his anticipation and speed off the mark. Brown often fielded at slip or in the covers. With Australia boasting the leg spin pairing of O'Reilly and Grimmett in the 1930s, close-catchers were frequently used. Along with Fingleton, Brown often fielded in the leg trap position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1793, war and {{internal}} disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following {{the collapse of the}} harvest. France's ongoing conflict with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the National Convention was the United States. Importing food from the Americas <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> risky venture, as the British Royal Navy—at war with France since early 1793—patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1826, Honório Hermeto {{married his}} 17-year-old first cousin Maria Henriqueta Neto, the {{daughter}} of his father's brother João Neto Carneiro Leme. Unlike his brother, João Neto was a rich and influential man. Honório Hermeto and Maria Henriqueta had five children: Honório, Henrique (later Baron of Paraná), Maria Emília, Maria Henriqueta and Pedro. The advantageous marriage allowed Honório Hermeto to become a slave owner, assume his uncle's business, which included domestic slave trading, and later, in the 1830s, purchase a coffee farm {{in the province of}} Rio de Janeiro. Coffee was quickly becoming Brazil's most important export commodity and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> lucrative crop.|$|E

Andrew and his retinue left Kraków for Italy on 10 September 1583. He visited Charles Borromeo, archbishop of Milan, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> respected prelate and {{regarded as a}} living saint for his piety in his diocese. After their meeting, Borromeo wrote a spiritual instruction to him. In Milan, Andrew also met Giovanni Botero who described him as an actual representative of anti-Machiavellianism. A Protestant retainer of Andrew, Ferenc Forgách, converted to Catholicism in the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto on 21 November.|$|E

5|$|The 1935 Jérémie {{hurricane}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> destructive and catastrophic {{tropical cyclone}} that impacted the Greater Antilles and Honduras in October 1935, killing well over 2,000 people. Developing on October 18 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the storm proceeded to strike eastern Jamaica and southeastern Cuba while overwhelming southwestern Haiti in a deluge of rain. The hurricane—a Category 1 at its peak—completed an unusual reversal of its path on October 23, heading southwestward toward Central America. Weakened by its interaction with Cuba, the storm soon regained strength and made its final landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios in Honduras on October 25. The cyclone weakened upon moving inland and dissipated two days later.|$|E

5|$|The 2011–12 season {{would inevitably}} {{be a new}} era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence {{and the loss of}} 6th-man Lorin Dixon left {{significant}} holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E

Allardyce was later sacked by new owners the Venky's on 13 December 2010, with Rovers placed 13th in the league. He was replaced {{by one of his}} coaches, Steve Kean, whose agent Jerome Anderson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> influential figure with the Venky family.|$|E
5|$|The end {{of silent}} {{film in the}} West and in Japan was imposed by the {{industry}} and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>highly</b> pleasurable and fully mature form.

As a cinema owner you didn't have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.|$|E

The BT38C of 1972 was Brabham's first production monocoque and the first not designed by Tauranac. Although 40 were ordered, it was less successful than its predecessors. The angular BT41 was the final Formula Three Brabham.|$|E
