5|$|After Cimon's ostracism, Pericles {{continued}} {{to promote a}} populist social policy. He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays <b>without</b> <b>paying,</b> with the state covering {{the cost of their}} admission. With other decrees he lowered the property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454BC. His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} of negotiations, Blizzard decided that the Korean e-Sports Players Association (KeSPA) was unwilling to {{cooperate}} with them {{in regards to the}} sharing of profits from competitive StarCraft multiplayer games. This breakdown led to an uncertain future of KeSPA's legal ability to broadcast Blizzard's intellectual property of both StarCraft and StarCraft II <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> royalties. MBC Television agreed to Blizzard's new terms in June 2010; KeSPA received a license from Blizzard and Ongamenet will host StarCraft II competitions starting in the summer of 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} put up for sale in summer 2010, and Allardyce was offered the job of {{managing}} Al-Ahli Dubai, but could not secure permission to leave Blackburn <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> compensation to the club and so remained in charge at Ewood Park. Allardyce was later sacked by new owners the Venky's on 13 December 2010, with Rovers placed 13th in the league. He was replaced {{by one of his}} coaches, Steve Kean, whose agent Jerome Anderson was a highly influential figure with the Venky family.|$|E
50|$|Unpaid leave: To {{avoid being}} fired as a {{cost-cutting}} measure, an employee may agree {{to take time}} off <b>without</b> <b>pay,</b> either spread out over a long period (e.g., taking off one day a week <b>without</b> <b>pay</b> over a year), or concentrated (e.g., taking off one month <b>without</b> <b>pay).</b>|$|R

50|$|The unwillingness of the {{government}} to pay for the Yeomanry led to many corps being disbanded in 1827-28. Twenty-two corps were authorised to continue officially, and another sixteen were allowed to continue to serve <b>without</b> <b>pay.</b> Serving <b>without</b> <b>pay</b> from 1828 to 1831, the Regiment was never disbanded.|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction. However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement. In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world Second Life. Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed them to continue <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> licensing fees.|$|E
5|$|Mills and workers' {{settlements}} {{were established}} at Belper, Darley Abbey, and Milford by Arkwright's competitors. Arkwright-type mills were {{so successful that}} sometimes they were copied <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> royalties to Richard Arkwright. The cotton industry in the Derwent Valley went into decline {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century as the market shifted towards Lancashire which was better position in relation to markets and raw materials. The mills and their associated buildings are well preserved and have been reused since the cotton industry declined. Many of the buildings within the World Heritage Site are also listed buildings and Scheduled Monuments. Some of the mills now contain museums and are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Moe {{speaks to}} Homer {{through the bars}} of his jail cell window and {{promises}} to bail him out, but changes his mind when Renee talks about wanting to vacation in Hawaii. While packing for the trip, Moe is confronted by his own conscience, {{in the form of}} Homer, who makes him feel bad for his betrayal. Moe ends up telling Renee the truth about the insurance fraud scheme, and she is at first happy he was honest. However, when Moe starts scheming again for a way to get Homer out of jail <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> the bail, Renee is disgusted and leaves him.|$|E

5|$|Several local {{businesses}} considered contributing {{money to the}} mountain's purchase. Such funding would be considered surplus, {{and would not be}} subject to referendum. Owners of businesses on Main Street expressed concern at the June1 town board meeting that the cost of parking would increase if the property was purchased by a third party. One board member estimated that <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> rent, the town would recoup the cost of the property within 12 years. Ulster County Area Transit expressed a desire to route its buses through the property, creating a connection to the Mohonk Preserve. A nonprofit organization, the Joppenbergh Mountain Preservation Association, was created in June 2011 to raise funding to purchase the mountain, the parking lot, and Willow Kiln Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{recording}} {{became the}} subject of a legal dispute between the band and Secor in later years. The band accused Secor of selling the tape <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> royalties, and attempted {{to put a stop to}} his distribution with help of lawyer Joe Escalante of The Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. Kung Fu digitally remixed and remastered the demo and commercially re-released it in October 1998, deleting two original tracks for other recordings from the original session. Kung Fu has since reportedly sold 300,000 copies of Buddha. It is currently the only commercially available demo by Blink-182.|$|E
5|$|The tea ship Dartmouth {{arrived in}} the Boston Harbor in late November, and Adams wrote a {{circular}} letter calling for a mass meeting {{to be held at}} Faneuil Hall on November 29. Thousands of people arrived, so many that the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House. British law required the Dartmouth to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo. The mass meeting passed a resolution introduced by Adams urging the captain of the Dartmouth to send the ship back <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> the import duty. Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the tea from being unloaded.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, CNHI {{implemented}} mandatory furloughs {{for most}} non-sales staff, requiring employees {{to take a}} mandatory week off <b>without</b> <b>pay</b> every quarter. As of 2015, these DOWOP (days off <b>without</b> <b>pay)</b> were still in effect. Also in 2014, most CNHI newspaper sites put a paywall into place, requiring readers to subscribe after reading 5 articles.|$|R

He became a coach (répétiteur) <b>without</b> <b>pay</b> on 23 May 1808 {{and professor of}} singing preparation (préparation au chant) on 1 July, again <b>without</b> <b>pay.</b> He was a student of Charles Simon Catel, a professor of harmony, and won a second prize in harmony in 1810.|$|R

5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> import duties. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936, Romania {{placed an}} order for 126; the bulk of these were {{delivered}} {{from the end of}} 1938 by Škoda. Afghanistan ordered ten in 1940; but, these were sold instead to Bulgaria. Total production was 434, including 298 for the Czechoslovak Army, 126 for Romania (under the designation Škoda R-2) and ten for Bulgaria. The Wehrmacht used 218 vehicles captured from the Czechoslovak Army in March 1939. Britain's Alvis-Staussler negotiated for a production license from September 1938 until March 1939 when the Nazi occupation made an agreement impossible. The Soviets were also interested so Škoda shipped the S-II-a prototype and one production LT vz. 35 to the proving grounds at Kubinka for evaluation. The Soviets were only interested in buying the prototype, but Škoda refused to sell unless a license was purchased as well, believing that the Soviets would simply copy the design and build it <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> any royalties.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E

5|$|John Ebers, a bookseller, {{took over}} the {{management}} of the theatre in 1821, and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas (La gazza ladra, Il turco in Italia, Mosè in Egitto, Otello, La donna del lago, Matilde di Shabran and Ricciardo e Zoraide) took place there in the following three years. Ebers sublet the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824, and Rossini was invited to conduct, remaining for a five-month season, with his wife Isabella Colbran performing. Two more of his operas, Zelmira and Semiramide, received their British premieres during the season, but the theatre sustained huge losses and Benelli absconded <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> either the composer or the artists. Ebers engaged Giuditta Pasta for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his bookselling business.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. copyright laws at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders or music rolls for player pianos. Edison Records paid popular singers like Harry Macdonough to sing the songs and then sold the recordings <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted papers with the U.S. State Department asking for an extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.|$|E

5|$|While her car {{is being}} serviced, Amy checks into the B where she meets Val and Eric and {{claims to be}} a trainee nurse to get a discount; but tells Victoria that she is {{actually}} 16 and has run away from foster care. Victoria tries to sneak Amy out <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> but Val catches her so she offers to pay her debt by working for them. The police arrive and inform Val that Amy stole her foster parents' car and she leaves with a social worker. Victoria stays in touch with Amy and when she runs away again, Victoria hides her in the B's basement. Val finds her and lets her stay but Eric insists she leave. Amy visits Val again and tells her that her foster parents have separated and she is moving to a care home. Amy locks herself in a bathroom and workers at the care home telephone Val, claiming she will not come out until Val arrives. Val arranges for Amy to stay at the B and later fosters her.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} <b>without</b> <b>paying</b> customers. The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this {{was rejected by the}} Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were rejected by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations would be based on their own resources. Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were rejected by the CAA, who stated that this was a typical post-excuse and that in case of a courtesy trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E
