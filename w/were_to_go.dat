The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be necessary if troops <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ashore by 7 June.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc {{compilation}} album entitled New Moon {{was released}} by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label, songs that were not included on albums, {{as well as a}} few early versions and previously released B-sides. In the United States, the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic's 15th best-reviewed album of 2007. A portion of the proceeds from album sales <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If you <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> outside {{on a clear}} night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

50|$|This {{is both a}} fideicommissary and {{a direct}} {{substitution}} in respect of the same persons. For example, the testator leaves “my farm to A, and on his death it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> B; if A dies before me it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> B.” The object of this double substitution which was in use in former times <b>was</b> <b>to</b> ensure that B would succeed if the fideicommissum collapsed owing to the fiduciary predeceasing the testator.
