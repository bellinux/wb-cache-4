500|$|On 8 December, PewDiePie's channel reached 50 million subscribers, {{becoming}} the first YouTube channel to do so. After reaching the milestone, PewDiePie tweeted [...] "will delete tomorrow 5pm gmt," [...] in reference to his channel, before later uploading a celebratory video featuring fireworks. Ultimately, he did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead shut down the joke Jack septiceye2 channel, stating [...] "You know <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a joke and it just blows up way bigger than you'd imagined?" [...] PewDiePie's stunt received negative reception from Fortune. The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who has noticed that his videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting {{him as much as}} he thinks they should." [...] On 18 December 2016, he received a Ruby Play Button from YouTube as a reward for hitting 50 million subscribers.|$|E
500|$|Antonov {{described}} his inspiration from London as [...] "a big metropolis, it's messy, it's chaotic and intense...and it's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans". He highlighted {{the importance of}} that familiarity to different cultures because [...] "you want to communicate {{to a lot of}} people <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a new piece of fiction". He said that Edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs, which were combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov said was not comparable to the brass, rivets, and steam of steampunk design. Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh for research, taking photographs of people, places, and objects. The pair avoided the busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that would better suit the game's world. Mitton stated: [...] "We were trying to design the game from a rat's viewpoint...if we have a small city, from a constrained viewpoint, what are all the different angles that we can explore?". Inspiration also came from the artwork of John Atkinson Grimshaw, Canaletto, and Gustave Doré. The world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so the designers were clear on where each mission takes place.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans for {{what we were going to}} do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> your own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E

2500|$|Not {{unlike the}} earlier {{exchange}} with Henrietta, the conversation between Leopold and Mme Fisher is uncomfortable {{and at times}} Mme Fisher is blunt, even cruel. She attempts to explain Karen's unique nature to the disconsolate boy, abandoning any of those delicacies requested in Marian Grant Moody's earlier letter. She explains Leopold his history, including {{the details of his}} birth, the death of his half-sibling, his adoption, and his general displacement in the world. Leopold begs to remain in the house, exclaiming, [...] "At Spezia when I am angry I go full of smoke inside, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> me angry I see everything." [...] At this point Miss Fisher returns to the room and whisks Leopold away again.|$|E

2500|$|On 20 April 2014 they {{released}} a new single titled [...] "Down". Their new album, Listen, {{was released on}} 8 September 2014. According to reports, singer Luke Pritchard and 25-year-old London-based hip hop producer Inflo share co-producing credits. This is their first album with new drummer Alexis Nunez. In an interview in July 2014, Pritchard stated that Listen includes more improvisation and found that “that kind of fearlessness <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> the first album kind of crept back in.” Upon its release, the album debuted at No.16 on the UK Albums Chart, then fell to No.57 the week after, and the next week dropped off the chart. A remix album for Listen, entitled Hello, What's Your Name?, was released on 4 December 2015. It features remixes by Jack Beats, The Nextmen, Montmartre and Kove among others.|$|E
2500|$|Belle is an {{influential}} proponent {{of discipline and}} control in parkour, saying, [...] "Precision is all about being measured," [...] and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master. [...] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time {{but it does not}} mean anything. It can be luck or chance. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> a jump, {{you have to do it}} at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times." [...] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{sound was}} praised. Arnold Katayev, {{reviewer}} of PSX Extreme, stated that [...] "Gran Turismo 5 actually sounds fantastic. Having sampled {{a number of}} cars in the game that I either own, drive frequently, or have driven numerous times before, I've verified how they all sound. My 350Z sounded pitch perfect as you start it up upon selecting it. Same goes for my 370Z, it sounds spot on. Even a bunch of the standard cars sounded good, and sound even better with a few exhaust mods", while TweakTown said that [...] "some cars just sounding flat when you feel they shouldn’t, and others just sending a shiver up your spine as you hit redline". Gamingreality awarded the sound 9/10, stating that [...] "The sounds are clear, crisp, and distinct. The engine sounds are great and {{make you feel like}} the car is actually near you. The engine sounds on premium cars change <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> adjustments to it just like in real life".|$|E

2500|$|On October 21, O'Keefe and Giles {{released}} {{video footage}} of their {{visit to the}} Philadelphia office of ACORN at a National Press Club conference. They claimed it was to show they had received help there, after an ACORN spokesman had said that the pair {{had been asked to}} leave the Philadelphia office. The Washington Post [...] "obtained a July 24 police report that showed police were called when O'Keefe and Giles attempted their sting at ACORN's Philadelphia offices—and that the couple were escorted out of those offices." [...] Susan Kinzie of The Washington Post noted that [...] "the heavily edited footage includes audio of the two conservatives but none of the ACORN Housing Corp. worker's responses to their questions." [...] Junette Marcano, a board member of Philadelphia ACORN, said, [...] "This is a targeted assault to disenfranchise our members because ... the right-wing agenda is to stop us from empowering people of low and moderate incomes. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> the poor powerful, the powerful feel threatened." ...|$|E
2500|$|The deal {{generated}} controversy after Canadian channel TSN {{had announced}} that the trade was complete, then claimed that the Flames had balked at completing the deal, believing they would need their players for a scheduled game. Consequently, Jokinen appeared in his final game with the Flames knowing through the media {{that he was to}} be traded afterward. When the trade was officially made, Jokinen bluntly described his feelings on the deal: [...] "It’s a brutal business. That’s the way it goes. It comes with the salary. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> $5 million, 11 goals is not going to cut it. ... It’s definitely {{a slap in the face}} to get traded." [...] Jokinen scored 15 points in 21 games with the Rangers. In the final game of the season, New York faced the Philadelphia Flyers with the winner qualifying for the final playoff spot. Regulation time ended with the two teams tied, and the game ultimately went to a shootout. Jokinen came up as the Rangers' final shooter, with Philadelphia leading by one goal. His shot was stopped by Brian Boucher, ending their season.|$|E
2500|$|Petracca {{ultimately}} {{made his}} debut in round six against St Kilda at Etihad Stadium in a 39-point loss; there was strong hype surrounding his debut, however, {{his performance in}} his debut was labelled as a glimpse of his potential by News Corp Australia journalists, Adam Baldwin and Jay Clark. In his second match he kicked his first AFL goal, finishing with two for the match; his second goal, in which he broke away from his opponent and tapped the ball to himself from the ground, saw former [...] forward, Jonathan Brown, praise his skill by stating [...] "jeez...it's a simple game <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> it look that easy." [...] In his fourth match, he recorded twenty-one disposals, eleven score involvements and seven tackles in the sixty-three point win against the Brisbane Lions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which saw him rewarded with the round nine nomination for the Rising Star. The match drew high praise {{from the head of}} football writer at the Herald Sun, Mark Robinson, while teammate, Jack Watts, labelled him an [...] "absolute beast".|$|E

2500|$|Several actors {{from the}} {{original}} film returned to make Gremlins 2, including Galligan, Cates, and Dick Miller. Miller reprised his role as Billy's neighbor Mr. Futterman, who the gremlins severely injured (both physically and mostly mentally) in the first film, in an expanded role in this film. In the second, he plays a part in wiping out the creatures by dousing one in cement and using the building's fire hose against the others. Character actress Jackie Joseph returned to play Mr. Futterman's wife, and there were also brief reappearances in the movie theatre sequence from Belinda Balaski as a complaining mother and Kenneth Tobey as the projectionist. Keye Luke also returned to play Mr. Wing, Gizmo's original owner. When Luke heard his character would die in Gremlins 2, he quipped, [...] "Remember, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> Gremlins 3, I'm a flashback!". Hoyt Axton was meant to return as Billy's father, the inventor. He would have appeared {{at the end of}} the film, having designed special clothing for Gizmo that would ensure Gizmo would never come into contact with water again. At the last moment, the filmmakers decided not to shoot the scene to reduce time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Morrison {{recalled}} that he recorded the songs about {{four weeks after}} writing them: [...] "Veedon Fleece {{was a bunch of}} songs that I wrote and then I just recorded it about four weeks after I wrote it. [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> an album you write some songs; you might have four songs and maybe you write two more, suddenly you've got enough songs for an album." [...] According to the drummer Dahaud Shaar, the tracks were laid down in a very informal manner: [...] "During that time I kinda haunted the studio, and Van would come in and we'd just do tracks." [...] David Hayes recalled about the recording sessions: [...] "Every night for about a week he came in with two or three new tunes and we just started playing with him." [...] Jim Rothermel also {{recalled that}} during the California recording sessions for the album the songs were often a first take and that the band members had sometimes not heard the songs previously. The strings and woodwinds were arranged by Jef Labes in a New York studio. [...] The song [...] "Come Here My Love" [...] was inspired during the week of the sessions and another song [...] "Country Fair" [...] was left over from the Hard Nose the Highway album [...] and provided a fitting sense of closure. [...] "Bulbs" [...] and [...] "Cul de Sac" [...] were recut in New York later with musicians with whom Morrison had never worked before: guitarist John Tropea, bassist Joe Macho and drummer Allen Schwarzberg. Given a rock music treatment, these songs were [...] released as the single for the album." ...|$|E
