40|$|ABSTRACT:Remotely sensed {{imagery is}} proving to be a useful tool to {{estimate}} water depths in coastal zones. Bathymetric algorithms attempt to isolate <b>water</b> <b>attenuation</b> and hence depth from other factors by using different combinations of spectral bands. In this research, images of absolute bathymetry using two different but related methods in a region in the southern Caspian Sea coasts has been produced. The first method used a Single Band Algorithm (SBA) and assumed a constant <b>water</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient throughout the blue band. The second method used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to adjust for varying <b>water</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficients without additional ground truth data. PCA method (r=- 0. 672394) appears to match our control points slightly better than single band algorithm (r=- 0. 645404). It is clear that both methods can be used as rough estimates of bathymetry for many coastal zone studies in the southern Caspian Sea such as near shore fisheries, coastal erosion, water quality, recreation siting and so forth. The presented methodology can be considered as the first step toward mapping bathymetry in the southern Caspian Sea. Further research must investigate the determination of the nonlinear optimization techniques as well as the assessment of these models ’ performance in the study area...|$|E

"December 2011 "A polycrystalline metal's grain size affects its mechanical properties; therefore, the ability to effectively and easily monitor grain size during a manufacturing process is critical. Conventional destructive tests utilized for estimating grain size or mechanical properties are expensive and time consuming. Past research has shown some success in nondestructively estimating a metal's mean grain size using attenuation coefficient measurements acquired from ultrasound. Within this research, a water immersion, pulse-echo mode of ultrasonic testing is employed to estimate the mean grain diameter of 5 thin copper-alloy samples using attenuation coefficient measurements. The attenuation coefficients were estimated via spectral analysis of interface reflections. The interface reflections were corrected for reflection and transmission effects, beam field diffraction, and <b>water</b> <b>attenuation</b> effects. An experimental diffraction correction approach and an inverse <b>water</b> <b>attenuation</b> filter accounted for diffraction and <b>water</b> <b>attenuation,</b> respectively. A Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation algorithm was implemented to generate correlation models needed for grain diameter estimation. Models were developed as a function of ultrasonic wavelength and yielded grain diameter estimates for each sample. Estimates were seen to compare favorably with the stated grain diameters of the copper-alloy samples...|$|E
30|$|From {{physical}} {{point of}} view, an acoustic ray represents a propagation trajectory of an emitted signal between the source, (emitter), and the receiver. In many cases, the channel depth {{is limited in}} size {{which means that the}} propagation is multi-rays. Each ray may be bent by refraction if the sound speed is a function of depth and range. Ray trajectories and sound speed profile allow us to compute propagation times. In addition ray trajectories, <b>water</b> <b>attenuation,</b> boundaries roughness and sub-bottom properties allow us to compute the signal magnitude.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} subpixel {{heterogeneity}} in cover types has been addressed in terrestrial environments by {{the application of}} linear spectral unmixing techniques. However, in aquatic systems the interceding depth of water causes the apparent reflectance of the substrate to diverge from a linear model, and if depth is unknown these methods cannot be applied. A new technique is presented in which the conventional spectral unmixing method has been modified to calculate depth at each pixel {{in addition to the}} proportions of substrate type. The technique requires knowledge of the reflectance spectra of m pure substrata in n (n > m) spectral bands at depth 0 and the <b>water</b> diffuse <b>attenuation</b> coefficients for the site in the same bands. Depth, z, can be entirely unknown. The method is comparable to "classical" spectral unmixing and proceeds by performing a Gaussian elimination for endmember quantities and then solving the remaining nonlinear function of z for f(z) = 0 by successive approximation. Computer-based models are used to test the technique with realistic <b>water</b> diffuse <b>attenuation</b> coefficients and random spectra and actual spectra of coral reef substrata. The robustness of the technique is assessed against three forms of introduced error: measurement errors on the spectra to be unmixed, differences between the true endmember spectra and those used in the analysis, and measurement error on the <b>water</b> diffuse <b>attenuation</b> coefficients. The results of these tests imply the technique is sufficiently robust for use on real data. Furthermore, spectral unmixing of aquatic systems appears to be relatively insensitive to inaccuracies in depth estimation and offers great utility for benthic mapping...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an attempt at}} the utilisation of two low level light sensors to improve {{on the design of}} a dose monitoring system, specifically for underwater applications with consideration for the effects of <b>water</b> <b>attenuation.</b> The gamma radiation ‘RadLine®’ detector consists of an inorganic scintillating crystal coupled to a fibre optic cable which transports scintillation photons, up to hundreds of metres, to an optical sensor. Analysed here are two contemporary technologies; SensL׳s MiniSL a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) and a Sens-Tech photon counting photomultiplier tube (PMT). A clinical radiotherapy linear accelerator (linac) is implemented as test beam, subjecting the RadLine® to a highly controlled dose rate (ranging from 0 Sv h− 1 to 320 Sv h− 1), averaging at 2 MeV in energy. The RadLine׳s underwater dose monitoring capabilities are tested with the aid of epoxy resin ‘solid water’ phantom blocks, used as a substitute for water. Our results show that the MiniSL SiPM is unsuitable for this application due to extremely high background noise levels, however the Sens-Tech PMT performs satisfactorily and the detected dose rate due to the effects of <b>water</b> <b>attenuation</b> compares strongly with MCNP simulation data and NIST database values. We conclude that the PMT shows promise for its ultimate use in the First Generation Magnox Storage Pond (FGMSP) on the Sellafield site...|$|E

40|$|Passive {{integrated}} transponder (PIT) {{technology is}} rarely utilized in estuaries due to (1) saline <b>water’s</b> <b>attenuation</b> of an antenna’s electromagnetic field, (2) rapidly changing water properties and levels, and (3) {{the challenges of}} installing and maintaining antennas in silty, brackish conditions. We present methods for the construction and installation of antennas that can detect 12 -mm full-duplex PIT tags in salinities up to 33 ‰. We evaluated their reading performance under variable water salinities, temperatures, and depths in the upper estuaries of three streams. We found that water depth, salinity, and temperature were all negatively correlated with antenna current, but that {{the relative importance of}} these variables varied depending upon aspects of the antenna deployment. Since our antennas held amperage levels adequate for maintenance of a complete electromagnetic field throughout all test conditions, we suggest that successful detection was more dependent upon the antenna system’s coverage of the water column and the swimming path of fish through the antenna system than individual antenna performance. In addition to fish, this technology could be applied to studies of mammals, crustaceans, and particles transported through estuarine channels.

30|$|There {{are only}} a few SAV models that have been {{developed}} for environmental study. One of the major reasons for this is the shortage of data to calibrate the model for the study area. Another reason is the SAV model cannot run independently; an integrated hydrodynamic, water quality, sediment, or even wind-wave model is required to provide the needed instant hydrodynamics, <b>water</b> quality light <b>attenuation,</b> sediment contraction, and other environmental parameters. The well known Chesapeake Bay SAV model is coupled to an eutrophication model of the Chesapeake Bay 3 D model (Cerco and Moore 2001). Sheng et al.

40|$|Earth’s {{atmosphere}} and magnetosphere deflect and absorb {{the majority of}} harmful radiation traversing Space; however, once outside Low Earth Orbit (LEO), payloads are exposed to Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Particle Events (SPEs). While humans possess capabilities that hardware does not, we are uniquely vulnerable to radiation. Detrimental effects range from nausea and dizziness brought by intense, short term doses to increased cancer risk and impaired cognitive function associated with chronic exposure. This paper aims to explore the use of human waste (feces and urine) as radiation shields in a comparative study of urine v. water and hydrated v. dehydrated feces. GCR contain particles with orders of magnitude higher energy than SPEs, which makes them impractical to shield against. Conversely, SPE occur with higher frequency and at a lower level that is practically attenuated. To this end, an SPE surrogate was validated and exposure (Counts) on the leeward side of the respective shields was measured. Counts per Minute (CPM) were obtained by applying a multiplicative factor to Counts. As expected, CPM behind a urine shield {{did not differ from}} CPM behind a water shield (t-test, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Similarly, no difference in leeward CPM was found between hydrated and dehydrated feces shields (t-test, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The lack of differences between water and urine may be a result of urine being composed primarily of water.

40|$|ABSTRACT: High {{nutrient}} inputs and eutrophication {{continue to be}} one of the highest priority water quality problems. Bioretention is a low-impact development technology that has been advocated for use in urban and other developed areas. This work provides an in-depth analysis on removal of nutrients from a synthetic stormwater runoff by bioretention. Results have indicated good removal of phosphorus (70 to 85 %) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (55 to 65 %). Nitrate reduction was poor (, 20 %) and, in several cases, nitrate production was noted. Variations in flowrate (intensity) and duration had a moderate affect on nutrient removal. Mass balances demonstrate the importance of <b>water</b> <b>attenuation</b> in the facility in reducing mass nutrient loads. Captured nitrogen can be converted to nitrate between storm events and subsequently washed from the system. Analysis on the fate of nutrients in bioretention suggests that accumulation of phosphorus and nitrogen may be controlled by carefully managing growing and harvesting of vegetation. Water Environ.

Metastatic disease and lymphoma accounted for 69 % of masses in this series, and CT could not generally differentiate them. However, CT was helpful in differential diagnosis in certain settings. CT demonstration of multiple mediastinal masses when conventional radiographs showed a single mass generally excluded diagnoses such as thymoma and teratoma. CT demonstration of a single middle mediastinal mass, frequently missed by conventional radiography, made metastatic disease a much more likely diagnosis than lymphoma.

40|$|A {{data set}} of radiometric {{measurements}} {{collected in the}} Beaufort Sea (Canadian Arctic) in August 2009 (MALINA project) is analysed in order to describe apparent optical properties (AOPs) in this sea, which is subject to dramatic environmental changes for several decades. The two properties derived from the measurements are the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance, K d, and the spectral remote sensing reflectance, R rs. The former controls light propagation in the upper water column. The latter determines how light is backscattered {{out of the water}} and becomes eventually observable from a satellite ocean colour sensor. The data set includes offshore clear waters of the Beaufort basin as well as highly turbid waters of the Mackenzie River plumes. In the clear waters, we show K d values that are much larger in the ultraviolet and blue parts of the spectrum than what could be anticipated considering the chlorophyll concentration. A larger contribution of absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is responsible for this high K d values, as compared to other oligotrophic areas. In turbid <b>waters,</b> <b>attenuation</b> reaches extremely high values, driven by high loads of particulate materials and also by a large CDOM content. In these two extreme types of waters, current satellite chlorophyll algorithms fail. This is questioning the role of ocean colour remote sensing in the Arctic when R rs from only the blue and green bands are used. Therefore, other parts of the spectrum (e. g. the red) should be explored if one aims at quantifying interannual changes in chlorophyll in the Arctic from space. The very peculiar AOPs in the Beaufort Sea also advocate for developing specific light propagation models when attempting to predict light availability for photosynthesis at depth...|$|R
