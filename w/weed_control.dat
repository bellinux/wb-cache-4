5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
5|$|The Park Authority {{receives}} 80% of {{its funding}} {{as a direct}} grant from the government. The Park Authority Committee consists of members from parish and county councils, and six appointed by the Secretary of State. The work is carried out by 80 staff including rangers, volunteers {{and a team of}} estate workers who carry out a wide range of tasks including maintaining the many miles of rights of way, hedge laying, fencing, swaling, walling, invasive <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> and habitat management on National Park Authority land. There are ongoing debates between the authority and farmers over the biological monitoring of SSSIs, showing the need for a controlled regime of grazing and burning; farmers claim that these regimes are not practical or effective in the long term.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{critical}} period for <b>weeds</b> <b>control</b> in sage was determined {{in an experiment}} based on a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications and five treatments in Ardabil in 2010 - 2011. The treatments included weeds interference and <b>weeds</b> <b>control</b> with the intervals of 20 days (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 days after sowing). It was found that among weeds interference treatments, the highest weeds population was observed {{in the treatment of}} weeds interference until 40 days and among <b>weeds</b> <b>control</b> treatments, the highest weeds population was in the treatment of <b>weeds</b> <b>control</b> until 20 days as the duration of weeds interference was increased, their density was decreased because of self-thinning. Critical period for <b>weeds</b> <b>control</b> in sage was found to be 76, 60 and 53 days for acceptable yield losses of 5, 10 and 15 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of pre-emergence herbicide, post-emergence herbicide and hand weeding alone {{as well as}} in combination with farm yard manure (FYM) were studied in potato for three years. The emergence percentage was at the top (84. 6) where pre-emergence herbicide was sprayed and FYM was not added followed by (84. 3) hand weeding in which FYM was used. The uncontrolled weed plots gave an average of 535. 8 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight than <b>weeds</b> <b>controlled</b> plots. The hand weeding plots gave an average of 58. 9 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight than chemically <b>weed</b> <b>controlled</b> plots. The pre-emergence herbicide controlled plots yielded an average of 111. 1 g m‾ 2 more fresh weeds weight as compared to post-emergence herbicide controlled plots. The percentage of > 55 mm tubers was at the top (55. 1) where post-emergence herbicide was sprayed and FYM was added followed by (50. 2 %) pre-emergence herbicide treated plots in which FYM was not added. The seed size (35 - 55 mm) tuber percentage was at the top (41. 1) where weeds were not eradicated and FYM was not added followed by (40. 8 %) hand weeding plots in which FYM was added. The percentage of & 35 mm tubers was at the bottom (11. 2) where pre-emergence herbicide was sprayed and FYM was added. <b>Weeds</b> <b>control</b> by any methods increased potato yield an average of 7. 983 t ha‾ 1 (27. 52 %) than the uncontrolled weeds plots. The FYM increased an average of 3. 687 t ha‾ 1 (10. 49 %) yield in potato as compared to plots in which FYM was not applied. The chemically <b>weed</b> <b>controlled</b> methods produced an average of 4. 482 t ha‾ 1 (13. 18 %) more potatoes than hand weeding. The post-emergence herbicide, on an average basis yielded more potatoes than pre-emergence herbicide. The difference was 3. 355 t ha‾ 1 (9. 11 %) in the favour of post-emergence herbicide. On the basis of three years results post-emergence herbicide is recommended for effective <b>weeds</b> <b>control</b> and higher production...|$|R
5|$|The black honeyeater may be {{adversely}} affected {{by the loss of}} the emu bush to grazing and <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> by farmers. Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be particularly rapid; the current population seems to be of sufficient numbers, and the species has a sufficiently large range, for the species to be evaluated as of species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However Claire A. Runge and colleagues observed that the black honeyeaters' range across inland Australia contracted after years of low rainfall and showed a slow and incomplete recovery even after several years. They added that although nomadic species such as the black honeyeater may have a large distribution, they are often habitat specialists and hence may only occupy a small area within their range. Thus the risk of extinction of these species may be underestimated.|$|E

Mazand (Allium sativum L.). An experiment was conducted {{in the form of}} simple randomized complete block design with three replications in 2012 - 2013 year. Factor studied were: one application of trifluralin and oxyfluorfen 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5 lit. ha- 1, two applications of oxyfluorfen 1. 5 lit. ha- 1, hand <b>weeding</b> <b>control</b> and without <b>weeding</b> <b>control.</b> Results showed that using different doses of herbicides significantly affected density and biomass of weeds. Two applicarions of oxyfluorfen with 1. 5 liters per hectare and hand weeding were best options to reduce of weeds biomass. Using of oxyfluorfen herbicide (2 and 2. 5 liters) resulted in little damage and low stable on garlic. Using of different herbicides with different doses were significant on plant height, number of cloves per bulb, 100 seed weight, biological and economical yield and harvest index. Lowest economic yield was due to control treatment (540 g. m- 2) and highest was obtained by using 1. 5 liter of oxyfluorfen herbicide (1661. 67 g. m- 2), hand weeding (1686. 67 g. m- 2) and split oxyfluorfen application (1670 g. m- 2). Finally, oxyfluorfen treatment (1. 5 liter) on 3 to 4 weeds leaf, were identified as the most appropriate treatments...|$|R
