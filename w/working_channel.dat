50|$|Protected Working Capacity Envelope Optimization - This model {{different}} from the other 2 models because in this model the p-cycles are found first. There are some considerations when creating the p-cycles based on the idea of optimizing the general volume of the <b>working</b> <b>channels</b> which must be protected.

40|$|Abstract — IEEE 802. 22 {{wireless}} regional {{area network}} (WRAN) is an emerging cognitive radio-based system. One {{of the major}} challenges for WRANs is how to efficiently schedule both channel sensing and data transmission for multiple adjacent WRAN cells. This challenge is known as coexistence problem. In this paper, we propose four schemes that aim at reducing the coexistence-problem effect. These schemes {{are based on a}} well-known operation mode of IEEE 802. 22, namely dynamic frequency hopping (DFH). The first and second schemes are based on using omni-directional antennas at the base stations (BSs), whereas the BSs in the other two schemes use directional antennas. The first scheme, coined fixed-scheduling D FH (FDFH), b ases upon a fixed scheduling of <b>working</b> <b>channels</b> for adjacent WRAN cells. The second scheme, called cooperative DFH (CDFH), cooperatively selects <b>working</b> <b>channels.</b> The third scheme, namely sectoral DFH (SDFH), is proposed to reduce the coordination overhead of CDFH via dividing a WRAN cell into sectors to decrease the chances of collisions between adjacent cells. Finally, we integrate FDFH and SDFH into a new scheme, called fixed-scheduling sectoral DFH (FSDFH), which exploits the advantages of both schemes with no additional overhead. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed schemes...|$|R

50|$|In {{multi-channel}} systems, {{channels are}} used for separate purposes. A channel may be reserved for a specific function or for a geographic area. In a functional channel system, one channel may allow City of Springfield road repair crews {{to talk to the}} City of Springfield's road maintenance office. A second channel may allow road repair crews to communicate with state highway department crews. In a geographic system, a taxi company may use one channel to communicate in the Boston, Massachusetts area and a second channel when taxis are in Providence, Rhode Island. In marine radio operations, one channel is used as an emergency and calling channel, so that stations may make contact then move to a separate <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> for continued communication.|$|E
50|$|Some later {{systems were}} {{equipped}} with a 'join' feature to overcome this problem. The system would monitor all channels in a given system and, if it detected a mobile attempting to acquire a second channel, that user would be invalidated on that channel (dumped), and immediately afterwards a 2-tone signaling sequence would begin on the original channel, bringing the lost unit into the original conversation. This could be highly annoying to users already in a conversation, as the very audible collect and group tones would interrupt the conversation, and if the invalidated user persisted in attempting to bring up a channel rather than waiting for the system to signal him, the collect and group tones {{would continue to be}} sent out on the <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> repeatedly on each channel attempt.|$|E

40|$|Background: EUS is a {{standard}} staging procedure in esophageal cancer. For adequate staging, FNA of suspicious lymph nodes is recommended. Based on optimal staging, sophisticated treatment can be applied more properly. The <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> of the endoscope can potentially be contaminated by cancer cells derived from the luminal surface of esophageal cancer during EUS-guided FNA, which may result in false-positive cytology results of EUS-guided ENA of celiac lymph nodes. Objective: To determine whether passing an endoscope through intraluminal esophageal cancer can lead to contamination of the <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> with tumor cells. Design: An ex vivo assessment of contamination of endoscope working channels. Setting: University hospital. Patients: This study, involved 13 patients with esophageal cancer. Intervention: Working channels of endoscopes {{that had been used}} in patients with intraluminal esophageal cancer were studied immediately after EUS. A routine ex vivo FNA was performed through the endoscope on 8 patients. The same procedure was performed through the endoscope on 5 other patients after the <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> had been cleaned by extensive flushing. Main Outcome Measurements: Semiquantitative scoring of cytology smears. Results: Six of 8 specimens contained carcinoma cells. No contamination by carcinoma cells or normal cells was observed when the <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> was flushed with tap water prior to the sham FNA procedure. Limitations: This was an ex vivo study of a limited group of patients. Conclusion: The <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> of the endoscope can be contaminated during the EUS-guided FNA procedure.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate suction with a new ultrathin endoscope (EG- 580 NW 2; Fujifilm Corp.) having a 2. 4 -mm <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> in clinical practice. Methods: To evaluate in vitro suction, 200 mL water was suctioned and the suction time was measured. The clinical data of 117 patients who underwent EGD were retrospectively reviewed on the basis of recorded video, and the suction time was measured by using a stopwatch. Results: In vitro, the suction time with the EG- 580 NW 2 endoscope was significantly shorter than that with the use of an ultrathin endoscope with a 2. 0 -mm <b>working</b> <b>channel</b> (EG- 580 NW; mean ± standard deviation, 22. 7 ± 1. 1 seconds vs. 34. 7 ± 2. 2 seconds; p< 0. 001). We analyzed the total time and the suction time for routine EGD in 117 patients (50 in the EG- 580 NW 2 group and 67 in the EG- 580 NW group). In the EG- 580 NW 2 group, the total time for EGD was significantly shorter than that in the EG- 580 NW group (275. 3 ± 42. 0 seconds vs. 300. 6 ± 46. 5 seconds, p= 0. 003). In the EG- 580 NW 2 group, the suction time was significantly shorter than that in the EG- 580 NW group (19. 2 ± 7. 6 seconds vs. 38. 0 ± 15. 9 seconds, p< 0. 001).
