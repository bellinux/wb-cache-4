5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel.

5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. The He 111 <b>was</b> <b>equipped</b> with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German {{aviation}} industry lacked powerplants that could produce more than 600 hp. Engines of suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it {{to rely on}} the BMW VI or 132s.|$|E
5|$|As built Kalinin lacked any radars, but by 1944 she <b>was</b> <b>equipped</b> with British and American Lend-Lease radars {{as well as}} Soviet-designed systems. A British Type 291 and an American SG radar {{were used}} for air search.

5|$|Due {{to rising}} light {{pollution}} in Cleveland, a new station in Geauga County's Montville Township {{was established in}} 1950s. Named after Jason John Nassau, the station initially housed the Burrell telescope, which was later moved to Kitt Peak National Observatory. Instead of Burrell the station <b>was</b> <b>equipped</b> with the 36-inch robotic telescope. In 2008 Nassau Station was sold to the Geauga Park District and subsequently incorporated into its Observatory Park.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} Fort Glanville's {{significance}} declined rapidly. Fort Largs <b>was</b> <b>equipped</b> in 1889 with two 6inch breech-loading disappearing guns which outranged Glanville's armament. The decline was also linked {{to changes in}} Port Adelaide's maritime facilities and the consequent northward movement of anchored and berthed vessels. During the 1880s the Port River was deepened enabling large ships to sail up and berth, rather than the former practice of anchoring off-shore.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain and the coastal forts, {{included}} Portland, received little attention. A 1623 survey reported that the castle <b>was</b> <b>equipped</b> with three culverins, nine demi-culverins and a saker, but that the fortifications had suffered badly from sea erosion and required extensive repairs. Fourteen years later, the castle had 15 guns and a garrison of a captain and 12 men.|$|E
5|$|Kaganovichs radar suite is unknown, but it {{is likely}} she <b>was</b> <b>equipped</b> {{with a mix of}} Soviet and British and American Lend-Lease radars.
