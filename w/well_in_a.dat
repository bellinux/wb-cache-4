5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

5|$|After being {{released}} by Carlisle, Beharall {{decided to join}} League 2 strugglers Stockport County {{until the end of}} the 2005–06 season, after playing <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reserve match for County prior to his move, he had high hopes of saving the club from relegation and also hoped to impress the County manager Jim Gannon enough to earn a new contract for the following season. Beharall made his début for County in the 2–1 away victory against Chester City. Beharall played another 11 league games during the 2005–06 for Stockport and was starting contract negotiations the managed Jim Gannon, but in May 2006 Beharall retired due to an ongoing bad knee injury.|$|E

5|$|Benbow {{entered the}} Royal Navy on 30 April 1678, aged 25 years. He became master's mate aboard the 64-gun HMS Rupert {{under the command}} of Captain Arthur Herbert, whilst she was fitting out at Portsmouth. He sailed with her to the Mediterranean, where Herbert was {{promoted}} to the rank of vice-admiral whilst serving under the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, Admiral Sir John Narborough. During this period the English fleet was often in action against the Barbary pirates of North Africa that were actively preying upon European shipping. The Rupert herself captured an Algerine warship in 1678, which was later commissioned in the Royal Navy as the HMS Tiger Prize. Benbow distinguished himself <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of actions against the Algerine vessels, and won Herbert's approval. On Narborough's return to England, Herbert was appointed acting commander-in-chief, and made Benbow master aboard HMS Nonsuch on 15 June 1679. The Nonsuch would remain at Tangiers and off the African coast and had a number of successive captains who would go on to achieve flag rank, including George Rooke, Cloudesley Shovell and Francis Wheler. All were impressed by Benbow, and would afterwards help to advance his career.|$|E
5|$|Blount {{entered his}} junior year at Oregon sharing the running back role with senior Jeremiah Johnson. The two backs lived together, and the talkative Johnson advised Blount in his first Pac-10 season. For Blount, {{it was the first}} season in which he split time with another running back, and his {{reaction}} was mixed. The two backs each contributed nearly 100 yards and three touchdowns in an early 63–14 win over the Washington State Cougars, and both again performed <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> late season victory over the Oregon State Beavers. However, Blount would record lackluster performances in games against USC and Cal. Overall, Blount rushed for 17 touchdowns, setting a single-season school record, and 1,002 yards. Blount and Johnson became only the second duo in team history to both clear 1,000 rushing yards in the same season; Johnson led the team with 1,201 yards.|$|E
5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia coccinea appears to be most closely related to Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri. Banksia coccinea plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. Widely {{considered one of the most}} attractive Banksia species, B.coccinea is a popular garden plant and one of the most important Banksia species for the cut flower industry; it is grown commercially in several countries including Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Israel. In cultivation, B.coccinea grows <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sunny location on well-drained soil, but it cannot survive in areas with humid or wet summers.|$|E

5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri. Banksia speciosa plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. In cultivation, Banksia speciosa grows <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sunny location on well-drained soil in areas with dry summers. It cannot be grown in areas with humid summers, though it has been grafted onto Banksia serrata or B.integrifolia.|$|E
5|$|In polling, Dodd {{has seemed}} unable {{to break through}} to the top tier. In Nationwide polls he usually only polls at or around 1%. A November 7, 2007 Gallup poll placed him in last place, behind both Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich at 1%. At the state level, Dodd has also not done so <b>well.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> November 18, 2007 Iowa poll {{conducted}} by ABC news, he registered with 1% the same number from a similar poll done by ABC news on July 31, 2007. In New Hampshire, a poll conducted by CNN placed Dodd at 1% constant from a September poll but up from polls in June and July. However, on the straw poll level, Dodd was able to gain a victory during an event in South Carolina on March 5, 2007. He won the York County straw poll by receiving 28% of the 100 votes cast. Barack Obama came in second with 24%. Hillary Clinton got 18% and John Edwards received 11%. The victory came two days after Dodd visited the county which probably secured him the win.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical. They felt {{that some of the}} characters, such as marine biologist Doc, would work <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> musical, but that many of the other characters would not. Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E

5|$|Redhead and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group. Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E
5|$|Roxburgh was {{succeeded by}} Craig Brown, {{who had been}} his assistant. Brown had first joined the Scotland {{coaching}} setup in 1986, when the team was managed by Alex Ferguson. His appointment was greeted critically, as Brown had a low-profile career in football beforehand. Despite limited resources, Brown managed to lead Scotland to qualification for two major tournaments, UEFA Euro 1996 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Scotland played <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> narrow defeat against Brazil and a draw against Norway, but were eliminated after suffering a 3–0 defeat against Morocco. During 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification, Brown continued {{to rely on a}} group of ageing players, including Colin Hendry and Tom Boyd. None of his strikers were playing regularly for their clubs and the team lacked pace. Brown resigned immediately after the last qualification match.|$|E
5|$|Serrate {{used the}} Mk. IV {{equipment}} for reception and display, replacing only the receiver unit. This could be switched {{in or out}} of the circuit from the cockpit, which turned off the transmitter as <b>well.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> typical interception, the radar operator would use Serrate to track the German fighter, using the directional cues from the displays to direct the pilot on an intercept course. Range was not supplied, but the operator could make a rough estimate by observing the signal strength and the way the signals changed as the fighter maneuvered. After following Serrate to an estimated range of , the fighter's own radar would be turned on for the final approach.|$|E

5|$|The 19thcentury saw {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} the castle. In 1826 repairs {{were made to the}} well in the keep. At the same time a survey was carried out by A. W. N. Pugin and he excavated around the keep, investigating how it was built. He descended into the <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bucket in an unsuccessful search for treasure. Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, leased the castle to the Corporation of Rochester in 1870 for use as a public park; when it opened to the public in 1872, Rochester Castle was presented as a picturesque ruin, with trees planted in the enclosure and the walls overgrown with ivy. In 1884 the Corporation bought the castle for £6,572 (equivalent to £3.4million in 2009 terms). Between 1896 and 1904, George Payne carried out repairs. In {{the first quarter of the}} century the gardens acquired a German field gun and a tank from the First World War, and a bandstand, though they were removed by 1961. Ivy was removed from the keep between 1919 and 1931 and the planting in the castles scaled back. In 1960 the origin of Boley Hill was investigated archaeologically, but the excavations failed to provide firm dating evidence.|$|E
5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> head sea. Stormy {{weather in the}} Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to complain that the ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded out and that the ship generated enormous sheets of spray when water came over the bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced tumblehome. Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as not high enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E
5|$|With India's older players {{opting out}} of the inaugural World Twenty20, Pathan {{was one of several}} younger players to regain {{national}} selection. India were not expected to do <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> format that favoured stronger fielding sides. In the first match, he scored 20 and took 2/20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round, before winning in a bowl-out. He then took 0/16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3/37 in a defeat of England. India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and Pathan conceded only 16 runs from his four overs, helping to restrict the hosts to 9/116 in pursuit of 154. Pathan then took 2/44, removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. Pathan was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3/16, including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls, before later bowling Yasir Arafat.|$|E

40|$|Determining optimal {{location}} for conventional and multilateral <b>wells</b> <b>in</b> {{oil and gas}} reservoirs is a complex process. Optimal location determination depends {{on a combination of}} geological parameters, reservoir information, and surface landcover feature data types that need to be analyzed concurrently in one software system. A Geographic Information System (GIS) can integrate and represent these many data types <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single view. It has sophisticated analysis tools that can identify the optimum <b>well</b> location <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reservoir. Saudi Aramco’s E&P GIS application functionalities were extended to allow petroleum engineers to efficiently propose well locations where the density of <b>wells</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field is high. Furthermore, these functionalities allow engineers to create and view fluid contact maps, formation pressure information, and well trajectory data for this complex task. This paper will provide an overview of the methodologies developed to effectively place <b>wells</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reservoir and will highlight the GIS implementation for each methodology...|$|R
