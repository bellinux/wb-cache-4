5000|$|X-TextsCollection of iconic {{sexual and}} erotic literature, {{in which each}} story is a meta-story, or treated version, of the original. Examples include Lady Chatterley's Loafer, Lolita, Over the Hill, and 9½ Weeks: The Long March.Assassination RhapsodyA deconstruction version of the {{materials}} in the Warren Commission Report. Examples {{include the use of}} collage and absurdism mixed with mechanical manipulations and transformations of the Commission texts' in A The Nature of the Shots, illustrations in A Bullet Theory Poem, and lipogram in The Magic Bullet. [...] The Marquis De Sade's Elements of StyleIntroduced as a [...] "found book" [...] originally published by Marquise de Sade while in a lunatic aslym, with pictures and edits done by the [...] "author", Derek Pell. Presented as a book on style, it is divided into four sections, Elementary Principles of Composition, A Few Matters of Form, Words and Expressions Commonly Misued, An Approach to Style, and an untraditional index, with <b>wood</b> <b>print</b> images either designed or found and incorporated throughout.The Little Red Book of Adobe LiveMotionWritten as an absurdist pastiche of Chairman Mao's Little Red Book, informing the citizens of [...] "correct" [...] political behavior, it also manages to be a guide to Adobe's LiveMotion software. The text serves as a humorous instruction manual for using flash as a political tool to oppose corporate culture and to foster a political revolution against capitalism. Resignifying symbols, images, and texts, the book {{is an example of the}} fluidity of meaning and identity found in the World Wide Web. This is the world's first (and only) satirical technical book.Bewildering BeastiesWritten as a warning, the book is framed as a rare surviving copy of a book of endangered species from England's Victorian period. The illustrations serves as puns and wordplay combine with nostalgia, pastiche, and found materials to serve as an absurd, but nonetheless less meaningful warning on extinction and humanities role in the environment.|$|E
40|$|Making Dorset is {{conceived}} as a biennial, selected, ten-day celebration of established and innovative craft and design practice in Dorset. As well as seeking to attract great practitioners in Dorset, the call is being extended to those working elsewhere who have an association with Dorset by education, or professional association with a place or person. The event is focused on attracting the public, collectors, other makers and curators to craft and design based studio workshops and special exhibitions. An accompanying events programme involving participants and invited specialists will include demonstrations, practical workshops, seminars and exclusive ‘meet the maker’ events. Aiming to make it worthwhile for visitors to Dorset to stay over, special events will be programmed to form three-day, ‘special interest trails’, focused on, for example: ceramics, textiles, <b>wood,</b> <b>print.</b> Quality and the synthesis of form and function, and skills with strong traditions are key elements of the selection criteria. Selectors will draw a distinction between craft and design disciplines and fine art. Whilst accepting {{that there will be}} applicants whose work straddles the divide, this is not an event for those who are first and foremost fine artists. Working with an advisory group, the selection process will be led - and in relevant aspects, curated - by Professor Simon Olding - Professor of Contemporary Crafts and Director of the Crafts Study Centre, UCA Farnham. The centrepiece of publicity will be a specially produced square format directory; rather like a ‘Year Book’. Making Dorset is a Dorset Visual Arts initiative. DVA is Dorset's principal membership organisation for artists, designers and makers...|$|E
