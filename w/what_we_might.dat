25|$|His {{early career}} {{included}} a lengthy stay in Italy, where he adopted {{a sense of}} space and use of modelling influenced by Trecento painting. From 1381 he was court painter to Louis de Mâle, Duke of Brabant, and from Louis's death in 1384 worked for his son-in-law and successor, Philip the Bold, although he remained based in Ypres, doing much work, mostly decorative, at Philip's now vanished chateau at Hesdin, which was full of elaborate mechanical devices, of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> today call a fairground nature, which needed painting. Like many court artists, including Jan van Eyck, he was appointed valet de chambre to the Duke (in 1387), and in 1391 promoted to court painter.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} Gregory's {{belief in the}} infinity of God is his belief that God, as limitless, is essentially incomprehensible to the limited minds of created beings. In Life of Moses, Gregory writes: [...] "...every concept that comes from some comprehensible image, by an approximate understanding and by guessing at the Divine nature, constitutes a idol of God and does not proclaim God." [...] Gregory's theology was thus apophatic: he proposed that God should be {{defined in terms of}} what we know He is not rather than <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> speculate Him to be.|$|E

An AMEC engineer participating in the firm's studies, Jacques Paynter, said that {{the banks of the}} river had begun widening [...] "at a noticeable pace", with the tidal bore growing closer to its pre-1968 levels: [...] "We were actually anticipating a fairly modest increase in height. It seems to be already exceeding <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have expected."

Pocock describes as [...] "almost the last production of that great tradition of administrator scholars who had long and extensive experience in the Indian Civil Service and had not found their arduous activity incompatible with scholarship." [...] Trautmann considers the census report and subsequent book to represent [...] "Risley's grand syntheses of India ethnology", while the paper of 1891 had given [...] "an exceptionally clear view of his project {{at the state of}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> call its early maturity." ...|$|E

He then compared the scenario in which Tarragon was trapped within his home to that in The Calculus Affair in which Professor Topolino was tied up in his house. He also identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He argued that {{the way in which}} Alcazar was presented as Tintin's friend in this story was a manifestation of the recurring theme of friendship. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Hergé's use of jewels as a theme throughout the series, while the mummy's removal from its tomb was a manifestation of the recurring concept of the tomb.|$|E

500|$|Neither brother married. Wilbur once quipped {{that he did}} {{not have}} time for both a wife and an airplane. Following a brief {{training}} flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June 1911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, [...] "When we think <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose." [...] Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European – particularly Parisian – philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would [...] "come home white".|$|E
500|$|According to Volk, [...] "The basic {{tenet of}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> call Manilius' natural {{philosophy}} {{is the idea}} that the universe is divine". With that said, she contends that the poet is inconsistent {{when it comes to the}} location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims that the perfectly regular movement of the heavenly bodies is proof that the universe is the product of a god, but at the same time he asserts that the universe itself is also a god (mundum ... ipsum esse deum). Later in the same book, Manilius once again argues that the universe is the [...] "work of a great divinity" [...] (magni ... numinis ordo). Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes: [...] "It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe ... Is the world simply ruled by a diuinum numen (cf. 1.484) or is it a deus (cf 1.485) itself?" [...] Volk answers that in the cosmology of the Astronomica, [...] "God can be understood as the soul or breath ... present within the world [...] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god." [...] According to Volk, this interpretation of the universewhich states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly waythus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect impacting everything within the cosmos, [...] and that fate rules all.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>might...</b> it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E
