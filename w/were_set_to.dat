5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which <b>were</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E
5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out to}} recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering the ruined city unopposed, Julian's men <b>were</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the opposition from the equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E

Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats.
