The complex salts used were based on cetyltrimethylammonium (C(16) TA(+)) with three different polymeric counterions: poly(acrylate) (PA(-)) or poly(acrylate) copolymerized with either dimethylacrylamide (PA(-) /DAM) or N-isopropylamide (PA(-) /NIPAM). The charge density of the polyion was varied by either adding poly(acrylic) acid (PAA) to the C(16) TAPA complex salt (annealed charges) or by varying {{the fraction of}} uncharged units in the C(16) TAPA/DAM or C(16) TAPA/NIPAM complex salts (quenched charges). The formed phases were studied visually between crossed polarizers and by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Both types of complex salts (annealed and quenched) formed hexagonal phases at high fractions of charged monomers and low water contents. Upon increasing the water content, a cubic phase of the Pm 3 n space group was found. Upon further addition of <b>water,</b> a <b>miscibility</b> gap with the cubic phase in equilibrium with pure water was found. Decreasing the fraction of charged monomers in the annealed complex salt resulted in an increase of the curvature of the surfactant aggregates. Only at very low (< 0. 05) fractions of charged monomers did the packing of the surfactant aggregates lose long-range order, and eventually, the miscibility gap disappeared. For the quenched complex salts, the changes upon decreasing the fraction of charged monomers in the polyion were similar, but the loss of long-range order occurred at much higher fractions of charged monomers.

The aim of this work was to study the effect of several biocompatible solvents with different physico-chemical properties on the release of ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic BCS II drug, from in situ forming PLA-based implants. The solvents evaluated were N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP), 2 -pyrrolidone (2 P), triacetine (TA) and benzyl benzoate (BB). Hansen's solubility parameters of solvents were used to explain polymer/solvent interactions leading to different rheological behaviours. The stability of the polymer and drug in the solvents were also evaluated by size exclusion and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The two major factors determining the rate of IVM release from ISI were miscibility of the solvent with water and the viscosity of the polymer solutions. In general, the release rate increased with increasing <b>water</b> <b>miscibility</b> of the solvent and decreasing viscosity in the following order NMP> 2 P>TA>BB. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a relationship between the rate of IVM release and the surface porosity of the implants, release being higher as implant porosity increased. Finally, drug and polymer stability in the solvents followed the same trends, increasing when polymer-solvent affinities and water content in solvents decreased.

Key modifications included the desalination of samples prior to DAI, the use of a threaded midget bubbler to purge small-volume samples under heated conditions and the addition of salt during P&T.

In addition a number of factors, such as water concentration in combination with the solvent, were found be significant. The factors of water and then surfactant in combination with solvent and solid have been further investigated, by use of sedimentation, rheology and electrophoretic measurements. It was found that for hydrophilic pharmaceutical particles, water contamination had the largest impact on the sols’ properties, particularly where the solvent had only limited <b>water</b> <b>miscibility.</b> The least impact was found with a hydrophobic particle and a water miscible solvent. In the absence of any water in the solvent, the anionic surfactant AOT was found to be an effective surfactant for most systems at stabilising the sols. Electrophoretic measurements revealed that the addition of AOT most cases reversed the charge of the particles to that observed in water. However, the surfactants 12 -hydroxysteric acid and Brij- 35 were found to be more effective than AOT at stabilising the systems against the effect of water contamination in the solvent. By addition of these surfactants it was possible to stop the catastrophic irreversible aggregation which resulted from water contamination. After the addition of surfactant, water had the effect of causing the suspensions to visibly thicken, but aggregation did not occur This study shows that the stabilisation of pharmaceutical dispersions is complex and there is no universal route to achieve this. However, for hydrophilic particles dispersed in a water immiscible non-polar solvent the effect of water in the solvent lead to aggregation of the particles, presumable due to capillary bridging effects; addition of a surfactant can help to mitigate these effects.

40|$|Public {{concerns}} {{about global warming}} and energy security contribute to an ever-increasing focus on biologically-derived fuels, leading to significant interest in several candidate molecules capable of complementing petroleum-derived fuel resources. Ethanol, {{one of the most}} developed biofuels, is used extensively as a gasoline additive. However, the high <b>water</b> <b>miscibility</b> of ethanol creates corrosion problems when transporting the fuel by pipelines. Furthermore, the low energy density of ethanol limits its fuel efficiency. Thus, it is important to explore alternative biofuels with properties that are more similar to conventional gasoline. With a higher energy density, enhanced physical properties that would allow better integration with current infrastructure, pentanol represents an excellent alternative, and {{has the potential to be}} a replacement for gasoline. The primary objective of my thesis work is to construct pentanol biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli, offering the possibility of producing pentanol from renewable carbon sources through microbial fermentations. We used butanol synthesis as a platform from which microbial synthesis of pentanol can be obtained. To explore the possibility of employing the butanol pathway enzymes for pentanol biosynthesis, we implemented a bypass/feeding strategy to thoroughly evaluate the ability of those enzymes to act on five-carbon substrates. Additionally, by boosting the intracellular NADH availability, we achieved up to 85 mg/L pentanol from glucose and propionate, providing an initial proof-of-concept of a functional and feasible pentanol biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. Furthermore, a platform pathway was established for synthesis of value-added chiral 3 -hydroxyalkanoic acids with applications ranging from chiral building blocks to high-value pharmaceuticals. Of significance, such pathway was constructed as one portion of the pentanol pathway, illustrating versatility of our pentanol pathway as it can be modularized for synthesis of various valuable chemicals. Altogether, our results suggest that direct microbial synthesis of pentanol solely from glucose or glycerol can be realized once an efficient redox balancing within the recombinant strains is ensured. As construction of desired biosynthetic pathways is just the first step toward economically viable pentanol production, increasing the titer, yield, and productivity will ultimately determine the feasibility of such pathways. by Hsien-Chung Tseng.

40|$|In this study, the emulsification-diffusion method {{traditionally}} used {{to prepare}} polymeric nanoparticles was adapted to obtain lipidic nanospheres (LN) using four model lipids. The method consists of dissolving the lipid in a partially water-miscible solvent (previously saturated with water) {{at room temperature}} or at controlled temperature depending on lipid solubility. This organic phase is emulsified in an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent (saturated with solvent) by conventional stirring at the same temperature used to dissolve the lipid. This oil-in-water emulsion is then diluted with an excess of water at controlled temperature in order to provoke the diffusion from the internal phase into the external phase thereby causing lipid aggregation {{in the form of}} LN. This new approach for the preparation of LN has clear advantages over the existing methods, namely: (i) it is efficient and versatile; (ii) easy implementation and scaling up (with no need of high energy sources); (iii) high reproducibility and narrow size distribution; (iv) less physical stress (i. e., long exposure to high temperatures and to mechanical dispersion); (v) {{it is not necessary to}} dissolve the drug in the melted lipid. The selection of the water-miscible solvent and the stabilizers are critical parameters to obtain lipidic particles in the nanometric range. In general, solvents with high <b>water</b> <b>miscibility</b> and stabilizers able to form stable emulsions are preferred. The results demonstrated that it was possible to reduce the particle size by increasing the process temperature, the stirring rate, the amount of stabilizer, and by lowering the amount of lipid. Control of the preparative variables allowed to obtain LN with diameters under 100 nm. It was found that the influence of preparative parameters was associated with a mechanism based on a physicochemical instability. In this sense, it is suggested that the rapid solvent diffusion produces regions of local supersaturation near the interface, and LN are formed due to the ensuing interfacial phase transformations and lipid aggregation that occur in these interfacial domains. In terms of stability, only poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVAL) was able to preserve the physical stability of the dispersion for long periods after preparation. This effect was attributed to the ability of PVAL chains to form a strongly attached layer on the nanoparticle surface with an excellent repulsion effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between poylions and oppositely charged surfactant ions has been investigated. This {{has been done}} by using the pure complex salt (polyion + surfactant ion) as a point of departure. Different parameters of the complex salt have been varied in a systematic way and the effect on structure and <b>water</b> <b>miscibility</b> has been investigated. Complex salts (CxTAPAy) consisting of alkyl trimethyl ammonium surfactants (CxTA+, with x being the alkyl chain length) and poly(acrylate) (PAy, with y being the degree of polymerization) have been used. Surfactants with the oligocarboxylate counterions oxalate, succinate, citrate, and butyl tetra-carboxylate (BTA) have also been used. By changing the surfactant alkyl tail length from 6 to 16 the size of the rodlike surfactant aggregates formed with a polymeric counterion at low water content could be controlled. Also the size of the surfactant aggregates in the cubic phase found varied with surfactant tail length. The C 16 TAPAy systems were virtually insoluble in water, but took up 40 - 50 wt% of water in equilibrium with excess water. When changing from shorter to longer polyions, the concentrated phase in equlilibrium with excess water switched from a cubic phase to a hexagonal phase. It was also shown that the solubility of the complex salts was higher with a shorter alkyl chain length and a longer polyion. By lowering the charge density of the polyion, the size of the surfactant aggregates decreased and the curvature of the aggregates increased. At very low charge densities, the systems lost long-range order. Additions of decanol to aqueous solutions of the complex salts decreased the curvature of the surfactant aggregates, causing a switch to a lamellar phase. By adding small oils (p-xylene, cyklohexane), the diameter of the surfactant rods in the hexagonal phase could be increased. Surfactants with dimeric counterions did not phase separate at high water content, but tri- and tetrameric counterions caused phase separation for spherical surfactant aggregates. Compared to the complex salts, there was very little difference between the surfactant with a tetrameric counterion and the complex salt with a short polyion, indicating a fast convergence of the effect of connecting the surfactant counterions. There was very little difference in the swelling of lamellar aggregates for di-, tri-, and tetrameric counterions...|$|E
30|$|Propofol, {{chemically}} named 2, 6 -diisopropylphenol, is {{a highly}} effective and rapid intravenous anesthetics, which has gained increasing popularity in anesthesia in clinic. Its greatest advantage is the rapid recovery, even after long periods of anesthesia. A particularly low incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was also observed [1, 2]. However, it also has some drawbacks such as poor <b>water</b> <b>miscibility</b> (150 μg/L) [3] and high lipophilicity (logP = 4.16) [4]. As vehicles for clinical delivery of anesthetics should be devoid of sedative and anesthetic properties, as well as toxic side effects, nearly all small-molecular weight organic solvents into which propofol is freely miscible are not useful. Therefore, propofol was initially formulated as a 1 % solution in 16 % Cremophor EL, which {{has been reported to}} induce undesirable side effects, such as the high occurrence of pain on injection and the risk of anaphylactic reactions associated to Cremophor EL. In view of the clinical importance of propofol, the alternative formulations such as oil/water emulsion consisting of soya bean oil, glycerol, and egg phosphatide (Diprivan®, Zeneca, UK) [5], microemulsions [6], inclusion complex [1], and polymeric micelles [7, 8], have been developed to improve its solubility. Unfortunately, lipid-based emulsions suffer from other limitations including poor physical stability and the potential for embolism. Strictly aseptic techniques must be maintained when handling these formulations since they do not contain antimicrobial preservatives, and the vehicle can support rapid growth of microorganisms [9, 10]. Among other particulate vehicles, polymeric micelles have presented their great potential in solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs in recent years [11 – 14]. Generally, block copolymers with concentration above the critical micellization concentration (CMC) self-assemble into spherical polymeric micelles with a core-shell structure in water: the hydrophobic segments aggregate to form an inner core being able to accommodate hydrophobic drugs with improved solubility by hydrophobic interactions; the hydrophilic shell consists of a brush-like protective corona that stabilizes the micelles in aqueous solution [15 – 17]. Polymeric micelles as novel drug vehicles present numerous advantages, such as reduced side effects of drugs, selective targeting, stable storage, and stability toward dilution [17, 18]. Furthermore, polymeric micelles possess a nanoscaled size with a narrow distribution. They can protect drugs against oxidation in vitro and premature degradation in vivo owing to their core-shell architecture [19, 20]. More importantly, polymeric micelles are fabricated according to the physicochemical properties of drugs and the compatibility between the core of micelles and drug molecules [14, 21]. Unfavorably, propofol-loaded polymeric micelles formed from poly(N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone)-block-poly(d,l-lactide) (PVP-PLA) copolymers [7, 8], the drug loading content (LC) was extremely low (7 to 12 %). Therefore, there has been an urgent quest to develop an ideal polymeric micelles formulation that can solubilize propofol efficiently and solve some of the aforementioned problems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This Ph. D thesis {{focuses on}} the {{synthesis}} of menthol-loaded-Poly-ε-caprolactone nanoparticles (NP's) for transdermal application. Polymers are increasingly needed to produce nanoparticles ready to convey drugs to the tissues or cells of interest. Polymer nanoparticles are submicron-sized colloidal systems. Without doubt, the adequacy of these systems relies upon {{the structure of the}} vehicle and, specifically, on the mean size and on the particle size distribution (PSD). The poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) polymer is chosen to synthesize nanoparticles because of its adaptability and fine tunning of its physico-chemical properties (great biocompatibility and biodegradability) which can be changed to acquire the desired nanoparticle size. Nanospheres have a monolithic type of structure (network) in which drugs are dispersed or absorbed on the surfaces or in the particles. Nano-capsules are vesicular systems in which the drug is kept in a cavity comprising of an inner liquid encompassed by a polymeric layer, which gives a supporting structure to the encapsulated material. For this state the active principle is normally dissolved in the inner core, yet may likewise be absorbed to the capsule surface. Nanosphere or nanocapsule development basically relies upon the production process. Nanoparticles utilized as drug delivery systems ought to be made out of biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic polymers. A number of distinctive strategies can be used to integrate polymer nanoparticles. Each has their own particular points of interest and constraints, which normally include blending of two fluid streams, e. g. emulsification-evaporation, emulsification-diffusion and solvent displacement. The solvent displacement strategy is characterized by simplicity of reproducibility, the possibility to utilize solvents with low poisonous potential and above all controlled particle size distribution (PSD). The nano-precipitation system involves dissolving the drug and polymer in the same solvent and afterward blending them with an antisolvent (typically water) in which the drug is immiscible and the nanoparticles are spontaneously framed. In this study, the nanoparticles were produced by utilizing three intensive reactors: a confined impinging jet mixer (CIJM), a two-inlet vortex mixer (VM) and a four-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM), testing their performance in the same operating conditions. Dynamic light scattering was carried out to measure the mean nanoparticle size (dp), particle size distribution (PSD), zeta potential (Z-average) and Polydispersity index (PDI). Nanoparticle separation was carried out by a centrifugation process for Transmission Electron microscope (TEM) analysis and menthol loading evaluation. Menthol quantification was evaluated by Gas chromatography (GC). Differential scanning calorimetry and transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques were considered for analysing the particle surface morphology and menthol and identification in the nanoparticles and melatonin suspension over textile fabrics. Exceptional micro scale reactors are extremely helpful to get an efficient blend of the considerable number of components present in the solvent solution. High super-saturation can be produced by distinctive micromixers, for example, the Confined Impinging Jets Mixer (CIJM) and the Multi Inlet Vortex Mixer (MIVM), in less time than the required time for nucleation and growth procedures of the precipitating solutes. Super saturation brings the unconstrained development of nanoparticles within the nano estimate limits. The nanoparticles were prepared using the aforementioned intensive mixers (CIJM and MIVM), PCL polymer and diverse internal cores (menthol, melatonin, miglyol etc). The main goal was to investigate the effect of these working parameters on the mean size of the nanoparticles, a reasonable design of Experiment (DoE) was utilized. Furthermore, the effect of the inlet feed speed Vj (Flow rate FR), mass proportion and quench volumetric proportion QR (dilution) on the mean size dp, the zeta potential Zp and poly dispersity index (PDI) of the nanoparticles was also explored. At first poly-ε-caprolactone nanoparticles (nanospheres) were produced under different working conditions. The essential goal of this evaluation was to prepare the nanoparticle synthesis with a wide size range of menthol-loaded -PCL. A further aim to advance the synthesis parameters. After early promising results it was evident that further examinations were required keeping in mind the final goal to optimize the mean size of the nanoparticles. Likewise, quantification of nanoparticles was completed with the specific end goal of estimating drug loaded and encapsulation efficiency. Quantification procedure included various stages followed by centrifugation, extraction and gas chromatography analysis. All nanoparticles studied in this proposition were produced by the solvent displacement technique, utilizing three reactors CIJM, MIVM- 4 and VM- 2. All trials were performed with a PCL of monolithic-type molecular weight (Mw) 14000 g/mol. Two unique solvents were utilized for the production of the nanoparticles; acetone and acetonitrile. Since these solvents satisfy the following criteria: adequate dissolvability of PCL, <b>water</b> <b>miscibility</b> and low harmfulness. The impact of solvents on the delivered nanoparticles utilizing acetone and acetonitrile was seen: with higher estimations of the inlet feed rate, the nanoparticles became distinctly smaller. In addition, preliminary trials using a third solvent tehtrahydroforan were also done for the sake of comparsion. The impact of the working conditions on the mean size of nanoparticles was explored the underlying polymer concentration, the inlet feed rate and the impacts of the post preparing conditions, for example, the quench (dilution). It was found that the initial polymer concentration, and in addition the inlet feed velocity, has {{a significant impact on the}} mean size of nanoparticles. With higher feeding concentrations of PCL polymer, nanoparticles became distinctly greater. When feed velocity was expanded the mean size of nanoparticles diminished. It was also observed that NP size was higher for acetonitrile in contrast with acetone solvent at comparable working conditions in all cases. Moreover, dilution of the solution containing nanoparticles (higher the quench) was found indispensible to obtain stable nanoparticles. In addition, by expanding the inlet feed rate, smaller nanoparticles with lower zeta potential, were acquired. Smaller nanoparticles were created in the MIVM regarding the CIJM. Polydispersity index (PDI, 0. 05 ± 0. 3) and zeta potential (- 30 mV to - 40 mV) were observed in all investigated experiments. After nanoparticles were produced, they were quantified. An exact and appropriate measurement of menthol was acquired by a Gas chromatography (GC). Results showed that the incorporation efficiency of menthol in the nanoparticles with expanding menthol content was very nearly 60 % - 80 % in both the CIJM and VM mixers, and this indicates that menthol was adequately exemplified by PCL polymer upon precipitation. Loading was assessed at 35 % - 50 % around, with expanding mass proportion of menthol and PCL, when utilizing both reactors. These results were confirmed through morphologic perceptions of nanoparticles utilizing transmission electronic microscope (TEM) examination. From there on, the work was centered around the synthesis of PCL nanocapsules containing differing internal cores (miglyol, and melatonin). Melatonin nanocapsules were further utilized for the impregnation of cotton fabrics. Furthermore, the synthesis and characterization of the nanocapsules formed by PCL (surface layer) and by melatonin or miglyol (in the core) was investigated. To optimize the nanocapsules production process, the impact of different working conditions was explored i. e. the underlying polymer concentration, the underlying, melatonin or miglyol concentrations and the inlet feed rate, on their mean sizes. Comparative conclusions, were observed for menthol loaded nanoparticles, that is when expanding inlet feed rate the mean size of nanocapsules diminished. Finally, it was also found that when concentrations of all substances was increased larger nanocapsules were shaped...|$|E
