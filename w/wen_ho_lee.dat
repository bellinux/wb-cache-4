25|$|In 1999, {{nuclear weapon}} design {{was in the}} news again, {{for the first time}} in decades. In January, the U.S. House of Representatives {{released}} the Cox Report (Christopher Cox R-CA) which alleged that China had somehow acquired classified information about the U.S. W88 warhead. Nine months later, <b>Wen</b> <b>Ho</b> <b>Lee,</b> a Taiwanese immigrant working at Los Alamos, was publicly accused of spying, arrested, and served nine months in pre-trial detention, before the case against him was dismissed. It is not clear that there was, in fact, any espionage.|$|E
25|$|In December 1999, the FBI was {{investigating}} how China obtained {{plans for a}} specific nuclear device. <b>Wen</b> <b>Ho</b> <b>Lee</b> was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory for the People's Republic of China. Federal officials, including then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, publicly named Lee as a suspect before {{he was charged with}} a crime. The U. S. Congress held hearings to investigate the Department of Energy's mishandling of his case. Republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of nuclear weapons and security issues, not the Department of Energy. All but one of the 59 charges against Lee were eventually dropped because the investigation finally proved that the plans the Chinese obtained could not have come from Lee. Lee filed suit and won a $1.6 million settlement against the federal government and news agencies.|$|E

The government would later claim this was 'espionage' and charge him under , (the Espionage Act) {{which makes it a}} felony to 'withhold' information related to the 'national defense'. He eventually pleaded guilty to one of the 54 counts against him. He later won a lawsuit against the government and several newspapers over his treatment.|$|R

25|$|The Senate {{confirmed}} Richardson to be Clinton's Secretary of Energy on July 31, 1998. His {{tenure at}} the Department of Energy was marred by the <b>Wen</b> <b>Ho</b> <b>Lee</b> nuclear controversy. Richardson named Lee, an employee at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, as a suspect who might have given nuclear secrets to the Chinese government. Lee was later cleared of espionage charges and won a settlement against {{the federal government for}} the accusation. Richardson was also criticized by the Senate for his handling of the espionage inquiry, which involved missing computer hard drives with sensitive data, by not testifying in front of Congress sooner. Richardson justified his response by saying that he was waiting to uncover more information before speaking to Congress. Republican Senators called for Richardson's resignation while both parties criticized his role in the incident, and the scandal ended Richardson's hope of being named as Al Gore's running mate for the 2000 presidential election.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, the San Jose Mercury News {{reported}} that the W88 had an egg-shaped primary and a spherical secondary, which were together inside a radiation case known as the [...] "peanut" [...] for its shape. [...] Four months later, The New York Times {{reported that}} in 1995 a supposed double agent from the People's Republic of China delivered information indicating that China knew these details about the W88 warhead as well, supposedly through espionage (this line of investigation eventually resulted in the abortive trial of <b>Wen</b> <b>Ho</b> <b>Lee).</b> If these stories are true, it would indicate {{a variation of the}} Teller-Ulam design which would allow for the miniaturization required for small MIRVed warheads.|$|E

2500|$|In Lee v. Department of Justice (2005), Garland dissented {{from the}} denial of {{rehearing}} en banc after the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court's order holding reporters in contempt of court for refusing to testify about their anonymous sources during the <b>Wen</b> <b>Ho</b> <b>Lee</b> investigation. Garland wrote that the panel had erred in failing to [...] "weigh the public interest in protecting the reporter's sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure" [...] and that this [...] "undermined the Founders' intention to protect the press 'so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.'" [...] In Initiative & Referendum Institute v. U.S. Postal Service (2005), Garland wrote for the court, holding that a U.S. Postal Service regulation banning signature-gathering for petitions at post offices violated the First Amendment. Garland found the regulation to be facially overbroad and not narrowly tailored.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Los Alamos National Laboratory {{scientist}} <b>Wen</b> <b>Ho</b> <b>Lee</b> {{was fired}} from his job, arrested, and held without trial for 278 days while his handling of sensitive nuclear information was investigated. Freeh accused him of downloading a [...] "portable, personal trove" [...] of US nuclear secrets. But ultimately Lee pleaded guilty to {{just one of the}} fifty-nine counts brought against him, after which he was freed from jail. At Lee's sentencing hearing, District Judge James A. Parker scolded the US government for its treatment of Lee, saying that the top decision makers in the case [...] "have embarrassed this entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of it" [...] and that they had been [...] "led astray" [...] by US government officials. Parker apologized to Lee, saying, [...] "Dr. Lee, you were terribly wronged by being held in pretrial custody in demeaning and unnecessarily punitive conditions. I am truly sorry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{laboratory}} {{has attracted}} negative publicity {{from a number}} of events. [...] In 1999, Los Alamos scientist <b>Wen</b> <b>Ho</b> <b>Lee</b> was accused of 59 counts of mishandling classified information by downloading nuclear secrets—"weapons codes" [...] used for computer simulations of nuclear weapons tests—to data tapes and removing them from the lab. After ten months in jail, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count and the other 58 were dismissed with an apology from U.S. District Judge James Parker for his incarceration. Lee had been suspected for having shared U.S. nuclear secrets with China, but investigators were never able to establish what Lee did with the downloaded data. In 2000, two computer hard drives containing classified data were announced to have gone missing from a secure area within the laboratory, but were later found behind a photocopier; in 2003, the laboratory's director John Browne, and deputy director, resigned following accusations that they had improperly dismissed two whistleblowers who had alleged widespread theft at the lab. The year 2000 brought additional hardship for the laboratory {{in the form of the}} Cerro Grande Fire, a severe forest fire that destroyed several buildings (and employees' homes) and forced the laboratory to close for two weeks.|$|E
