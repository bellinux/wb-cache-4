5|$|Aqil angered the kaimakam (district governor) of Acre, Muhammad Kubrisi, for his {{intervention}} {{in a dispute}} between two factions of the Catholic Church in Nazareth. One {{of the leaders of}} the Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided to take matters into his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church was compelled to restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of sedition. Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions,</b> and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the Beni Sakhr tribe.|$|E
5|$|The earthly authority, whose <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> {{should be}} cleaved to both in life (agriculture) and death (funerals), {{is called to}} minaa (an aluk priest). Aluk {{is not just a}} belief system; it is a {{combination}} of law, religion, and habit. Aluk governs social life, agricultural practices, and ancestral rituals. The details of aluk may vary from one village to another. One common law is the requirement that death and life rituals be separated. Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with life rituals. The two rituals are equally important. During the time of the Dutch missionaries, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing life rituals, but were allowed to perform death rituals. Consequently, Toraja's death rituals are still practised today, while life rituals have diminished.|$|E

25|$|Traditions of {{the life}} of Muhammad and the early history of Islam were passed down mostly orally for {{more than a hundred years}} after Muhammad's death in AD 632. Muslim historians say that Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (the third khalifa (caliph) of the Rashidun Empire, or third {{successor}} of Muhammad, who had formerly been Muhammad's secretary), is generally believed to urge Muslims to record the hadith just as Muhammad suggested to some of his followers to write down his <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
25|$|A full {{investigation}} was conducted into the allegations by David Douglas– a former Metropolitan Police detective chief superintendent, {{and head of}} the WPBSA's disciplinary committee. The independent tribunal that followed on 7–8 September, hosted by Sports Resolutions (UK) and chaired by Ian Mill QC, concurred that the WPBSA was right to conclude that Higgins had truthfully accounted for his <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> and to withdraw the more serious charges of match-fixing, but found him guilty of 'giving the impression' he would breach betting rules, and of failing to report the approach made by the News of the World. Higgins received a six-month ban, backdated to the start of his suspension period, and was fined £75,000.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all other}} {{students}}, {{students with disabilities}} experience sexual harassment in school as both victims and perpetrators. Some disabilities could cause a lack of control over impulses, a lack of awareness {{of the effects of}} their <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions,</b> and a lack of social skills needed to avoid sexually harassing behavior. In some circumstances, a student with disabilities could exhibit a behavior that would constitute sexual harassment without intentionally trying to be malicious or inappropriate. In these cases, where a disability could lead to sexually harassing behaviors, positive behavior intervention plans are often put into place by a team often including parents, school administrators, general education teachers, special education teachers, school psychologists, and counselors. These types of plans could also be made during Individualized Education Programmeetings regarding the student.|$|E

25|$|According to Tabata, Noctis' cool mannerisms and {{reserved}} exterior stem from his lonely childhood, {{in addition to}} a fear of losing those closest to him. His <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> stem from a fear of disappointing those around him, causing him to work to both fulfill expectations and bring people happiness as a result. When comparing the personalities of Noctis and Lunafreya, Tabata referred to Noctis as the weaker of the two, remarking that {{he is the one who}} needs protection instead of her. A key part of his narrative is Noctis' transition from prince to king during his journey. According to scenario writer Saori Itamuro, Noctis faces the future as king with both dread and acceptance as he was brought up to expect such an event. This part of his story influenced aspects of his appearance.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{consensus}} among economists regarding the motive force for the U.S. economic expansion that continued {{through most of the}} Roosevelt years (and the 1937 recession that interrupted it). The common view among most economists is that Roosevelt's New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery, although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession. Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt's <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> portended. It was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interrupting recession of 1937. One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of 1935, which effectively raised reserve requirements, causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery. GDP returned to its upward trend in 1938.|$|E
25|$|A {{major element}} of Prompto's {{character}} is his humble origins {{when compared to}} Gladiolus and Ignis, expressing this in his <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions.</b> Prompto's facial features and hairstyle underwent multiple redesigns, the more recent ones based on negative feedback from fans, {{so that he would}} have international appeal. As {{with the rest of the}} party, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance to the Lucian royal family. The character was initially unpopular with series fans, so the team designed Prompto's photography hobby—and its subsequent gameplay and story interactions—as a way of making him useful and enabling each player to chronicle their journey through the game. Tabata later defined Prompto's camera as a manifestation of Prompto's wish to record Noctis and Lunafreya's journey. Prompto proved to be the starting point for Brotherhood, as producer Akio Ofuji conceived the series based around wanting to expand upon a backstory created by staff surrounding his difficult childhood. For Prompto's English performance, Inoue based him on the titular protagonist of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.|$|E

25|$|The Jewish {{conception}} of the messiah (משיח mashiach in Hebrew) holds certain similarities to that of Christians, yet there are substantial differences. According to Jews, the Hebrew Scriptures contain {{a small number of}} prophecies concerning a future descendant of King David, who will be anointed (Hebrew: moshiach) as the Jewish people's new leader and will establish the throne of David in Jerusalem forever. In the Jewish view, this fully human and mortal leader will rebuild the land of Israel and restore the Davidic Kingdom. This subject is covered in the section on Jewish eschatology. Some Christians have a different understanding of the term messiah, and believe that Jesus is the messiah referred to in the Old Testament prophecies; that the kingdom in these prophecies was to be a heavenly kingdom, not an earthly one; and that Jesus' <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> in the New Testament provide evidence of his identity as messiah and that the remainder of messianic prophecy will be fulfilled in the Second Coming. Other Christians acknowledge the Jewish definition of messiah, and hold that Jesus fulfills this, being 'fully man' (in addition to being 'fully God'), and believe that the Second Coming will establish the Kingdom of God on earth, where Jesus, as messiah and descendant from David, will reign from Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Despite his flaws, Saint-Just {{is often}} accorded {{respect for the}} {{strength}} of his convictions. Although his <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> may be viewed as reprehensible, his commitment to them is rarely questioned: he was [...] "implacable but sincere". Like Robespierre, he was incorruptible {{in the sense that he}} exhibited no attraction to material benefits but devoted himself entirely to the advancement of a political agenda.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} themes in Le Père Goriot is the quest to {{understand}} and ascend society's strata. The Charter of 1814 granted by King Louis XVIII had established a [...] "legal country" [...] which allowed only {{a small group of}} the nation's most wealthy men to vote. Thus, Rastignac's drive to achieve social status is evidence not only of his personal ambition but also of his desire to participate in the body politic. As with Scott's characters, Rastignac epitomizes, in his <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions,</b> the Zeitgeist in which he lives.|$|E

In 1972, she stated, [...] "Anything that gets out of control becomes a hazard, whether it's fire, flood, or women's lib". She {{went on to say}} that [...] "we want to preserve the nobility, dignity, and femininity of women; there's a danger of some of that being lost.

500|$|According to {{historian}} Clarance A. Bacote, [...] "Before the Spanish–American War, the Negroes, {{in spite}} of some mistakes, regarded McKinley as the best friend they ever had." [...] Under pressure from black leaders, McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant. [...] McKinley toured the South in late 1898, promoting sectional reconciliation. He visited Tuskegee Institute and black educator Booker T. Washington. He also visited Confederate memorials. In his tour of the South, McKinley {{did not mention the}} racial tensions or violence. Although the President received a rapturous reception from Southern whites, many African Americans, excluded from official welcoming committees, felt alienated by the President's <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions.</b> [...] Gould concluded regarding race, [...] "McKinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all Americans".|$|E

500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of {{the former vice president}} Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal...

500|$|Although {{some critics}} and historians view the {{language}} and examples employed by the Drapier to describe the possible economic harms as over the top, others consider that Swift's imagery was grounded in truth. Even Swift's satire of Wood's character is based on actual evidence and added very little to what Wood provided the public through his <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions.</b> Although the Drapier emphasises Wood's involvement and not the king's, glosses of the first letter reveal allusions to Wood bribing the Duchess of Kendal that obscure the distinction to the careful reader. However, the Drapier always respects the king {{as leader of the}} Irish nation and the Irish church, although some critics see his bold language and free use of the king's name and title as undermining those positions. The Drapier makes sure that Wood appears to be the primary target, which, when combined with only an indirect attack upon people {{at the top of the}} British political system, reassured the people of Ireland that they could rebel against an [...] "insignificant hardware man".|$|E
500|$|Wills {{struck his}} contemporaries as {{peculiar}} {{and at times}} narcissistic, with a prickly temperament, but also kind, charismatic and companionable. Often embroiled in controversy, he seemed to lack {{an understanding of how}} his <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>actions</b> could repeatedly get him into trouble. His obsession with sport was such that he showed little interest in anything else. Through his research, journalist Martin Flanagan concluded that Wills was [...] "utterly bereft of insight into himself", and football historian Gillian Hibbins described Wills as [...] "an overbearing and undisciplined young man who tended to blame others for his troubles and was more interested in winning a game than in respecting sporting rules." [...] Wills' family and peers, though angered by his misbehaviour, frequently forgave him. It is unlikely that he sought popular favour, but his strong egalitarian streak helped solidify his folk hero status. This affection for him, coupled with an understanding of his waywardness, found expression in the public motto: [...] "With all thy faults I love thee still, Tommy Wills".|$|E
