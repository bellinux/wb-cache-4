5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E

5|$|By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena <b>was</b> (<b>indeed)</b> neither galena nor graphite.

Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.|$|E
5|$|Colbert dropped {{hints of}} a {{potential}} presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, I Am America (And So Can You!), which was rumored (invariably by Colbert himself) to {{be a sign that}} he <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating he had not yet made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the best option was to attack Princeton.|$|E

5|$|If Mac Scelling <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> {{a member}} of the Meic Somairlethe {{descendants}} of Somairlethis relationship may cast light upon Somairle's struggles in the Isles. For instance, Mac Scelling's cooperation with Muirchertach could be evidence that Guðrøðr faced united opposition from Somairle and Muirchertach. In fact, there is evidence indicating that Guðrøðr and Muirchertach were indeed at odds {{at some point in the}} 1150s or 1160s, as the former appears to have briefly gained the kingship of Dublin at the expense of Muirchertach's authority as overlord.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 the Norwegian {{pathologist}} Leiv Kreyberg {{was allowed}} to examine one of Reich's bion preparations under a microscope. Kreyberg wrote that the broth Reich had used as his culture medium <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> sterile, but that the bacteria were ordinary staphylococci. He concluded that Reich's control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether John Doukas married once or twice. The name of only one wife, Zoe Doukaina, is known. She was the {{daughter}} of Constantine Doukas and Anna Doukaina, whose exact identity is unclear. If he married twice, then his first marriage took place c. 1150, and his unknown first wife must have died c. 1165. If Zoe Doukaina <b>was</b> <b>indeed</b> his second wife, this marriage took place c. 1170.|$|E

Despite these and his great popularity however, {{he was unable to}} achieve his ambition of marrying Praejecta: his wife came to the imperial capital and presented her case to the Empress Theodora. The Empress compelled Artabanes to retain his wife, and not until after Theodora's death in 548 was the Armenian general able to divorce himself. By then, however, Praejecta had already been remarried.|$|E
