40|$|The {{following}} is a study of how the <b>welfare</b> <b>taxi</b> services in Sweden {{have been affected by}} the introduction of a ceiling to their specific grants. The municipalities that were studied were found to have expanded the services at a slower rate since the introduction of the ceiling, and from this time there has been a greater use of fees to finance the taxi service. ...|$|E
40|$|Built {{up on the}} {{previous}} studies, this paper incorporates both bilateral taxi-customer search friction and congestion externality into the economic analyses of the equilibrium properties of taxi market. We take account of congestion externalities by adopting a realistic distance-based and delay-based taxi fare structure. We first investigate comparative static effects of regulatory variables of taxi fare and fleet size on the market, and then examine {{the properties of the}} Pareto-efficient solutions for simultaneous maximization of social <b>welfare</b> and <b>taxi</b> profit in the congested market...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} entry and price {{regulation}} in the taxi industry are analysed. Previous work {{has not taken}} full account of the peculiarities of the taxi market and has underestimated the welfare loss caused by inappropriate regulation. This paper presents {{a model of the}} taxi industry which demonstrates that if price competition is infeasible then the market will necessarily lead to an outcome which is socially undesirable. In particular, there will be too many taxis operating at too high a price. This holds whatever the elasticities of demand with respect to price and waiting time. However, this crucial evidence on price and service elasticities has not previously been available. To that end, we present the results from a number of case studies which demonstrate the size of potential market failure under different conditions. Optimal price-setting, together with free-entry subject to quality controls, is the efficient strategy for regulating the taxi trade and could increase <b>welfare</b> considerably. <b>taxi,</b> demand elasticity, regulation, deregulation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{properties}} of an aggregate taxi service model with general bilateral searching and meeting functions, which characterize the meeting frictions between vacant taxis and customers. Three specific issues are analyzed theoretically for meeting functions that exhibit increasing, constant and decreasing returns to scales, respectively. Firstly, the market profitability at social optimum is examined, and {{it is found that}} taxi services should be subsidized at social optimum only when there are increasing returns to scale in the meeting function. Secondly, both service quality in terms of customer waiting/search time and average profit per taxi are examined in relation with taxi fleet size, and a Pareto-improving win-win situation is identified, where an increase in taxi fleet size leads to improvement in both service quality and market profitability. It is found such a Pareto-improving situation emerges if and only if there are increasing returns to scale in the meeting functions. Thirdly, due to the different viewpoints of government and private companies, we investigated {{the properties of}} Pareto-optimality via a bi-objective programming approach for simultaneous maximization of social <b>welfare</b> and <b>taxi</b> profit. This thesis proves that the taxi utilization in terms of the percentage of occupied taxi time and the service quality in terms of customer waiting time are constantly equal to those at social optimum only if there are constant returns to scale in the meeting function. However, the cases with increasing (decreasing) returns to scale are examined with different properties of Pareto-optimality. Cost recovery ratio is also explored in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The taxi sector {{presents}} {{many challenges}} to adequately serve the demand while maximising efficiency and profitability and minimising externalities. Many authors {{have dealt with}} the ‘taxi industry’ by modelling and forecasting its activity, usually using limited, incomplete or no trustable data to validate their model. The present paper tackles a different point of view. The applied methodology is based in the continuous monitoring of a sample of taxis that provide information recorded by the taximeter about their real activity. Taximeter data allows the definition of a wide series of representative and relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with which characterize the taxi activity. This paper focuses on the analysis of efficiency and profitability using KPIs. Thus, indicators firstly diagnose the system revealing its (in) efficiencies and whether or not is profitable. While studying profitability, the concept of the reasonable profit (RP) is presented to ensure <b>welfare</b> to the <b>taxi</b> driver. Indicators also represent an assessment tool to evaluate improvement measures and they constitute a powerful support for the decision making. In this sense, a methodology for the annual review of fares is developed introducing the concept of the RP. KPIs are applied in Barcelona, where they proof a demand-supply imbalance: since 2008 supply has increased significantly and demand has diminished; consequently, productivity and profitability have decreased considerably. Hence, KPIs reveal the inefficiencies of the Barcelona taxi system and demonstrate that its profitability is at risk. Postprint (published version...|$|R
30|$|Writers who are {{supportive}} of Uber and who tend also to distrust structures that support established taxi services {{do not accept}} these assertions. Whilst {{they may want to}} see some regulation, this will tend to relate to protecting the physical safety of road users rather than the <b>welfare</b> of conventional <b>taxi</b> drivers or the smooth running of the highway network. Part of the enthusiasm for Uber lies in its rating system which is argued to provide a natural means of promoting good service as well as rooting out poor performance. Walker Smith, for example, sees the Uber model being replicated, with “trust” distributed and secured “from the bottom up by community consensus” ([66], p. 389), providing further evidence of the polarisation amongst commentators: those who favour the free market applaud the “creative disruption” [46] Uber has brought and celebrate the dismay that it has caused amongst what they see as vested interests (the established taxi market). These same writers are not keen on regulation (except {{to the extent that it}} protects the safety of users) and so do not express concern over the way Uber is affecting the governance of transport in cities. A perhaps more balanced view emerged from an ITF round table on the subject which was attended by representatives of governments and the various elements of the taxi/PHV industry, including Uber. Its conclusion was that equitably improving mobility, safety, consumer welfare and sustainability would “likely entail lightening entry controls for the for-hire transport market and fares regulation for dispatched taxi services. It will require continued oversight for services obtained via street hail/rank, which are marked by lack of effective consumer choice” ([27], p. 7). The question of whether Uber can and should be treated as if it were a conventional PHV company continues to be debated.|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{properties of}} an aggregate taxi market are investigated using a general bilateral searching and meeting function which characterizes the search frictions between vacant taxis and unserved customers. Three specific issues are analyzed for meeting functions that exhibit increasing, constant and decreasing returns to scale. Firstly, service quality {{in terms of}} customer wait/search time and average profit per taxi are examined jointly in relation to taxi fleet size, and a Pareto-improving win-win situation is identified, where an increase in taxi fleet size leads to improvements in both service quality and market profitability. Such a Pareto-improving situation is found to emerge {{if and only if}} the meeting functions show increasing returns to scale. Secondly, the properties of the socially optimal solution are examined. It is found that the taxi fleet size should be chosen such that the total cost of operating vacant taxis equals the total cost of customer waiting time multiplied by an asymmetric factor of the meeting function, and that taxi services should be subsidized at social optimum only when the meeting functions show increasing returns to scale. Thirdly, the Pareto-efficient services are examined for trade-offs between social welfare and profits in the light of partially conflicting objectives of the public sector and the private taxi firms using a bi-objective maximization approach. The taxi utilization rate and the customer wait/search time or service quality are proved to be constant along the Pareto frontier and equal to those at social optimum if the meeting functions show constant returns to scale. Extensions are made to the cases with increasing and decreasing returns to scale. This thesis further incorporates both bilateral taxi-customer search frictions and congestion externality into the economic analyses of the equilibrium properties of taxi market. We take account of congestion externalities by adopting a realistic distance-based and delay-based taxi fare structure. We first investigate comparative static effects of regulatory variables of taxi fare and fleet size on the market, and then examine the properties of the Pareto-efficient solutions for simultaneous maximization of social <b>welfare</b> and <b>taxi</b> profit in the congested market. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) is applied to estimate the returns to scale in a Cobb-Douglas type bilateral searching and meeting function which characterizes the search frictions between vacant taxis and unserved customers. Number of taxis, taxi fare, population, average occupied taxi journey time and disposable income are used as exogenous variables; while customer demand, average customer waiting time and average taxi waiting and cruising time in search of each customer are used as endogenous variables. These variables are coupled together through the SEM whose parameters are estimated from the Hong Kong annual taxi survey data. Our calibration results show that urban taxi services in Hong Kong exhibits an increasing return to scale. The established SEM model can be used to obtain regulatory information useful for decision making, such as the impact of the restriction over the number of taxi licenses and the fixing of taxi fare structure...|$|R
