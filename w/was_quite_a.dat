5|$|Following Juventus's {{return to}} Serie A, Del Piero {{was locked in}} months of fractious {{negotiations}} over the signing of a new contract with Juventus' new management. After successfully negotiating a new contract till 30 June 2010, he was greeted with news {{of the birth of}} his first child, Tobias Del Piero. This <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> staggering turnaround in his fortunes, as only two weeks earlier, he was dropped by Claudio Ranieri for the Serie A match with Fiorentina, and was then axed from Roberto Donadoni's Italy squad for the games with Georgia and South Africa.|$|E

So we {{constructed}} this backing track and then more of the girls started to come in—this <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> good day—and gradually they started to add on their little bits.|$|E
5|$|While {{traveling}} from Shandong into North Zhili, Choe noticed {{a multitude of}} boats passing by which held officials from the Ministries of War, Justice, and Personnel. When he questioned his escorts about this, Choe {{was told that the}} newly enthroned Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1488–1505) had recently impeached a large number of officials from office whom he considered inept and unworthy of their positions. Brook writes that it <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> comfortable privilege for disgraced and dismissed officials to be escorted by the courier service, yet even this saving of face was still a firm reminder of their banishment from court.|$|E
50|$|A lot of today's {{electronic}} game products have chipsets with keys, {{that make it}} difficult or impossible to interchange the integrated circuits in the device, in order to repair it, or to carry out certain interface or applications. Some people do get around the keys, but it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> involved process. There <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> good counterculture scene however, and there <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> few people who do this.|$|R

5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked very hard on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in lead pencil, then {{to put in the}} shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed at lower right) by a variety of engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

25|$|The {{terminology}} did not {{settle down}} until {{some time after}} the publication of the Origin of Species. The word evolution <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> late-comer: it can be seen in Herbert Spencer's Social Statics of 1851, and {{there is at least one}} earlier example, but it was not in general use until about 1865-70.|$|E
25|$|Fairly large {{single-storied}} earthen {{structures are}} common {{in different parts of}} the world, but building a two-storied structure of such enormous proportions as that of the main building at the resort, <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> challenge. Since the building was designed without any concrete pillars, extra attention had to be paid to load bearing and load balancing aspects to ensure stability.|$|E

25|$|King {{finally got}} out of Germany in 1939, {{with the help of}} German friends. One helped her get a visa for England. Another warned her that he had {{received}} his mobilisation papers and that she should leave as soon as possible. She spent about a year in domestic service with families in southern England. She found England far more old-fashioned and conservative than the Berlin she had come from. This <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> shock.|$|E
25|$|When Fr. Godofredo was {{transferred}} to Pasig in September 1919, Fr. Josef Billiet became the Parish Priest of Paco, a position he held for 10 years. Finding it too inconvenient to administer a growing school which <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> distance from the convent of Paco, he had a wooden building of five rooms constructed along Trece de Agosto Street on the North and along the estero on the South of the present site of Paco Catholic School. The students of Peñafrancia transferred to the new building in the early 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Abdul Ghani <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{multilingual}} person. He spoke Urdu, {{his native}} tongue, Bengali, English, and Persian. He learnt Arabic and Persian at home, and English at Dhaka Collegiate School, {{where he was}} the student of the very first batch. He is known as patron of Urdu and Persian literature in Dhaka. He observed the Shi'a Remembrance of Muharram, and contributed to renovate Hoseni Dalan, the Shi'ite centre in Dhaka, though he was a Sunni himself. He also had close relations with the Hindu, Armenian and European community.|$|E

25|$|The Dennis Dart, {{released}} in 1989, {{had been a}} runaway success, so in 1991 the Plaxton Pointer midibus was announced, this <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> utilitarian, square body. This {{was followed by the}} Plaxton Verde, which Plaxton hoped would match the success of its smaller sister, but it failed to capture the market quite as much as the Pointer, and {{it was clear that the}} bus industry wasn't buying 12m single-deckers in as large numbers any more. Later that year new coach bodies, the Plaxton Premiere and Plaxton Excalibur, were launched.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some kind}} of reform was {{obviously}} needed to contrast the criminal problems of the streets, nowadays critics believe that watchmen were actually vigorously engaged in catching offenders, and that their work might be concealed in the records because the official arrest would be recorded by the constable {{in charge of the}} watch. The Old Bailey Session Papers report many examples of watchmen being very capable and brave in confronting and arresting offenders. Probably the statutory reward to be earned from the arrest of a street robber or a burglar <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> good incentive, not to mention possible private gratuities and local rewards.|$|E
25|$|Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich {{were unable}} to {{practice}} on Christmas Eve – {{mainly because of the}} drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two hour work-out on Christmas morning. It <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents.|$|E

25|$|The regime gave {{plenty of}} support to musicians willing to write and sing anti-U.S. or pro-revolution songs; this <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bonus {{in an era when}} many of the {{traditional}} musicians were finding it difficult or impossible to earn a living. In 1967 the Casa de las Américas in Havana held a Festival de la canción de protesta (protest songs). Much of the effort was spent applauding causes that would annoy the U.S. government. Tania Castellanos, a filín singer and author, wrote ¡Por Angela! in support of Angela Davis. César Portillo de la Luz wrote Oh, valeroso Viet Nam. These were hot topics of the 1970s, but their topicality declined as time passed.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the speech, {{eighteen}} men gathered outside the schoolhouse. They began throwing rocks and other debris at the school, breaking all of the windows. Enos Hawley and the guest speaker were both injured in the assault. Upon fleeing the school, the abolitionists were pelted with eggs. The rioters followed Hawley and his guest to Hawley's home at the corner of High and Main Streets. They continued the assault on Hawley's home until after midnight, when the local law enforcement officers were able to quell the riot and arrest the rioters. The rioters were indicted in September and went to trial in October; thirteen of the eighteen rioters were found guilty as charged. The jury's deliberation <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> long process.|$|E
