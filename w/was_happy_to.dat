5|$|Brashear {{struggled}} in New York, however, registering just one assist and 73 PIMs in 36 games; he became unhappy with {{his role in}} New York and asked the Rangers for a trade. Following a stretch of seven-straight and 12 of 13 games {{where he was a}} healthy scratch, the Rangers placed Brashear on waivers. After clearing waivers, he was assigned to the Rangers' AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. Despite the demotion, Brashear <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be receiving steady ice time whilst in Hartford.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Light {{became famous}} among {{aviation}} enthusiasts {{due to his}} 1934 around-the-world flight. To celebrate his marriage to Meader, he wished to approximate the same, and Meader <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> comply. During the planning of the trip, many points on Earth had not been captured on film from {{the air and the}} American Geographical Society promoted these photographic flights, as they were trying to build an aerial collection. Light's idea was to travel across areas South America and Africa never been aerially photographed.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{his social}} circle grew to include William Cameron Edwards. Through Edwards, Rutherford was {{introduced}} to the Birkett family, which included former Member of Parliament Thomas Birkett. Rutherford married Birkett's niece, Mattie Birkett, in December 1888. The couple had three children: Cecil (born in 1890), Hazel (born in 1893), and Marjorie (born in 1903, but died sixteen months later). Rutherford had a traditional view of gender roles, and <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> leave most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife.|$|E

5|$|Failing to {{turn the}} Braves into a winning team, Bancroft {{requested}} his release from the team after the 1927 season. He signed with the Brooklyn Robins the same day. Stating that he <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> {{no longer have the}} stress of managing, he played for the Robins for the 1928 and 1929 seasons. During his time with the Robins, he was seen as a possible successor to manager Wilbert Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Honoré III was {{a soldier}} who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> leave Monaco to be governed by others, most notably a former tutor. It was on one of Honoré III's rare visits to the palace in 1767 that illness forced Edward, Duke of York, to land at Monaco. The sick duke was {{allocated}} the state bedchamber where he promptly died. Since that date the room has been known as the York Room.|$|E

5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff. He became {{responsible for}} matters other than operations, such as administration and training. It {{soon became clear}} that Jones and Bostock could not get along together, but Kenney preferred to have Bostock in operational command, and although he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> leave arrangements the way they were.|$|E

5|$|Olmstead was {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985. Olmstead, with his wife Nora, visited the town of Okotoks, Alberta on August 13, 2005, with the Stanley Cup. He had previously declined to spend a day with it, believing that it was being given to much older winners only because of the lockout. Olmstead also noted, {{at the end of the}} day, that he <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have the Stanley Cup again. Olmstead died at his home in High River, Alberta on November 16, 2015, due to complications from a stroke.|$|E

5|$|Air Chief Marshal Burnett had {{recommended}} his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 {{to bring in}} an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond had indicated that he <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{recruitment}} of Tomáš Ujfaluši and Johnny Heitinga pushed Pablo down the pecking order, he finished the 2008–09 season with 21 league appearances. An offer from Real Zaragoza of less than €5m {{was rejected by the}} club as insufficient, but despite the arrival of Juanito adding to the defensive competition, Pablo said he <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see out the remaining year of his contract. In that final season, he played rarely. He took part in the early rounds of the Copa del Rey and in the group stage of the Champions League as Atlético finished third in their group and dropped into the Europa League, but made his last appearance for the club, as a late substitute, on 20 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the {{decision}} was made, French shipyards were heavily committed to producing vessels for the French Navy. So, despite its intention to develop a French concept, the KSCS engaged Yarrow Shipbuilders in Glasgow, Scotland, to build the ships. Unlike the French, who preferred to install guns of their own manufacture, Yarrow <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> order the guns from the Czechoslovak firm Škoda. The initial Yarrow design {{was based on an}} enlarged version of the British Shakespeare class, with five Skoda 14 cm/56 naval guns. Excessive top weight resulted in the deletion of one of the guns, to be replaced with a seaplane mounting. The final version replaced the seaplane mounting with improved anti-aircraft armament.|$|E

5|$|Bakshi's frustrations {{with his}} failing {{marriage}} {{and the state of}} the planet further drove his need to animate. In 1959, he moved his desk to join the rest of the animators; after asking Rasinski for material to animate, he received layouts of two scenes: a hat floating on water and Deputy Dawg, the lead character of one of Terrytoons' syndicated television series, running. Despite threats of repercussion from the animators' union, Rasinski fought to keep Bakshi as a layout artist. Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E
5|$|By early 1952, Robey was {{becoming}} noticeably frail, {{and he lost}} interest in many of his sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth. In May he filmed The Pickwick Papers, in which he {{played the role of}} old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as Clown in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume instead of the usual clown garb, a request the comedian <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> fulfil.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{struggled}} {{under new}} coach Marc Crawford {{early in the}} 2006–07 season, falling to five goals and 16 points in 52 games for the Kings before he was traded back to the Flames on January 29, 2007, in exchange for Jamie Lundmark and two draft picks. An emotional Conroy, who said he <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> return to Calgary, scored two goals the following night in his second debut with the Flames to defeat his former Kings teammates, 4–1. Conroy finished the season by scoring 21 points in 28 games for Calgary, then scored 34 points in 2007–08.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{reclaiming}} the Drivers' Championship lead at {{the preceding}} Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton {{said that he}} was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set his sights on a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.|$|E
5|$|His knighthood {{involved}} some controversy, {{following his}} wife's public comment {{that he was}} the only Australian state governor without such an honour. As knighthoods were then conferred by the Queen on the recommendation of her Federal and State governments, and the Governor was the Queen's representative in the state, this was seen as highly inappropriate, especially given the Western Australian ALP State government of the day, led by John Tonkin had a policy of not recommending Imperial Honours. However, the Tonkin Government was defeated in April 1974 and the incoming Liberal Premier, Sir Charles Court, <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> make the necessary recommendation.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
