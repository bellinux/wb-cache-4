25|$|The {{first draft}} of the bill was printed on 6 December 1989, and {{consisted}} of 87 sections and 13 schedules spread over 115 pages. By the time the bill passed this had been extended to 125 sections and 20 schedules spread over 201 pages, mostly due {{to the discovery of}} how complex the required reforms <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be.</b> The bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 6 December 1989 by Lord Strathmore.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{summarised}} {{the importance}} of Epstein when he was interviewed in 1997 for a BBC documentary about Epstein, saying, [...] "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian". In his 1970 Rolling Stone interview, Lennon commented that Epstein's death {{marked the beginning of}} the end for the group: [...] "I knew that we were in trouble then... I thought, 'We've had it now'". Thirty years after Epstein's death, McCartney said, [...] "Brian <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> happy to hear how much we loved him". The first contract between the Beatles and Epstein was auctioned in London in 2008, fetching £240,000.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} Roberts' idea {{to bring back}} the Cybermen, because there were no other {{returning}} monsters in the series and he thought [...] "there should be a sense of history about the Doctor's final battle to save Earth before he heads off to meet his death". He felt that this was consistent with the theme of [...] "death and lingering darkness" [...] that had run throughout the sixth series. Roberts wanted the audience to think that maybe Craig <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> converted. Moffat felt the [...] "blowing the Cybermen up with love" [...] conclusion was the Doctor Who version of a father bonding with his son. Roberts felt that the episode's depiction of the Cybermen put it on the [...] "silly/terrifying axis" [...] that was common in Doctor Who.|$|E

500|$|Episode writer Lender {{proposed}} to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu {{appear as a}} gag {{at the end of}} the episode. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender's proposal and allowed him to do it. Lender said, [...] "Steve gave you the opportunities to do things that <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> memorable, if you could sell him on it." [...] Lender then searched for books with scannable pictures of Count Orlok. However, the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet. He said, [...] "I searched what little there was of the Web back then." [...] Nick Jennings Photoshopped the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender's board drawing. Lender said, [...] "It was my baby, and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [...]" [...] Before his idea of Count Orlok, Lender thought of [...] "Floorboard Harry", a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode, in which he initially flickers the lights.|$|E
500|$|... "The Front" [...] {{was written}} by Adam I. Lapidus and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. In the early 1990s, Lapidus saw a news report on television about three 13-year-old girls - Renee Carter, Sarah Creef, and Amy Crosby - who had written a script for Tiny Toon Adventures, titled [...] "Buster And Babs Go Hawaiian". The show's executive producer, Steven Spielberg, liked the script {{so much that he}} brought the three to Hollywood to work with the show's writing staff. Upon seeing the report, Lapidus thought, [...] "That <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> a neat idea for Bart and Lisa." [...] He wrote a spec script, which made its way via executive producer James L. Brooks to the Simpsons staff, who hired Lapidus to write the episode. [...] "The Front" [...] is the only Simpsons episode written by Lapidus, causing some dispute among the show's fans as to whether he actually exists or was perhaps a pseudonym. Lapidus' mother-in-law came upon one such debate on an Internet forum.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Bob Marley {{signed with}} CBS Records in London and {{embarked}} on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash. While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> the way to break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image." [...] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, {{which resulted in the}} album Catch a Fire.|$|E

2500|$|These {{calls to}} extend {{the scope of the}} inquiry to include missing and murdered {{aboriginal}} people of all genders have met with resistance and been criticized as detracting from the current focus on the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women. [...] Barbara Bailey, who was on the UN team that visited Canada in 2013 to investigate the violence, has said, [...] "I think to detract now <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> a tragedy. Let’s fix that problem first and then we can begin to see what else is out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rickover was {{promoted}} to rear admiral by the next selection board in July. [...] "This {{is the end of}} the selection system," [...] mourned one of Holloway's friends. [...] "No, it isn't," [...] Holloway replied. [...] "It isn't the end...because we've used a law to promote him...to make the will of the Secretary felt. When we're too hidebound and reactionary, there's room in the law for the Secretary to get his way. If you don't do that, you'd have a special law in Congress which <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> the end of the selection system." ...|$|E

Sweet as it is however, the Cosworth Vega is still way down the excitement ladder from what it would be with another 30 or 40 bhp. Then it <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Aline agreed. [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>really</b> have <b>been</b> {{impossible}} for him to have returned to-night. And it will be much better to travel to-morrow. The journey at so late an hour would tire you so much, dear madame." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{it stands}} now, ... federal law prohibits anyone from {{being forced to}} join a union.

2500|$|Kurzweil says {{life in the}} {{universe}} is [...] "both rare and plentiful" [...] meaning for vast stretches there is nothing then piled into a small space it is everywhere. He suggests any form of life that invents technology will, if it survives, relatively quickly reach the point of merging with that technology, the same thing he predicts will happen to humans. Therefore, Kurzweil explains if we ever met another civilization, we <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> meeting with its technology. The technology would likely be microscopic in size because that is all that would be necessary for exploration. The civilization would not be looking for anything except knowledge, therefore we would likely never notice it.|$|E
2500|$|By 1937, in {{tune with}} the National Christian Party regime, Cantacuzino had embraced eugenics, racism, and antisemitism. At a meeting in Cluj, she {{proposed}} the introduction of legislation banning all [...] "foreigners" [...] and minorities from marrying Romanian state employees, as well as 10-year reviews for all Romanian citizenship applications. Additionally, she and the GFR envisaged state bonuses for [...] "eugenic" [...] marriages between full-blooded Romanian youths. Meanwhile, her connections in the international feminist movement became alarmed by the growth of antisemitic violence. In a December 1933 letter to Cantacuzino, Cécile Brunschvicg inquired: [...] "there is talk of terrible antisemitic campaigns in Romania, and of the development of a Nazi spirit in your country. Is this true? [...] It <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> a deplorable if [...] spirit were to win over a Latin country that is so sane, and so very close to our hearts." ...|$|E

50|$|It is {{reported}} that Mezzalama always wore a big 15-25 kg rucksack on his ski tours, {{that he never}} left to anybody.
