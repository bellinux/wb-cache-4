Look at you, all {{decent and}} unriotous, and only fit to sit on juries and mend the wood-house door. You was a man once. I have hostility for all such acts. Why don't {{you go in the}} house and count the tidies or set the clock, and not stand out here in the atmosphere? A jack-rabbit might come along and bite you.' ...|$|E

I wanted him to come with me; but he shuffled out of it. I {{could see that he was}} quite afraid of you. Only fancy: he wanted me not to come. As if [trembling] I should be afraid of you, dearie. [Vivie's gravity deepens]. But of course I told him it was all settled and {{comfortable}} between us, and that we were on the best of terms. [She breaks down]. Vivie: whats the meaning of this? [She produces a commercial envelope, and fumbles at the enclosure with trembling fingers]. I got it from the bank this morning.|$|E
6000|$|Hetty {{looked at}} him sharply. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I am. <b>You</b> would have <b>gone</b> on to the major's. You know <b>you</b> would. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> there so often for?" ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{they went}} away, Jesus {{began to speak}} to the crowds {{concerning}} John: [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out into the wilderness to see?

6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} enjoyed your visit to London," [...] she said. [...] "Did {{you go to}} buy Angela a set of {{diamonds}} in Bond Street? You did n't buy anything--you {{did n't go into}} a shop? Then pray <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> for? Excuse my curiosity--it seems to me it 's rather flattering. I never know anything unless I am told. I have n't any powers of observation. I noticed you went--oh, yes, I observed that very much; and I thought it very strange, under the circumstances. Your most intimate friend arrived in Paris, and you choose the next day to make a little tour! I don't like to see you treat my husband so; he would never have done it to you. And if you did n't stay for Gordon, you might have staid for Angela. I never heard of anything so monstrous as a gentleman rushing away from the object of his affection, for no particular purpose that any one could discover, the day after she has accepted him. It was not the day after? Well, it was too soon, at any rate. Angela could n't in the least tell me what you had gone for; she said it was for a 'change.' That was a charming reason! But she was very much ashamed of you--and so was I; and at last we all sent Captain Lovelock after you to bring you back. You came back without him? Ah, so much the better; I suppose he is still looking for you, and, as he is n't very clever, that will occupy him for some time. We want to occupy him; we don't approve of his being so idle. However, for my own part, I am very glad you were away. I was a great deal at Mrs. Vivian's, and I should n't have felt nearly so much at liberty to go if I had known I should always find you there making love to Mademoiselle. It would n't have seemed to me discreet,--I know {{what you are going to}} say--that it 's the first time you ever heard of my wishing to avoid an indiscretion. It 's a taste I have taken up lately,--for the same reason you went to London, for a 'change.'" [...] Here Blanche paused for an appreciable moment; and then she added--"Well, I must say, I have never seen anything so lovely as Mrs. Vivian's influence. I hope mamma won't be disappointed in it this time." ...|$|E

5000|$|In college Paterno was {{a member}} of Delta Kappa Epsilon {{fraternity}} (Upsilon chapter).
