2500|$|The {{practical}} {{significance of}} Simpson's paradox surfaces {{in decision making}} situations where it poses the following dilemma: Which data should we consult in choosing an action, the aggregated or the partitioned? In the Kidney Stone example above, {{it is clear that}} if one is diagnosed with [...] "Small Stones" [...] or [...] "Large Stones" [...] the data for the respective subpopulation should be consulted and Treatment A would be preferred to Treatment B. But <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> patient is not diagnosed, {{and the size of the}} stone is not known; would it be appropriate to consult the aggregated data and administer Treatment B? This would stand contrary to common sense; a treatment that is preferred both under one condition and under its negation should also be preferred when the condition is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2007, JR and Babe's tempestuous romance {{received}} notice by TV Guide's Daniel R. Coleridge, {{who published}} {{an exclusive interview}} with Babe's former portrayer, Alexa Havins, and queried her about the matter. Coleridge cited the marriage as dysfunctional and seemed perplexed as to why Babe would stay with a man who tried to kill her, and as he put it, [...] "verbally abuses her all the time". Havins addressed deeper issues about the coupling:I know. I asked if we could do a PSA (Public service announcement) for women in abusive relationships to get help, but that didn't happen. I was concerned about how viewers might be influenced by Babe saying, 'Oh, it's OK, JR, you only tried to kill me because you were drinking.' <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> woman decided to ignore the warning signs of abuse and stay in a bad relationship, and then a true tragedy happened? ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the split, the {{remnants}} of the Irish Volunteers were often, and erroneously, referred to as the [...] "Sinn Féin Volunteers", or, by the British press, derisively as [...] "Shinners", after Arthur Griffith's political organisation Sinn Féin. Although the two organisations had some overlapping membership, there was no official connection between Griffith's then moderate Sinn Féin and the Volunteers. The political stance of the remaining Volunteers was not always popular, and a 1,000-strong march led by Pearse through the garrison city of Limerick on Whit Sunday, 1915, was pelted with rubbish by a hostile crowd. Pearse explained the reason for the establishment of the new force when he said in May 1915: What if conscription be enforced on Ireland? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> Unionist or a Coalition British Ministry repudiates the Home Rule Act? What if it be determined to dismember Ireland? The future is big with these and other possibilities.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Jonathan that Abraham's servant Eliezer made an {{improper}} request when in [...] he asked God to grant that the young woman whom he would ask to draw water for him and who replied by offering also to water his camels might be the one whom God had decreed for Isaac. Rabbi Samuel asked {{what would have happened if}} she had happened to be lame or blind, and concluded that Eliezer was fortunate that Providence answered him by sending Rebekah to meet him. Rabbi Samuel compared Eliezer's request to the improvident oaths that Saul made in 1 Samuel [...] when he promised his daughter to the man who would kill Goliath and that Jephthah made in [...] when he promised to sacrifice whatever came out of his house to meet him on his return. Similarly, a Midrash taught that Abraham's servant was one of four who asked improperly — Eliezer, Caleb, Saul, and Jepthah. The Midrash asked: <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> slave woman had done as Eliezer had asked? Yet the Midrash taught that God prepared Rebekah for him and granted his request in a fitting manner. And Rav cited Eliezer's request in [...] along with the omen sought by Jonathan in [...] as forms of improper acts of divination.|$|E

2500|$|Catharine Bond Hill, {{president}} of Vassar College argued that, [...] "many {{of us in}} higher education dislike popular college rankings such as the annual academic beauty pageant from US News & World Report. But expecting them to go away is naive, and attempting to undermine them is unwise since students and families could perceive that as petulant and paternalistic. Worse, it could seem as if {{we have something to}} hide." [...] Rather than not sending in the reputation survey, she argued, it would be of value to focus on, [...] "a third-party non-profit or foundation", sending them [...] "the same data that we already submit to US News and other rating organizations." [...] On this point, she argues, [...] "a one-size ranking does not fit all, because students and families care about different things [...] <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> school doesn't use the SAT in making admissions decisions and therefore doesn't collect or report these data? In a new system, that school couldn't be ranked if a student chose a positive weight for the SATs. Students would know that the school doesn't value that piece of information. They could then run the rankings with other information (maybe class rank and other indicators of academic achievement), excluding the SAT, and see what those rankings look like. Alternatively, they could decide they actually do care about the average SATs of the student body and decide to look at other schools. Fair enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bianca's {{most notable}} initial storyline upon her return was a {{paedophilia}} plot revolving around Bianca's partner Tony King (Chris Coghill), and her 15 year old step daughter, Whitney. According to the Daily Mail, the storyline {{has been dubbed}} as the [...] "most controversial story-line on the show ever". The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer Simon Ashdown and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to EastEnders. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by {{an image of a}} woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering [...] "What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family". They pitched the idea to John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, who said that [...] "It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk. Diederick Santer commented, [...] "We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show." [...] It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although EastEnders had broached it in 2001 with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her abusive uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.|$|E
