30|$|Fard et al. [33] {{propose a}} multi-objective {{scheduling}} solution and present {{a case study}} comprising makespan, cost, energy, and reliability.

Energy consumption <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> only after the compute phases of the workflow. The authors state that their focus is on computational-intensive applications, thus only the computation part of the activities are considered in the energy consumption calculation, while “data transfers and storage time are ignored”. Finally, reliability <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> using an exponential distribution representing the probability of successful completion of a task.|$|R

5|$|Designed by {{visual effects}} artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was {{inspired}} by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head <b>was</b> <b>modeled</b> after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His skin was given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction.|$|E
