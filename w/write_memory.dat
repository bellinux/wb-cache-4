50|$|In early {{computer}} systems, programs typically specified {{the location}} to <b>write</b> <b>memory</b> and what data to put there. This location was a physical {{location on the}} actual memory hardware. The slow processing of such computers did not allow for the complex memory management systems used today. Also, as most such systems were single-task, sophisticated systems were not required as much.|$|E

5000|$|There {{may also}} be a memory address {{register}} and a memory data register, used to access the main computer storage. Together, these elements form an [...] "execution unit". Most modern CPUs have several execution units. Even simple computers usually have one unit to read and <b>write</b> <b>memory,</b> and another to execute user code. These elements could often be brought together as a single chip. This chip comes in a fixed width that would form a [...] "slice" [...] through the execution unit. These are known as [...] "bit slice" [...] chips. The AMD Am2900 family {{is one of the best}} known examples of bit slice elements. The parts of the execution units and the execution units themselves are interconnected by a bundle of wires called a bus.|$|E
50|$|Even in {{very simple}} systems, {{at various times}} the data bus {{is driven by the}} program memory, by RAM, and by I/O devices.To prevent bus {{contention}} on the data bus, at any one instant only one device drives the data bus.In very simple systems, only the data bus is required to be a bidirectional bus.In very simple systems, the memory address register always drives the address bus, the control unit always drives the control bus,and an address decoder selects which particular device is allowed to drive the data bus during this bus cycle.In very simple systems, every instruction cycle starts with a READ memory cycle where program memory drives the instruction onto the data bus while the instruction register latches that instruction from the data bus.Some instructions continue with a <b>WRITE</b> <b>memory</b> cycle where the memory data register drives data onto the data bus into the chosen RAM or I/O device.Other instructions continue with another READ memory cycle where the chosen RAM, program memory, or I/O device drives data onto the data bus while the memory data register latches that data from the data bus.|$|E
50|$|These three {{commercial}} architectures exhibit explicit fence instructions {{as their}} safety nets. The Alpha model provides {{two types of}} fence instructions, Memory barrier(MB) and <b>Write</b> <b>memory</b> barrier(WMB). The MB operation {{can be used to}} maintain program order of any memory operation before the MB with a memory operation after the barrier. Similarly, the WMB maintains program order only among writes. The SPARC V9 RMO model provides a MEMBAR instruction which can be customised to order previous reads and writes with respect to future read and write operations. There is no need for using read-modify-writes to achieve this order because the MEMBAR instruction can be used to order a write with respect to a succeeding read. The PowerPC model uses a single fence instruction called the SYNC instruction. It is similar to the MB instruction, but with a little exception that reads can occur out of program order even if a SYNC is placed between two reads to the same location. This model also differs from Alpha and RMO in terms of Atomicity. It allows write to be seen earlier than a read’s completion. A combination of read modify write operations may be required to make an illusion of write atomicity.|$|E

More precisely if we allow kn time for some fixed constant k, then there is an epsilon > 0 so that the problem cannot be solved with epsilon n log n bits of read and <b>write</b> <b>memory</b> if n is sufficiently large.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} jobs within a data parallel environment is controlling the simultaneous data access.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the vulnerability of}} spacecraft (S/C) equipment to space debris and meteoroid impacts, hypervelocity impact (HVI) tests have been performed on electronic equipment. The electronics were placed inside aluminium casing located behind representative spacecraft structure walls and operated at simulated conditions (i. e. counting and read / <b>write</b> <b>memory</b> access). The impact tests were performed {{as part of an}} ongoing European Space Agency contract. Twenty six hypervelocity impact tests at 0 ° and 45 ° incidence have been performed on the electronics boxes with impact velocities ranging from 3. 3 km/s to 7. 7 km/s. Projectiles have been 99. 9 % pure aluminium spheres with diameters ranging from 1. 5 mm to 5. 5 mm. Several failure modes have been investigated. The impact experiments showed that in order to produce permanent errors or destruction of the electronics inside the aluminium casing, impact conditions have to be such that the electronics casing was perforated wit h a minimum extension of 1. 4 mm, leading to the ejection of projectile and casing material inside the electronics box and subsequently inducing damage on the PCB. The electronics system consists of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and random access memory on a printed circuit board. The FPGA is programmed to perform simple operations: counting and read / <b>write</b> <b>memory</b> access. The electronics boxes are tested in six configurations: three configurations behind an aluminium honeycomb (H/C) sandwich panel (SP), and three configurations behind multi-layer insulation (MLI). The different set-ups vary in spacing between the electronics boxes and the H/C SP or MLI respectively. All tests are performed while the electronics are in operation, i. e. the FPGA is operating. During HVI, signals have been monitored to determine the type and severity of the perturbation induced on the equipment's operation...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{effective}} deformable part model for face detection in the wild. Compared with previous systems on face detection, there are mainly three contributions. The first is an efficient method for calculating histogram of ori-ented gradients by pre-calculated lookup tables, which only has read and <b>write</b> <b>memory</b> operations and the feature pyra-mid {{can be calculated}} in real-time. The second is a Sparse Constrained Latent Bilinear Model to simultaneously learn the discriminative deformable part model, and reduce the feature dimension by sparse transformations for efficient in-ference. The third contribution is a deformable part based cascade, where every stage is a deformable part in the dis-criminatively learned model. By integrating the three tech-niques, we demonstrate noticeable improvements over pre-vious state-of-the-art on FDDB with real-time speed, un-der widely comparisons with both academic and commer-cial detectors. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe memory {{subsystem}} of modern multi-core archi-tectures {{is becoming more}} and more complex with the increasing number of cores integrated in a single computer system. This complexity leads to profiling needs to let software developers understand how programs use the {{memory subsystem}}. Modern processors come with hardware profiling features to help building tools for these profiling needs. Regarding memory profiling, many processors provide means to monitor memory traffic and to sample read and <b>write</b> <b>memory</b> accesses. Unfortunately, these hardware profiling mechanisms are often very complex to use and are specific to each micro-architecture.
