5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E
5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive regimes are forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E
5000|$|The question, what is being, {{is seeking}} {{an answer to}} {{something}} [...] "that is." [...] A contemporary example in rhetoric would be {{to look at a}} color. Using white as an example, when we define a color, we define it by association. Snow <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> Paper <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> A cow <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> But what <b>is</b> <b>white?</b> While we <b>are</b> saying things that <b>are</b> <b>white,</b> we <b>are</b> not defining what <b>white</b> <b>is</b> without qualification. Ousia is thus {{the answer to the question}} of [...] "what is being" [...] when the question is without qualification. The unqualified answer of what <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>is</b> the ousia of white.|$|R

5|$|By 77 BC, {{the rivalry}} between the Red and the Whites was already developed, when a funeral for a Red driver {{involved}} a Red supporter throwing {{himself on the}} funeral pyre. No writer of the time, however, refers to these as factions such as came into existence later, with the factions being official organizations. Writing {{near the beginning of}} the third century, he wrote that the Reds were dedicated to Mars, the Whites to the Zephyrs, the Greens to Mother Earth or spring, and the Blues to the sky and sea or autumn. Domitian created two new factions, the Purples and Golds, which disappeared soon after he died. The Blues and the Greens gradually became the most prestigious factions, supported by emperor and populace alike. Numerous occasions occurred when a Blue vs. Green clash would break out during a race. Indeed, Reds and <b>Whites</b> <b>are</b> only rarely mentioned in the surviving literature, although their continued activity is documented in inscriptions and in curse-tablets.|$|E

In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the white}} grapes, Chardonnay {{is the most}} common. Another grape found in the region, Aligoté, tends to produce cheaper wines which are higher in acidity. Aligoté from Burgundy is the wine {{traditionally}} used for the Kir drink, where it is mixed with black currant liqueur. Sauvignon blanc is also grown in the Saint Bris appellation. Chablis, Mâcon wines and the Côte d'Or <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> mostly produced from 100% Chardonnay grapes.|$|E
25|$|The colors used by Metzinger, accentuated by a {{contrasting}} {{range of}} blacks and <b>whites,</b> <b>are</b> bright and largely unmixed. The move away from more subtle tonalities of his earlier Cubist work; Portrait of an American Smoker, Portrait of Albert Gleizes (both from 1911–12) closely relates Le Fumeur {{with a series of}} portraits painted by Metzinger circa 1913; Woman with a Fan, Portrait of Max Jacob, and La Fumeuse. As in these latter works, the decorative patterning assumes a principal role in the composition.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010s, ethnic {{entrepreneurship}} {{has been}} studied {{in the case of}} Cuban business owners in Miami, Indian motel owners of the U.S. and Chinese business owners in Chinatowns across the United States. While entrepreneurship offers these groups many opportunities for economic advancement, self-employment, and business ownership in the United States remain unevenly distributed along racial/ethnic lines. Despite numerous success stories of Asian entrepreneurs, a recent statistical analysis of U.S. census data shows that <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> more likely than Asians, African-Americans, and Latinos to be self-employed in high prestige, lucrative industries.|$|E
25|$|Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic tendencies, head to South Carolina {{to observe}} the {{implementation}} of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many <b>Whites</b> <b>are</b> denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken.|$|E
25|$|Wine expert Karen MacNeil {{notes that}} most well made {{examples}} of Provençal wine have flavors and aromas {{that reflect the}} garrigue landscape of the region which includes wild lavender, rosemary and thyme. The rosés of the region are normally dry with zestiness derived from their acidity. The red and <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> characterized by their full bodies and intense aromatics. The nature and impression of the wines change significantly depending on whether they are consumed as an apéritif or paired with food, particularly the traditional flavors of Provençal cuisine. The rosé wine in particular is noted {{for its ability to}} pair well with garlic based dishes, such as aioli.|$|E

25|$|Van der Weyden {{worked from}} life models, and his {{observations}} were acute, yet he often idealised certain elements of his models' facial features, {{and they are}} typically statuesque, especially in his triptychs. All of his forms are rendered with rich, warm colourisation and a sympathetic expression, while he {{is known for his}} expressive pathos and naturalism. His portraits tend to be half length and half profile, and he is as sympathetic here as in his religious triptychs. Van der Weyden used an unusually broad range of colours and varied tones; in his finest work the same tone is not repeated in any other area of the canvas; even the <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> varied.|$|E
25|$|The {{viticulture}} and winemaking {{practices of}} the Côte Chalonnaise {{are very similar to}} those of the Côte d'Or. However, yields are generally higher here with up to 10.5 gallons per 120 square yards (40 litres per 100 square metres) permitted. The exception is the region of Mercurey which maintains its yield restrictions to the same levels as the Côte d'Or. Grapes are normally harvested from late September to early October. Both red and <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> fermented in oak barrels with premium producers more likely to use new oak. The wines are usually aged for 6 to 10 months, being bottled in the late summer before the next vintage harvest. Depending on the quality of the vintage and winemaking practices, some Côte Chalonnaise can be prone to oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{a region}} where <b>whites</b> <b>are</b> a minority, until 1960 West Indies were always captained by white cricketers, though this was more social than racial discrimination. Throughout the 1950s, social theorist CLR James, the {{increasingly}} political former cricketer Learie Constantine and others called for a black captain. Constantine himself had stood in for Jackie Grant in the field against England on the 1937–38 tour, and George Headley captained the West Indies in the First Test against England in 1947–48 when the appointed, white captain, John Goddard was injured. However, no black was appointed as captain for a whole series until Frank Worrell was chosen to lead West Indies in their tour of Australia in 1960–61. In his three years as captain, Worrell moulded a bunch of talented but raw cricketers into probably {{the best team in}} the world.|$|E
