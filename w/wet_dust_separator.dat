The use of high- effective dust capturing devices, reducing leakage degree of dust particles thrown out from aspiration cutting dust schemes {{is one of the most}} promising and effective ways to decrease dust emissions at the cement producing enterprises. The article shows some summary results of the field power determination for dust emission, dust of sand and expanded clay, leak out of equipment, workplaces and aspiration schemes of expanded clay and cement manufacturing enterprises. The results of the analysis of dust particles with various dimensions and the experimental determination of the degree of dust separating apparatuses’ leaking out was used for design and development of the new <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> cleaner -separator. The experiments were carried out to get the leakage's degree of dust particles thrown out from this new wet cleaner’ modification at the industrial plants. The statistical treatment of the experimental results allowed us to get dependence of the leakage of dust's particles in these <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> cleaners - <b>separators</b> within the studied aerodynamic range of work regime. The results showed that the proposed <b>wet</b> scrubbing <b>dust</b> cleaners provide a significant reduction of dust emissions (expanded clay and sand) into the atmosphere from expanded clay and cement manufacturing enterprises. It is recommended to use the results of the development of <b>dust</b> <b>wet</b> cleaning devices in decreasing of dust aspiration schemes in the building construction industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to improve the}} productivity and lower the expense of existing vacuum blasting technology. This technology is used to remove radioactive contamination, PCBs, and lead-based paint and provides worker protection by continuously recycling the material and dust for the decontamination tasks. The proposed work would increase the cleaning rate and provide safe and cost-effective decontamination of the DOE sites. This work focuses on redesigning and improving existing vacuum blasting technology including blast head nozzles, ergonomic handling of the blast head by reducing its weight; brush-ring design, vacuum level regulator, efficiency of the <b>dust</b> <b>separator,</b> and operational control sensors. The redesign is expected to enhance the productivity and economy of the vacuum blasting system by at least 50 % over current vacuum blasting systems. There are three phases in the project. Phase I consists of developing and testing mathematical models. Phase II consists of pre-prototype design and fabrication and pre-prototype unit testing. Phase III consists of prototype design and field verification testing. In phase I, mathematical models are developed and analyzed for the nozzle, blast head, wind curtain, and <b>dust</b> <b>separator,</b> first as individual devices and then combined as an integrated model. This allows study of respective airflow and design parameters. The Contractor shall, {{based on the results of}} the mathematical modeling studies, design experimental models of the components and test these models. In addition, the Contractor shall develop sensors to detect the relationship of the blast head to the blast surfaces and controls to minimize the dependency on an operator's skill and judgment to obtain optimum positioning, as well as real-time characterization sensors to determine as the blast head is moving the depth to which coatings must be removed, thereby improving production and minimizing waste. In phase II, the Contractor shall design and construct a pre-prototype of the nozzle, blast head with wind curtain, sensors, and <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> and test this system to assess the performance of the new design under controlled conditions at the contractor's facility. In phase III, the Contractor shall design and construct a prototype of the High Productivity Vacuum Blasting System, based on the results of the pre-prototype design and testing performed.

A Venturi water film dust precipitator is a wet precipitator in which the removal of particles by droplets is accomplished mainly through inertial collision, interception and cohesion between particles and droplets. Thus, the particle removal efficiency of this precipitator is a relatively low 95  %– 97  %, as shown in Fig.  4.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{designed}} to explore the hypothesis that settled dust in a domestic environment can contain significant levels of allergens and that common cleaning methods employed to remove dust can result in sufficient airborne exposure to potentially trigger an allergic reaction. Qualitative feedback from respondents in studies of furniture dusting habits indicated that household furniture dusting could elicit an allergic response. A consumer questionnaire was fielded to confirm the problem and it's magnitude. This indicated that it affected approximately 20 % of allergy sufferers (or approximately 5 % of the total UK population). Further work was performed to estimate the level of allergen exposure during dusting. Additional consumer research was fielded to ascertain the surface area being dusted, (approximately 54000 cm 2 for frequently dusted areas and 10000 cm 2 for frequently dusted areas). Domestic dusting habits were probed for the relative frequency of dusting method, which split evenly between dry <b>dusting,</b> <b>wet</b> <b>dusting</b> with water and <b>wet</b> <b>dusting</b> with a furniture polish. Surface sampling techniques were adapted to make in-home measurements of the rate of dust settling which {{was found to be}} approximately 3. 19 x 10 - 7 g. cm- 2,day- 1. In-home sampling was also undertaken to measure the mean allergen content of surface dust for major allergens, yielding 24667 ng. g- 1 combined dust mite, 47696 ng. g- 1 Fel d 1 and approximately 126 8 08 ng. g- 1 Can f 1. Laboratory-based studies determined the relative amount of dust rendered airborne during dusting of different furniture surface types and comparing different cleaning methods. This was found to be between 2. 3 - 43. 0 %. From these experiments, a model "average" home was constructed and used to estimate the exposure towards dust allergens during a typical dusting task. Exposure was estimated to be as much as 16500 ng total dust mite, 124000 mug (31000 mU) cat allergen and 275000 ng (IU) dog allergen per dusting method.

The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on dust and noise exposure. Dust exposure was found to be minimal, but noise exposure was potentially significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended because the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may cause the results to be inapplicable to indoor settings.

40|$|Worker {{exposure}} to coal dust in underground mines remains a major health hazard. This research has: 1) Analyzed the wetting characteristics {{of less than}} 10 micron dust particles using a novel micro-emulsion technology (MET) at bench scale and prototype scale with emphasis on agglomeration of dust particles, and 2) Simulate airflow and dust dispersion patterns on a longwall mining face using CFD modeling techniques to compare the current and proposed spatial distributions of water sprays around a longwall shearer. With the “Final Dust Rule” adopted by MSHA in 2014 and slated to go into full effect August 16, 2016, this research is {{a significant contribution to}} the coal industry. A suitable micro-emulsion containing 0. 2 % oil and 0. 0125 % didodecyl-dimethyl-ammonium bromide (DDAB) was identified. For assessing the wettability of coal dusts, a slightly modified version of “Fixed Time Wettability” or FTW (Chugh et al., 2004) was employed. These wettability tests however, did not yeild true wettability using the MET. An analysis for both unwetted and wetted portions of coal dust using particle size distribution curves (PSD) confirmed agglomeration when treated with the emulsion. For the unwetted portion, 96. 6 % of the particles had sizes greater than 25 μm after treatment with MET. Similar data for <b>wetted</b> <b>dust</b> was 100 %. Experiemental studies in a 4 ft x 4 ft x 10 ft chamber showed 12 - 15 % improvement in respirable dust when using MET as compared to water alone [...] Validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were used to study airflow patterns and the interaction between sprays and airflow for designing both engineering and administrative controls around a longwall face. Two important zones – low air velocity (LAV) and recirculation (RC) – were identified around the model of a longwall face. These zones were located: 1) Behind the headgate drum and 2) Above the shearer chassis. Analysis of a modified geometric configuration of sprays on the shearer chassis showed improved coverage for <b>wetting</b> the <b>dust</b> on the longwall face. Numerical modeling comparisons were made between current spray systems and spray systems proposed by Dr. Y. P. Chugh using the concepts of “Continuous and Discrete Phase Modeling”. Analyses included changes in airflow patterns caused by spray systems and dust dispersion tracks generated from the cutting face. Chugh’s spray system was able to effectively eliminate RC zones existing above the shearer body, thereby minimizing the extent to which coal dust enters the walkway of the longwall face where workers are located. The proposed spray system used concepts of multiple <b>wetting</b> points for <b>dust,</b> air-locks, and venturi to <b>wet</b> the <b>dust</b> and direct the dust-laden air from mine workers.

40|$|We report {{here the}} {{elemental}} composition of sinking particles in sediment traps {{and in the}} water column following four artificial dust seeding experiments (each representing a flux of 10 g m − 2). Dry or <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> deposition were simulated during two large mesocosms field campaigns {{that took place in the}} coastal water of Corsica (NW Mediterranean Sea) representative of oligotrophic conditions. The dust additions were carried out with fresh or artificially aged dust (i. e., enriched in nitrate and sulfate by mimicking cloud processing) for various biogeochemical conditions, enabling us to test the effect of these parameters on the chemical composition and settling of dust after deposition. The rates and mechanisms of total mass, particulate organic carbon (POC) and chemical elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, N, Nd, P, S, Sr and Ti) transfer from the mesocosm surface to the sediment traps installed at the base of the mesocosms after dust deposition show that (1) 15 % of the initial dust mass was dissolved {{in the water column}} in the first 24 h after seeding. Except for Ca, S and N, the elemental composition of dust particles was constant during their settling, showing the relevance of using interelemental ratios, such as Ti/Al as proxy of lithogenic fluxes. (2) Whatever the type of seeding (using fresh dust to simulate dry deposition or artificially aged <b>dust</b> to simulate <b>wet</b> deposition), the particulate phase both in the water column and in the sediment traps was dominated by dust particles. (3) Due to the high Ba content in dust, Ba/Al cannot be used as productivity proxy in the case of high dust input in the sediment traps. Instead, our data suggests that the ratio Co/Al could be a good productivity proxy in this case. (4) After 7 days, between 30 and 68 % of added dust was still in suspension in the mesocosms. This difference in the dust settling was directly associated with a difference in POC export, since POC fluxes were highly correlated to dust lithogenic fluxes signifying a ballast effect of dust. The highest fraction of remaining dust in suspension in the mesocosm at the end of the experiment was found inversely correlated to Chl a increase. This suggests that the fertilizing effect of dust on autotrophs organisms, the ballast effect, and POC fluxes are strongly correlated.

In this approach, the CAD model for the original geometry of the <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> was generated and the turbulent flow field was solved using time-independent solver and Reynolds stress turbulence model. The solution approach demonstrates consistency with the a vailable experimental data proving the accuracy of the solution method.

The main contributors of the pressure loss production in the flow field are identified and the most effective geometry parameters are recognized in order to perform the parametric analysis. The modifications are implemented on the original geometry and flow simulation is performed for each new configuration with the same solution method as used for the original model. The flow field changes are evaluated by comparing the contours of flow variables and the generated pressure loss for each case are compared with original configuration.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{considered}} an hazelnut harvest technique by hazelnuts aspiration from the soil, and a comparison with {{the characteristics of the}} crop and of the soil, with which the considered machines have to interact, has been performed. This technique has broadly spread in Campania Region and for it, it is not required a meadow around the trees. After having performed some tests for the considered harvest technique, the characteristic parameters of working capacity, working quality and energy costs have been evaluated. Further, it has been faced the problems due to the soil dusts. to identify a filtering system capable of reducing the great amounts of dusts introduced in the environment during the process of hazelnuts picking up by means turbo-aspirating machines. The main types of dust removers for medium-thin dusts have been studied and examined; a comparative exam proved the mechanical removal by cyclone (centrifugal <b>dust</b> <b>separator)</b> to be the most effective. Therefore, two prototype filters were examined, each consisting of four cyclones with a turning diameter of mm 350 and mm 250 respectively. Field tests showed the effectiveness of the system; the 350 mm multi-cyclone proved to have a dust removing capacity of 90 %, with no reduction in performance caused by the dust that goes through it, while the 250 mm removes 93. 75 %, with a reduction in performance of approximatevely 30 %. However, {{it would be a mistake}} to give preference to the former over the latter, as its better performance does not compensate, in terms of environment hygiene, the 3. 75 % difference which, though seemingly slight, represents a further reduction of 50 % of the thinner dust contained in the atmospher...|$|R
40|$|The term “technogenic particles” {{is used to}} {{describe}} airborne particulate matter (PM) produced during industrial processes. The most common of these is “fly ash” produced during combustion of solid and liquid fossil fuels. Coal fly ash {{is derived from the}} mineral and metal contaminants within coal in which particles (1) are distinctly spherical in shape, (2) are composed of 60 – 90 % glass, and (3) often contain a range of contaminant metals. In addition, particles may contain recrystallized minerals, mainly quartz, mullite, and hematite; both quartz and mullite are recognized respiratory hazards. Fly ash particles from both UK and Chinese coal-burning power stations were characterized by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (morphology and size), x-ray diffraction (crystallinity and minerals), and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (elemental composition). PM 10 samples were separated from bulk fly ash by a dry <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> system. The plasmid scission assay (PSA) was used to measure damage produced by fly ash to plasmid bacteriophage ΦX 174 RF DNA. The supercoiled DNA was either damaged or severely damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the fly ash at different concentrations. Geochemical analyses confirmed that the fly ash particles are predominantly glass, with a minor component of the minerals quartz, hematite, and mullite. Fly ash particles also contained a range of metals contaminants; however, these were mostly bound into the glass with only a small proportion potentially bioaccessible. PSA data showed that fly ash exhibited significant oxidative capacity when compared to negative control (MB H 2 O), indicating that ROS are likely to be the driving force underlying fly ash bioreactivity...|$|R
40|$|Quartz {{is a human}} {{carcinogen}} and a causative agent of silicosis. Exposure levels often exceed exposure limits in the construction industry. The need for effective control measures is high, but the complex structure of the construction industry, the variability in sources of exposure and the frequent changes of worksite {{makes it difficult to}} implement even simple and potentially effective control measures. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of control measures for reducing quartz dust exposure and to assess the extent of their use. Full-shift respirable dust measurements (n = 61) and short-term measurements among construction workers were performed and results of a questionnaire study among 1335 construction workers were analysed. Full-shift measurements showed respirable quartz exposure levels up to 63 times the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) value (0. 075 mg/m 3). More than half of the measure-ments were above the MAC value. Control measures were not very strongly associated with the full-shift exposure estimates, but the short-term measurements showed large reduction factors (> 70 %) when <b>wet</b> <b>dust</b> suppression or local exhaust ventilation was used. The effectiveness of control measures is potentially high, and a significant part of the construction worker popu-lation is indeed using them on a regular basis. Still, both the exposure study and questionnair...|$|R
