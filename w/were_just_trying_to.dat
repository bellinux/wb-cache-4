500|$|Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, {{was signed}} up {{by a major}} British {{recording}} company, and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some monaural records in the 1940s and 1950s, followed, with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw, by numerous stereophonic versions of his works. Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason {{that it did not}} seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make music." ...|$|E
500|$|La Dispute {{recorded}} {{the remainder of}} the album in a month in StadiumRed in New York City in April 2011. Dreyer wanted to give the album the most organic feel possible by using no artificial reverb or studio techniques that would give the album a synthesized quality. Joe Pedulla stated that he wanted to give the album a more raw and authentic sound: [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> capture {{what it would be like}} for an audience member sitting and listening to a guitar in a room." [...] He also credited Dreyer's vocal range: [...] "Jordan Dreyer has this crazy dynamic range – a 20dB swing from how loud and quiet he gets. So there are some vocal parts with no resonance at all, where he's speaking/singing softly, the room is not echoing, and he sounds close and in-your-face. Then the dynamic swing happens, and we would see how big it can get." [...] When recording vocals, Dreyer makes very long takes, trying to emulate the sound of his voice in live performances. The album's recording features what the band considers [...] "auxiliary instrumentation", including trumpet and rhodes piano, and even improvised instruments that Sterenburg's brother created out of scrap metal.|$|E
500|$|Pacers coach Rick Carlisle {{said after}} the game, [...] "I felt like I was {{fighting}} for my life out there." [...] One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player [...] "went through me like I was butter", and then NBA Commissioner David Stern, watching the game on TV, recalled that he said, [...] "Holy [...]" [...] (O'Neal later said, [...] "As bad as it looked on TV, {{it was at least}} 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach Chuck Person compared the situation to being [...] "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." [...] Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. Derrick Coleman stood near Brown and Brown's ball boy son to protect them. The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win. Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a folding chair that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave. Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.|$|E

Sex, drugs and {{violence}} just didn't factor into that equation." [...] On the other hand, David Nusair gave the film a negative review with a score of 1.5/4 saying, [...] "...it's difficult to imagine even the most die-hard fan of musicals finding anything here worth embracing." [...] Scott Weinberg also gave the film a negative review saying, [...] "A schmaltzy little piece of obvious fluff that's directed in truly horrendous fashion and populated by cardboard characters who spit out simplistic platitudes and breathy pop tunes." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: [...] "I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> figure out how blue rhymes with you. When I was writing them, they didn't {{have anything to do with}} who I was." [...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they [...] "had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17". They later bought a drum machine [...] "so it would feel like we were more in a band".|$|E
2500|$|Culshaw {{produced}} {{a series of}} Decca recordings of Britten's music with the composer as conductor or pianist. The Times described them as [...] "a priceless heritage for posterity." [...] Culshaw persuaded Decca {{to make the first}} complete recording of Peter Grimes, arguing that unless they did so they should abandon their exclusive agreement with the composer and so [...] "give him a chance to try his luck with other companies". Decca, unwilling to lose out to competition, gave the go-ahead. Culshaw, who was then responsible for recordings in Vienna, was unavailable to produce that pioneering recording, which was also the first modern opera to be recorded in stereo: instead, he [...] "planned it down to the last detail", and passed his detailed instructions to Erik Smith, who produced the recording. Among the works Culshaw himself recorded with Britten were the operas Albert Herring (1964), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1967), and Billy Budd (1968). Culshaw wrote, [...] "The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason that it did not seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hüsker Dü {{started as}} a {{hardcore}} punk band known for its speed and intensity. While the band included some slower material earlier in its career, Hüsker Dü developed a fast repertoire {{as a result of}} having less time to play while billed as an opening act, and to antagonize its audience when it headlined shows. [...] "here was a point where we were, like, 'Let's see how fast we can play,'" [...] Norton recalled. [...] "I guess we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> blow people away." [...] Hüsker Dü was particularly influenced by punk bands like D.O.A., Dead Kennedys, and The Fartz after having seen them play. NME journalist Andy Gill contended that Hüsker Dü's characteristic sound crystalized on the Metal Circus EP, incorporating [...] "thunderbuck, hiccup" [...] drums, a melodic yet solid bass, and [...] "carillions [...] of distorted guitar, with shouted vocals rasping hoarsely from deep in the mix." [...] He argued that what set them apart from other punk bands was [...] "the way they mix those same structural devices in ways that shouldn't work, combining elements of several genres in one song." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 29, 2016, DJ Khaled {{released}} his ninth studio album, Major Key. Cole is {{featured on the}} track [...] "Jermaine's Interlude". [...] "Said all I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement" [...] is a direct quote from the track that caused some of Cole's fans to worry about him and his music career. In an interview with Genius, Doctur Dot of the Atlanta duo EarthGang explained that the song was originally a nine-minute posse cut, he said, “We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get Bas to fuck with the song, but Cole was like, ‘I can’t resist this beat,’ so he hit the weed {{for the first time}} in a long time." [...] “He overthinks on weed but we were in the garage smoking a blunt, the beat was running in the background. We stacked the hook up, we all had verses on it, it was a posse record and was like, nine verses long.” On November 4, 2016, Cole performed at Jay Z and Beyoncé's Hillary Clinton Rally in Cleveland, Ohio, along with Big Sean and Chance the Rapper. On November 8, 2016, Spillage Village released the official version of [...] "Jermaine's Interlude", called [...] "Can't Call It". The song features Cole, EarthGang, Bas and J.I.D.|$|E
2500|$|Illustrator Benjamin Roman {{made his}} {{professional}} debut {{with the first}} volume of I Luv Halloween; he wanted to create [...] "something that was offbeat and a little gory, but with a kind of humor and playfulness." [...] Having spent years {{trying to get into the}} comic book industry, he moved to Los Angeles, California, in 2003, and worked at Kinko's in Hollywood; there, he met a Tokyopop employee, who passed along some of his [...] "rejected proposals" [...] to now-former editor Mark Paniccia. Keith Giffen, an American comic book illustrator and writer who had previously adapted the Tokyopop-licensed manga Battle Royale and Battle Vixens for an English-language audience, joined the project as the writer. Together, they spent three to four years working on the series. Although Roman did not draw the series with any particular influences in mind, he read Calvin and Hobbes and Marvel books as a child. Drawing inspiration from science-fiction and horror films in general, Roman acknowledged that [...] "some of that same kitsch finds itself in I Luv Halloween." [...] For the plot, Roman and Giffen were given [...] "a lot of leeway creatively," [...] and Roman commented: [...] "I think that we were seeing how irresponsible we could go with that story and still get away with it. We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> let loose with the characters, however violent that mentality my have turned at some points." [...] As a way to celebrate the conclusion of the series, Roman gave away more than one hundred pages of I Luv Halloween artwork and five hundred replicas of Finch's mask at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con International.|$|E
