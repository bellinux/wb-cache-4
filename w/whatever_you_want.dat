That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E

[...] Bono, who {{compared}} many of his lyrics prior to The Joshua Tree to [...] "sketches", said that [...] "'Where the Streets Have No Name' is more like the U2 of old {{than any of the}} other songs on the LP, because it's a sketch—I was just trying to sketch a location, maybe a spiritual location, maybe a romantic location.

500|$|Germany's Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, had {{apparently}} known {{nothing about the}} proposal. He cabled Brigadeführer Edmund Veesenmayer of the SS on 20 July 1944 to ask about it, and was told on 22 July that Brand and Grosz {{had been sent to}} Turkey on the orders of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. Eichmann himself said during interrogation after the war that the order had come from Himmler, as did SS officer Kurt Becher: [...] "Himmler said to me: 'Take whatever you can from the Jews. Promise them <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> What we will keep is another matter.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As governor, Huntsman listed {{economic}} development, health-care reform, education, {{and energy}} security as his top priorities. He oversaw {{tax cuts and}} advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so {{that the government would}} not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. He also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down. In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, [...] "I'm comfortable with a requirement – you can call it <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> but at some point we're {{going to have to get}} serious about how we deal with this issue".|$|E

500|$|The visual {{design of}} the live-action footage was {{intended}} to look like [...] "a living, walk-through painting", a visual concept Bakshi had long wanted to achieve. The film's sets were based upon enlargements of designer Barry Jackson's paintings. The animation was strongly influenced by Fleischer Studios (whose cartoons were released by Paramount) and Terrytoons (where Bakshi once worked, and whose Mighty Mouse character was also adapted into a series by Bakshi). The artwork by the character Jack Deebs was drawn by underground comix artist Spain Rodriguez. The film's animators were never given a screenplay, and were instead told by Bakshi to [...] "Do a scene that's funny, <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do!" ...|$|E

500|$|Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson {{spent the}} summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to {{complete}} the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to call it, that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he {{could do a lot}} of it on his own.

500|$|... "You Already Know What You Are" [...] {{is about}} {{negative}} people and music critics, and doing <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{no matter what}} others say. The song's title was a saying from {{a friend of the}} band. The title for [...] "Another Song About the Weekend" [...] is a reference to Secret Lives of the Freemasons's album Weekend Warriors (2008), while the lyrics are about [...] "a sick cycle" [...] of [...] "life on the road [...] Every time you're gone, you miss home and when you get home, you miss the road". [...] "If It Means a Lot to You" [...] had been written {{over the course of a}} year, and McKinnon said he wrote it about himself.

In the article, the magazine credits the album with [...] "single-handedly changed the face of mainstream rock." [...] Property of Zack also gave the album a fifteenth anniversary feature, commenting, [...] "Enema of the State has become the single most important album in our overarching community since its release in 1999.

When going around a bend a few tenths of a mile from his parents' house, Favre lost control of his car, which flipped three times and came to rest against a tree. It was only after one of his brothers smashed a car window with a golf club that Favre could be evacuated and rushed to the hospital. In the ambulance, his mother was sitting with him. [...] "All I kept asking [...] was 'Will I be able to play football again?'" [...] Favre recalled later. Doctors would later remove 30 inches (76cm) of Favre's small intestine. Six weeks after this incident, on September 8, Favre led Southern Miss to a comeback victory over Alabama.

500|$|... "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker. The scene where Mr. Mackey loses the marijuana cigarette in class was inspired by a real event from Parker's life, where a counselor came into his class in seventh grade, and passed around a lit piece of marijuana, which then disappeared. At {{the beginning and end of}} the episode, there are scenes where the kids imitate Mr. Mackey's voice to him, while he is oblivious to the fact that he is being made fun of. Parker and his classmates used to do the same thing to their counselor in junior high school, who was the basis for Mr. Mackey's character. Parker said that he was especially proud of Chef's line, [...] "There's a time and a place for everything, and it's called college", which is something Parker believes in, noting that if he had a child, he would tell him: [...] "Do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> just wait till college because you don't know what the fuck's up right now." [...] Chef's sentence would later return in the season four episode [...] "The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000".|$|E

It featured guest appearances from Victoria Principal as Dr. Amanda Rebecca, Danny Smith and Wally Wingert as various characters. This was the first episode directed by Povenmire.

Give me some visual gags. Do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> I trust you." [...] Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him have fun. Several years after the episode was written, in DVD commentary for the eighth and ninth season of the show, Gary Janetti, the writer of the episode, recalled that the original title of the episode {{was intended to be}} simply [...] "Brian & Stewie", but was changed by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, who wanted there to be a [...] "Road to" [...] episode each season. The name of the episode was then changed to [...] "Road to Rhode Island", with the original name later being used for the landmark 150th episode of the show, also entitled [...] "Brian & Stewie", and written by Janetti.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care.

She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it {{in my mind that}} you had to be skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|The Commander-in-Chief of the Brazilian forces, Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then Baron {{and later}} Marquis of Tamandaré), himself a Progressive, {{complained to the}} Brazilian Cabinet of the outcome {{engineered}} by Paranhos. By the time the peace treaty was concluded, the Uruguayan capital was under siege by Brazilian troops and under blockade by the Brazilian fleet. The admiral and the Cabinet were eager {{for an end to}} the conflict which would have resulted in a conquest of the enemy capital and a consequent boost in the popularity of the Brazilian government. Paranhos, however, had preempted such an outcome. As retaliation for the bloodless conclusion, he was fired from his post. Returning to Brazil, he defended himself in the Senate: [...] "Say [...] <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> about the diplomatic act of 20 February; you will not be able to take away from me this grateful conviction: that through that solution I saved the life of 2,000 fellow compatriots, [...] avoided the destruction of an important capital". Nonetheless, he received accolades in Uruguay, Brazil and even Argentina for his accomplishment in engineering both an end to the war and the formation of the alliance.|$|E
40|$|Education and {{training}} institutions {{around the world}} used {{to be driven by}} a belief that teaching simply involved imparting knowledge to learners. This was based on the notion that a learner’s brain is an 'empty vessel', into which knowledge can be poured, and that if you poured in the right information, in the right sequence, the learner would automatically learn <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> her to learn. Although most educators would now disagree with this notion, it is still the case that most educators/ trainers in higher education and workplace training are appointed {{on the basis of their}} subject knowledge and not their ability to teach in a learner-centred way. In recent years, the concept of constructivism has helped many educators to go beyond traditional rote learning techniques, and to engage their learners more fully in the learning process. In this unit, we take a bird's-eye look at the many ways in which you can support distance learners in their learning from a constructivist perspective. ...|$|R

I told Jan he couldn’t mess with the script like that. But Jan was a sweet guy. He never believed {{that he was an}} actor, though. He was embarrassed to be an actor. He always thought he was doing an awful job and that people were laughing at him. You had to keep telling him he was wonderful and he would do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> him to do.
