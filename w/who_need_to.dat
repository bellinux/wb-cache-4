5|$|Whitney High School {{runs along}} the Response to Intervention guideline; the RTI model {{implements}} a three-tiered research-based plan to catch students who are struggling in their schooling. The model implements a number of measures intended to assist students, including an intervention period, an AVID program, night and summer school programs, and Section 504 plans. Among the programs, the intervention periods are twenty minutes set before lunch that is intended for students <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> fulfill the academic requirements {{in which they are}} lacking. The AVID program pertains to students who are socially or economically disadvantaged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear {{a striking resemblance}} to wasps, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and M端llerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of M端llerian mimicry. In M端llerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known M端llerian complexes.|$|E

25|$|Other main {{controversy}} {{issues of}} Malaysian National Service include the selection system {{where the government}} computer database system picks up the trainees randomly without even knowing about their social status.

However, selected trainees with extraneous circumstances can send a letter of appeal to be exempted from the training, which will usually be approved.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive {{synchrony}} {{can never}} be perfect. On the other hand, theoretical models predict that group-living species will tend to synchronise wherever females can benefit by maximising the number of males offered chances of paternity, minimising reproductive skew. The same models predict that female primates, including evolving humans, will tend to synchronise wherever fitness benefits can be gained by securing access to multiple males. Conversely, group-living females <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> restrict paternity to a single dominant harem-holder should assist him by avoiding synchrony.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with sexual}} {{harassment}} policies {{in colleges and}} universities, brochures or informational handouts are often distributed, and there are often designated locations or personnel on campus where victims can report sexual harassment. Under Title IX, schools that receive federal funding must designate a coordinator to whom those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> report sexual harassment can go to, as well as who can receive suggestions and feedback from students {{on how to improve}} upon how the school is dealing with sexual harassment.
