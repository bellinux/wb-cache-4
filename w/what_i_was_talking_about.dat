500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love. I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> when I wrote it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California. They commenced constructing a large home on this site, {{and the subsequent}} re-modelling of the house occupied the next two years. Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand me ever since that day. That's when our marriage started breaking up. She never knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> what I was thinking about, and I couldn't possibly explain it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hussey {{joined the}} James Reyne Band {{and worked on}} Reyne's self-titled debut solo album (September 1987), co-writing six tracks with the artist. Four of these were issued as singles, [...] "Hammerhead" [...] (October), [...] "Heaven on a Stick" [...] (February 1988), [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] (June) and [...] "Always the Way" [...] (November). James later told Debbie Kruger that [...] " [...] was not {{necessarily}} about me, but let's say I thought I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> I wrote it with Simon Hussey; the music Simon and I wrote together and I wrote the lyrics. From memory it seemed to come quite easily". The album peaked at No.4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, while [...] "Hammerhead" [...] reached No.8 and [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] at No.4 on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart. [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] also reached No.6 on the ARIA Singles Chart.|$|E

[THOMAS is silent.] We know very well what we are--discontented dogs--never satisfied. What did the Chairman tell me up in London?

60|$|The event, even to me, {{was more}} inspiring in {{anticipation}} than in fulfillment, for when I rose {{to speak in}} the band-stand {{the wind was blowing}} hard, and other and less intellectual attractions were in full tide. My audience remained distressingly small--and calm. I have a dim recollection of howling into the face of the equatorical current certain disconnected sentences concerning my reform theory, and of seeing on the familiar faces of David Babcock, John Gammons and others of my bronzed and bent old neighbors a mild wonder as to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E

You {{ought to}} know that I am {{not the sort of}} man to make evil remarks about a lady behind her back, unless I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> I cannot at this moment prove it, but I am morally {{convinced}} that Miss Merton came here to-day at the instigation of the person who wrote to you, and that she only refrained from making you some offer because she knew quite well that we were within hearing." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{relative}} pronouns, 'who', 'which' and 'that' {{are mostly}} replaced with 'what' in Norfolk. e.g. 'That <b>was</b> the one <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about' or 'He was shaking Pimper Wiley...what lived {{a few doors}} from us'. Adjectival use of 'those' usually becomes 'them'. e.g. 'I was as bad as them what done it' ...|$|R

I told him that in theory a dry battery was just a curled darling and no mistake, but when it come to practice, sho!--and here's the result. Was I right? What should you say, Washington Hawkins? You've seen me try that button twice. Was I right?--that's the idea. Did I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> or didn't I?" ...|$|E

60|$|DAN. Many--and {{so many of}} {{them have}} no answer. Why am I a useless, {{drifting}} log upon the world's tide? Why have all the young men passed me? Why am I, at thirty-nine, let us say, with brain, with power, with strength--nobody thinks I am worth anything, but I am--I know it. I might have been an able editor, devoting every morning from ten till three to arranging the affairs of the Universe, or a popular politician, trying to understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> and to believe it. And what am I? A newspaper reporter, at three-ha'pence a line--I beg their pardon, its occasionally twopence.|$|E

He chuckled in a funny, dry way he had, and I called her. She knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> the hussy, and I saw her {{out of the corner of}} my eyes {{listening}} with all her ears, while she pretended to iron a blouse that she had been washing for me. She came. She was laughing, but I could see that she was a little shy, and Strickland looked at her without speaking." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{only person}} of the {{smallest}} importance in the place was the priest, and to him I addressed my first inquiries, leaving Monkton to await my return with the guide. I spoke Italian quite fluently, and correctly enough for my purpose, and was extremely polite and cautious in introducing my business, {{but in spite of}} all the pains I took, I only succeeded in frightening and bewildering the poor priest more and more with every fresh word I said to him. The idea of a dueling-party and a dead man seemed to scare him out of his senses. He bowed, fidgeted, cast his eyes up to heaven, and piteously shrugging his shoulders, told me, with rapid Italian circumlocution, that he had not the faintest idea of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> This was my first failure. I confess I was weak enough to feel a little dispirited when I rejoined Monkton and the guide.|$|E
6000|$|On his side, the Indian {{preserved}} {{the character of}} a perfect stranger. He produced the little casket, and made exactly the same application which he had afterwards made to me. As the speediest way of getting rid of him, Mr. Luker had at once declared that he had no money. The Indian had thereupon asked to be informed of the best and safest person to apply to for the loan he wanted. Mr. Luker had answered that the best and safest person, in such cases, was usually a respectable solicitor. Asked to name some individual of that character and profession, Mr. Luker had mentioned me--for the one simple reason that, in the extremity of his terror, mine was the first name which occurred to him. [...] "The perspiration was pouring off me like rain, sir," [...] the wretched creature concluded. [...] "I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> And I hope you'll look over it, Mr. Bruff, sir, in consideration of my having been really and truly frightened out of my wits." ...|$|E
5000|$|Just {{months into}} his term, Lujan came under {{criticism}} from conservationists {{and the media}} for his hands-off approach to policy and his gaffe-prone speeches.

6000|$|What {{particular}} form my explanations and apologies took when I tried {{to offer them}} is more than I can tell now. I was so confused and distressed that I hardly knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> at the time. The one circumstance which I remember clearly is that I was ashamed to refer to my interview with the strange man, and that I tried to account for my sudden withdrawal of my balance by referring it to some inexplicable panic, caused by mischievous reports which I was unable to trace to their source, and which, for anything I knew to the contrary, might, after all, have been only started in jest. Greatly to my surprise, the partner {{did not seem to}} notice the lamentable lameness of my excuses, and did not additionally confuse me by asking any questions. A weary, absent look, which I had observed on his face when I came in, remained on it while I was speaking. It seemed to be an effort to him even to keep up the appearance of listening to me; and when, at last, I fairly broke {{down in the middle of}} a sentence, and gave up the hope of getting any further, all the answer he gave me was comprised in these few civil commonplace words: ...|$|E
6000|$|It did {{not affect}} her at all; it did not budge her the {{fraction}} of an inch from her position.

Arguments to show that a person on a man's outside can know better what is on his inside than he does himself! I had cherished some contempt for arguments before, I have not enlarged my respect for them since. She refused to believe that I had invented my visions myself; she said it was folly: that I was only a child at the time and could not have done it. She cited the Richmond fire and the colonial mansion and said they were quite beyond my capacities. Then I saw my chance! I said she was right--I didn't invent those, I got them from Dr. Peake. Even this great shot did no damage. She said Dr. Peake's evidence was better than mine, and he had said in plain words that it was impossible for me to have heard about those things. Dear, dear, what a grotesque and unthinkable situation: a confessed swindler convicted of honesty and condemned to acquittal by circumstantial evidence furnished by the swindled! ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Permettez-moi expliquer. You see, I’m rather under a cloud,” said Matilda. “I’m {{staying with}} my aunt, and I was told I must behave {{particularly}} well to-day, as {{lots of people}} were coming for a garden party, and I was told to imitate Claude, that’s my young cousin, who never does anything wrong except by accident, and then is always apologetic about it. It seems they thought I ate too much raspberry trifle at lunch, and they said Claude never eats too much raspberry trifle. Well, Claude always goes to sleep {{for half an hour}} after lunch, because he’s told to, and I waited till he was asleep, and tied his hands and started forcible feeding with a whole bucketful of raspberry trifle that they were keeping for the garden-party. Lots of it went on to his sailor-suit and some of it on to the bed, but a good deal went down Claude’s throat, and they can’t say again that he has never been known to eat too much raspberry trifle. That is why I am not allowed to go to the party, and as an additional punishment I must speak French all the afternoon. I’ve had to tell you all this in English, as there were words like ‘forcible feeding’ that I didn’t know the French for; of course I could have invented them, but if I had said nourriture obligatoire you wouldn’t have had the least idea <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Mais maintenant, nous parlons français.” ...|$|E
