5|$|We had Belzer in {{the band}} for six months. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was purely musical, and I {{honestly}} believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person {{at that point in}} our lives... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E

Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E
2500|$|Sister Pascalina later {{recalled}} that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned [...] "deaf ear {{to all his}} proposals". She later wrote, [...] "Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, {{it occurs to me}} over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the Rhine with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well.' I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> but here, too, he was to be proved right." ...|$|E

5000|$|Keys {{said that}} the idea of the song was {{inspired}} by Aaliyah's death: [...] "The song idea came together right after Aaliyah passed away. It was such a sad time and no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> It just made everything crystal clear to me—what matters, and what doesn't." ...|$|R

"It's a lie! a lie without {{shadow of}} foundation, and I call upon {{you all to}} beware you give {{credence}} to the malicious inventions of this ramshackle slander-mill that has been doing its best to destroy my character for years, and will grind up your own reputations for you next. I got off to tighten my saddle-girthI wish I may die in my tracks if it isn't soand whoever <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> can, and whoever don't can let it alone." ...|$|R
2500|$|The first single, [...] "It's Alright, It's OK", Tisdale said, [...] "is a strong, {{empowering}} {{song that}} kind of helps you move on" [...] and continued to say: I have definitely [...] on and with someone you really like, if they are cheating on you, you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> But, unfortunately, you either stay in the relationship and keep getting hurt because it keeps happening or you get up and you move on. You don't look back. Tisdale said the song [...] "Hot Mess" [...] is [...] "about hanging out with a motorcycle bad boy that makes life more interesting" [...] and the song [...] "How Do You Love Someone" [...] written by Porcelain Black (Alaina Beaton) is [...] "about a girl who deals with the split of her parents". Tisdale also said, the song could be about [...] "When you have been cheated on or you're in a relationship". Black was initially reluctant to let Tisdale record the song, but eventually green-lit the track. However, she recorded her RedOne-produced version which will feature guest vocals by Eminem for her upcoming debut album. Tisdale co-wrote several songs on the album such as [...] "What If", which was co-written with Kara DioGuardi. Tisdale described [...] "What If" [...] as the most personal song on the album, she said the song [...] "is about when you’re in a relationship and you say 'If I really needed you, would you actually be there?’" ...|$|E

[...] "I'm {{not sure}} that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> I can't endure the thought of my mother's destruction, and yet the notion of her {{floating}} about somewhere like a wreath of mist is sorrowful to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he didn't {{find any}} other fault with me. If {{he had had}} any to find, he would have begun yesterday, for he {{was just in the}} humor for it. He drove that jack-pair around town and showed them the sights, and when he came home he couldn't find his father's old silver watch that don't keep time and he thinks so much of, and couldn't {{remember}} what he did with it three or four days ago when he saw it last, and when I suggested that it probably wasn't lost but stolen, it put him in a regular passion, and he said I was a fool--which convinced me, without any trouble, that that was just what he was afraid had happened, himself, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> because lost things stand a better chance of being found again than stolen ones." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Brockington for the New York Post was {{critical}} of Hollywood Records decision to not include Rihanna and Brown's version on the soundtrack, writing [...] "the Pussycat Dolls are listed as the artist, {{and as much as}} I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was a typo, I pressed play, and there was Nicole Scherzinger and her kittens singing away." [...] Brockington continued to express his distaste, writing [...] "Now I have to listen to some overproduced vocals by a pack of hyenas and their booty-slap noises." ...|$|R

Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it's</b> true, or because they're afraid {{it might be}} true. Peoples' heads are full of knowledge, facts and beliefs, {{and most of it}} is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the {{difference}} between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool." ...|$|R

5000|$|Tomer was {{the first}} French {{stand-up}} comedian to have won the Just for Laughs comedy festival, the biggest in the world, in 2003. He is considered the first comedian to introduce real stand-up comedy in France, where until then, the popular one-man shows used to portray mostly impressions and sketches. His stand-up routine became a huge hit, partly thanks to a three-and-a-half minute bit where he said his mother was Jewish and his father an Arab. Though not true, no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> was a joke, and it hence allowed him to joke about both religions. The media immediately saw him as [...] "the answer to racism".|$|R

5000|$|The {{evidence}} {{was wrapped in}} paper used for sandwiches, and taken to General Kress von Kressenstein, who examined the pocket book and mused on its authenticity. According to an account by Turk Colonel Hussein Husni, Chief of Staff of 7th Army, Meinertzhagen's German-sounding name added to its genuine feel. Von Kressenstein <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> which threw the staff into some confused arguments. The ideas of Allenby's general leave-time played on Turk preconceptions about the way British and Australians were thought to behave. [...] The main consequence was a swap in the German High Command, and Mustafa Kemal's resignation. At {{a time when the}} British were planning their third attempt to capture Gaza the timing proved critical.|$|R

5000|$|Buzz Osborne, {{close friend}} of Cobain, called the film [...] "mostly misguided fiction" [...] and wrote that [...] "people need to {{understand}} that 90% of Montage of Heck is bullshit". In an interview with RiffYou.com, Osborne reinforced his criticisms, stating [...] "I happen to know {{a lot of the stuff}} in the movie isn’t true.

5000|$|Hakuhō {{expressed}} his shock at {{the retirement of}} Asashōryū in February, following allegations his fellow yokozuna had assaulted {{a man in a}} drunken brawl outside a nightclub during the previous tournament. Fighting back tears he said, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> I was honoured to wrestle in the same era as him." [...] After getting regularly beaten by Asashōryū earlier in his career, Hakuhō came to completely dominate him, winning all of their last seven regulation matches (excluding two tournament-playoff defeats) and finishing with a 14-13 record over his greatest rival.|$|E
5000|$|Buxtun, then a 27-year-old {{social worker}} and {{epidemiologist}} in San Francisco, {{was hired by the}} Public Health Service in December 1965 to interview patients with sexually transmitted diseases; {{in the course of his}} duties, he learned of the Tuskegee Experiment from co-workers. He later said—"I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> This was the Public Health Service. We didn't do things like that." [...] In November 1966, he filed an official protest on ethical grounds with the Service's Division of Venereal Diseases; this was rejected on the grounds that the Experiment was not yet complete. He filed another protest in November 1968; again, his concerns were ruled irrelevant.|$|E

60|$|Jim Leonard {{said it was}} all logs once, {{and that}} the roof was loose clap-boards, held down by logs that ran across them, like the roofs in the early times, before there were {{shingles}} or nails, or anything, in the country. But none of the oldest boys had ever seen it like that, {{and you had to}} take Jim Leonard's word for <b>it</b> if you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> The little fellows nearly all did; but everybody said afterwards {{it was a good thing}} for Jim Leonard that it was not that kind of roof when he had his hair-breadth escape on it. He said himself that he would not have cared if it had been; but that was when it was all over, and his mother had whipped him, and everything, and he was telling the boys about it.|$|R
60|$|Now Happy Jack {{knew just}} what he would like <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> He would like <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Farmer Brown's boy had taken Shadow away and made an end of him.
