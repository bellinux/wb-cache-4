40|$|Generally the {{discharge}} in a dielectric barrier arrangement {{consists of a}} great number of filaments in parallel. It has been shown in the past that barrier discharges without filaments could also be established in special electrode arrangements and in limited working domains at atmospheric pressure. Further it was shown that a reliable control of such discharges in a cheap gas like nitrogen is possible. Different interfaces between the insulating barriers and the electrodes (“contacts”) are investigated in order to improve the <b>working</b> <b>domain</b> of homogeneous discharges. The <b>working</b> <b>domain</b> is characterized by the applied voltage parameters. The contact is either made by a flat metal electrode or by a mesh of fine wire between barrier and current lead. The discharges are characterized by successive high speed photographs and electrical measurements. Electrode parameters have been found which lead to an increase of the <b>working</b> <b>domain</b> of homogeneous barrier discharges. An approach to explain the effect of the electrode shape and material, respectively, on homogeneous barrier discharges at atmospheric pressure is made...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the radical copolymerization of styrene (St) and n-butylmethacrylate (BMA) in a counter-rotating twin-screw extruder. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} polymer melt viscosity on the <b>working</b> <b>domain</b> in reactive extrusion, the copolymer was crosslinked with different amounts of divinylbenzene (DVB). Crosslinking of the polymer resulted in a higher polymer melt viscosity. It was demonstrated that not only the product properties but also the process characteristics were strongly influenced by the addition of divinylbenzene to the reaction mixture. The product properties changed as expected: more crosslink agent led to a higher molecular weight or an increase in gel fraction, and a much higher melt viscosity of the polymer. Besides these effects on the product properties, the addition of DVB resulted in a more stable process, leading to an enlarged <b>working</b> <b>domain.</b> ...|$|E

Digital watermarking was introduced to provide the copy right protection and owners’ authentication. Digital video watermarking is the process to embedding a digital code into digital video sequences. Digital video watermarking nothing but a sequence of consecutive still images. In recent few years the applications based on video like, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, video broadcasting are becomes more and more popular, so the requirement of a secure video distribution increases. In this paper, the concept of digital video watermarking, its terminology, principle, properties, applications, and classification is introduced. Classification is based on the types of key used for embedding/detecting purpose, types of carriers and the <b>working</b> <b>domains</b> of watermark embedding are included...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{focuses on}} the study of routing {{protocols}} in IPv 4 and IPv 6. Their classification is based on type of updating (distance-vector versus link-state), <b>working</b> <b>domains</b> (intra- versus inter-domain), and number of paths (single or multi-path). In addition, some of the routing protocols could involve a flat scheme, whilst others follow mainly a hierarchical mechanism. The performances are highly dependent also on the unicast or multicast way of exchanging information within the autonomous system. The study is completed by practical experiments, using a software routing package under RedHat Linux / Fedora called zebra. The paper covers the unicast routing protocols: RIPv 1, RIPv 2, RIPng, OSPFv 2, and OSPFv 3 for both IPv 4 and IPv 6...|$|R

40|$|The self-wiping co-rotating twin-screw {{extruder}} was {{studied as}} a reactor for two polymerizations in bulk: the homopolymerization of n-butylmethacrylate and the copolymerization of n-butylmethacrylate with 2 -hydroxypropylmethacrylate. The {{influence of the}} extrusion parameters on the product was analyzed. With both reactions, conversions up to 95 % were obtained. Nevertheless, a significant difference was observed in the <b>working</b> <b>domain</b> of both polymerizations, in which a stable reactive extrusion process could be attained wherein the discharge rate is constant and equals the feed rate. In {{the case of the}} relatively fast copolymerization, both the throughput and the screw rotation rate could be raised without endangering the stability of the process. This was not the case for the homopolymerization studied. It was determined that the stability of the process depends on the reaction velocity and the product viscosity.

Furthermore, we aimed to test the possible interaction between childhood and adult MLE and to investigate modification of these associations by educa-tional attainment. Methods The study was based on 4, 761 participants from the Copenhagen City Heart Study free of diabetes at baseline and followed for 10 years. MLE were categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3 or more events. Multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, education and family history of diabetes were used to estimate the association between MLE and T 2 DM.

40|$|In this review, we {{summarize}} a {{new line}} of experimentation showing that attentional orienting can bias information processing in the <b>working</b> memory <b>domain</b> {{as well as in the}} perceptual domain to optimize goal-directed behavior. A new experimental paradigm was developed, which revealed that spatial orienting cues that appear after perceptual events (retro-cues), when these have been internalized into working memory representations, can retrospectively enhance performance to a similar degree as spatial precues appearing before perceptual events. As part of their facilitatory action, retro-cues diminish the costs of retrieving items from increasing loads within working memory. Hemodynamic and electrophysiological brain imaging experiments show a high degree of overlap between brain areas and dynamics involved in spatial orienting in the <b>working</b> memory <b>domain</b> compared to the perceptual domain. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging points to the selective involvement of frontal areas during spatial orienting in the <b>working</b> memory <b>domain.</b> The roles of different frontal areas remain to be clarified but may include both early roles in guiding spatial shifts occurring within a mnemonic context as well as selection of memorized targets amidst distracting stimuli. Experiments have also begun to reveal the ability to orient attention selectively to object-based representations in working memory and suggest that the neural representations of objects in working memory can be directly modulated by this process. The findings bolster contemporary notions of a strong theoretical relationship between attentional orienting and working memory, suggesting that these two cognitive functions interact in more ways and directions than previously considered...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the implementation of mediation in cases where a power disbalance between partners exists. The model includes relevant theoretical concepts which are important for understanding of violence phenomenon in the family, and the contemporary approaches to the work on balancing unequal power in relationships. In creating the model of family mediation in cases including violence, some basic concepts of mediation procedures are modified or adjusted (neutrality, confidentiality), as well as the concept of circular causality and complementary relationships from a systemic perspective. Implementation of interdisciplinary approach is proposed for efficient work on balancing the power in relations and using various <b>working</b> <b>domains.</b> The confession of violent behavior and the acceptance of personal responsibility by the offender, and the readiness of both sides to take part in restoration of a relationship are basic principles of restorative justice that is fundamental for victim- offender mediation.
