500|$|Mariel Concepcion of Billboard {{was also}} {{positive}} of the video, saying that [...] "not only does she {{walk away from}} an unhealthy situation in the clip- she looks completely stunning while doing so." [...] A reviewer from Kayrhythm.com said, [...] "The clip is fairly successful, despite its simplicity and sobriety, which probably result {{from a lack of}} budget. In the song, Kelly is very beautiful and very emotional because it gives way to sadness created by the decline of a relationship with her boyfriend. In the absence of a spectacular clip, Kelly still focused on her wardrobe, perfect for the occasion." [...] The reviewer pointed out that the video works because of Rowland having a good team behind her. [...] "Kelly's team is really good. Imagine the damage that Kelly could have done with the team of Rihanna!..." [...] Julia Guez of Ados.fr was also critical of the clip, saying, [...] "The aesthetic is the rendezvous, the Destiny's Child alum appears sexier than ever, but <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> increased the costumes? Something is missing...coherence, an imprint? We do not yet see the real Kelly..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2013 interview, guitarist Brett Gurewitz {{stated that}} Bad Religion would start writing their seventeenth studio album in 2014. Guitarist Brian Baker {{said that he}} hoped Bad Religion would start {{recording}} the album {{in the fall of}} 2015. In a September 2015 interview, however, frontman Greg Graffin stated that he had been working on his first solo album since 2006's Cold as the Clay, and that a new Bad Religion album would not be released until around late 2016. Graffin also said that Bad Religion would begin writing their new album after the release of this third solo album Millport, which was released on March 10, 2017. Baker said, however, that the album will not be released until 2017. Asked in a March 2017 interview about the follow-up to True North, Graffin said, [...] "It's one of the great challenges as artist is to maintain the tradition of his or her prior work. That's hard to do. It normally takes (Bad Religion) two years to put out an album. <b>Why</b> <b>has</b> <b>it</b> taken us four years to release an album after True North? Well, True North was such a great album — and we owe it to our fans to take it seriously as a great album — that to do another one {{is going to take a}} lot more work." ...|$|E

5000|$|Indeed he does. It {{was a most}} tragic case {{in which}} a circus lion somehow got loose and savaged two people, one of whom was killed, and the other badly disfigured. The latter is {{apparently}} this lodger - the former was her husband. Holmes could make little of the case at the time, but perhaps if someone had actually hired him, the outcome would have been different. As it was, the inquest ruled that Mr. Ronder was the victim of death by misadventure. Still, even the local police were a bit disturbed at the time by some seeming inconsistencies in the accounts. For example, the lion was part of an act which Mr. and Mrs. Ronder performed right in its cage, and {{they were the ones who}} fed <b>it.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> suddenly turned on its feeders? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> not tried to escape?

60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>had</b> the Roman Empire {{grown and}} <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> so {{completely}} decayed? It grew because {{at first the}} idea of citizenship held it together. Throughout {{the days of the}} expanding republic, and even into the days of the early empire there remained a great number of men conscious of Roman citizenship, feeling it a privilege and an obligation to be a Roman citizen, confident of their rights under the Roman law and willing to make sacrifices in the name of Rome. The prestige of Rome as of something just and great and law-upholding spread far beyond the Roman boundaries. But even as early as the Punic wars the sense of citizenship was being undermined by the growth of wealth and slavery. Citizenship spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship.|$|R

6000|$|But why {{was this}} story of Joseph put into Holy Scripture, and at such length, too?

It tells us, of course, how the Israelites first came into Egypt; and that was necessary for us to know.

The gruesome story is as follows.|$|R
50|$|None but Christ {{is a huge}} {{survey of}} the whole of scripture {{designed}} to show that every divinely-inspired 'personality' from Moses to St Thomas Apostle believed, as Muggletonians believe, that Christ was the Holy One of Israel. Hence its title, None but Christ. But, if the message of scripture is so clear and unanimous, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> become such a minority view by Thomas Tomkinson's time? His answer is that, after its first three hundred years of existence, Christianity was absorbed {{by the state and}} misused ever since for the state's own purposes. This oppressive situation will continue until the seventh anti-church (Quakers) expires.|$|R
