40|$|When <b>wine</b> is aged <b>on</b> <b>lees,</b> {{the process}} of lees {{autolysis}} causes {{the release of a}} range of constituents including mannoproteins, polysaccharides, amino acids and fatty acids that interact with the fermented wine leading to changes in the final flavour and sensory aspects of the wine. There is no doubt that ageing <b>wines</b> <b>on</b> <b>lees</b> for extended periods of time, adds beneficial organoleptic qualities to a finished wine. Furthermore, whilst the interactions of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> <b>on</b> phenolics, lipids and mannoproteins released have been widely studied, exactly how all these factors and constituents influence final wine quality is not totally clear. It can be said that there is still a poor understanding of how <b>lees</b> impacts <b>on</b> <b>wine</b> aroma. Moreover, the addition of autolytic enzymes to speed up lees breakdown or the addition of inactivated dry yeast (IDY) preparations to enhance the release of mannoproteins and glucans so that the perceived benefits of lees exposure are achieved in a shorter timeframe is only a recent advance over the last decade or so. Consequently, more research is needed in this field in order to further clarify the mechanisms and factors that lead to these perceived changes in a <b>wine</b> upon ageing <b>on</b> <b>lees.</b> To this end, the Introduction for this PhD thesis provides a complete summary of the current state of play in terms of knowledge as to the scientific and practical potential of ageing <b>wines</b> <b>on</b> <b>lees.</b> It begins with a detailed account into the history of winemaking in Australia and the current state of play in terms of how Australian winemakers perceive utilising lees exposure to prepare their wine styles. Autolysis is a slow process and often is conducted over periods of years. Coupling this with the fact that wines are produced from a range of grape varieties; employ a range of different yeasts and utilise different winemaking protocols, results in a complex field of research study in which it can often be difficult to draw clear conclusions between the research studies and into the mechanisms and factors that lead to these perceived changes of a <b>wine</b> upon ageing <b>on</b> <b>lees.</b> Consequently, the Introduction provides a detailed account of all major research studies completed over the last few decades. The Introduction then concludes with an introduction to the aims of the research to be carried out within this PhD thesis. Chapter two describes an exploratory study into the effect of <b>lees</b> exposure <b>on</b> both a Pinot Noir wine and a Chardonnay wine over a two-year period. A recent survey into current Australian practices showed that the ageing of Pinot Noir <b>on</b> <b>lees</b> is highly employed in Australia thus leading us to include this variety in this study. The use of lees ageing for the preparation of Chardonnay wines is typical throughout the World. Furthermore, the project was enlarged to include a number of wine and lees treatments (including the addition of commercial enzyme preparations). A range of chemical parameters were measured over the two-year period in order to evaluate further the importance of <b>lees</b> exposure <b>on</b> these <b>wines.</b> Some of the parameters measured, such as levels of polysaccharides or changes in colour, were those that have been shown to alter over time upon lees ageing, thus comparisons were able to be drawn between the work conducted here and that already reported in the literature. Moreover, we also examined other parameters which are not normally associated with lees autolysis such as possible changes in overall viscosity and metal concentrations in the wines to see if further information <b>on</b> how <b>lees</b> ageing impacts <b>on</b> a <b>wines</b> final quality could be gleaned. Unfortunately, the autolytic enzyme utilised in this study was found to be not very active at enhancing the autolysis rate in our wine treatments, thus the results found were not entirely as we hoped, although some new preliminary findings were captured. Clearly further highly focussed research is needed to unravel this complicated field of <b>wine</b> research. Based <b>on</b> the results of the above study we then found ourselves in a position to devise a new alternative strategy to avoid the uncertainties associated with traditional lengthy lees exposure times, the results of which are described within Chapter three of this thesis. Instead of simply leaving the <b>wines</b> <b>on</b> <b>lees</b> for extended periods of time, we explored the concept that exposure of lees to microwaves {{for a short period of}} time may accelerate autolysis and when the treated lees is added back to a base wine for a short time, could the same perceived benefits of lees ageing be observed. This new technological approach for the preparation of new wine styles, coupled with both chemical evaluations and formal sensory trials was evaluated and it was found from our initial studies that there appears to be clear evidence that such a process leads to wines in which there is a perceived difference in the organoleptic properties of the microwaved lees wines when compared to the control wines. Further studies are needed in order to clearly define the key constituents that are altered in terms of their concentrations when such an approach is employed, however, it can be concluded that microwave assisted lysis of yeast lees appears to be a new method for the accelerating of yeast autolysis and thus allows for a shortening of wine/lees exposure time needed to achieve the perceived organoleptic benefits of lees exposed wines. Chapter four describes a study on the use of commercial inactivated dry yeast (IDY) preparations and their ability to alter the properties of a fermented Chardonnay wine and a browning model wine system containing (+) -catechin, iron(II), copper(II), and acetaldehyde aover a short period of time. Such yeast derived preparations are now being used as an alternative technique to ageing <b>wines</b> <b>on</b> <b>lees,</b> because they permit a quicker release into the wine of yeast compounds such as mannoproteins and glucans and as such the perceived benefits of lees exposure are achieved in a shorter timeframe. We analysed 10 commercial IDY preparations and evaluated their effectiveness at altering the base wines composition and the browning model wine system by a range of analytical measurements. Importantly, it was found that a range of the IDY preparations were able to substantially inhibit oxidative browning with the amount of soluble proteins being released correlating well with their preventative browning abilities. Such a finding is yet to be reported in the literature. Undoubtedly further scientific research will aid in unlocking the mysteries of IDY preparations and the host of positive effects that they can have <b>on</b> a finished <b>wine.</b> Finally, Chapter five contains a detailed description of all the experimental methods and analyses utilised throughout these studies.

All the warmth {{that we have in}} our communion, it is the warmth of the Spirit: when a company of saints are {{gathered}} together in the name of Christ, to perform any spiritual exercise, and their souls be edified, warmed, and made glad therein, it is because this water, this river of water of life, has, in some of the streams thereof, run into that assembly (Jer 31:12,13). Then are Christians like those that drink wine in bowls, merry and glad; for that they have drank into the Spirit, and had their souls refreshed with the sweet gales and strong wine thereof.

Without this water of life, communion is weak, flat, cold, dead, fruitless, lifeless; there is nothing seen, felt, heard, or understood in a spiritual and heart-quickening way.

The ultrasounds has been applied on crushed grapes before microvinification; during these trials, skins have been removed from the wine after 2, 3 and 4 days and the measured phenolic compounds and anthocyanins content have shown that the ultrasounds can save up to 3 days of maceration, comparing to the traditional treatment that usually takes 5 days. Experiences on white grape in the cellar at 27 KHz, have shown interesting sensory responses and made it possible to eliminate the traditional maceration normally used for extraction of aromas and aromatic precursors.

The second revealed a correlation between heterocyclic compound and free amino acid concentrations measured in the wines, suggesting that these compounds are potential aromatic precursors when <b>wine</b> is aged <b>on</b> <b>lees</b> and, thus, potential key compounds in the bouquet of aged Champagnes. The principal outcome of these assays was to reveal, for the first time, that aromatic heterocycle concentrations in Champagne base wines are correlated with wine age...|$|R

The release of the products of autolysis during this aging step is fundamental for the quality of sparkling wines made by the traditional method. These cells undergo an autolysis process characterized by self‐digestion of yeast intracellular and cell‐wall macromolecules, and the release of the degradation products to the wine. Autolysis is the source of several molecules responsible for the quality of sparkling wines, as well as still <b>wines</b> aged <b>on</b> <b>lees</b> (yeast cells). Autolysis is a slow process under sparkling wine production conditions, and there is interest, from the industrial side, in the design of strategies for rapid development of autolysis. Some years ago our research group hypothesized that, during the process of sparkling wine production, autophagy would take place. This had important implications for the design of genetic engineering strategies aimed to accelerate autolysis. The relationships between autolysis and autophagy are not completely elucidated, but in case autophagy preceded autolysis during the aging step of sparkling wine production, there were at least two possibilities for accelerating autolysis by targeting genes involved in autophagy. This chapter discusses methods to demonstrate the development of autophagy under enological conditions. This is accomplished by using either laboratory strains defective in autophagy and/or the Cvt pathway, in conditions that mimic sparkling wine production or industrial wine yeast strains under real sparkling wine production conditions.

40|$|A new method, {{based on}} Kynch theory of {{gravitational}} sedimentation, to calculate partly the flux density of solids’ volume fraction q(c) {{and then the}} propagation velocity ua of the sediment shock, was proposed {{to reduce the number}} of preliminary tests. A few sedimentation tests <b>on</b> <b>wine</b> <b>lees,</b> characterized by a colloidal and flocculant behaviour and diluite in water at several volumetric concentration Co was carried-out. The experimentation was repeated with two different initial volumes (α and β). So the relative time-height (t-z) charts were drawn with in evidence the upper front wave (shock). Through the measurement of the shock propagation velocity, the flux density function q(c) was partly mathematically represented by the new method and then the propagation velocity of the sediment shock ua was calculated. The comparison between these calculated shock velocities and the experimental ones, taken from z-t charts, showed a very good corrispondence when the volumetric concentration c 0 was upper 0. 2, whereas an average error of 20...|$|R

6000|$|SIR, Your Billingsgate Muse methinks does begin With {{much greater}} noise than a {{conjugal}} din. A pox of her bawling, her tempora et mores! What are times now to me; a'nt I {{one of the}} Tories? You tell me my verses disturb you at prayers; Oh, oh, Mr. Dean, are you there with your bears? You pray, I suppose, like a Heathen, to Phoebus, To give his assistance to make out my rebus: Which I don't think so fair; leave it off for the future; When the combat is equal, this God should be neuter. I'm now at the tavern, where I drink all I can, To write with more spirit; I'll drink no more Helicon; For Helicon is water, and water is weak; 'Tis <b>wine</b> <b>on</b> the gross <b>lee,</b> that makes your Muse speak. This I know by her spirit and life; but I think She's much in the wrong to scold in her drink. Her damn'd pointed tongue pierced almost to my heart; Tell me of a cart,--tell me of a ----, I'd have you to tell on both sides her ears, If she comes to my house, that I'll kick her down stairs: Then home she shall limping go, squalling out, O my knee; You shall soon have a crutch to buy for your Melpomene. You may come as her bully, to bluster and swagger; But my ink is my poison, my pen is my dagger: Stand off, I desire, and mark what I say to you, If you come I will make your Apollo shine through you. Don't think, sir, I fear a Dean, as I would fear a dun; Which is all at present from yours, [...] THOMAS SHERIDAN.|$|R
