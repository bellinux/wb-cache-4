Thus I have always been against the Pacifists during the quarrel and the Jingoist at its close...I thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> conquered the Irish then given them Home Rule...and that after smashing the General Strike <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> met the grievances of the miners.|$|E

25|$|Revelation has a {{wide variety}} of interpretations, ranging from the simple message that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> faith that God will prevail ("symbolic interpretation"), to complex end time {{scenarios}} ("futurist interpretation"), to the views of critics who deny any spiritual value to Revelation at all.|$|E

25|$|I {{really do}} not think that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> homosexuals guiding our children. I think that it’s a {{lifestyle}} that I don’t agree with. I realize a lot of people do. It’s my personal faith, religious faith, that I don’t believe that the people who do this should be raising our children. It’s not a natural thing. You need a mother and a father. You need a man and a woman. That’s what God intended.|$|E
25|$|During a refueling, Spaatz was drenched {{with fuel}} when {{turbulence}} caused the hose {{to pull out}} of the receptacle. Recalling the event in 1975, Eaker said:We went over the Rose Bowl. It was very bumpy, as you can appreciate, as <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> appreciated, up against those mountains in January, and the refueling plane and the Question Mark were torn apart. I was piloting the Question Mark and I realized that General Spaatz had probably been drenched in high octane gasoline.|$|E
5000|$|Without the {{assistance}} of France <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> sufficient forces to meet the combined German and Italian navies in European waters and the Japanese fleet in the Far East. In the circumstances envisaged, it is most improbable that we could send adequate reinforcements to the Far East. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> therefore <b>have</b> {{to rely on the}} United States of America to safeguard our interests there.|$|R

25|$|Russell and Moore {{were devoted}} to clarity in {{arguments}} by breaking down philosophical position into their simplest components. Russell, in particular, saw formal logic and science as the principal tools of the philosopher. Russell did not think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> separate methods for philosophy. Russell thought philosophers should strive to answer the most general of propositions about the world and this would help eliminate confusions. In particular, he wanted to end {{what he saw as}} the excesses of metaphysics. Russell adopted William of Ockham's principle against multiplying unnecessary entities, Occam's Razor, as a central part of the method of analysis.|$|E
25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E
25|$|If {{it should}} be {{declared}} that contraception is not evil in itself, then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit {{had been on the}} side of the Protestant churches in 1930 (when the encyclical Casti Connubii was promulgated), in 1951 (Pius XII's address to the midwives), and in 1958 (the address delivered before the Society of Hematologists in the year the pope died). It should likewise have to be admitted that for a half century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error. This would mean that the leaders of the Church, acting with extreme imprudence, had condemned thousands of innocent human acts, forbidding, under pain of eternal damnation, a practice which would now be sanctioned. The fact can neither be denied nor ignored that these same acts would now be declared licit on the grounds of principles cited by the Protestants, which popes and bishops have either condemned or at least not approved.|$|E

25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have.</b> I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E
500|$|Oxford's {{number five}} and Great Britain {{international}} Peter Bridge noted Gröbler's impact: [...] "We really felt the strength {{that we had}} built up over six months under Jürgen's methods." [...] He continued: [...] " [...] were slower off the start than we expected which was nice." [...] Referring to Cambridge's lead at Hammersmith Bridge, their number seven Steve Fowler said [...] "we were feeling good but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> closed the door there and then. [...] <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> killed them on the bend." [...] Cambridge cox Probert conceded to his counterpart Liz Chick: [...] "she steered very well."

500|$|Separate {{competitions}} for men {{and women}} will be held, using a similar format to the existing IRB Sevens World Series. The IRB had originally proposed including 12 teams of each sex, the same number as other team ball sports events. During the IRB's presentation at the IOC Session, two IOC members asked why only 12 teams were included. IRB Chief Executive Mike Miller responded, [...] "We followed the guidance of the Executive Members of the IOC, but if the IOC feels <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> more teams, we will add more." ...|$|E

Goodbye, friends. I feel sure that my dear wife and children will not be neglected." [...] In 1923, Gladys Mackintosh married Joseph Stenhouse, Auroras first officer and later captain.|$|E
500|$|Had the Germans invaded Britain, Coward was {{scheduled}} to be arrested and killed, as he was in The Black Book along with other figures such as Virginia Woolf, Paul Robeson, Bertrand Russell, C.

He was given permission to do the interview by Rowett Institute Director Philip James. Rowett's press officer {{was present at the}} start of filming. During the interview Pusztai said he had [...] "concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what we thought it was necessary to do, and therefore <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> more testing." [...] When asked why he felt concerned, he said [...] "it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned" [...] and discussed his results in general terms.|$|E
500|$|Contrasting with Libeskind's {{original}} plan, the tower's {{final design}} tapers octagonally as it rises. Its designers {{stated that the}} tower would be a [...] "monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna." [...] In 2006, Larry Silverstein commented on a planned completion date: [...] "By 2012 <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a completely rebuilt World Trade Center, more magnificent, more spectacular than it ever was." [...] On April 26, 2006, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin. A formal agreement was drafted the following day, the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the Empire State Building. Construction began in May; a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived.|$|E
500|$|England won the Test series 3–2 {{after winning}} the first, second and fourth games. In the first match Rhodes contributed 40 runs to a tenth wicket {{partnership}} of 130 with R. E. Foster, who scored 287, to assist the team in building a large lead. This was a Test record partnership for the tenth wicket, and remained so for 70 years; until 2014, it was a record for England's 10th wicket. When Victor Trumper led an Australian fightback, scoring 185 not out, only Rhodes could slow his scoring in conditions which, according to Warner, were very good for batting. Steady bowling through the innings brought Rhodes figures of five for 94; Warner wrote: [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done without Rhodes I do not know".|$|E
