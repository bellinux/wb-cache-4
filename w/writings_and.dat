5|$|Botany {{originated}} as herbalism, {{the study}} and use of plants for their medicinal properties. Many records of the Holocene period date early botanical knowledge {{as far back as}} 10,000 years ago. This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee, which make up much of the Cherokee land today. The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient <b>writings</b> <b>and</b> plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan <b>writings,</b> <b>and</b> in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E

In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's <b>writings</b> <b>and</b> beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the senior}} monks of Gautama Buddha, some of Koṇḍañña's <b>writings</b> <b>and</b> discourses to other monks are {{recorded}} in the literature.

In other verses, Koṇḍañña is shown admonishing monks who had fallen into ways contrary to Buddhist teaching. Koṇḍañña also acknowledged his own struggles against Mara, the demon who attempted to prevent the enlightenment of the Buddha. Koṇḍañña was also praised in the Udana by the Buddha, who observed his deliverance from the destructiveness of craving.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, <b>writings,</b> <b>and</b> speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
