5|$|In 1887, he {{was signed}} by the Peanut Eaters of the Pennsylvania State Association, and played in 36games before being sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, along with Ed Beatin for $1,000 on July27. Soon, the deal was put on hold by the NL, as the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association(AA) also claimed they had a deal in place for these players. On September6, an {{arbitration}} board for the NL and AA leagues convened to render their findings. They found that Detroit's contract <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> was dated on July20, which superseded Cincinnati's contract that was signed on July27, and awarded Detroit the players. Detroit then sold their contracts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> to the London Tecumsehs of the International Association. Though he did not play for London in 1887, he did play in two games for the New York Metropolitans of the AA, going hitless in eight at bats.|$|E

In casino play, it is more common to use blinds; the first betting round thus begins <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to <b>the</b> left of the big blind, and subsequent rounds begin <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to <b>the</b> dealer's left, thus draw games are very positional.|$|R

5|$|At a VCA {{meeting in}} April 1981, Loxton {{announced}} that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, as he would be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, he proceeded to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming that he had lost the art of communicating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E

He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{returned}} to Leeds City from Barnbow after hostilities had ended, but resigned suddenly in December 1918, eventually moving to Selby {{to take up}} a position as a superintendent at an oil and coke works. No reason was given for his resignation, but as football resumed in 1919–20, Leeds City were accused by a former player of financial irregularities, involving illegal payments to guest players during wartime matches. No documentary evidence was produced, but Leeds' refusal to allow the authorities access to their financial records was deemed a sign of guilt, and they were expelled from the Football League in October 1919 and five club officials, including Chapman, were banned from football for life. The club was dissolved, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> auctioned off and their Elland Road ground taken over by the newly formed Leeds United.|$|E

5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, the Bears began a {{voluntary}} offseason program, {{and because they}} had a new head coach, the Bears were given a two-week earlier start than teams that did not hire a new head coach.

Encounter 17 occurs in a giant but fragile bubble located above a boiling lake, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> needing to defeat a giant crab and retrieve Wave without damaging the bubble. Encounter 26 involves negotiating a magical ziggurat populated by various monsters (including sea lions, giant crayfish, giant scorpions, and manticores) before encounter 28, a battle against an ogre mage who possesses Blackrazor.

5|$|Though Taylor's {{friendship}} and partnership with Clough had been strong, their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion. While at Derby in 1971, Taylor was riled {{when he learned}} that Clough had failed to disclose to him that he had received a pay rise of £5,000 from chairman Sam Longson. He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do a larger share of the work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough, by Taylor, an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor's work with Clough.

5|$|Although {{no longer}} a Rangers employee, Smythe was invited to the Rangers' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard, an {{invitation}} he nearly turned down because he had felt the Rangers had short-changed him. Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, and Smythe felt he was owed $10,000. At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's private box. When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned the Rangers down, {{partly because of the}} disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest. On the return trip to Toronto, Conn and Irene visited Montreal, where Smythe bet the $2,500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> Smythe had brought to the team.|$|E
