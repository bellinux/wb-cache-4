5|$|Andrea Martin {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Apu's mother, recording her part in New York City. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Hank Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's. During the flashback to Apu's childhood, the animators made sure not to show Manjula, as they wished to reveal her {{at the end of}} the episode.|$|E

But Parveen, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the situation, {{composed}} a gazal or a couplet which stated her status as an already used woman not fit for an emperor, which enabled her to get release from Akbar's court and return to Orchha.|$|E

MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking to the work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E

However, art director Vivek managed to erect those sets without cutting down any trees.|$|E
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> sober, {{but due to}} his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, Marvel Entertainment began {{planning}} to independently produce its own films and distribute them through Paramount Pictures. Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema and others, including a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox. Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more {{money out of}} its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony, but was less pleased about others. As a result, they decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent movie studio since DreamWorks.|$|E

The City <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic Committee would vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a proposal for the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West Side Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid.|$|E
5|$|Stiller {{displayed}} {{an early}} interest in filmmaking and made Super 8 movies {{with his sister}} and friends. At nine years old, he made his acting debut as a guest on his mother's short-lived television series, Kate McShane. In the late 1970s, he performed with the New York City troupe NYC's First All Children's Theater, playing several roles, including the title role in Clever Jack and the Magic Beanstalk. After being inspired by the television show Second City Television while in high school, Stiller realized that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved with sketch comedy. During his high school years, {{he was also the}} drummer of the punk band Capital Punishment, which released a studio album named Roadkill in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The American Chess Congress' final {{proposal}} {{was that the}} winner of a tournament {{to be held in}} New York in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for the time being, but must be prepared to face a challenge from the second or third placed competitor within a month. Steinitz wrote that he would not play in the tournament and would not challenge the winner unless the second and third placed competitors failed to do so. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws, and Weiss then <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to his work for the Rothschild Bank, conceding the title to Chigorin.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Jordan, within miles of the Iraqi border, to achieve Bigelow's goal of authenticity. Iraqi {{refugees}} were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but director Kathryn Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{as close to the}} war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraq border. She had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} of the Flushing Line was then proposed {{as part of the}} New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The City <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic Committee would vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a proposal for the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West Side Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid. However, in a report entitled No. 7 Subway Extension– Hudson Yards Rezoning and Development Program, the government of New York City, devised a rezoning plan for the Hudson Yards area and proposed two new subway stations to serve that area. The subway extension was approved following the successful rezoning of about 60 blocks from 28th to 43rd Streets, which became the Hudson Yards neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} movie audiences, hip-hop {{dance was}} already being broadcast on television. Soul Train was a , music variety show that featured social dancing and performances by African-American soul, funk, and R singers. The show was broadcast in South Korea via the US Armed Forces Korea Network. Before officially becoming a crew, The Lockers made several appearances on this show. After becoming a crew, The Electric Boogaloos also {{appeared on the}} show. Soul Train premiered in 1970. During its 36 year run, the resident freestyle dancers were {{referred to as the}} Soul Train Gang. Auditions were held in 1971 when the show moved from Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California. Dancers who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on Soul Train after this time had to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations from dancers who were already employed by the show. A regular feature during the broadcast was the Soul Train Line. To participate in the Soul Train Line, the dancers formed two lines of equal length facing each other with a large space in between them. Each dancer in line would take their turn dancing down the middle.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling {{that it was the}} first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
5|$|Due to lost {{communications}} with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters, and the unit's subsequent capture, its disposition and success at delaying {{the advance of}} the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to U.S. commanders. Lt. Lyle Bouck considered the wounding of most of his men and the capture of his entire unit a failure. When the war ended five months later, the platoon's men, who were split between two prisoner-of-war camps, just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> home. It was only after the war that Bouck learned that his platoon had prevented the lead German infantry elements from advancing and had delayed by about 20 hours their armored units' advance. On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying, a Congressional hearing, and letter-writing by Bouck, {{every member of the}} unit were finally recognized for their valor that day, making the platoon most decorated American unit of its size of World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Savage began {{a ten-year}} stay in San Francisco. He worked {{with his father}} and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a {{prominent}} role in the civic and social life of the city, and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous mob of angry supporters who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Chinese immigrants. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as a rallying point for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories.|$|E
