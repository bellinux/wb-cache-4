His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet, the only time she did so during the <b>whole</b> <b>show,</b> and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|The show on June 14, 2002 at the United Spirit Arena in Lubbock, Texas was {{cancelled}} due to {{a transformer}} blowing out during the 2nd song which put the <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> on auxiliary power making it unsafe for Spears and the entire production team to continue.

25|$|Frank Sinatra, who had {{declared}} Presley and {{rock and roll}} a disgrace in the 1950s, was keen to have him appear on his show. Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be $125,000 for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the <b>whole</b> <b>show,</b> but he agreed. The show, entitled “Welcome Home, Elvis”, was Presley's first national television appearance since The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1957.|$|E

25|$|French {{choreographer}} Sébastian Ramirez {{was hired}} from the dancer auditions, which saw over 5,000 applicants in Paris, New York and Los Angeles.

25|$|In the evening, Crosby did the <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> {{before an}} {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought {{it was very}} funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E

25|$|The Going Home Song - A song sung {{every day}} (except Fridays {{due to the}} Official Chart) at 16:10, with three {{people who are going}} home singing to the tune of Nut Rocker by B.

The feature has created some controversy on Rage Against the Answer Machine, with some saying 16:10 is too early for people to be going home, to which Greg responds that they cannot do lots of different Going Home Songs throughout the <b>whole</b> <b>show.</b> In May 2016, singer Craig David recorded his own version of the Going Home Song.|$|E
25|$|Others, however, {{reason that}} Houghton Mifflin must have printed the volumes several {{distinct}} times between 1938 {{and the second}} edition of 1951. They point out {{that none of the}} variations could have come about {{during the course of a}} single printing run. Also, thirteen years elapsed between the first printing and the appearance of the second edition; it seems improbable that Houghton Mifflin would not have reprinted the book (presuming the arrangements with Allen & Unwin permitted). And finally, while the bowing hobbit (first printing) version appears on the market uncommonly, first editions as a <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> up scarcely less often than all the printings of the second edition combined.|$|E
50|$|Advertiser-funded programming, {{largely a}} neologism, is a {{solution}} to this change and means the advertiser pays to integrate their message in the TV programme itself, rather than just buying advertising space around it.

Many of these projects are enabled by a content partnership where the programming is co-funded by multiple stakeholders.|$|R

25|$|Lighting {{designer}} Al Gurdon {{worked with}} Stufish and Tait Towers {{for the light}} setup, which was handled by PRG Group. The three main video screens were angled to give the side audience a better angle of vision. A Hippotizer V3 media server was used for content playback and operated by PRG Nocturne's Will Stinson, and five cameras were manned for this show. PRG used their newly invented GroundControl followspot devices which were attached as truss {{to the top of}} the screens, using Clay Paky Stormy Strobes. Fitted with high-definition cameras, they could be operated from backstage, who could simply use the cameras and direct the lights to illumate specific areas as required, without having to have knowledge about the physical stage. Console director Joshua Hutchings controlled their color, beams and shutters. Advantage of the followspot was to allow the lightning personnel to operate from a comfortable environment, rather than to climb on heights atop the stage. Hutchings explained the <b>whole</b> <b>show</b> was time-coded, going inline with the choreography.|$|E

Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they really liked that shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|E
500|$|Howe's {{decision}} to focus his own activity on {{an expedition to}} Philadelphia may have been motivated by competition with General Burgoyne, who was given command of the northern force despite lobbying by Howe for its command {{to be given to}} Clinton. John Alden notes the jealousies among the British leaders, saying, [...] "It is likely that [...] was as jealous of Burgoyne as Burgoyne was of him and that he was not eager to do anything which might assist his junior up the ladder of military renown." [...] Along the same lines historian Don Higginbotham concludes that in Howe's view, [...] "It [...] was Burgoyne's <b>whole</b> <b>show,</b> and consequently he [...] wanted little to do with it. With regard to Burgoyne's army, he would do only what was required of him (virtually nothing)." ...|$|E

It is set on an ocean liner on which Reno helps the character Billy Crocker win {{the heart of the}} engaged Hope Harcourt who he has fallen in love with. While reviewing the musical for the Deseret News, Joseph Walker commented that Gaven [...] "is sensational as Reno Sweeney, the saucy, sassy hoofer-with-a-heart-of-gold.

[...] At the end of 1988, Gaven returned to the musical Oliver! in a Theatre Under The Stars production in Houston, starring as Nancy. A critic for the Houston Chronicle commended her performance, writing that she [...] "acts the compassionate Nancy with warmth and spirit, and sings in a strong voice full of character." ...|$|E
