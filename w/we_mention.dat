Jeff Arwadi responded to the [...] "avant-garde" [...] label {{in an interview with}} Ultimate Metal.com: [...] "For us, avant-garde is not a classification of music. It is a state of being, a state of becoming.....once your music can be classified easily, I don't think the word progressive or avant-garde fits. So that's why <b>we</b> <b>mention</b> in our bio that 'avant-garde' is an ideal state for us, and not a classification." ...|$|E

Tommy Garrett of the website Highlight Hollywood has often lauded Morrow's acting.

500|$|Saint-Saëns {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878. In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday. On 28 July he {{disappeared}} from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say {{that he would not be}} returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five. Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women. After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle. Marie told him, [...] "For us you are one of the family, and <b>we</b> <b>mention</b> your name ceaselessly here." ...|$|E

[...] He notably pointed at the [...] "demographic explosion of youth" [...] of the Maghreb, though he said that the change brought about in Tunisia may not last. He thinks [...] "this {{is going to be the}} same old story. Yes, we would like a democracy in Tunisia – but not too much democracy. Remember how we wanted Algeria to have a democracy back in the early Nineties? Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died. No, in the Arab world, we want law and order and stability." [...] He added that [...] "If it can happen in the holiday destination Tunisia, it can happen anywhere, can't it?" ...|$|E
