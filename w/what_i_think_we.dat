500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Haunted" [...] was {{directed}} by Swedish film and music video director Jonas Åkerlund and styled by Dagmarette Yen and B. Åkerlend. It was shot using four cameras and {{in a period of}} two days. On November 15, 2013, Popjustice reported that one of the actors who was featured in the video, J-Hustle, shared a picture on his Twitter account while being on a five-day set for the filming. He added that a song with [...] "a slow vibe" [...] was played in the background during the shooting and that its potential name was [...] "Ghost Haunted". Beyoncé first discussed about the video with Åkerlend during a concert she had in Stockholm in 2013. Having invited him for the performance, the singer played several songs for the director afterwards and the pair went on to exchange several ideas about its concept. During an interview with Vulture, Åkerlend talked about the process, [...] "It was not like a solid plan of 'This is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should do.' It was a pretty long process. And she was traveling and touring, so we had time to bounce ideas back and forth, figure out what the best vision was. And meanwhile, she was shooting all these other videos and I wasn't really involved in what those other ideas were." [...] He noted that several ideas of the video which were initially conceived were similar with [...] "other videos that people were working on". Beyoncé conceived some of the initial ideas behind the looks and the scenarios for many of the rooms which were eventually shot. He also explained that the video contained many sexually explicit scenes and ideas when initially shot. However, he felt that the team managed to balance between the singer's look, her performance and a strong idea along with several other things. Åkerlund further noted that its concept remained largely unchanged as none of the big ideas were excluded. Beyoncé's look remained largely the same as the director pictured it before the filming of the video had started.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, Albom {{and four}} editors were briefly {{suspended}} from the Detroit Free Press after Albom filed a column that stated that two college basketball players were in the crowd at an NCAA tournament game {{when in fact they}} were not. In a column printed in the April 3, 2005 edition, Albom described two former Michigan State basketball players, both now in the NBA, attending an NCAA Final Four semifinal game on Saturday to cheer for their school. The players had told Albom they planned to attend, so Albom, filing on his normal Friday deadline but knowing the column could not come out until Sunday (after the game was over) wrote the players were there. But the players' plans changed at the last minute and they did not attend the game. The Detroit Free Press also suspended the four editors who had read the column and allowed it to go to print. Albom was in attendance at the game, but the columnist failed to check on the two players’ presence. A later internal investigation found no other similar instances in Albom's past columns, but did cite an editorial-wide problem of routinely using unattributed quotes from other sources. Carol Leigh Hutton, publisher of the Detroit Free Press {{at the time of the}} scandal, later told Buzzfeed that she regretted the way it was handled. “It was a stupid mistake that Mitch made that others failed to catch but not at all indicative of some problem that required the response we gave it. I allowed myself to believe that we were doing this highly credible, highly transparent thing, when really in hindsight <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were doing was acquiescing to people who were taking advantage of a stupid mistake.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{biggest problem}} with the {{criminal}} justice system is that too many crimes are committed-too many rapes, too many murders, too many robberies; too much violence that inflicts an untold amount of suffering and destruction on too many people. If that seems obvious, what follows should be equally obvious. The most important step to take to solve the problems of {{the criminal justice system}} is to reduce the number of crimes that are committed: to prevent crimes. The best thing we can do to help the victims of crime is to keep them from becoming victims in the first place. Chief Reuben Greenberg is doing an admirable job of that in his own city 2 ̆ 7 -many of his reforms have been adopted by other police departments-but overall, crime prevention has not been a high priority.

40|$|In this {{presentation}} I shall outline <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{can learn}} from the notion of ‘Asia as Method’ as proposed by Taiwan scholar and cultural theorist Chen Kuan-hsing. I shall focus on post-colonial and post-imperialist epistemologies (Chen, 2010; Lin, 2013) and discuss how our sense of cultural self and other is routinely re/produced in everyday discourses. The method of ‘critical syncretism’ and ‘multiplying our references’ is then proposed as a critical proposition to transform existing knowledge structures and simultaneously to transform ourselves (Chen, 2010). Then I shall explore how ‘Asia as method’ can be connected to the notion of ‘Asia literacy’ which is taken not as a static set of skills, knowledges and languages, but more importantly, as ‘learning how to advance a reflexive and open dialogue with oneself, and with others, in an age of global interconnectedness’ (Iwabuchi, 2015) ...|$|E

It is described how Galactic chemical evolution models have helped showing that: i) stringent constraints on primordial nucleosynthesis can be derived from the observed Galactic abundances of the light elements, ii) the Milky Way has been accreting external gas from early epochs to the present time, iii) the vast majority of Galactic halo stars have formed quite rapidly at early epochs. Chemical evolution models for the closest dwarf galaxies, although still uncertain so far, are expected to become extremely reliable in the nearest future, thanks to the quality of new generation photometric and spectroscopic data which are currently being acquired. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point for this paper {{are some of the}} key texts relating to the question of promoting ‘pro-poor’ political participation and organisation, which were written or circulated within the British government’s Department for International Development (DFID) in preparation for a retreat organised to discuss the issue in October 2002. I incorporate into this some of the concerns I believe we are addressing within the Crisis States Programme. In this paper I demonstrate how paying attention to politics challenges some of the assumptions within programmes pursued by donors involved in the promotion of ‘good governance’ and economic reform. The argument is structured around four issues: (1) the question of ‘participation’; (2) understanding ‘civil society’ and the state; (3) the role of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can usefully call ‘political society’ and ‘political parties’; and (4) governance and economic reforms that may undermine political organisation...|$|E

40|$|Thank you {{for coming}} and letting me talk about the theory and {{practice}} of education. Let me start with some observations about {{what we are trying to}} do, or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> should be trying to do, with Education theory. And in thinking about Education theory, we should never forget that what we are actually dealing with is people – living, breathing, feeling individuals with their own purposes and intentions. In view of the diversity and range of individuals that is implied by that simple statement, it is perhaps surprising that we can predict anything about people. But we can predict some things with considerable accuracy – such as traffic jams at particular times of day or seasons of the year, or the sale of food in supermarkets. But if we try to predict everything about a person, then we are not respecting their individuality, their ability to make their own choices, and to exercise free will. Education theory should make predictions that are helpful for planners, but that respect the freedom and individuality of the personal decisions that each of us make. I have argued elsewhere that this means that Education theory should be based on three principles: ● It should be ethical in allowing scope for individual free will; ● It should be multi-centred in allowing that there is more than one correct way to develop one’s educational career; and ● It should allow for partial autonomy between levels of understanding, between the individual, the schoo...|$|R
