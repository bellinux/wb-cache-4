5|$|The actual {{battle of}} Salamis {{is not well}} {{described}} by the ancient sources, and {{it is unlikely that}} anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across the width of the straits. <b>What</b> <b>follows</b> is more of a discussion than a definitive account.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{accounts}} {{of the origins of}} the Quyllurit'i festival. <b>What</b> <b>follows</b> are two versions: one relates the pre-Columbian origins, and the other the Catholic Church's version as compiled by the priest of the town of Ccatca between 1928 and 1946.|$|E
60|$|And yet often, as I sit {{alone in}} my splendour upon {{the roof of the}} ancient halls or wander through the starlit palace gardens, I call to mind that great catch of fishes in the English sea and of <b>what</b> <b>followed</b> after. I call to mind also my {{prosperity}} and wealth {{as one of the first}} merchants of London Town and <b>what</b> <b>followed</b> after. I call to mind, too, the winning of Blanche Aleys, the lady so far above me in rank and station and <b>what</b> <b>followed</b> after. Then it is that I grow afraid of <b>what</b> may <b>follow</b> after this present hour of peace and love and plenty.|$|R

5|$|Overton was {{decorated}} numerous times during his Korean War tour, however {{many of these}} awards and medals were rescinded following his controversial removal from the country. Additionally, his records were among the 16 to 18 million which were destroyed in the 1973 National Archives fire. Most of Overton's decorations were restored following his 2009 appeal. <b>What</b> <b>follows</b> is an incomplete list of awards confirmed to have been awarded to Overton during his service.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} are {{a sample of}} the basic or widely practiced throws and pins. Many of these techniques derive from Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, but some others were invented by Morihei Ueshiba. The precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles, so <b>what</b> <b>follows</b> are the terms used by the Aikikai Foundation. Note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed, they are not universally taught in numeric order.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{officials}} {{said there were}} 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden. Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors. The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound. Because {{of a lack of}} verifiable information, some of <b>what</b> <b>follows</b> is thinly sourced.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. <b>What</b> <b>follows</b> are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E
