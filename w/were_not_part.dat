5|$|Although Jewish, Levi's {{family did}} not {{practise}} their religion, and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the Jewish community, {{but when she}} was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her religion was listed as Jewish. Religious instruction was compulsory, {{so she had to}} attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she did not wish to attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E

5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as rock and roll, a reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, Blue Demon, Jr., the {{president}} of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, telling them to stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the NWA. NWA Mexico had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, but was ignored by CMLL. The promotion did not directly respond to the latest claim either; the NWA Welterweight Champion, Mephisto, commented, simply stating that the titles belonged to CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship and returned the old title to NWA.|$|E

5|$|The Native Americans that {{attacked}} the group <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of Black Hawk's band of warriors {{but they were}} en route to join that group when the massacre occurred.

Black Hawk asserted that the group was Ho-Chunk and unaffiliated with his band in his autobiography.|$|E
5|$|According to Amineri, {{one of the}} mod's core developers, initial {{versions}} of Long War used changes to the game's configuration file to change content in the game. After other mod makers that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the Long War project discovered how to make changes to the game by directly working with its Unreal Engine, more significant game alterations became possible, and the forums of NexusMods became a hub where such changes were exchanged. Many of the mod's key features, including the increased number of soldiers and the lengthened campaign, first appeared in version beta 1.9, which was released in mid 2013. Shortly after Enemy Within released, Amineri and XMarksTheSpot completed development of a Java-based tool called upkmodder that allowed the team to more effectively manage and implement the changes made by the mod. In the late stages of the mod's development, the team worked directly with the Unreal Development Kit.|$|E

5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma {{if she could}} sense {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E
5|$|Cathay dragon (Formerly Dragonair) {{operated}} {{its first}} commercial flight from Hong Kong to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia in July 1985 with a Boeing 737-200 aircraft, after receiving its air operator's certificate. In 1986, the airline introduced regular passenger services to Guilin, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen in the People's Republic of China, and to Phuket, Thailand. In the following years, the airline's operations expanded to more {{cities in the}} People's Republic of China and to other countries across Asia, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Japan, Nepal, Philippines, the Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korea and Vietnam. Initially, Dragonair operated its passenger services only as regular charter flights; these were passenger flights that were operated by the airline on a programme basis similar to scheduled flights, but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the air services agreement between their respective countries. The airline was granted scheduled services rights in 1990.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{examination}} of the fossil on March 6, 1999 it had already become clear to Currie that {{the left and right}} feet mirrored each other perfectly and that the fossil had been completed by using both slab and counterslab. He also noticed no connection could be seen between the tail and the body. In July 1999, Currie and the Czerkases brought the fossil to the High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility of the University of Texas (Austin) founded and operated by Dr. Timothy Rowe to make CT scans. Rowe, having made the scans on July 29, determined that they indicated that the bottom fragments, showing the tail and the lower legs, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the larger fossil. He informed the Czerkases on August 2 that there was a chance of the whole being a fraud. During a subsequent discussion Rowe and Currie were pressured by the Czerkases to keep their reservations private.|$|E

5|$|For over 62 years CMLL {{controlled}} NWA World Middleweight Championship, {{even after}} leaving the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in the late 1980s. Up until 2010 the NWA more or less ignored CMLL's use of the championship, but in March 2010 Blue Demon Jr., {{the president of the}} newly formed NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, demanding that they stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the organization. NWA Mexico had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, but was ignored by CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship belt and named Averno, the final CMLL-recognized NWA World Middleweight Champion, as the inaugural champion.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E
5|$|The German {{version of}} The Testament of Dr. Mabuse premiered on April 21, 1933, in Budapest, Hungary with a playing time of 124 minutes. The French-language version was {{distributed}} through Europe. A subtitled {{version of the}} French version was released in 1943 with the title The Last Will of Dr. Mabuse in the United States. In 1951, the German version was released in a 75-minute version with the title The Crimes of Dr.Mabuse which featured an English dub. The English subtitles for the 1943 release and the 1952 dub added allusions to Adolf Hitler that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the original script. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was first shown publicly in Germany on August 24, 1961 with a 111-minute running time. In 1973, the unedited German version of the film was released in the United States with the title The Testament of Dr. Mabuse with English subtitles.|$|E

5|$|The plot of Carnivàle {{takes place}} in the 1930s Dust Bowl and {{revolves}} around the slowly converging storylines of a traveling carnival and a Californian preacher. Out of the 17 actors receiving star billing in the first season, 15 were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to 13 main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers are benefited with more flexibility in story decisions. The backgrounds of most characters were fully developed before the filming of Carnivàle began but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>part</b> of the show's visible structure. The audience therefore only learned more about the characters as a natural aspect in the story.|$|E
