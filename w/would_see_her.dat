Mary Rolleston inherited £400 and the piano, her oldest brother received an annual annuity of £20, and Frank Brittan was given the farm, the house and all its contents. William Rolleston was [...] "shocked, hurt and astonished" [...] by the unfairness of this distribution. Contact between the Rollestons and Frank Brittan all but ceased. Much later in life, Mary Rolleston <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> brother briefly once a year on New Year's Day at his home, {{and that was all}} the contact that they had.|$|E

Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men. At 15," [...] Brown said.

Jones told Chrissie Camp (TV Week) that three years on a soap opera was long enough and {{the right time to}} leave. Jones filmed her final scenes with Neighbours in July that year. Camp revealed that Jane's exit storyline <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> receiving bad news about Nell's health and performing a [...] "mercy dash overseas".

500|$|Harriet Jones is {{a fictional}} {{character}} played by Penelope Wilton in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Having worked previously with lead writer {{and executive producer}} Russell T Davies, Wilton was keen to involve herself with his 2005 revival of Doctor Who after he sought to cast her. Jones is introduced in the two-part story [...] "Aliens of London" [...] and [...] "World War Three" [...] as a Member of Parliament who aids the Ninth Doctor against an alien invasion of London. The episode introduces a running joke associated with the character which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> frequently introduce herself by holding up her ID and stating her name and rank; in subsequent episodes this was usually met with the response [...] "Yes, I/we know who you are," [...] even occurring with The Daleks and The Sycorax.|$|E
500|$|The {{end of the}} storyline was criticised by gay advocates after Charlie {{was seen}} having sex with Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) and Joey left Summer Bay alone.

Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> typecast as [...] "the lesbian cop." [...] Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was the first time you got to see Charlie's vulnerable side. (The controversy) blew my mind – I wasn't expecting it at all. I think it was a fantastic storyline because for the first time I got to show the producers and audience what I could do." ...|$|E

500|$|Donna's {{relationship}} with Michael proved unpopular with critics. In an editorial discussing {{the boundaries between}} fiction and reality, The Guardian Scott Murray and Barney Ronay declared their love for Donna, commending the way she [...] "always has time for people" [...] and recommending that she stay away from Michael as she deserves better. Bree Treacy of RTÉ.ie believes that Michael had better chemistry with Donna than with his wife Annalese, however similarly commented {{that he did not}} deserve Donna, never having seen her as more than [...] "a notch on his stethoscope". Following her promotion to ward sister, Treacy hoped that the series producers would give Donna a man who <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> [...] "as more than just a good time girl." [...] Simon criticized Donna for failing to observe correct organ donation protocol in an attempt to win Michael's affection, commenting that she had [...] "thrown her own heart willynilly at the first good-looking doctor she s with an ego the size of Texas." [...] She later branded her [...] "selfish to a fault" [...] for her negative reaction to Kieran's posting to Afghanistan, but opined that Kieran [...] "makes a far more suitable partner for her" [...] than Michael did.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1906 Barrett {{attended}} a suffrage rally in Cardiff and {{was inspired by a}} speech from Nellie Martel to join the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) {{at the end of the}} meeting. By the following year Barrett was active as a WSPU activist and helped organise Adela Pankhurst's meetings in Cardiff and Barry that year, sharing the stage with her as one of the speakers. Barrett spoke on behalf of the WSPU at many meetings, often in Welsh, which conflicted with her role as a schoolteacher as her headmistress disapproved of the publicity, especially after news of Barrett being flour-bombed at a rally in Cardiff Docks made the local papers. In July 1907 Barrett resigned as a teacher and enrolled at the London School of Economics, intending to study economics and sociology and to work towards her DSc. That August she was heavily active for the WSPU, campaigning at the Bury St Edmunds by-election with Gladice Keevil, Nellie Martel, Emmeline Pankhurst, Aeta Lamb and Elsa Gye. Barrett was also active with Adela Pankhurst at Bradford. With her campaign activities over Barrett was free to attend the LSE, which proved useful for attending WSPU activities in nearby Clement's Inn. Over the Christmas period Barrett was again busy campaigning for the WSPU, this time in the lead up to the Ashburton by-election. Shortly afterwards she was asked by Christabel Pankhurst to become a full-time organiser of the WSPU, an offer which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> leave her course at the LSE. Barrett regretted giving up her studies but accepted the position stating, [...] "It was a definite call and I obeyed." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Alice {{appears in}} flashbacks and dream {{sequences}} in {{the remainder of}} the series, during which several previously unknown details about the day she committed suicide are revealed. In season two, Mary Alice {{was the first of the}} housewives to move onto Wisteria Lane, to which she recounts how she met each of them and how they all became friends. In season three, Lynette has a recurring nightmare of the last time she spoke to Mary Alice; while she was reading her blackmail note for the first time on her front lawn, the day she committed suicide. Lynette asks if she is okay, to which Mary Alice says she is and while Lynette knew otherwise, she had groceries that needed refrigeration, so she simply told Mary Alice she <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> later. After a hostage situation at the local grocery store, Lynette has one final dream in which she speaks to Mary Alice and asks how she can help her; she tells her that we can’t prevent what we can’t predict, and to enjoy the beautiful day, as we get so few of them. Afterward, Mary Alice states that this was the last time Lynette would ever dream of her, and for her sake, she is grateful. In season four, Mary Alice appears in two separate flashbacks to when Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) was first living on Wisteria Lane; in [...] "Now You Know", she and Susan knock on Katherine’s door wondering why there is a moving truck outside her house, to which a rattled Katherine says she got a new job in Chicago. In [...] "Free", Mary Alice is shown to have been babysitting Katherine's daughter Dylan (Hailee Denham) the night the child's father returned, to which Katherine looks immediately panicked and Mary Alice apologizes for any wrongdoing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{were told that}} actress Drew Barrymore wanted to guest star in the series and pitched several {{possible}} episodes for her.
