5|$|In 2014, Iran {{started the}} second phase of its {{targeted}} subsidy plan under President Hassan Rohani. Petrol prices <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> 75% from 4,000 to 7,000 rials ($0.16 to $0.28) per litre, which is far from the target price of approx. $0.90 per litre. As a consequence, fuel smuggling and gasoline imports increased again.|$|E
5|$|Some {{complaints}} <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> others {{during the}} construction of the freeway south of SR 94. A proposed drainage basin raised concerns about a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes being located near homes. Caltrans was later ordered by local courts to pay settlements in the millions of dollars to local business owners for undervaluing property taken by eminent domain.|$|E
50|$|The first runestone (DR 282) <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> Ásbjörn and Tumi {{in memory}} of Tumi's two brothers, whereas the last one (DR 283) <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> Ásbjörn {{in memory of}} Tumi.|$|R

5|$|The arena can seat 18,055 for basketball, 17,800 for ice hockey, and 19,300 for concerts. The {{price for}} courtside seats to a Rockets {{game in the}} new arena <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> as much as 50% {{compared}} to prices in the team's old home, while upper-deck seat prices were lowered.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} five pioneer battalions <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the AIF during the war, with one being {{assigned}} {{to each of the}} five infantry divisions that the Australians deployed to the battlefield in France and Belgium. The battalions consisted of four companies, under a headquarters company. To identify the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's personnel, they were issued with a purple and white Unit Colour Patch. The colours were in common with other Australian pioneer battalions, while the horizontal oval shape denoted that the unit was part of the 3rd Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 Johnson married Ms. Barbee of Virginia, {{and they}} had three {{children}}: Leila B. Johnson, William T. Johnson and H. Guy (or Howard H.) Johnson. His wife died in 1880, and his children {{from his first marriage}} <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> their grandparents in Bridgewater, Virginia. In 1882 Johnson married Elizabeth Neale, the daughter of Hamlet V. Neale of Keyser. He and Elizabeth had two children: George N. Johnson and Lucy N. Johnson.

50|$|If {{the issue}} <b>is</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the {{prosecution}}, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable {{doubt that the}} defendant is unfit to plead. If the issue <b>is</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the defence, it need only be proved on the balance of probabilities.|$|R
50|$|According to John Tzetzes the kourotrophos, or nurse of Poseidon was Arne, who denied {{knowing where}} he was, when Cronus came searching; {{according}} to Diodorus Siculus Poseidon <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the Telchines on Rhodes, just as Zeus <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the Korybantes on Crete.|$|R
30|$|This point <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> an {{anonymous}} referee.|$|R
5|$|Other {{factors may}} include Enlightenment {{thinking}} and {{the examples of}} the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.|$|E
5|$|Secondly, quotas {{were raised}} {{to limit the}} ability of workers to overfulfill targets. In the case of time workers, this was {{sometimes}} done by keeping quotas the same but reducing hours; for example, coal miners saw their working day shortened to six hours. Some rises were very steep; {{in the case of}} engineering enterprises, quotas <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> 65 percent.|$|E
5|$|The wooden Pontnewydd aqueduct, {{which was}} prone to the river flowing over its top, was {{replaced}} by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room for the river to flow under it. Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and {{the banks of the}} Kymer canal <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> , to allow the water level to be raised. This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised. At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E
50|$|According to legend Hidehira <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> wolves.|$|R
50|$|In fiscal 2011 {{the average}} minimum wage <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> ¥6. On July 25, 2012 a {{subcommittee}} of the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare's Central Minimum Wages Council decided to recommend that it <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> ¥7. This would raise the average minimum wage from ¥737 to ¥744.|$|R
50|$|Generosa Rand LeGaye <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> {{a single}} mother, Marie Theresa LeGaye. When LeGaye was 10 years old, her mother died. After her mother's death she <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> various relatives. She {{graduated}} from the University of California, Irvine in 1981, and moved to New York to be an artist.|$|R
5|$|After the {{elections}} of 2011, Mirela Holy, who had declared her opposition to the project prior to {{the elections}}, was appointed Minister of Environment and Nature Protection. In 2012 the ministry commissioned four reviews of the EIA. The reviews—one of them supporting the EIA and three disproving the conclusions of the original EIA—were submitted to the Government of Croatia one day after Holy resigned her post, reportedly over an unrelated matter, on 7 June 2012. Objections <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> authors of the EIA that the reviews were not published {{and the names of}} the authors have been kept secret. Prime Minister Zoran Milanović said he wanted to collect opinions from the foremost Croatian, European, and worldwide experts before deciding on the matter, which has been under consideration since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E
5|$|Concerns <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> Antonio Saldías (pen name Don Antonio de Petrel) {{regarding}} {{the appropriateness of}} the date used to celebrate the anniversary of Pichilemu, which commemorated the creation of the commune, on 21 December 1891, a date also used in the coat of arms. Saldías pointed out that, since there was no act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record of date of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes, the date of 24 January 1544, specified in the title of encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro, another conquistador, was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu. The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma.|$|E

5|$|Cycling groups voiced safety {{concerns}} after {{people were injured}} as their bicycle wheels became caught in the track. They reported the road surface around the tracks was crumbling, raising further safety problems. In response, TiE promised to carry out repairs and Edinburgh Trams agreed to fund special training for cyclists., but the repairs were insufficient: in 2017, a woman was crushed to death by a passing bus when her bicycle wheel {{was caught in the}} tracks. Further {{safety concerns}} <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> residents along the routes about the suspension of overhead electric cables from residential buildings, and some property owners refused permission for cables to be attached.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{was born}} in Glendale, California, {{where he and his}} older brother <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> his mother. After his mother remarried, the family {{relocated}} to Ventura, California and then to Grants Pass, Oregon, where Howard attended Grants Pass High School. After graduating, Howard worked in a beer warehouse before moving to Mobile, Alabama with the mother of his daughter, Stephanie. Howard spent several years working as a mechanic for Meineke (supplementing his income by boxing in bars) before joining Taylor Wharton as a pipe cutter, where he trained as a welder. Howard later moved to Cowin Equipment, where he worked as a mechanic and welder.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of York {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 1668 or 1669, but Mary and Anne {{were brought up}} as Anglicans, pursuant to the command of Charles II. They were moved to their own establishment at Richmond Palace, where they <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> their governess Lady Frances Villiers, with only occasional visits to see their parents at St James's or their grandfather Lord Clarendon at Twickenham. Mary's education, from private tutors, was largely restricted to music, dance, drawing, French, and religious instruction. Her mother died in 1671, and her father remarried in 1673, taking as his second wife Mary of Modena, a Catholic who was only four years older than Mary.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} covered in detail by Time, and Arafat's face {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} the 13 December 1968 issue, bringing his image to the world for the first time. Amid the post-war environment, the profiles of Arafat and Fatah <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> this important turning point, and he came to be regarded as a national hero who dared to confront Israel. With mass applause from the Arab world, financial donations increased significantly, and Fatah's weaponry and equipment improved. The group's numbers swelled as many young Arabs, including thousands of non-Palestinians, joined the ranks of Fatah.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E
5|$|The rugby {{competition}} {{took place}} in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium. The original plan was to stage the rugby matches at the São Januário Stadium. However this was scrapped because the club in charge of the venue missed the deadline to present its project. The Organising Committee considered Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which would have had to have been shared with the athletics competitions. It was later announced that the rugby competition will take place in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium, shared with the modern pentathlon. In April 2016 concerns <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the World Rugby head of competitions and performance, Mark Egan, about progress of construction at the temporary 15,000-seater stadium.|$|E
