5|$|When he proves {{unable to}} defeat Data-Sora himself, Pete infects Data-Riku's code with bugs and forces him to fight, putting the datascape {{in danger of}} being totally corrupted. Seeing no alternative, Data-Sora chooses to debug Data-Riku from inside, an act which will cause the datascape to reset if he succeeds, <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> memories. The {{debugging}} process also activates the bug responsible for the data's corruption, which takes the form of Sora's Heartless. Data-Sora destroys the bug while Mickey and the others are returned to their world by Data-Riku before the reset occurs. In a scene exclusive to HD 2.5 ReMix, after Maleficent and Pete take their leave, Maleficent speaks with Pete about the Book of Prophecies, an ancient artifact capable of transcribing events that have yet to take place and even conjuring them, including entire worlds; she resolves to find it, believing it may hold a connection with the datascape and the journal.|$|E
25|$|Of many memorable {{images from}} that day, one is of Moore <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> hands clean {{of mud and}} sweat on the velvet {{tablecloth}} before shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth II as she presented him with the Jules Rimet trophy (World Cup).|$|E
25|$|On Sam's 21st birthday, {{his parents}} behave very strangely, and Sam himself sees hellish visions and {{experiences}} odd events. His father eventually claims that many years ago, {{he was very}} sick, and in return for restoring his health, {{he and his wife}} promised their firstborn child to the Devil (Ray Wise). Although the couple intended to cheat the Devil by not having children, this plan went awry when Satan persuaded their doctor to lie and tell the couple that they could not conceive in exchange for <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> gambling debts clean. Sam was born shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|During the season, Vincent and Cat briefly {{break up}} with each other, due to Vincent having changed so much because of Muirfield <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> memory. Cat starts a {{relationship}} with Gabe, a previous beast, now turned ally, while Vincent starts to date Tori, a wealthy socialite who has discovered that {{she is also a}} Beast. Eventually, after regaining his memories and Tori's death during the season, Vincent realizes that he is still in love with Cat and tries to win her back, but she rejects his advances. However, slowly she starts to realize that she still loves him and they both get back together {{near the end of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|... }} He {{was sent}} to No. 4 Initial Training School at Victor Harbor in South Australia, around 100km south of Adelaide. Miller quickly showed his anti-authoritarian streak in a {{training}} drill in which Miller's instructor asked the recruits to disarm him. The recruits feared that their weekend leave would be cancelled if they succeeded in confiscating their sergeant's rifle, but the sergeant assured them {{that this was not}} the case. Miller volunteered to combat the instructor, and succeeded by tripping him and removing his firearm. The sergeant angrily protested that Miller had tripped him and told Miller to repeat his feat. Miller again tripped the sergeant and disarmed him, this time contemptuously <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> boot on his NCO's shirt and soiling it. The irate instructor cancelled Miller's leave and put him on guard duty, further threatening the other recruits with the same fate for protesting Miller's treatment. However, the recruits protested the ruling with the camp adjutant, who overruled the sergeant, putting him on guard duty instead of Miller.|$|E
500|$|Recording of {{the tracks}} that were to appear on Echo & the Bunnymen began at Conny Plank's studio in Cologne. Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label, WEA Records, were unhappy {{with the results of}} the Norton {{sessions}} with Palmer playing drums. Keen to record again with de Freitas, the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single [...] "Bring on the Dancing Horses". The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs; however, Latham was very specific and exacting, and he would work on one song for as long as a month. Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch. This, along with his heavy drinking, alienated him {{from the rest of the}} band. In a 1995 interview, band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch's treatment, [...] "We just found it all ridiculous. He had people running around behind him, basically <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> arse." [...] McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview: [...] "I knew I was losing it. I was on another planet but then I didn't want to be on the one [...] were on." ...|$|E

He handed it back to Brown and the latter wiped again. A little later, Lehner {{repeated}} the act. Folks, this was something I saw, not something I heard about." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ali {{later said}} in round five {{he could only}} see a faint shadow of Liston {{during most of the}} round, but by {{circling}} and moving frantically he managed to avoid Liston and somehow survive. At one point, Ali was <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> eyes with his right hand while extending his left arm—"like a drunk leaning on a lamppost" [...] Bert Sugar wrote—to keep Liston at bay.|$|E
2500|$|A funerary {{column in}} brick, {{which seems to}} have {{commemorative}} connotations, supports [...] "an infant in fired clay, almost naked, with a crest placed behind him, upset and <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> tears with a cloth". The column is still extant, visible from the chateau {{at the edge of the}} lawn, but Cranga reports that by 1981 the statue had been replaced by a mythical monster; and his own photograph shows the column deeply overgrown with ivy.|$|E
2500|$|Judging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two {{men were}} very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an {{impeccable}} literary taste. In An Uncommon Story he wrote: [...] "Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, Oblomov will be remembered... Another time, as I was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly rose from his divan and departed to his bedroom. 'Old sparrow as I am, you touched me to tears', he said upon his return, <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> eyes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Next are verses {{from the}} Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John {{referring}} to Jesus {{after he was}} flogged by soldiers. Another section shows the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas watching the punishment of Jesus from afar. Christ then receives the cross. The next section shows Jesus on his knees with Simon of Cyrene [...] carrying the cross and followed by a large crowd and soldiers. Saint Veronica appears in front of Christ, <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> face with a cloth. The north and south segments show the falls Jesus suffered while carrying the cross while the three Marys look on.|$|E
2500|$|One of Ryang's classmates. He {{learned early}} that Fanta is a faerie. When Fanta tried {{to wipe his}} memory it was {{uncovered}} that Seho has a multiple-personality disorder consisting of two distinct personalities, which possibly resulted when his twin brother died at birth. [...] This condition prevents Fanta from <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> memory or cutting his line of affinity. [...] His personalities consist of a [...] "geek" [...] Seho with glasses, closed eyes and a quieter disposition and a [...] "cool" [...] Seho with no glasses, open eyes and a wilder personality. In the eleventh book, the [...] "geek" [...] Seho called himself Jun when meeting with Sorim (his girlfriend).|$|E
2500|$|After Never So Few, the film's {{director}} John Sturges cast McQueen in {{his next}} movie, promising to [...] "give him the camera". The Magnificent Seven (1960), in which he played Vin Tanner and co-starred with Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Robert Vaughn, Charles Bronson and James Coburn, became McQueen's first major hit and led to his withdrawal from Wanted: Dead or Alive. McQueen's focused portrayal of the taciturn second lead catapulted his career. His added touches {{in many of the}} shots, such as shaking a shotgun round before loading it, repeatedly checking his gun while in the background of a shot, and <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> hat rim, annoyed costar Brynner, who protested that McQueen was trying to steal scenes. (In his autobiography, Eli Wallach reports struggling to conceal his amusement while watching the filming of the funeral-procession scene where Brynner's and McQueen's characters first meet: Brynner was furious at McQueen's shotgun-round-shake, which effectively diverted the viewer's attention to McQueen.) Brynner refused to draw his gun in the same scene with McQueen, not wanting his character outdrawn.|$|E
