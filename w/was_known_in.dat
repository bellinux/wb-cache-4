5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>in</b> Europe {{during the}} High Middle Ages {{due to the}} usage of guns and explosives by the Mongols and the Chinese firearms experts employed by the Mongols as mercenaries during the Mongol conquests of Europe, {{it was not until}} the Late Middle Ages that European versions of cannons were widely developed. The first cannons introduced into Europe were probably used in Iberia, during the Christian wars against Muslims in the 13th century; their use was also first documented in the Middle East around this time. English cannons first appeared in 1327, and later saw more general use during the Hundred Years' War, when primitive cannons were engaged at the Battle of Crécy in 1346. By the end of the 14th century, the use of cannons was also recorded in Russia, Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. That was because an entirely new class of tachometric bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the setup. The RAF was working on the Automatic Bomb Sight along these lines but development was slow and it had not been accepted for use when the war started. Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E

Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, {{with the possible exception}} of Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>in</b> his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
