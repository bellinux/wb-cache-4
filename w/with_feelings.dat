5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more <b>with</b> <b>feelings</b> of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} patient, {{the partner}} of an injured person {{frequently}} needs support and counseling. It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (such as being placed {{in the role of}} caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people must contend <b>with</b> <b>feelings</b> like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E

40|$|We are {{familiar}} with both pleasant and unpleasant psychotropic effects of movements associated with vestibular stimulation. However, {{there has been no}} attempt to scientifically explore the impact of different kinds of vestibular stimulation on mood states and biomarkers. A sample of 23 healthy volunteers were subjected to a random sequence of three different passive rotational (yaw, pitch, roll) and translational (heave, sway, surge) vestibular stimulation paradigms using a motion-simulator (hexapod). Mood states were measured by means of questionnaires and visual analog scales. In addition, saliva cortisol and α-amylase samples were taken. Compared to a subliminal control paradigm all rotational and two translational stimulations produced significant changes in mood states: Yaw rotation was associated <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> more comfortable, pitch rotation <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> more alert and energetic, and roll rotation <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> less comfortable. Heave translation was associated <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> more alert, less relaxed, and less comfortable and surge translation <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> more alert. Biomarkers were not affected. In conclusion, we provide first experimental evidence that passive rotational and translational movements may influence mood states on a short-term basis and that the quality of these psychotropic effects may depend on the plane and axis of the respective movements...|$|R

Stronger anatomical pathways are correlated with higher long-term self-esteem, while stronger functional connectivity is correlated with higher short-term self-esteem.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at San Diego State University, USA, {{found that}} narcissism revealed {{a positive relationship}} with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making false allegations). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left <b>with</b> <b>feelings</b> of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.|$|E

It was while she trained there under a young Mother Superion, then Sister Katherine, that she first met and befriended the future Sister Sarah, her best friend; Father David Crowe, her future love interest; and Shotgun Mary. It was {{at this time that}} she visited Quagmire High School, also called Ninja High School, though at the time she yet to take her vows and was referred to simply as Shannon and not Sister Shannon.

25|$|In 1901 Balmont and Lokhvitskaya met, apparently, for {{the last}} time. Since then their {{relationship}} has been confined to enigmatically constructed poetic dialogues, full of demands and threats on his part and pleas for mercy on hers. Apparently both were taking their shared self-created world of horror and passion seriously. Balmont was continuously complaining in his letters of being 'possessed', while Lokhvitskaya submerged herself in a quagmire of violent visions which, coupled <b>with</b> <b>feelings</b> of guilt towards her family, might have led to an illness the roots of which were obviously psychosomatic. Some (Alexandrova included) regard the involvement of Valery Bryusov, Balmont's close rival/friend {{to be the most}} damaging factor. The well-publicized fact that Bryusov (who hated Lokhvitskaya, thinking she was trying to 'steal' a friend of his) dabbled in black magic added a gothic touch to the whole affair.|$|E
25|$|This {{album is}} filled <b>with</b> <b>feelings</b> of lethargy, languor and disengagement, yet {{most of the}} tracks sound warm and sweet, {{as opposed to those}} piquant self-centered ones before her motherhood. Reporters noticed that she began to smile more often in public and was not as icy or aloof as before. However, the album was {{released}} during the Asian financial crisis which swept East and Southeast Asia. Wong's old company Cinepoly, which retains the copyright on her previous records, released a Mandarin compilation {{at the same time in}} 1997 to counteract her new EMI album (and indeed outperformed it). Later, Cinepoly would release two compilations each year to compete with Faye's new releases, a tactic which has come under fire from her international fans. Faye Wong did not sell well in Hong Kong, but did quite well in Taiwan and mainland China. Although Wong had garnered some popularity with her 4 previous Mandarin albums, it was really this sweet yet slightly alternative album which had the Mainland Chinese audience listening. Her profile began to rise sharply in Asia.|$|E

J.D.'s undeniable crush on Elliot emerges again, but J.D. instead begins a {{relationship}} with Jordan's sister Danni (Tara Reid), who is also dealing <b>with</b> <b>feelings</b> for her ex. Turk and Carla are engaged and planning their wedding. Turk, along with the Todd and the other surgical residents, deal with new attending surgeon Dr. Grace Miller (Bellamy Young), who dislikes Turk and considers him sexist. Dr. Cox and Jordan are doing well with their relationship and their son Jack, although Dr. Cox develops a schoolboy crush on Dr. Miller. He also struggles {{with the death of}} his best friend. Elliot gets into a serious relationship with Sean Kelly (Scott Foley) and tries to maintain a long-distance relationship while he is in New Zealand for six months. J.D. eventually convinces Elliot to break up with Sean to date him, only to realize, once he has her, that he does not actually love her. Their relationship lasts three days. The season ends with Turk and Carla's wedding, which Turk misses due to surgery and a church mix-up.|$|E
