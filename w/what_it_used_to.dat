25|$|At {{the onset}} of the First World War, the cost of gold was very low and {{therefore}} the pound sterling had high value. But during the First World War, the value of the pound fell alarmingly due to rising war expenses. At the conclusion of the war, the value of the pound was only a fraction of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be prior to the commencement of the war. It remained low until 1925, when the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, restored it to pre-War levels. As a result, the price of gold fell rapidly. While the rest of Europe purchased large quantities of gold from the United Kingdom, there was little increase in her gold reserves. This dealt a blow to an already deteriorating British economy. The United Kingdom began to look to its possessions as India to compensate for the gold that was sold.|$|E

A duet with Jennifer Hudson, [...] "The Future Ain't <b>What</b> <b>It</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Be" [...] is a pessimistic song based upon the myth that Pandora closed her jar before allowing [...] "hope" [...] to escape (the song first appeared on the only album performed by female group Pandora's Box).

500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the funny {{thing about it is}} that the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E

[...] and [...] "The Future Ain't <b>What</b> <b>It</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Be") that originally appeared on Original Sin, Steinman's 1989 concept album with Pandora's Box. Steinman's demo of [...] "In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher Is King" [...] {{was part of}} the preparations for the unrealized Batman: The Musical project. Steinman's [...] "Cry to Heaven" [...] demo was intended for the possibility that Steinman would provide songs for a musical based on the film Cry-Baby. Cry-Baby has since been staged, but without any work from Steinman. [...] "Bad for Good" [...] was featured as the title track on Steinman's 1981 album. Some of the songs on the Bad for Good album were once intended to be a Meat Loaf solo album. [...] "Seize the Night" [...] first appeared as [...] "Carpe Noctem" [...] in the German language musical Tanz der Vampire. It was also performed in English in the 2002 Broadway show called Dance of the Vampires, and demos of the song in English became widely available around that time. [...] "If It Ain't Broke, Break It" [...] first appeared in the MTV film Wuthering Heights, and a recording of the song was released on the soundtrack CD for the film.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the first}} forty {{official}} copies {{are made of}} the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions, periodic verifications using {{a large number of}} replicas—especially the national primary standards, which are rarely used—can convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK. What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other. It is also clear that the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50µg over the last century, and possibly significantly more, in comparison to its official copies. The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world. This relative nature of the changes amongst the world's kilogram prototypes is often misreported in the popular press, and even some notable scientific magazines, which often state that the IPK simply [...] "lost 50µg" [...] and omit the very important caveat of [...] "in comparison to its official copies".Even well respected organizations incorrectly represent the relative nature of the mass divergence as being one of mass loss, as exemplified by , and , and [...] The root of the problem is often the reporters' failure to correctly interpret or paraphrase nuanced scientific concepts, as exemplified by [...] by the Associated Press published on PhysOrg.com. In that AP story, Richard Davis—who used to be the NIST's kilogram specialist and now works for the BIPM in France—was correctly quoted by the AP when he stated that the mass change is a relative issue. Then the AP summarized the nature of issue with this lead-in to the story: [...] "A kilogram just isn't <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. The 118-year-old cylinder that is the international prototype for the metric mass, kept tightly under lock and key outside Paris, is mysteriously losing weight— if ever so slightly". Like many of the above-linked sites, the AP also misreported the age of the IPK, using the date of its adoption as the mass prototype, not the date of the cylinder's manufacture. This is a mistake even Scientific American fell victim to in a print edition. Moreover, there are no technical means available {{to determine whether or not}} the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long-term trends upwards or downwards because their mass [...] "relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000µg over a period of 100 or even 50 years". Given the lack of data identifying which of the world's kilogram prototypes has been most stable in absolute terms, it is equally valid to state that the first batch of replicas has, as a group, gained an average of about 25µg over one hundred years in comparison to the IPK.|$|E

[...] Robert Canning of IGN commented: [...] "It's been argued that Lisa episodes of The Simpsons are basically hit and miss. In my opinion, the boring, unfunny Lisa episodes far outweigh the classic Lisa episodes. 'Lisa the Drama Queen' was one of those episodes that fell into the boring majority. There were a number of reasons for this— too many song montages, for one— but ultimately it boiled down to the uninspired storyline. Worst episode of the Simpsons ever." ...|$|E

2500|$|Metepec is {{the most}} {{important}} tourist destination in the Valley of Toluca because of its handcrafts, even having eight five-star hotels. Eighty percent of the municipality’s economy is based on pottery, commerce and real estate. However, making a living through pottery has become difficult especially for those who create utilitarian items and for those whose work is not famous. Sales and tourism have decreased with some artisans seeing a drop of as much as eighty percent, forcing them into other occupations and making it difficult to maintain the tradition in families. One problem with sales is the existence of copycat projects, including trees of life made in China and elsewhere. Another is vendors in Metepec who sell wares from other states without marking them as such. One of Metepec’s ceramics families is the Ortegas, which has worked in clay for five generations and whose current patriarch, Odilón, is considered a master potter in Metepec. Despite this, the family workshop makes only about thirty percent of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E

Hudson said on The Tyra Banks Show, on February 23, 2007, that she just finished the first song for the album. Hudson also recorded a song she co-wrote with Bill Grainer and Earl Powell called [...] "Stand Up", which was available for preview on her fan website.

[...] For many years, the annual blessing of the fleet, seeking God's blessing for a bountiful harvest and for the fleet's safety, drew large crowds to San Pedro. [...] At its peak {{the blessing of the}} fleet drew 100,000 people and 200 fishing boats.
