500|$|Silver himself {{commented that}} {{inspiration}} came from multiple sources: [...] "I'm inspired by nature and {{by some of}} the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life. I'm inspired by my mentors. I'm inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind just before I wake up. Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some 12 {{minutes into}} the match Rob Newman's floated cross was headed away weakly by a back-pedalling Matth√§us, towards {{the edge of the}} Bayern Munich penalty area. It fell {{straight}} into the path of Jeremy Goss. [...] "I didn't have to adjust my stride, I just hit it on the volley <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> foot. It was as sweet as anything", said Goss. The result was [...] "a screaming 20-yard volley" [...] into the top left hand corner of the net.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{went over}} to Lauren and dragged her down to the water. I held her head under the water. She was {{struggling}} and she knocked me into the water. One of my knees, I think the left went into the water. This pissed me {{off a little bit}} and I opened my knife, it was in my left hand and I stabbed Lauren in {{the left side of the}} neck. I said in my interview that it was the right side of the neck <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left. After a couple of seconds after I stabbed her she stopped moving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{located in}} this island--at least it isn't {{so far as}} I am concerned!" [...] cried Uncle Barney. [...] "If those men bought what they thought were the rights to this island, they were defrauded, that's all! And that has {{absolutely}} nothing to do <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> to this land!" ...|$|R
60|$|Whereupon a {{thoroughly}} British sentiment was aroused in me. Of the liberties {{which had been}} taken <b>with</b> <b>my</b> room, both by this man and by his pursuers, I scarcely thought, but that any one should presume to interfere <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> as an hotel guest angered me! I kept my finger on the knob of the bell; I summoned chambermaid, waiter, valet and boots. It was all to no effect. No one came. The telephone remained silent. The door was {{on the point of}} yielding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hadst thou {{turned out}} of thy bed sooner, O well-beloved lord of this abode of peace," [...] said Diogenes cheerily, [...] "there {{would have been}} less noise outside its portals. Had I not loved thee as I do, I would not have wakened thee from thy sleep, but would have acted in {{accordance}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> and without bringing to thy ken a matter which would vastly have astonished thee in the morning." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the excess}} of my filial tenderness, I poured out a glass for papa, and {{offered it to}} him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand.|$|E

6000|$|... "Avuncular, I want to {{tell you}} {{something}} important. I was raised a Lord Fauntleroy, but I can outpack you, outwalk you, put you on your back, or lick you <b>with</b> <b>my</b> fists <b>right</b> now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Osama joined Japanese side Montedio Yamagata on January 2011. [...] "I {{can score}} goals <b>with</b> <b>my</b> left, <b>right</b> feet or head. I {{improved}} my physical {{strength in the}} Czech Republic. I'm confident of scoring," [...] Elsamni said. He was released in January 2012.|$|R
25|$|Integrity (purple) (Job 27:5): I {{will have}} the moral courage to make <b>my</b> actions {{consistent}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> knowledge of <b>right</b> and wrong.|$|R
60|$|I have {{something}} the matter <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> thumb, and can't (as you see) write plainly. I sent {{a word to}} poor Robert Chambers,[32] and I send my love to Mrs. Wills.|$|E
60|$|Taking a firm hold of {{the roots}} of the seaweed with my left hand, I laid myself down over the brink, and felt <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand under the {{overhanging}} edges of the rock. My right hand found the chain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I would scorn {{to contend}} for empire with him--I would scorn it. Shall {{my left hand}} dispute for {{precedence}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right?</b> Shall my heart quarrel with my pulse? Shall my veins be jealous of the blood which fills them?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In November, Podolski {{spoke about}} his unrest with his current role with Arsenal and {{his lack of}} game time, saying: [...] "Of course I am not happy <b>with</b> <b>my</b> {{situation}} <b>right</b> now.

60|$|In {{the tiniest}} of whispers <b>with</b> <b>my</b> lips <b>right</b> against his smelly head, I {{submitted}} {{the problem to}} Hans, asking him what we should do, go on or go back. He considered a while, then answered in a voice which he contrived to make like the drone of a night beetle.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes a {{confusing}} or ambiguous statement {{made in a}} speech can attract attention in the media. In Angelina Jolie's Best Supporting Actress speech in 2000 for Girl, Interrupted, she said, [...] "I'm so in love <b>with</b> <b>my</b> brother <b>right</b> now", leading to accusations of incest with her brother, actor and producer, James Haven.|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} save time I {{diagnosed}} my case, touched my nose <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> forefinger, struck myself below the knee to make my foot kick, sounded my chest, stuck out my tongue, and asked him the price of cemetery lots in Pineville.|$|E

6000|$|... "You will do me the favour, monsieur, {{to inform}} your friend {{that this was}} no first blood combat, but one a outrance. I fence as well with my left arm as <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right,</b> and if Monsieur de Bardelys will do me the honour to engage again, I shall esteem it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I pardon your ignorance {{concerning}} many {{matters of}} this Northland, for {{you are a}} young man and have travelled little; but, at the same time, I am inclined to agree with you on one thing. The mammoth no longer exists. How do I know? I killed the last one <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own <b>right</b> arm." ...|$|R
500|$|Wings for My Flight was {{generally}} well received. In 1991, the book received the Oregon Book Award for literary nonfiction, co-receiving the award <b>with</b> <b>My</b> Country, <b>My</b> <b>Right</b> to Serve by Mary Ann Humphrey.

60|$|Starbottle. My {{object was}} only precautionary. Owing to the {{position}} in which you--er--persist in holding your weapon, in a line <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> eye, I perceive that a ray of light enters the nipple, and--er--illuminates the barrel. I judge from this {{that you have been}} unfortunate enough to draw the--er--er--unloaded pistol.|$|E
6000|$|So, when Christian George King, who was {{individually}} unpleasant to me besides, comes a trotting {{along the}} sand, clucking, [...] "Yup, So-Jeer!" [...] I had a thundering good mind to let fly at him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right.</b> I certainly {{should have done}} it, but {{that it would have}} exposed me to reprimand.|$|E
6000|$|And oh--ho-o! how {{my spirit}} seemed to gush out through {{my mouth and}} nose, or out {{at the top of}} my head, when the cold water encircled my neck as I lost my footing altogether, and struck out <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, endeavouring the while to support my rod in the left! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wait {{the purpose}} of your mission, my lords," [...] said the Queen, after she had been seated for about a minute without a word-being spoken,--"I wait your message from those you call the Secret Council.-I trust it is a {{petition}} of pardon, and a desire that I will resume my rightful throne, without using <b>with</b> due severity <b>my</b> <b>right</b> of punishing those who have dispossessed me of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Item: I charge my son Diego and my descendants, {{especially}} whoever may inherit this estate, which consists, as aforesaid, of {{the tenth}} of whatsoever may be had or {{found in the}} Indies, and the eighth part of the lands and rents, all which, together <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> and emoluments as admiral, viceroy, and governor, amount to more than twenty-five per cent.; I say, that I require of him to employ all this revenue, {{as well as his}} person and all the means in his power, in well and faithfully serving and supporting their highnesses, or their successors, even to the loss of life and property; since it was their highnesses, next to God, who first gave me the means of getting and achieving this property, although, it is true, I came over to these realms to invite them to the enterprise, and that a long time elapsed before any provision was made for carrying it into execution; which, however, is not surprising, as this was an undertaking of which all the world was ignorant, and no one had any faith in it; wherefore I am by so much the more indebted to them, as well as because they have since also much favored and promoted me.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer <b>with</b> <b>my</b> arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around <b>with</b> <b>my</b> arm <b>right</b> away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should like," [...] said Periwinkle, {{a girl of}} ten, [...] "to {{have the}} power of turning {{everything}} to gold <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> forefinger; but, with my left forefinger, I should want the power of changing it back again, if the first change did not please me.

6000|$|... "That's true, Mum," [...] said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. [...] "That's {{the state}} of the case, for that much I've seen myself." [...] And then they both stared at me, and I, with an {{obtrusive}} show of artlessness on my countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I chucked off {{the belt}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand," [...] he said, [...] "an' made a {{reach for the}} flint with my left. I didn't stop {{to see if the}} belt was off. I thought my right hand had done it--only it didn't. I reached quick, and the belt wasn't all the way off. And then my arm was chewed off." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 10, 2007, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed claimed responsibility, {{before his}} Combatant Status Review Tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, {{for the murder}} of Daniel Pearl.

In a confession read during his Tribunal hearing, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said, [...] "I decapitated <b>with</b> <b>my</b> blessed <b>right</b> hand the head of the American Jew Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan."

5000|$|In 2010, the BBC {{reported}} that Willard Wigan, famed for his microscopic art, had sculpted {{a model of}} Chosen Hill's St Bartholomew's church on a grain of sand {{that he had taken}} from its churchyard.
