Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E

40|$|Children <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> {{frequently}} experience {{impairment in}} the school setting, {{but we do not}} yet understand how unique these struggles are to children <b>with</b> primary <b>pain</b> conditions compared to peers <b>with</b> disease-related <b>pain</b> or those without chronic pain symptoms. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine school functioning, defined as school attendance rates, overall quality of life {{in the school}} setting, and school nurse visits among adolescents <b>with</b> primary <b>pain</b> conditions, those <b>with</b> juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) -related pain, and healthy peers. Two hundred and sixty adolescents participated in the study, including 129 <b>with</b> primary <b>pain</b> conditions, 61 <b>with</b> JIA, and 70 healthy comparison adolescents. They completed self- and parent-reported measures of school function. Findings show that as a group, youth <b>with</b> primary <b>pain</b> conditions reported more school absences, lower quality of life in the school setting, and more frequent school nurse visits compared to both adolescents <b>with</b> JIA-related <b>pain</b> and healthy peers. We conclude that compared to those who experience pain specific to a disease process, adolescents <b>with</b> primary <b>pain</b> conditions may face unique challenges in the school setting and may require more support to help them succeed in school in spite of pain...|$|R

At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability.

40|$|Chronic pain is a {{significant}} health-care problem. This review aims to critically analyse occupational therapy services for people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> and identify significant factors influencing the future development of occupational therapy services for people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain.</b> A broad range of literature is reviewed and analysed using causal layered analysis, a post-structural critical futures methodology. This layered analysis moves through four layers of analysis; the litany layer, the social causes layer, the worldview analysis layer and the grand myth and metaphor layer. This layered analysis revealed three significant factors shaping the future development of occupational therapy services for people with chronic pain: {{the influence of the}} biopsycho-social model within health-care services for people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain,</b> occupational therapy philosophy and the social construction of people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain.</b> Recommendations for future research and practice derived from this analysis include the need to research the effectiveness of occupation-based interventions for people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain,</b> the significance of client-centred occupational therapy and valuing of clients' narratives to avoid pervasive negative social constructions of people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> influencing occupational therapy practice. This critical analysis has made occupational therapy services for people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> problematic in order to generate reflection, discussion and new insights. This analysis deconstructs contemporary occupational therapy philosophy and practice and therefore provides a new perspective on occupational therapy for people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain...</b>|$|R

5|$|For those <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> {{localized}} to {{the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although {{only a few of}} those who have spinal fusion experience good results. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of Australian physiotherapists who see people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> {{as part of their}} daily practice. It has been established in the literature that Australian physiotherapists do not manage people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> well; however, the reasons for this are not well understood. This study aimed to explore this phenomenon through a qualitative approach that generated data about the perceptions of physiotherapists in regard to caring for people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain.</b> Fourteen physiotherapists were interviewed using a semistructured interview approach. The results indicate that the therapists experience emotional responses to people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain,</b> which lead to difficulties in being able to successfully provide effective care. These findings also provide the beginnings of a framework that may support physiotherapists in engaging more successfully with people <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain...</b>|$|R

5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E
5|$|The 1130 Pipe Roll {{noted that}} Pain was a royal justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke. Besides the {{ordinary}} court, Pain also heard cases {{relating to the}} forest law in those counties. The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it. Also in 1130, Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric. The Diocese of Hereford had been vacant {{since the death of}} Richard de Capella in August 1127, and the king consulted <b>with</b> <b>Pain</b> and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—Robert de Bethune, the prior of Llanthony Priory. In 1132 Pain was present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry. Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134. As lord of Caus, Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding. Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.|$|E

40|$|Offspring {{of parents}} <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> {{may be at}} risk for poorer {{outcomes}} than offspring of healthy parents. The objective of this research was to provide a comprehensive mixed-methods systematic synthesis of all available research on outcomes in offspring of parents <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain.</b> A systematic search was conducted for published articles in English examining pain, health, psychological, or family outcomes in offspring of parents <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain.</b> Fifty-nine eligible articles were identified (31 population-based, 25 clinical, 3 qualitative), including offspring from birth to adulthood and parents <b>with</b> varying chronic <b>pain</b> diagnoses (eg, mixed pain samples, arthritis). Meta-analysis was used to synthesize the results from population-based and clinical studies, while meta-ethnography was used to synthesize the results of qualitative studies. Increased pain complaints were found in offspring of mothers and of fathers <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> and when both parents had chronic pain. Newborns of mothers <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> {{were more likely to have}} adverse birth outcomes, including low birthweight, preterm delivery, caesarian section, intensive care admission, and mortality. Offspring of parents <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> had greater externalizing and internalizing problems and poorer social competence and family outcomes. No significant differences were found on teacher-reported externalizing problems. The meta-ethnography identified 6 key concepts (developing independence, developing compassion, learning about health and coping, missing out, emotional health, and struggles communicating with parents). Across study designs, offspring of parents <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain</b> had poorer outcomes than other offspring, although the meta-ethnography noted some constructive impact of having a parent <b>with</b> chronic <b>pain.</b> © 2015 International Association for the Study of Pain...|$|R
