40|$|We are {{witnessing}} {{the beginnings of}} what could well be significant change in Myanmar. Elections in November 2010 were quickly followed by the release of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, then by the resignation of Senior-General Than Shwe, dissolution of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the opening of parliament, and the inauguration <b>of</b> <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein</b> as President on 30 th March 2011. <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein</b> 2 ̆ 7 s inauguration speech called for national reconciliation {{and an end to}} corruption, promised a more market-oriented economy, and vowed to create employment opportunities. He also pledged to develop the health and education sectors in cooperation with international organisations, and to alleviate poverty. While some fear this may only be rhetoric, a growing number of indications suggest that major political and economic reform may indeed be getting underway. This paper traces these recent developments and the possibility of significantly improved international development cooperation in Myanmar, particularly as it affects the prospects of poverty alleviation efforts and cooperation with Western INGO and multilateral agencies. It analyses the implications of this reform on international development assistance and cooperation from the perspectives of humanitarian needs, international relations theory, development theory, and political philosophy...|$|R

Neighboring Bangladesh donated $800,000 worth of medicine, water kits, and other supplies. Assistance from other countries included $775,000 from the United Kingdom, $142,202 from nearby Thailand, $100,000 from the Singapore Red Cross, and $300,000 from China.|$|R

Commander-in-chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, also took to his Facebook to congratulate Suu Kyi, vowing that the Tatmadaw will co-operate with the new government following the transition. This was after a meeting conducted within the Tatmadaw's top ranks.US President Barack Obama and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Suu Kyi on her victory and praised <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein</b> for his organisation of the election. Suu Kyi also received calls from French President François Hollande, British Prime Minister David Cameron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the remarkable political transition underway in Myanmar/Burma since the inauguration <b>of</b> President <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein</b> {{at the end}} of March 2011. It begins with the historical background and the political context and then addresses the main features of the economy, highlighting current performance, major reforms, and key issues. It concludes by characterising the progress to date as verging on the miraculous, while stressing that future progress is highly uncertain. The next two years leading up to a national election in 2015 are unlikely to be as easy as the past two. Outsiders can be most helpful by giving senior officials more space to concentrate on policy formulation and implantation...|$|R

When the nominations for the 2013 Peace Prize closed in February, among the 15 or so names mentioned as possible laureates was the "reformist President <b>of</b> Myanmar," U <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein.</b> That is an eventuality almost no one could have foreseen three years ago and indicates the relative progress Burma has made from the dark days of a long, naked and very oppressive military rule.

40|$|Myanmar has {{implemented}} a wide-ranging set of reforms as it embarks on a remarkable top-down transition from five decades of authoritarian rule, argues this report. This report examines the real {{changes that have}} been taking place {{during the first year}} in office <b>of</b> President <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein.</b> Addressing the nation on 1 March, he made clear that the goal is to introduce “genuine democracy” and that there is still much more to be done. This ambitious agenda includes further democratic reform, healing bitter wounds of the past, rebuilding the economy and ensuring the rule of law, as well as respecting ethnic diversity and equality. To consolidate and build on what has been achieved and increase the likelihood that benefits flow to all its citizens, Myanmar now needs the international community to seek opportunities for greater engagement rather than more reasons why sanctions should be sustained. As the European Union (EU) approaches a key decision point in late April on whether to renew sanctions, the value of the coercive measures must be reconsidered...|$|R
5000|$|After his death, Myanmar Army {{claimed that}} the {{reporter}} was a communications officer for the political wing of the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army’s (DKBA). Nineteen days after his death, the army sent an unsigned email to Myanmar's Interim Press Council saying he was shot while trying to escape. However, human rights groups have {{said that he was}} probably killed for reporting openly on the military. Myanmar National Human Rights Commission, under the command <b>of</b> then-president <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein,</b> opened an investigation on this incident. The DKBA denied that Aung Kyaw Naing was working for them and activists and fellow journalists have also dismissed the army’s version of events. His body was exhumed on 5 November 2014 showing that the journalist was shot five times and that his body showed signs of torture including a broken jaw, a caved-in skull, several teeth missing, broken arms and swelling on the torso indicating broken ribs. [...] “The only way I could tell that it was my husband was because of his height," [...] said Naing’s wife.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the inauguration}} <b>of</b> President <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein</b> in March 2011, Myanmar has adopted {{remarkable}} democratic reforms in {{a transition from}} military to democratic rule. Informed by the literature on democratic transitions, this thesis examines which factors motivated Myanmar’s military regime to commence on a transition towards democracy. This examination of Myanmar’s democratic transition is structured around an identified division between competing arguments within the literature on democratic transitions. One group of scholars emphasise the importance of internal factors as decisive when authoritarian regimes transition towards democracy, while another group of scholars emphasise external factors. Through a deductive research strategy, concepts emphasising internal and external factors will {{be applied to the}} case of Myanmar’s democratic transition, in order to comprehensively assess which of these two competing arguments best explain Myanmar’s democratic transition. I found that internal factors are best applied to the case of Myanmar’s regime-controlled transition. A political momentum for regime softliners to instigate democratic reforms was identified, as perceived threats had decreased, key interests were safeguarded and an elite pact was established between President <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein</b> and Aung San Suu Kyi. I found that external factors were unable to explain Myanmar’s democratic transition, as there was not found a link between democratisation and socioeconomic development, and CSOs had a minimal impact on instigating democratic reforms. Moreover, I found that while economic sanctions were unable to create regime change through economic punishment, they indirectly impacted the democratic transition through increased dependence on China...|$|R

40|$|Myanmar {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{connected}} countries in the world, with an estimated Internet penetration at just over one per cent. The country was ruled by a rigid military regime for half a century, who had a firm grip on the media and brutally cracked down upon any political dissent. In 2011, in a surprise move, a process of reform and a transition towards democracy began under the leadership <b>of</b> President <b>Thein</b> <b>Sein.</b> As a result, foreign investment in the country’s lagging telecom sector is now emerging. This thesis is a case study that partly aims to identify the major challenges facing Internet freedom {{as it relates to the}} human rights discourse and partly explores how two foreign telecom companies, Telenor and Ooredoo, are approaching responsible investment as they enter the country. Methodologically, the study is based on interviews, some of which were conducted during a two months field visit in Myanmar in 2013, and thorough document analysis. The research concludes that the major challenges facing Internet freedom in Myanmar are a deficit legal framework and the absence of digital literacy, which has contributed to irresponsible practices of hate speech in the online environment. Both Ooredoo and Telenor demonstrate an awareness of the complexities in Myanmar, whilst Telenor has a stronger formal commitment to respecting human rights. ...|$|R
