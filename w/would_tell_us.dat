25|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{can be made}} with an index. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a sparse index). This auxiliary index would be 1% {{of the size of the}} original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same disk block. The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.|$|E
500|$|Because Johnston was {{believed}} to be safe at the ColdwaterII observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died [...] "doing what he wanted to do." [...] His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, [...] "Not many people get to do what they really want to do in this world, but our son did.... He <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> he may never get rich but he was doing what he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see." [...] Dr. Stephen Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he [...] "was very good at his work".|$|E

2500|$|The band made a demo tape but, {{instead of}} mailing {{the tape to}} record companies, they would go in and {{personally}} deliver it. They would demand the companies play it; according to Dave Gahan, [...] "most of them <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> to fuck off. They'd say 'leave the tape with us' and we'd say 'it's our only one'. Then we'd say goodbye and go somewhere else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kipling {{referred}} to such conflicts, for example: [...] "In the afternoon [...] before {{we took our}} sleep, she (the Portuguese ayah, or nanny) or Meeta (the Hindu bearer, or male attendant) <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> stories and Indian nursery songs all unforgotten, and we were sent into the dining-room after we had been dressed, with the caution 'Speak English now to Papa and Mamma.' So one spoke 'English', haltingly translated out of the vernacular idiom that one thought and dreamed in".|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{difficult}} shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there. Mesa remembers, [...] "Bruce was cussing and swearing {{some of the time}} because you had to work on the number system. Sam <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes". Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, {{a former}} {{director}} of the Penn State Confucius Institute, Eric Hayot, said he suspected that the Confucius Institute might not have been providing enough of a return on Penn State's investment. [...] "I will say that in my experience as CI director one of the major frustrations with the relationship was that we consistently had more ambitious ideas for the ways CI funding could be used", such as research projects proposed by Penn State professors on topics concerning the environment, science, and politics. He said the Hanban regularly rejected such proposals [...] "too far outside the official CI ambit (which they <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> was mainly 'cultural')," [...] "A lot of what the Hanban wanted us to do didn’t make sense given our institution, faculty population, and student population," [...] said Professor Hayot, who was not involved in the CI contract negotiations this summer. [...] "Had they been flexible, it would have helped Confucius Institute succeed here." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Bloom {{published}} The Western Canon, {{a survey}} of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focusing on 26 works he considered sublime and representative of their nations and of the Western canon. Besides analyses of the canon's various representative works, the major concern of the volume is reclaiming literature from those he refers to as the [...] "School of Resentment", the mostly academic critics who espouse a social purpose in reading. Bloom believes that the goals of reading must be solitary aesthetic pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal held by [...] "forces of resentment" [...] of improving one's society, which he casts as an absurd aim, writing: [...] "The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading Shakespeare is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools." [...] His position is that politics have no place in literary criticism: a feminist or Marxist reading of Hamlet <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> something about feminism and Marxism, he says, but probably nothing about Hamlet itself.|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence {{had first}} {{arrived at the}} Spade Ranch in 1909 {{at the age of}} {{thirteen}} and grew up observing and working for its owners. In 1908 Bixby's father James, an eastern professor who had moved west for a position at the Spade School, filed on and moved to a section of land four miles (6km) east of the Spade Ranch Headquarters. On March 3, 1909 the rest of the Bixby family arrived at the depot in Ellsworth. From the back of the wagon, as they freighted north from Ellsworth, Lawrence led their milk cow, Old Roanie, and as they passed the Spade Ranch store, Mike Peterson saw them from the front porch. The Spade Foreman laughed when he saw the Bixby piano in the wagon. [...] "I'll just give them six months," [...] he said. Bixby's mother Jennie worked as a ranch cook at the Spade Headquarters Cookhouse. Lawrence would later recall, [...] "Every time some old drunken cook drank up the extract, the foreman would send someone after mother. I used to go up and help her at the cookhouse. I rode Old Plunger and had an eleven dollar Sears Roebuck saddle." [...] In March 1909 James took Lawrence to a cattle sale near Hay Springs, Nebraska. There they bought 28 head of heifers for $467.00. This was the start of Bixby's herd {{and with the help of}} a neighbor they trailed the cattle south for the Spade. They stayed the first night at Newton's Ranch and the next at Sam Green's. [...] "Mr. Green couldn't read nor write," [...] Lawrence wrote, [...] "but he <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> wonderful stories about Quantrill's Raiders. We stopped at the Spade and branded our heifers with the J Lazy B but before long Newton came with the sheriff and said he was short two white-faced heifers. We had no way to prove what we knew had happened, so we had to see them go". James chose the tranquil name of Cloverleaf Ranch for their new homestead but in the first year a rattlesnake bit their dog Spot, James killed a wolf and a neighbor threatened to contest Lawrence's sister Ina's homestead filing unless they gave him a cow, calf and a spool of wire.|$|E
