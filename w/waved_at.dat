R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E
5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E

25|$|Caution {{number seven}} waved around lap 220, after David Gilliland turned Alex Bowman into the wall. Earnhardt, Allmendinger, and Kurt Busch stayed out, but {{everyone}} else pitted, with Logano coming off of pit road first. After another quick caution and restart for debris, Kurt Busch {{took the lead}} from Earnhardt on lap 243, and Johnson took over from Busch two laps later. The ninth caution <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> lap 250 after Ryan Truex go turned into the wall, {{and all of the}} leaders made pit stops. Kenseth, however, stayed out and reassumed the lead, with Tony Stewart taking second. Johnson and Earnhardt would come out of pit road first to restart third and fourth, respectively. Earnhardt took the lead on lap 260, Johnson took over once again on lap 265, and then Clint Bowyer charged to the front and took the lead on lap 284 but gave it back to Johnson four laps later and faded back a bit. Meanwhile, Kenseth and Stewart, who both stayed out during the previous caution, would fall back quickly, with Kenseth being lapped on lap 304 and Stewart losing a lap ten laps later. Other drivers had problems as well, with Alex Bowman cutting a tire and Denny Hamlin getting a windshield tear-off stuck over the opening to his left-front brake duct. Lap 316 saw the tenth caution as Joe Nemechek slammed the wall, and all of the leaders pitted and retained their positions. The eleventh caution flew on lap 341 as 20th-place Kyle Larson spun out of turn two, and the leaders pitted once again, with Johnson and Bowyer keeping their first and second-place positions. Bowyer nosed ahead on the restart and led a lap, but Johnson retook the lead the next lap as another caution waved for debris. Edwards would nose ahead on the next restart but fail to lead a lap before Johnson pulled away. The 13th caution flew on lap 411 as Brad Keselowski spun Martin Truex, Jr. in turn two, and on the ensuing pit stops, an exiting Edwards hit an entering Matt Kenseth, spinning Kenseth around backwards into his pit stall. Johnson retained the lead on the restart, ahead of Bowyer and Edwards. Kurt Busch would then move up second and challenge Johnson but fell back and was passed by Bowyer. Bowyer then chased Johnson down, and, after a slip by Johnson, took the lead on lap 449. On lap 459, Carl Edwards spun to bring out the 14th caution, and Bowyer fell back to tenth during pit stops, allowing Johnson to retake the lead ahead of Joey Logano. Johnson barely retained the lead on the lap 465 restart, but began to pull away as Kurt Busch slipped into second. Busch would then run down and pass Johnson in about five laps, but Johnson would once again retake the lead on lap 482, with that pass setting a new track record with 32 lead changes. Busch retook the lead on lap 488 (the 33rd lead change) and held off Johnson to break a winless drought dating back to the 2011 AAA 400, ironically another race that Johnson led the most laps in but was beaten late by Busch. Earnhardt finished third, Joey Logano fourth, Marcos Ambrose fifth, and Matt Kenseth sixth.|$|E

500|$|The {{candidates}} <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> {{the crowd}} of 3,000 which had come to meet the plane, and rode together, with Nixon in place of honor, to a rally at City Island Stadium as Eisenhower chatted to Nixon as if the crisis had never occurred. At the stadium, Eisenhower introduced Nixon as a [...] "colleague" [...] who had been subject to [...] "a vicious and unprincipled attack" [...] but who had [...] "vindicated himself" [...] and who [...] "stood higher than ever before". The presidential candidate finished by reading two telegrams, one from Nixon's mother assuring the general of her son's integrity, and the second from Summerfield stating that the RNC had voted unanimously to retain Nixon on the ticket. Nixon then spoke, telling the crowd that {{this was one of}} two moments when he was most proud to be an American; the other had been at the victory parade in New York in 1945, when he had seen General Eisenhower go by. He called the Wheeling rally [...] "the greatest moment of my life".|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the Royal Serbian Army had only three planes, {{one of which was}} piloted by Tomić. His plane was quite primitive even for 1914. Misha Glenny, a journalist who has written extensively on the Balkans, likens it to [...] "a box kite on perambulator wheels". At the beginning of the war, Tomić was attached to the 1st Danube Division. On the afternoon of 12 August 1914, he flew a reconnaissance mission over Šabac, and disclosed to the Serbian High Command that, contrary to initial reports, the Austro-Hungarians had not set up pontoon bridges on the Sava and were attempting to cross the river with boats. On 15 August, Tomić encountered an enemy plane while conducting a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian aviator initially <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> Tomić, who waved back. The enemy pilot then took a revolver and began shooting at Tomić's plane. Tomić produced a pistol of his own and fired back. He swerved away from the Austro-Hungarian plane and the two aircraft eventually parted ways. This incident is considered the first recorded dogfight of the war. Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed. The Serbians equipped their planes with [...] Schwarzlose MG M.07/12 machine guns, six 100-round boxes of ammunition and several bombs. The first armed Serbian plane was given the name OЛУЈ (Oluj), or [...] "storm". It was mostly flown by Tomić.|$|E
500|$|The {{conditions}} on the grid were dry and sunny before the race with an air temperature between [...] and a track temperature ranging from [...] A record-breaking 263,500 people attended the race. The French tricolour was <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> 15:00 Central European Summer Time (...) , by the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company Bill Ford to start the race, led by starting pole sitter Jani. Fifty five cars planned to take the start following {{the withdrawal of the}} No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette, but the No. 23 Nissan missed the opening laps while undergoing repairs to its clutch. Bernhard overtook Jani on the first lap while the trio of Audi cars were able to pass the No. 19 Porsche {{by the end of the}} second lap. The top six cars remained within a few seconds of each other as the group pulled away from the Toyota drivers. Duval lost third place to teammate Lotterer after battling with Jani through traffic for second position. The first hour of the race ended with the first retirement as the No. 92 Manthey Porsche began leaking oil and spun at the first chicane of the Mulsanne Straight. Despite resuming driver Patrick Pilet pulled to the side of the track further down the Mulsanne Straight as the engine compartment soon caught fire. The No. 42 Strakka Dome-Nissan of Jonny Kane and Alexandre Imperatori in the No. 13 Rebellion car were caught off guard by Pilet's oil and collided with one another in the chicane, stranding the Rebellion in the gravel trap while the Dome returned to the pit lane for repairs.|$|E

500|$|Magnussen ran wide {{onto the}} first-turn run-off area on lap 38 but rejoined without spinning, and Vergne {{went off the}} track at the second corner. Vettel ran wide off the circuit and into the gravel trap at the S-turns during that lap, {{allowing}} Button to close in on him. Ricciardo closed the gap to Button that lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the fastest overall lap time of the race during the 39th lap, completing a circuit of one minute and 51.600 seconds. DRS was disabled on lap 41 because weather conditions continued to deteriorate. Visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover; drivers were dazzled by lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to pass Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. He passed Button at the hairpin to move into fourth position on the 42nd lap, and Button made a pit stop for full wet tyres. Sutil lost control of his car due to aquaplaning, spun and collided with the outside tyre barrier {{at the top of}} the hill at Dunlop Curve on the lap. Double yellow flags were <b>waved</b> <b>at</b> the corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a tractor crane that lap and turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at [...] on lap 43, veering right towards the run-off area outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his fail-safe system did not work because the settings of his brake-by-wire system were incompatible.|$|E
