Trainee Skye is frustrated when Coulson refuses to tell the team what the information is, based on their clearance level. At The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility run by Agent Victoria Hand, it is revealed that a South Ossetian separatist group has built a weapon called the Overkill device, which uses sonic vibrations to trigger other weapons from great distances. Ward, a field specialist, and Agent Leo Fitz, a weapons technology specialist, are tasked <b>with</b> <b>finding</b> and disabling the device within 24 hours, before the separatists use it to declare independence from Russia and Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Following Operation Kraai in 1948, {{in which}} Dutch forces conquered the republican capital at Yogyakarta and {{captured}} {{much of the}} Sukarno government, Soeman was made commander of the guerrilla forces in Riau. Aside from continuing the fight, he was tasked <b>with</b> <b>finding</b> new fighters to support the republican cause. In this mission, he was aided in part by his extensive networks as a long-term schoolteacher, and many of Soeman's fighters were former students of his. Though his troops were underarmed, Soeman led them into combat against Dutch-allied indigene troops several times.|$|E

Sumida strongly suspected that the saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the prison to catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief suspect was British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E

Quan reveals that Chan's location and abilities were leaked by the hacktivist group Rising Tide. Skye, a new civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee, was once a member of the Rising Tide. She traces the hack that released the information back to Miles Lydon, her secret boyfriend and Rising Tide contact.

50|$|Most {{patients}} with ETV6-ACSL6-related disease present <b>with</b> <b>findings</b> similar to eosinophilia, hypereosinophila, or chronic eosinophilic leukemia; at least 4 cases presented <b>with</b> eosinophilia plus <b>findings</b> {{of the red}} blood cell neoplasm, polycythemia vera; three cases resembled acute myelogenous leukemia; and one case presented <b>with</b> <b>findings</b> of a combined Myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm. Best treatments for ETV6-ACSL6-related disease are unclear. Patients with the polycythemia vera form of the disease have been treated by reducing the circulating red blood cell load by phlebotomy or suppressing red blood cell formation using hydroxyurea. Individual case studies report that ETV6-ACSL6-associated disease is insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Best treatment currently available, therefore, may involve chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantion.|$|R

5|$|Kepler-4 {{is named}} for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA {{telescope}} tasked <b>with</b> <b>finding</b> Earth-like planets that transit their stars as seen from Earth. As the previous three planets that Kepler confirmed had already been confirmed by other finds, Kepler-4 and its planet {{were the first to}} be discovered by the Kepler team. The star and its system were announced in Washington, D.C. at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010, along with Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. Of the presented planets, Kepler-4b was the smallest, around the size of planet Neptune. The discovery of Kepler-4b and the other planets presented at the AAS meeting helped to confirm that the Kepler spacecraft was indeed functional.|$|E
5|$|Later on 2 May, {{the remains}} of Hitler, Braun, and two dogs (thought to be Blondi and her offspring, Wulf) were {{discovered}} in a shell crater by {{a unit of the}} Red Army intelligence agency SMERSH tasked <b>with</b> <b>finding</b> Hitler's body. Stalin was wary of believing Hitler was dead, and restricted the release of information to the public. The remains of Hitler and Braun were repeatedly buried and exhumed by SMERSH during the unit's relocation from Berlin to a new facility in Magdeburg. The bodies, along with the charred remains of propaganda minister Goebbels, his wife Magda, and their six children, were buried in an unmarked grave beneath a paved section of the front courtyard. The location was kept secret.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team was tasked <b>with</b> <b>finding</b> a suitable actor {{for the role}} of the Doctor. Most notably, they approached film stars Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson for the role. By the time Mal Young had suggested actor Christopher Eccleston to Davies, Eccleston was one of only three left in the running for the role: the other two candidates are rumoured in the industry to have been Alan Davies and Bill Nighy. His involvement in the programme was announced on 20 March 2004 following months of speculation. In the April 2004 issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Davies announced that Eccleston's Doctor would indeed be the Ninth Doctor, relegating Richard E. Grant's Shalka Doctor to non-official status. Russell T Davies revealed that Eccleston asked for the role in an e-mail.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} {{in light of}} his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned <b>with</b> <b>finding</b> more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E
5|$|Treasurer of the United States Francis E. Spinner {{has been}} {{credited}} <b>with</b> <b>finding</b> {{the solution to}} the shortage of coinage: he created postage currency (which led into the use of Fractional currency). Postage (or postal) currency was the first of five issues of US Post Office fractional paper money printed in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations and issued from 21 August 1862 through 27 May 1863. Spinner proposed using postage stamps, affixed to Treasury paper, with his signature on the bottom (see illustration below). Based on this initiative, Congress supported a temporary solution involving fractional currency and on 17 July 1862 President Lincoln signed the Postage Currency Bill into law. The intent, however, was not that stamps should be a circulating currency.|$|E
