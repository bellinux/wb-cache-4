25|$|Locus {{of control}} {{generated}} much research {{in a variety}} of areas in psychology. The construct is applicable to such fields as educational psychology, health psychology and clinical psychology. Debate continues whether specific or more global measures of locus of control <b>will</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more useful in practical application. Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as self-efficacy.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{varieties}} of eliminative materialism, but all maintain that our common-sense [...] "folk psychology" [...] badly misrepresents {{the nature of}} some aspect of cognition. Eliminativists such as Patricia and Paul Churchland argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence-like, the non-linguistic vector/matrix model of neural network theory or connectionism <b>will</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a much more accurate account of how the brain works.|$|E

500|$|In {{the context}} of materialist {{understandings}} of psychology, eliminativism stands in opposition to reductive materialism [...] which argues that mental states as conventionally understood do exist, and that they directly correspond to the physical state of the nervous system. [...] An intermediate position is revisionary materialism, which will often argue that the mental state in question <b>will</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somewhat reducible to physical phenomena—with some changes needed to the common sense concept.|$|E
500|$|Commerce Square {{was praised}} for its design of two towers {{surrounding}} a plaza. The Philadelphia Inquirer said [...] "Its most positive aspect {{is that it}} avoids the developers' cliches of atriums and shopping malls and makes a real urban place. It expresses great confidence in Philadelphia, and even more important, in {{the whole idea of}} living in cities." [...] Renowned Philadelphia urban planner Edmund N. Bacon praised Commerce Square and its plaza by saying [...] " [...] sensitivity for urban design is beautifully demonstrated by his design for the lobby level, including the splendid garden, of Commerce Square at 20th and Market streets, which I think <b>will</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the finest commercial projects to be built in this century." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata named Twin Spica, because of its nostalgic story, as one of five manga series which highlight the dream of reaching space. While assessing the series for licensing in English, Vertical marketing director Ed Chavez, a fan of science fiction, found its story [...] "technically sound" [...] and noted it as [...] "possibly one of the most heartfelt series I've read in ages". He hoped that the series would rank in top 10 of The New York Times Graphic Books Best Seller List for manga and believed that it would make Vertical a [...] "known name, not only amongst better comic shops and independent book stores, but also with anime fans and casual graphic novel readers". While the series was originally published in a seinen magazine, Chavez expected that it would also appeal to fans of shōjo manga. He believed that the word seinen [...] "means adult and does not make reference to gender". He hoped Twin Spica <b>will</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a financial success and enable Vertical to fund future licenses of classic works by Osamu Tezuka and the Forty-Niners. The first volume in English was listed by Publishers Weekly {{as one of the most}} anticipated graphic novels of 2010.|$|E
