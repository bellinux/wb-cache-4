5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

During {{his time in}} Rishikesh, Lennon decided to write a song about the recent wave of social upheaval. He recalled, [...] "I thought it was about time <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> about it , the same as I thought it was about time we stopped not answering about the Vietnamese war. I {{had been thinking about}} it up in the hills in India." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his rookie}} year, Doby hit 5-for-32 in 29 games. He played four games {{at second base}} and one each at first base and shortstop. Throughout the season he talked with Robinson via telephone, the two {{encouraging}} each other. [...] "And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn't challenge anybody or cause trouble—or we'd both {{be out of the}} big leagues, just like that. We figured that if <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> out, we would ruin things for other black players." [...] After his rookie season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948. He was the first black player to join the league.|$|E

While discussing the decision to create an independent record label, Rodríguez explained [...] "I can't deny <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> with different labels, but we didn't find anything favorable. Labels are going through tough times {{and we decided to}} brave it on our own." [...] Many of the songs on the album were written and performed during the band's extensive touring beginning in 2007, and the songs went through numerous transformations during this time. Before the album's official release, the band posted songs on the internet, including [...] "La Complicidad", which became a radio hit in Puerto Rico. La Dulzura debuted at number five on Billboards Top Latin Albums Chart.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Kent {{continued}} {{his role as}} Executive Producer, while Erika Hossington remained as Series Producer. This series consisted of 43 episodes. As the show built towards its thirtieth anniversary in 2016, Hossington revealed {{in an interview that}} the special episode will do something [...] "no other show has done before." [...] In the interview, Hossington said: [...] "I'm very keen to make it a big event! <b>We</b> <b>spoke</b> about live episodes and things like that, but we decided that none of those things were satisfying as they've all been done. What we're doing, no other show has done before..." [...] Producer of Holby City, Simon Harper, also announced in an interview plans for a crossover event with sister show Holby City in celebration for Casualty's thirtieth anniversary. It was later revealed by Charles Venn in an interview with What's on TV on 8 June 2016, that his character, Nurse Jacob Masters, would be {{at the forefront of the}} anniversary episode. Venn said in the interview his character would play [...] "an integral part" [...] in the 110-minute special anniversary episode. Venn also went on to say that the cast and crew brand the thirtieth anniversary episode Casualty: The Movie.|$|E
500|$|At two secret {{meetings}} on 16 and 18 November 1959, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General Twining, recommended the Air Force's {{plan for the}} B-70 to reconnoiter and strike rail-mobile Soviet ICBMs, but the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General White, admitted the Soviets would [...] "be able to hit the B-70 with rockets" [...] and requested the B-70 be downgraded to [...] "a bare minimum research and development program" [...] at $200 million for fiscal year 1960. President Eisenhower responded that the reconnaissance and strike mission was [...] "crazy" [...] since the nuclear mission was to attack known production and military complexes, and emphasized that he saw {{no need for the}} B-70 since the ICBM is [...] "a cheaper, more effective way of doing the same thing". Eisenhower also identified that the B-70 would not be in manufacturing until [...] "eight to ten years from now" [...] and [...] "said he thought we were talking about bows and arrows at a time of gunpowder when <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> of bombers in the missile age".Note: 18 November meeting quotations in this article are Goodpaster's paraphrasing of White & Eisenhower (e.g., [...] "said he [...] thought we [...] ") – possibly from an audio recording if one was made at Augusta. In December 1959 the Air Force announced the B-70 project would be cut to a single prototype, and most of the planned B-70 subsystems would no longer be developed.|$|E

500|$|Mutchnick, {{in regards}} of Debra Messing's character, said: [...] "Grace doesn't fall {{into any of}} those {{categories}} that have stereotyped Jewish women. She's strong, she's pretty and she's a proud Jewish woman." [...] Mutchnick revealed that Nicollette Sheridan was originally brought in to read the part of Grace, but even though she did a [...] "great job", her performance was [...] "too desperate". Mutchnick and Kohan decided to cast Messing in the role instead, {{who at the time}} was starring in ABC's drama Prey. After her first meeting with them, Messing was not convinced she wanted the role. Messing revealed that Mutchnick and Kohan showed up at her home with a bottle of vodka; [...] "They poured me several shots, <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> for several hours and they pitched me the show. I'm a lightweight. I didn't need much to be a little giddy. By the end of the evening, they said, 'Will you do it?' I said, 'Let's talk tomorrow.'" [...] They called her the next day to inform her that they [...] "loved her" [...] and asked [...] "if she'd made up her mind". Messing still did not make her mind up. However, the following day, she called Mutchnick and Kohan and accepted the role. In discussion of the character, Messing said: [...] "I have a lot more confidence and I'm much more relaxed. I feel comfortable that Grace will be a character I'll enjoy doing for a long time." [...] She later, however, admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing Will & Grace. Messing was the last actor to be cast.|$|E

I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an 'audience' with her which meant we were alone, at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry. Her mother was friends with Ted Hughes whose poetry I admire a lot. <b>We</b> <b>spoke</b> about his influence on me." ...|$|E

He explained that it was Gene Scott's intelligent and fact-based approach to teaching that earned his respect and allowed him to build faith. He stated that his earlier exposures to Christianity had no effect, because they were mostly based on simplistic platitudes such as [...] "God is love" [...] which he found unconvincing.|$|R

2500|$|As the {{district}} court noted, we have repeatedly rejected {{the claim that the}} Sixteenth Amendment was improperly ratified. One would think this repeated rejection of Benson's Sixteenth Amendment argument would put the matter to rest Benson is the co-author of The Law That Never Was, a book that purports to [...] "review the documents concerning the states' ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment" [...] and to show [...] "that only four states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment [...] the official promulgation of the amendment by Secretary of State Knox in 1913 is therefore void." [...] Benson insists that as the co-author of The Law That Never Was, and the man who actually reviewed the state documents [...] "proving" [...] improper ratification, he is uniquely qualified to make the [...] "exceptionally strong showing" [...] <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> of in Foster. Because of this, Benson insists, {{the district}} court should have at least granted him an evidentiary hearing on the Sixteenth Amendment issue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} ambitious as Lucas {{wanted to create}} fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) {{that had never been}} {{realized}} before in science fiction films. He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: [...] "George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real." [...] They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets. Christian said that Lucas [...] "didn't want anything [...] to stand out, he wanted it [...] all real and used. And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amnesty International, [...] "torture is commonplace" [...] against protesters by Venezuelan {{authorities}} despite Article 46 of the Venezuelan Constitution prohibiting [...] "punishment, torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment". During the protests, {{there were}} hundreds of reported cases of torture. In a report titled Punished for Protesting following a March investigation of conduct during the protests, Human Rights Watch said that those who were detained by government authorities were subjected to [...] "severe physical abuse" [...] with some abuses including being beaten [...] "with fists, helmets, and firearms; electric shocks or burns; being forced to squat or kneel, without moving, for hours at a time; being handcuffed to other detainees, sometimes in pairs and others in human chains of dozens of people, for hours at a time; and extended periods of extreme cold or heat."

He {{was lying on the}} floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth. An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell. Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30a.m. Police ruled out homicide by reviewing hotel surveillance video, which showed nobody entering or exiting the suite after his bodyguard left around 11:35p.m. The cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging. Cornell was 52 years old. Footage of his final concert was posted on YouTube. Cornell's wife said, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different.

Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?'

2500|$|As media {{coverage}} widened and intensified, CBS at first attempted to produce additional {{evidence to support}} its claims. On September 11, a CBS News segment stated that document expert Phillip Bouffard thought the documents [...] "could have been prepared on an IBM Selectric Composer typewriter, available at the time." [...] The Selectric Composer was introduced in 1966 for use by typesetting professionals to generate camera-ready copy; according to IBM archives describing this specialized equipment, [...] "To produce copy which can be reproduced with 'justified', or straight left-and right-hand margins, the operator types the copy once and the composer computes the number of spaces needed to justify the line. As the operator types the copy a second time, the spaces are added automatically.") Bouffard's comments were also cited by the Boston Globe in an article entitled [...] "Authenticity backed on Bush documents." [...] However, the Globe soon printed a retraction regarding the title.
