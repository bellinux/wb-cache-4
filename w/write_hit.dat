500|$|Upon its release, One by One was {{considered}} the band's heaviest album, as Grohl described the sound as a darker and more aggressive approach {{as opposed to the}} band's usual work. Grohl said that the album mainly focused on the energy of live performances, which he attributed to both the extensive touring preceding the compositions, and the short period during which the re-recordings were done. The frontman added that although the previous albums had songs which were never played live, the track listing on One by One was compared to a set list where he would play all songs every night. As the results of the early recording sessions had manager John Silva complimenting the songs that did not sound like the band's previous work, and suggesting Grohl to [...] "stop trying to <b>write</b> <b>hit</b> singles and go back to being weird", the band decided to be more experimental in addition to writing music meant to be played in full arenas. The variety included moody songs such as [...] "Have It All" [...] and [...] "Tired of You", the seven-minute [...] "epic opus" [...] album closer [...] "Come Back", and the alternating dynamics of [...] "Halo", which drew inspiration from Tom Petty, Cheap Trick and Guided by Voices. Grohl added that the sonority tried to blend dissonance and melody: [...] "We figured we're gonna get mean, we're gonna get ugly. And then I end up putting this four-part harmony on it, and all of sudden it's beautiful. Like 'wait a second, {{it was supposed to be}} gross, and now it's gorgeous'." ...|$|E
