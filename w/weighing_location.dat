40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this report {{was carried out by}} Operation and Maintenance Engineering at Luleå University of Technology (LTU) from November 2015 to April 2016. LKAB initiated the research study and provided financial support. The purpose of this research was to support LKAB and Trafikverket in their operational strategy review and optimization of future axle load implementations. It developed five research questions and answered them by analyzing the data for the Malmbanan iron ore train axle loads for 2015. Data analysis comprises four parts. In the first part (section 2), the analysis focuses on axle loads of all loaded trains operating at three different terminals: Kiruna, Malmberget, and Svappavaara. In addition, it examines the differences of three <b>weighing</b> <b>locations</b> in Kiruna, five <b>weighing</b> <b>locations</b> in Malmberget and four <b>weighing</b> <b>locations</b> in Svappavaara (12 <b>weighing</b> <b>locations).</b> Based on these results, the analysis in the second part (section 3) focuses on the heavy haul wagon. Wagon loads are evaluated and predicted for different loading rules (31. 0 and 32. 5 tons separately). To optimize the current loading rules, the third part of the analysis (section 4) proposes a novel approach to optimize the wagon axle loads: “three sigma prediction”. Under this approach, Kiruna, Malmberget and Svappavaara can set new target loads based on various risk levels. In the fourth and final part of the data analysis (section 5), a comparison study is carried out by collecting axle load data for the test train (with a 32. 5 ton axle load) using three different measurement systems in Malmberget, Sävast and Sunderbyn. Finally, sections 6 and 7 summarize the results and make some recommendations for future work. The work {{presented in this}} report should give LKAB and Trafikverket a good overview of the load distribution for the ore trains operating on Malmbanan line. It can serve as input into the process of evaluating possible changes in axle load limits. It also gives LKAB a base from which to identify and work with optimization of the various loading places to load trains more efficiently and save costs. Godkänd; 2016; 20160502 (linjan) </p...|$|R
40|$|National {{data and}} case studies {{are used to}} test the {{importance}} of different types of management practices on the location decisions of new manufacturing plants. We find that plants that adopt high performance management practices and cultures rely on different criteria when making their location decisions, and also <b>weigh</b> standard <b>location</b> criteria differently, than those plants that are managed in more traditional ways. Omitting management culture from studies of business location may result in biased estimates of the importance of various traditional location factors. By more accurately specifying location models for manufacturing plants with high performance management cultures, this study provides some additional insights for regional development policy. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{determinants}} of the composition of public investment in Europe, with a special focus {{on the role of}} fiscal decentralisation. The results suggest that fiscal decentralisation boosts economically productive public investment, notably infrastructure, and curbs the relative share of economically less productive investment, such as recreational facilities. While not readily reconcilable with the traditional theory of fiscal federalism, these findings can be interpreted in terms of the literature on fiscal competition, with not only tax rates but also the quality of public expenditure <b>weighing</b> in firms' <b>location</b> decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present some}} stylised {{facts about the}} {{composition}} of public investment in Europe and analyse its determinants, with a special focus {{on the role of}} fiscal decentralisation. The empirical analysis is conducted both for levels of different types of public investment and for their shares in total public investment. The results suggest that fiscal decentralisation boosts economically productive public investment, notably infrastructure, and curbs the relative share of economically less productive public investment, such as recreational facilities. While not readily reconcilable with the traditional theory of fiscal federalism, especially as regards the provision of local public goods, these findings can be interpreted in terms of the literature on fiscal competition, with not only tax rates but also the quality of public expenditure <b>weighing</b> in firms' <b>location</b> decisions.

40|$|Under {{the mandate}} of the Educational Committee of the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (E. A. E. S.), three {{consensus}} development conferences (CDCs) were performed in order to assess the current status of the endoscopic surgical approaches for the treatment of cholelithiasis, appendicitis, and inguinal hernia. Consensus panels for the different disease states (10 - 13 members each) selected by the education committee on the basis of members' clinical expertise, academic activity, community influence, and geographical <b>location</b> <b>weighed</b> the evidence on the basis of published results according to the criteria for technology assessment: feasibility, efficacy, effectiveness, economy. Draft statements were prepared, discussed by the panels, and presented at plenary sessions of the 2 nd European Congress of the E. A. E. S. in Madrid September 15 - 17, 1994. Following discussions final consensus statements were formulated to provide specific answers for each topic to a minimum of the following questions:status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|There is {{demand for}} a {{decision}} support tool to design greenhouse production systems in various climate zones and locations in Africa: the ‘Toolbox Adaptive Greenhouse Systems for Africa’. Selection of {{a limited number of}} climate zones that are representative for Africa limits the variation in designs to be evaluated and makes the approach more effective for the Netherlands supply industry. The toolbox will result in a number of greenhouse cultivation systems that are most suitable for a given <b>location,</b> <b>weighing</b> perspectives such as greenhouse type, greenhouse installation, climate, production and economic viability. The toolkit will follow the ‘adaptive greenhouse approach’ in which models for greenhouse, crop and finances are combined. This report provides a basis for the toolbox. An overview of African climates is given, followed by options for greenhouse design which are placed {{in the context of a}} number of production systems. The expected future developments and the transitions from current situations to likely future situations are briefly described. Anticipating likely future developments enables an analysis of the potential of a certain farm type, the requirements for further development, and the options for Netherlands involvement...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} the deterministic flow-interception {{model with}} the objective of locating truck weigh stations to maximize the total flow of trucks that are intercepted during their travel on the intercity highway network of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The Origin-Destination (O-D) matrix of daily truck trips between each pair of the KSA's 18 major cities and regional centers was assigned to the shortest paths between the O-D pairs. The flow interception model was then solved using two approaches: a mathematical programming (MP) approach and a (greedy) heuristic approach. The results show that the greedy heuristic gives a solution that is very close to the optimum {{in terms of the number}} of stations needed to intercept a given percentage of the truck flow. However, some of the station locations might not coincide with those given by the exact MP solution. Furthermore, the MP solution results show that 44 stations are needed for 100 % truck flow interception, and that the existing 31 stations can intercept only 60. 91 % of the total truck flow. These 31 stations could intercept up to 98. 73 % of the total truck flow if relocated to the optimum <b>locations.</b> Keywords: Truck <b>weigh</b> stations, Optimum <b>locations,</b> Saudi Arabi...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the endocrine responses {{associated with the}} relocation process, 22 Holstein heifers (326. 4 ± 46. 8 kg BW) {{were randomly assigned to}} control (CON) or relocation (RELOC) treatment groups. On d 0, heifers were weighed and fitted within dwelling rectal temperature (RT) monitoring devices and jugular catheters. On d 1, baseline blood samples were collected from all heifers for 2 h prior to the transportation event, then weighed. Controls were returned to tie stalls and RELOC were loaded into a modified stock trailer (12 individual stanchions) for a 4 h transportation event. Simultaneous blood samples were obtained at 30 -min intervals from both groups throughout the 4 h transport event (TE-I). After transport, RELOC were unloaded at an unfamiliar <b>location,</b> <b>weighed,</b> and placed in tie stalls for a 2 h post-transportation period. All heifers were then placed into two separate holding paddocks with access to water and hay for 4 h. After 4 h, hay and water was withdrawn for 20 h. On d 2 RELOC heifers were exposed to a second transport event (TE-II); the timeline and procedures of TE-II were identical to those of TE-I (except for the starting point for RELOC heifers). All serum samples were analyzed for concentrations of cortisol, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor-I(IGF-I). A 6...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the mandate}} of the Educational Committee of the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (E. A. E. S.), three {{consensus}} development conferences (CDCs) were performed in order to assess the current status of the endoscopic surgical approaches for the treatment of cholelithiasis, appendicitis, and inguinal hernia. Consensus panels for the different disease states (10 - 13 members each) selected by the education committee on the basis of members' clinical expertise, academic activity, community influence, and geographical <b>location</b> <b>weighed</b> the evidence on the basis of published results according to the criteria for technology assessment: feasibility, efficacy, effectiveness, economy. Draft statements were prepared, discussed by the panels, and presented at plenary sessions of the 2 nd European Congress of the E. A. E. S. in Madrid September 15 - 17, 1994. Following discussions final consensus statements were formulated to provide specific answers for each topic to a minimum of the following questions: 1. What stage of technological development is the endoscopic surgical procedure at (in September 1994) ? 2. Is endoscopic surgery safe and feasible? 3. Is it beneficial to the patients? 4. Who should undergo endoscopic surgery? 5. What are the training recommendations? Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the procedure of choice for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Laparoscopic appendectomy is presently at the efficacy stage of development, because most of the data on feasibility and safety originate from centers with special interest in endoscopic surgery: it is not yet the gold standard for acute appendicitis. Endoscopic hernia repair is presently a feasible alternative for conventional hernia repair if performed by experienced endoscopic surgeons. It appears to be efficacious in the short-term.
