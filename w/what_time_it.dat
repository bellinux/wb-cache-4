5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} circadian {{clock is}} profoundly influenced {{by changes in}} light, since these are its main clues about <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> is. Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability. Short pulses of light, {{at the right moment}} in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock. Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic media use before bed may interfere with sleep.|$|E

500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized.

500|$|Mehldau often plays a {{separate}} melody with each hand, {{and one of}} the central features of his music is the playing of improvised counterpoint. He stated in 2002 that some of the content of his playing is affected by the music that he has recently been listening to: [...] "If I'm digging a Brahms intermezzo that'll find its way in. If it's McCoy Tyner, there'll be more of that." [...] Mehldau's performances often employ unusual rhythmic meters; for example, he plays his arrangement of [...] "All the Things You Are" [...] on Art of the Trio 4 in 7/4 time, and [...] "I Didn't Know <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> <b>It</b> Was" [...] on Art of the Trio 1 in 5/4. He developed this ability over a period of around a year, with the help of Rossy. Mehldau is able to reach tenth and eleventh intervals on the piano.|$|E

Their repertoire featured interpretations of [...] "I Didn't Know <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> <b>It</b> Was" [...] and Dave Brubeck's recent composition [...] "In Your Own Sweet Way"; the latter focused on Costa's vibes and Farmer's muted trumpet, with Woods switching from his usual alto saxophone to the piano. The Billboard review was positive, calling it [...] "a first rate jazz set" [...] on which [...] "Costa swings as ever on piano". A trio {{appearance at the}} 1957 Newport Jazz Festival also brought Costa greater attention. Some of his playing at the festival – as a trio with Ernie Furtado (bass) and Al Beldini (drums), and as a quintet {{with the addition of}} Rolf Kühn and Dick Johnson – was released later in 1957 as part of a Verve album.

500|$|According to Suetonius, {{a number}} of omens had foretold Domitian's death. Several days prior to the assassination, Minerva had {{appeared}} to the emperor in a dream.

[...] According to an auspice he had received, the Emperor believed that his death would be at midday. [...] As a result, he was always restless around that time.

The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon.

500|$|Before his {{departure}} from Jive, Big Boi planned {{to release the}} album in 2008. In January 2010, he announced a March 23 release through his Twitter account. In April, its release was pushed back to July 6 in the United States. However, in June, Jive attempted to block its release, claiming that Def Jam could not issue songs featuring both Big Boi and André 3000, as OutKast was represented as a duo by the former label. In a June 7 interview for GQ, Big Boi responded to a question concerning the blocking of his recordings with André 3000 for Sir Lucious Left Foot, stating [...] "Au contraire! They cannot block it. Au contraire. Either they're {{going to do it}} the right way, or they're going to do it my way... The fans' thirst will be quenched. You know, I'm no stranger to that Internet, baby.

On June 10, his website released the album's track listing, which excluded tracks featuring André 3000. Of his songs with André 3000, he told GQ, [...] "We're gonna keep one of them for the next OutKast record".|$|E

500|$|Liz (Tina Fey), Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) all {{attempt to}} trick Tracy into {{arriving}} at a rehearsal on time. [...] Tracy arrives not knowing <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> is and announces that Liz is racist and treating him like a child. Liz challenges Tracy to behave better so he can be treated as an adult, but he responds by sending a gibbon to replace himself at rehearsal. Liz tells Tracy to arrive on time with his lines memorized the next day {{if he wants to}} be treated equally. Tracy retaliates by acting professionally but convincing everyone to treat Liz equally too, by making her lift heavy water jugs, passing gas near her, and inviting her to a strip club along with the other writers. Liz in turn stops Tracy from going to the strip club, noting that because he is acting so professionally he has to write notes for the upcoming script. Liz is uncomfortable at the strip club and Tracy hates writing all night so they agree to return to the [...] "natural order" [...] of things with both receiving preferential treatment.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} {{to go to bed}} due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure he does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams {{have nothing to do with}} him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> is throughout, as Fleance says when asked at the beginning of the scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E
