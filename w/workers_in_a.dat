5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

25|$|Justice Ivan Rand {{issued a}} {{landmark}} legal decision following a strike in Windsor, Ontario, involving 17,000 Ford workers. He granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues.

Therefore, he reasoned they must pay union dues, although {{they do not have}} to join the union.|$|E

25|$|Incarceration {{for workers}} and their representatives within the Syndicate was a regular occurrence.

25|$|To join a {{traditional}} labor union, workers must either be given voluntary recognition from their employer {{or have a}} majority of <b>workers</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bargaining unit vote for union representation.

25|$|Corbyn is {{in favour}} of {{repealing}} the Trade Union bill which would place restrictions on strikes in key areas such as transport and prevent unions from charging members a political levy unless they specifically agree (currently members can be charged unless they opt out).

To better understand workplace violence and workplace harassment, the definitions are listed below: Workplace violence: (a) Is the exercise of physical force by a person against <b>a</b> <b>worker,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> workplace, that causes or could cause physical injury to the worker. (b) Is an attempt to exercise physical force against <b>a</b> <b>worker,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> workplace, that could cause physical injury to the worker.
