Zusho also saw many {{similarities}} in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had a great interest in Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain’s financial position. Having <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira’s ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho’s mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma’s affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or their dealings with the shogunate.|$|E

[...] During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on Queen for a Day and The Dinah Shore Show, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave Ed Wood a positive review. [...] "Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous.

[...] After that, he went to live with his father Augustus Jones, a Welsh-born United Empire Loyalist. [...] There he learnt the customs and language of the white Christian settlers of Upper Canada and was taught how to farm. [...] Jones converted to Methodism at age 21 after attending a camp-meeting with his half sister. [...] Methodist leaders in Upper Canada recognised his potential as a bridge between the white and Indian communities and recruited him as a preacher. [...] As a bilingual and bicultural preacher, he enabled the Methodists to make significant inroads with the Mississaugas and Iroquois of Upper Canada, both by translating hymns and biblical texts in Ojibwe and Mohawk and by preaching to Indians who did not understand English. [...] Beyond his preaching to the Indians of Upper Canada, he was an excellent fundraiser for the Canadian Methodists, and toured the United States and Great Britain giving sermons and speeches. [...] Jones drew audiences of thousands, filling many of the buildings he spoke in, but came to resent the role, believing the audiences came to see Kahkewāquonāby, the exotic Indian, not Peter Jones, the good Christian he had <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> become.|$|E
500|$|Her next {{appearance}} was in StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, {{where she is}} the central character, and it {{tells the story of}} her further fate, and of the Zerg Swarm as well. Once again a human, Kerrigan is brought by Raynor to a secret research facility run by Valerian Mengsk to determine how much of her skill at controlling Zerg remains from her time as the Queen of Blades. However, the facility is attacked by Dominion forces and while Kerrigan and Valerian manage to escape, Raynor becomes trapped. After returning to look for him, Kerrigan hears Mengsk's announcement that he was captured and executed. To enact revenge against Mengsk, Kerrigan, while traveling through the sector to reunite the Zerg Swarm under her control, is approached by Zeratul. Zeratul tells her to travel to Zerus, the original homeworld of the Zerg, where the primal Zerg are in a constantly evolving state. Kerrigan, initially reluctant, is convinced after Zeratul tells her there she can obtain enough power to move on with her vengeance plans. On Zerus, Kerrigan learns that Amon stole {{a large portion of the}} Zerg from Zerus and bound them to a single overriding will, making them Amon's slaves as part of his plot to destroy both the Zerg and Protoss and remake life in his own image. Kerrigan enters a chrysalis in the first Zerg spawning pool and emerges, transforming again into the primal Queen of Blades. She also realizes that Amon's lingering taint was partially responsible for the crimes she committed during the Brood War. Mengsk contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor was not killed, but is held as a hostage instead, threatening to kill him should she wage war against the Dominion. With help from Valerian and Raynor's Raiders, Kerrigan manages to rescue Raynor, but is rejected by him for renouncing the human self that he <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> restore. Now in full control of the Zerg Swarm once again, Kerrigan launches an attack on the Dominon's main world, Korhal, to defeat Mengsk. She is assisted by Valerian, who convinces her to give an opening for the civilians to escape, and is later assisted by Raynor's forces as well. Confronting Mengsk face to face, Kerrigan is almost defeated when he uses the Xel'naga artifact to attack her, but Raynor stops him, allowing her to kill Mengsk with her own hands. Kerrigan and Raynor make their peace and it is shown that they will always look out for each other, hinting an everlasting affection between the two. With the Dominion's leader destroyed, Kerrigan bids Raynor and Valerian farewell and starts to prepare herself and her swarm for [...] "the greatest battle they'll ever face".|$|E

5000|$|A {{great deal}} of {{pressure}} can be produced by preventing the reversion of deformed martensite to austenite — from 35,000 psi to, in many cases, more than 100,000 psi (689 MPa). One {{of the reasons that}} nitinol <b>works</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> return to its original shape {{is that it is not}} just an ordinary metal alloy, but what is known as an intermetallic compound. In an ordinary alloy, the constituents are randomly positioned in the crystal lattice; in an ordered intermetallic compound, the atoms (in this case, nickel and titanium) have very specific locations in the lattice. [...] The fact that nitinol is an intermetallic is largely responsible for the complexity in fabricating devices made from the alloy.|$|R

However, there is evidence presented by some modern historians that it could possibly be credited to Constans, and yet others leave the door open that Heraclius could possibly have done so in the late 630s in Cilicia. In any case, the debate over exactly when the thematic system originated continues on.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Jones {{released}} his last proper studio album on Epic, You Oughta Be Here With Me. [...] Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single [...] "Hell Stays Open All Night Long" [...] and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made {{the switch to}} MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years. [...] His first album with MCA, And Along Came Jones, was released in 1991 and, backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had. [...] However, two singles, [...] "You Couldn't Get The Picture" [...] and [...] "She Loved A Lot In Her Time" [...] (a tribute to Jones' mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts as Jones lost favor with country radio as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. [...] His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's Walls Can Fall, which featured the novelty song [...] "Finally Friday" [...] and [...] "I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair," [...] a testament to his continued vivaciousness in old age. [...] Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and {{was inducted into the}} Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992. [...] In 1996, Jones {{released his}} autobiography I Lived To Tell It All with Tom Carter and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, [...] "I also {{know that a lot of}} my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. [...] So many have <b>worked</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> maintain their careers. [...] I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing." [...] He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that saw him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. (Jones had long been a critic of country pop, and along with Wynette and Jean Shepard, he was one of the major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones's divorce from Wynette was a factor in the Association's collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. [...] On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called The George Jones Show, with Jones as host. [...] The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new and, of course, music.
