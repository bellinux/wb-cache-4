25|$|The {{investigations}} {{were widely}} {{reported in the}} press, but eventually junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha intervened: the embezzlement case had already been closed in 2006 by the then Attorney-General and that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Prayuth {{was afraid of the}} rising conflicts. He then dissolved the religious committee of the reform council. However, Paiboon, Phra Suwit and Mano continued to address the leading Sangha's shortcomings through judicial means. In the meantime, the DSI investigated further, and it was discovered that a used vintage car in Wat Paknam's museum had not been properly registered, allegedly to evade taxes. Somdet Chuang was charged with tax evasion by the DSI, and the accusations were reason enough for the government to further postpone the appointment. Fear of Phra Suwit Dhiradhammo and his ties to the army may {{have played a role in}} this stalling. In December 2016, the National Legislative Assembly amended the 2005 Monastic Act to allow other monks than Somdet Chuang to be appointed Supreme Patriarch. Finally in February 2017, Somdet Amborn was appointed by King Vajiralongkorn to serve as the next Supreme Patriarch.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they {{said they were going to}} put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E

50|$|Termination, as used by Quaternary geologists, oceanographers, and paleoclimatologists <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{period of}} time during an glacial cycle {{when there is a}} {{relatively}} rapid transition from full glacial climates to full interglacial climates. For the Quaternary period, terminations are numbered using Roman numerals from the most recent termination as “I” and with increasing value, e.g. “II”, “III”, and so forth, into the past. Termination I, also known as the Last Glacial Termination, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine isotope stage 2; Termination II <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 6; Termination III <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 8; Termination IV <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 10, and so forth.|$|R
