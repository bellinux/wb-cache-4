50|$|BacMap is a freely {{available}} web-accessible database containing fully annotated, fully zoomable {{and fully}} searchable chromosome maps {{from more than}} 2500 prokaryotic (archaebacterial and eubacterial) species. BacMap was originally developed in 2005 to address the challenges of viewing and navigating through the growing numbers of bacterial genomes that were being generated through large-scale sequencing efforts. Since it was first introduced, the number of bacterial genomes in BacMap has grown by more than 15X. Essentially BacMap functions as an on-line visual atlas of microbial genomes. All of the genome annotations in BacMap were generated through the BASys genome annotation system. BASys is a widely used microbial annotation infrastructure that performs comprehensive bionformatic analyses on raw (or labeled) bacterial genome sequence data. All of the genome (chromosome) maps in BacMap were constructed using the program known as CGView. CGView is a popular visualization program for generating interactive, <b>web-compatible</b> circular chromosome maps (Fig. 1). Each chromosome map in BacMap is extensively hyperlinked and each chromosome image can be interactively navigated, expanded and rotated using navigation buttons or hyperlinks. All identified genes in a BacMap chromosome map are colored according to coding directions and when sufficiently zoomed-in, gene labels are visible. Each gene label on a BacMap genome map is also hyperlinked to a 'gene card' (Fig. 2). The gene cards provide detailed information about the corresponding DNA and protein sequences. Each genome map in BacMap is searchable via BLAST and a gene name/synonym search.|$|E

40|$|Bibliographic data provide well {{established}} {{means of the}} information resource description. Nowadays, there is obvious need to make this data more web-friendly and <b>web-compatible,</b> while web is mostly seen as {{the only place where}} people are seeking information. The proposed solution is to change the traditional bibliographic data representation format. Semantic Web initiative presents enhancement of the current web with machine processable data semantics (meaning). The main goal is to manage more effective information processing by web applications that brings up many benefits for web users. Linked data are seen as practical means to reach the semantic web vision. This initiative promotes best practices of publishing, connecting and sharing structural data on the web. This thesis reports the transformation of bibliographic records' format in case of Database of publishing activities at University of Economics, Prague (PCVSE). Benefits of linked data publishing model are demonstrated on the realized projects. The main part describes practical experiences gained during the implementation of RDF framework in phases of data modelling, interlinking and exposing the dataset. The linked data publishing model is seen there as an optimal <b>web-compatible</b> bibliographic data representation format...|$|E

The inappropriateness of traditional schemas of resource description for web resources has encouraged significant activities recently on defining <b>web-compatible</b> schemas named "metadata". While conceptually old for library and information professionals, metadata has taken more significant and paramount role than ever before and is considered as the golden key for the next evolution of the web in the form of semantic web.

40|$|Abstract. The {{semantic}} web {{is an extension}} of the current web [1][2] and the data are well-defined based on those semantics for the agents to comprehend. Ontologies provide a solid base to represent metadata for the {{semantic web}} environment. Several <b>web-compatible</b> languages and technologies [4][5][6] have been developed to support the semantic knowledge management for ontologies. Current ontology management systems, such as Protégé [12], allow only one relation type and thereby provide insufficient support for other web technologies. Overly simplified models lack the semantics expressions required. To solve these problems, we propose a dynamic ontology management system. The system implements a data model enclosing sufficient semantics, integrates the ontologies developed by different web-based technologies, and incorporates other data resources for the ontology refinements. The performance of the ontology management system is being enhanced to ensure less human involvement. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{popularity}} of Internet technology {{has brought about}} some fundamental changes {{in the field of}} GIS. Internet GIS is emerging as a new technology to access, process, and disseminate spatial information over the Internet. Internet GIS cover a much wider audience than the traditional GIS. This raises many issues that are distinct from traditional desktop GIS, such as easy access, <b>web-compatible</b> user interface, and file transfer security. I will first discuss the definition and features of Internet GIS. Two major approaches used in the Internet GIS development [...] server-side processing and client-side processing [...] are then described. These approaches are compared according to their performance, user interactivity, and other criteria. The server-side approach is appropriate to provide users easy access and inquiry of large databases, whereas the client-side Internet GIS offer better user interactions. The technology of Internet GIS is evolving rapidly. It is therefore important for the GIS community to monitor and define the course of its development. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of three papers in 2013, {{researchers}} at the Cornell Node of the NSF Census Research Network ([URL] investigated and proposed solutions for two fundamental yet distinct issues in the curation of quantitative social science data: confidentiality and provenance. We argued that the W 3 C PROV model, a foundation for semantically-rich, interoperable, and <b>web-compatible</b> provenance metatdata, is especially important in a web environment in which data from distributed sources and of varying integrity can be combined and derived. In this paper we combine and expand upon these two separate threads—confidentiality and provenance—and experiment with the use of PROV and DDI in documenting the complex provenance chain between the highly confidential environment of the U. S. Census Bureau and restricted and public versions of internal census demographic files. In particular, our presentation will report on our effort to: 1) test PROV’s ability to describe meaningful relationships between confidential, restricted and public data at the variable level; 2) develop a user interface for researchers attempting to understand the relationships between distinct versions of confidential, restricted, and public census files. Longer term our work should produce a useful metadata resource for users of public and restricted American Community Survey data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Visualizing 3 -dimensional (3 -D) {{datasets}} is {{an important}} part of modern neuroimaging research. Many tools address this problem; however, they often fail to address specific needs and flexibility, such as the ability to work with different data formats, to control how and what data are displayed, to interact with values, and to undo mistakes. Results iiV, an interactive software program for displaying 3 -D brain images, is described. This tool was programmed to solve basic problems in 3 -D data visualization. It is written in Java so it is extensible, is platform independent, and can display images within web pages. iiV displays 3 -D images as 2 -dimensional (2 -D) slices with each slice being an independent object with independent features such as location, zoom, colors, labels, etc. Feature manipulation becomes easier by having a full set of editing capabilities including the following: undo or redo changes; drag, copy, delete and paste objects; and save objects with their features to a file for future editing. It can read multiple standard positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) file formats like ECAT, ECAT 7, ANALYZE, NIfTI- 1 and DICOM. We present sample applications to illustrate some of the features and capabilities. Conclusion iiV is an image display tool with many useful features. It is highly extensible, platform independent, and <b>web-compatible.</b> This report summarizes its features and applications, while illustrating iiV's usefulness to the biomedical imaging community. </p...|$|E
40|$|Academic Bibliography Database of the University of Economics in Prague {{consists}} of bibliographic records of publications involving journal articles, conference papers, lecture notes, monographs and monograph chapters {{created by the}} academic staff of the university. We would like to discuss the experiences gained {{in the process of}} this dataset’s transformation from its current data format to RDF-based data. During the course of conversion we will specify the entity types in our data and choose a way to model them. For data description we are going to use the most popular and widely implemented vocabularies and domain ontologies. Next, we will discuss the issues associated with interlinking the data with relevant and well-established datasets constituting a part of the web of data (e. g., DBLP Computer Science Bibliography). We would like to examine further possibilities of data re-use by making the data suitable for other applications such as citation managers (e. g., Zotero) to generate citations automatically. We are also interested in providing users with the information about availability of a resource as full text or as library holding, so we discuss cooperation with link resolvers (SFX, in our case) as well as other possible ways of linking. In this way, aligned with the concept of the semantic web, we maintain that the potential of the data would be maximized, as the information in bibliographic records would become easy to share, more visible due to incoming links, and more ready to be processed by web applications. We argue that academic bibliography data should be openly available, so it increases transparency of publishing activity of the university’s academic staff. Beyond being re-usable, the data can be easily linked to so that they must not be duplicated at multiple locations. Likewise, these features together can provide a few benefits for bibliometric evaluation of science. The adoption of linked data publishing model for academic bibliography datasets involves moving to a more flexible data format for bibliographic data. While linked data is seen as a pragmatic implementation of the semantic web, we argue that {{it is not possible to}} implement the library data vision with the MARC, current standard for bibliographic data. Obviously, there is a need for more <b>web-compatible</b> and web-friendly data model. With this in mind, we suggest linked data as a part of the pragmatic implementation of the vision for bibliographic data on the Web...|$|E
