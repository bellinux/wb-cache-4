25|$|There {{are three}} major events when {{the street in}} Alameda's {{historic}} downtown district is closed to vehicular traffic. The Park Street Spring Festival takes place every May during the weekend of Mother's Day and attracts over 50,000 visitors. The Park Street Art & Wine Faire takes place the last weekend of every July and attracts over 100,000 visitors. Both street fairs feature over 150 arts & crafts vendors, food vendors, beer and <b>wine</b> <b>pouring,</b> a children's area, and two stages with regional entertainment. The Park Street Classic Car Show is held on the second Saturday every October and displays over 400 vintage vehicles.|$|R

50|$|A wine {{decanter}} is a glass serving vessel {{into which}} an entire {{bottle of wine}} is poured. They are used to remove sediment, aerate the <b>wine,</b> facilitate <b>pouring,</b> and provide elegant presentation. Decanters are important when serving older vintages which {{are more likely to}} accumulate potassium bitartrate crystal sediment in the process of aging; these can be removed both by filtering when pouring into the decanter - so that the wine in the decanter is sediment-free - or due to the shape of the decanter (flared bottom), which catches sediment. Decanters promote the aeration of wine by having a flared bottom, hence large surface area of wine, maximising the wine-air interface, thereby introducing more oxygen which changes the wine's bouquet and taste - it also allows the evaporation of undesirable organic compounds, particularly sulfides and sulfites; this use is controversial, and some argue that this is unnecessary and harmful, with swirling the wine in the glass being sufficient and preferable. Because they are a serving vessel, not a storage vessel, they also can make <b>wine</b> <b>pouring</b> easier by preventing dribbling, and elegantly display the wine's color in clear glass, rather than the green glass used for storage.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that food consumption {{is a major}} component of feasting. This should also be true of the Aegean Bronze Age. Therefore, food and its role in the execution of a feast should be one of the main focuses of feasting-related studies. Such issues are one of the main concerns of both archaeozoology and the study of Linear B tablets. However, food preparation and consumption, as evidenced by ceramic remains, constitute a field still not properly surveyed, in great contrast to wine drinking. This is partly {{due to the lack of}} ambiguity of wine-related vessels among feasting remains. <b>Wine</b> <b>pouring,</b> mixing and drinking vessels are easily recognizable (or at least are thought to be so), something which cannot be said about food serving vessels. However, food preparation vessels, the ordinary cooking pots, are usually easy to identify due to their distinct fabric, shape and frequent burning marks, and I shall focus on them in the discussion that follows. Food serving vessels will be of secondary concern. Bartłomiej Li...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Excess alcohol {{consumption}} extorts significant {{social and economic}} costs that are increasing {{despite the presence of}} mandatory warning labels on packaged alcoholic beverages. We used a novel approach by adding a brief statement based on self-affirmation theory (Steele, 1988) to alcohol warning labels. Method. In two studies (N = 85; N = 58), we randomized regular wine drinkers recruited from University campuses to complete a <b>wine</b> <b>pouring</b> task with bottles that had standard labelling, or bottles that added a self-affirming implementation intention to the standard labeling. Alcohol consumption, behavioral intention and self-efficacy were measured pre-manipulation; message acceptance was measured post-manipulation; and {{alcohol consumption}}, behavioral intention and self-efficacy were measured again at follow-up. Results. In both studies, the self-affirming implementation intention significantly reduced subsequent alcohol consumption (ds = 0. 70 and 0. 91, respectively). However, message acceptance, behavioral intention, and self-efficacy did not significantly mediate the observed effects. Conclusions. Self-affirming implementation intentions augmented the effect of alcohol warning labels to reduce subsequent alcohol consumption, but – consistent with the broader self-affirmation literature – it was not clear what mediated the effects. Further research is required to examine whether self-affirming implementation intentions could augment the effects of other kinds of public health-related labelling...|$|R
60|$|Although the squire was not apt {{to observe}} closely what was passing around him, {{he had been}} struck with the old butler's demeanour. That {{something}} was wrong with him was clear. Usually he was the most quiet and methodical of servants, but he had blundered several times in the service. He had handed his master dishes when his plate was already supplied. He had spilled the <b>wine</b> in <b>pouring</b> it out. He had started nervously when spoken to. Mr. Linthorne even thought that he had seen tears in his eyes. Altogether, he was strangely unlike himself.|$|R

When she was in college she took a wine tasting class at a {{restaurant}} in Dallas, Texas. The class was a catalyst for Robinson, instigating her passion for wine. She studied economics and finance and graduated with her economics degree from Southern Methodist University. [...] She worked for Morgan Stanley as an investment banker. She started to volunteer at a local <b>wine</b> shop, <b>pouring</b> <b>wine.</b> She took free classes and met wine industry people. Robinson did a wine tasting for Champagne Krug one day. The next day she quit her job at Morgan Stanley to pursue a career in wine. After quitting, she traveled through Europe by train and foot in 1990, with the goal to learn more about wine. She remained for six months, staying in hostels. She returned and started working in the wine industry. Robinson graduated from the International Culinary Center. She eventually became dean of wine studies at the institution. Robinson lives in Napa Valley, California. She is married and has two children.|$|R

Dispensers store stored wines at cool temperatures and oxygen is prevented from entering the bottle when <b>pouring.</b> <b>Wine</b> dispensers vary greatly in use and function, most commonly wine dispensers are used in restaurants and bars to prevent spoilage when selling wine by the glass.

500|$|Sappho {{was said}} to have three brothers: Erigyius, Larichus, and Charaxus. According to Athenaeus, Sappho often praised Larichus for <b>pouring</b> <b>wine</b> in the town hall of Mytilene, an office held by boys of the best families. This {{indication}} that Sappho was born into an aristocratic family is consistent with the sometimes rarefied environments that her verses record. [...] One ancient tradition tells of a relation between Charaxus and the Egyptian courtesan Rhodopis. Herodotus, the oldest source of the story, reports that Charaxus ransomed Rhodopis for a large sum and that Sappho wrote a poem rebuking him for this.|$|R

He arranged a multitude of putti figures in front of a row of wine vats, joined to one another with vines and bunches of grapes.
