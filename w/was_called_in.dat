5|$|On 21 February 2010 the 21:43 {{service from}} Paris to London broke down just outside Ashford International, {{stranding}} 740 passengers {{for several hours}} while a rescue train <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alan Tudyk applied {{through a}} casting office and {{several months later}} <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> for an audition, where he met with Whedon. He was called back to test with two {{candidates}} {{for the role of}} Zoe (Wash's wife) and was told that it was down to him and one other candidate. The Zoes he tested with were not selected (Gina Torres eventually received the role) and Tudyk was sent home, but received a call informing him he had the part anyway. His audition tape is included in the special features of the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|An early {{draft of}} the {{screenplay}} was written by Chris Conkling, who told {{the bulk of the}} story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view. After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author Peter S. Beagle <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> for a rewrite. According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, on the strength of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises.|$|E

5|$|During the drawn Third Test, opening batsman Sid Barnes was injured. This {{opened up}} a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Hamence made 30 as Australia {{defeated}} Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match before the Fourth Test at Headingley. Hamence was overlooked for the vacancy as Harvey <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in.</b> Australia scored 3/404 to set a world record for the highest successful Test run chase; Harvey scored a century.|$|E
5|$|In Hamden, Connecticut, the National Guard <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> {{to aid in}} {{cleanup and}} keep order, as some looting was {{reported}} in the devastated area. President George H. W. Bush declared the area a disaster area on July 18. The damage was so intense that much of the area was without power for a week, and trees were still being cleared a year later.|$|E
5|$|Just before Najib {{spoke at}} 22:00 MYT, an {{emergency}} meeting <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> Beijing for relatives of Flight 370 passengers. Malaysia Airlines announced that Flight 370 was assumed lost with no survivors. It notified {{most of the}} families in person or via telephone, and some received an SMS (in English and Chinese) informing them that it was highly likely that the aircraft had crashed with no survivors.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of May 20, 2013, the general public witnessed, through a {{dedicated}} webcam, that the bulb had apparently burned out. The next morning, an electrician <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> to confirm its status. It was determined that the bulb had not burned out when the uninterruptible power supply was bypassed, using an extension cord. The dedicated power supply {{was found to have}} been faulty. Approximately seven hours had transpired before the light was reestablished.|$|E
5|$|Steve Woodard {{received}} an unusual no-decision in 2000, when the team's Opening Day {{game against the}} Cincinnati Reds <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> the sixth inning due to rain, with the score tied at 3. This was the first Opening Day tie game since 1965.|$|E
5|$|The {{involvement}} of Lance Reddick and Ashly Burch was revealed in January 2017. Burch voiced Aloy, whose likeness was portrayed by Hannah Hoekstra and motion capture {{was performed by}} Amanda Piery in London. Following an auditioning process in 2014, Burch <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> to do the E3 2015 trailer and worked on the game for two years, providing facial motion capture as well. Her work was done in Los Angeles, with the Dutch developer brought in via Skype. Reddick voiced Sylens and also provided his likeness to the character.|$|E

5|$|The name Burnham {{is derived}} from Burnhamm, as it <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> the will of King Alfred, made up from the Old English words Burna meaning stream and Hamm for enclosure. On-Sea was added later as {{there are several other}} towns of the same name in England.|$|E
5|$|Tom Mankiewicz, {{who worked}} on the three {{preceding}} Bond films, claims he <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> to do an extensive rewrite of the script. Mankiewicz says he did not receive credit, because Broccoli was limited to the number of non-English in key positions he could employ on the films to obtain Eady Levy assistance.|$|E
5|$|After 15:00 an airstrike <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> to {{dislodge}} the surviving Chinese {{in front of}} D Company. However, the attack by two US Marine Corps F4U Corsairs was mistakenly directed at the Australians themselves after their positions were wrongly marked by the spotter plane. Two men were killed and several badly burnt by napalm before the attack was broken off after the company second-in-command—Captain Michael Ryan—ran out under Chinese fire waving a marker panel. The company medical orderly—Private Ronald Dunque—was subsequently awarded the Military Medal for his efforts assisting the wounded despite his own injuries. The Chinese quickly attempted to exploit the chaos, moving against D Company's long exposed eastern flank. 11 Platoon on the main ridge forward of the summit was subjected to a frontal assault; however, unaffected by the napalm, they broke up the Chinese attack and inflicted heavy casualties on them. Regardless, further Chinese attempts to infiltrate the Australian positions continued into the afternoon.|$|E

5|$|An Israeli {{reserve unit}} <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages. They {{entrenched in the}} actual village, which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948, with British escort. Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood in the south, and the railway station. The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base {{just east of the}} village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{forty minutes}} after his collapse, a police {{helicopter}} took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, {{where he was}} pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Dumas refused to sign a burial certificate and a poisons expert from Marseille was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. Two empty tubes of amphetamines and a half-full tube {{were found in the}} rear pocket of his racing jersey, one of which was labelled Tonedron. The British team <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> for questioning and their baggage was searched. Two of the Belgian soigneurs– who looked after riders on the British team including Simpson– locked themselves in their room, got drunk and did not come out.|$|E
5|$|Army Group Centre renewed their {{offensive}} on Moscow in mid-November. Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade {{were held}} back as an operational reserve in the rearward {{area of the}} 9th Army. Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line, and the brigade <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> to fight at the front on 28 December. While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent {{to one or two}} divisions, in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at this point, of which 1,800 were ready for action. The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps, where it defended against attacks in the rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the force}} <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> to manage {{industrial}} disputes {{on a range}} of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|E
5|$|At 10:10 of {{the third}} quarter Roethlisberger {{completed}} a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14–9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the end zone on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison—who <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren—snapped the ball out of the end zone to give the Giants a safety and tie the game. The Giants drove after receiving the safety's kickoff to score a touchdown—taking a 21–14 lead with 3:07 remaining. Pittsburgh was unable to convert on their final two drives, as Roethlisberger threw his fourth interception of the day.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{by three}} tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} wreck were unsuccessful, but the next spring tide carried the {{midsection}} up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>in</b> to remove it: he used gelignite without success, though the explosion {{was reported to have}} broken many windows in the town. In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the Antoinette, surfaced on Town Bar. The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.|$|E
