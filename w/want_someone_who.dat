500|$|An 'It Girl' to me {{is someone}} who is selfless, someone who's always {{thinking}} about others before she thinks about herself. You know, my mom is a very charitable woman, so I'd <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> {{is in line with}} that kind of thought process. I also like a girl who's polite. I feel like that's a lost art, and just saying 'please' and 'thank you' goes a very long way with me. That's just so lost these days. So, ladies, it's OK to say 'thank you.' ...|$|E
500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have {{to stay home and}} mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who were thought to be easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life. I <b>want</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E

6000|$|... "The New York policeman, Comrade John, is, {{like all}} great men, {{somewhat}} peculiar. If {{you go to}} a New York policeman and exhibit a black eye, he is more likely to express admiration for the handiwork of the citizen responsible for the same than sympathy. No; since coming to this city I have developed a habit of taking care of myself, or employing private help.
