The BI-RADS system <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> for describing and classifying abnormal breast imaging findings. For a breast abscess, a percutaneous biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> {{in the case of}} a mass or persistent symptoms (Grade C). For mastalgia, when breast imaging is normal, no MRI or breast biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). Percutaneous biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> for a BI-RADS category 4 - 5 mass (Grade B). For persistent erythematous nipple or atypical eczema lesions, a nipple biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). For distortion and asymmetry, a vacuum core-needle biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> due to the risk of underestimation by simple core-needle biopsy (Grade C). For BI-RADS category 4 - 5 microcalcifications without any ultrasound signal, a minimum 11 -G vacuum core-needle biopsy <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade B). In the absence of microcalcifications on radiography cores additional samples <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade B). For atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, flat epithelial atypia, radial scar and mucocele with atypia, surgical excision <b>is</b> commonly <b>recommended</b> (Grade C).

For these lesions, when excision margins are not clear, no new excision <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> except for LCIS characterized as pleomorphic or with necrosis (Grade C). For grade 1 phyllodes tumor, surgical resection with clear margins <b>is</b> <b>recommended.</b> For grade 2 phyllodes tumor, 10 mm margins <b>are</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). For papillary breast lesions without atypia, complete disappearance of the radiological signal <b>is</b> <b>recommended</b> (Grade C).
