Two years later, over a family meal of chicken, Dahmer asked his father <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{bones of the}} chicken were {{to be placed in}} a bleach solution. Lionel Dahmer was, by this stage, concerned as to his elder son's placid and lethargic attitude and his solitary existence; therefore, he was delighted at the initiative displayed by his son towards what he believed to be scientific curiosity. He willingly demonstrated to his son how to safely bleach and (later) preserve animal bones. This knowledge regarding the cleansing and preserving of bones would be used by Dahmer on many of the animal remains which he continued to avidly collect.|$|E
25|$|In reality, for MACSOG, {{the point}} was moot. Suspicions abounded within the {{organization}} that Operation Timberwork had been penetrated by communist dich van agents. The intelligence returns from the northern agent teams had been strangely lax and {{more than three-quarters of}} the agents inserted had been captured either during or not long after their arrival. The fact that SOG had slavishly followed the CIA's failed formula for three years was not considered a contributing factor. The unit was more concerned over Washington's continuous rejection of one of the original goals of the operation, the formation of a resistance movement by possible dissident elements within North Vietnam. Washington's stated goal in the conflict was a free and viable South Vietnam, not the overthrow of the Hanoi regime. The conundrum was <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> program had succeeded. The best possible outcome would have been a repeat of the ill-fated Hungarian uprising of 1956, brutally crushed by the Soviet Union, and about which the U.S. could do nothing.|$|E

25|$|Juin {{became a}} {{prisoner}} of war, and was held in Oflag IV-B Koenigstein, a prison camp for officers in Königstein Fortress in Saxony. While in prison {{he was promoted to}} général de division. He was released in June 1941 at the request of Pétain, now the head of the Vichy Government, in exchange for thirty German sailors, as a specialist in North African affairs. He was promoted to Général de corps d'armée on 16 July, and became commander of the troops in Morocco. Admiral François Darlan offered him the post of Minister for War following the death of Général d'armée Charles Huntziger in November 1941, but Juin turned down the offer, saying that he only wished to serve in North Africa. On 20 November, he was promoted to Général de corps d'armée, replacing Weygand as commander of French land forces in North Africa. In December he led a French mission to Germany that met with Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring to discuss <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> German-Italian Panzerarmee Afrika was driven out of Libya by Operation Crusader. This did not occur, but a dispute over what should be done led to Juin relieving de Lattre of command of the forces in Tunisia, permanently damaging their friendship.|$|E

500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too easy for him to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario to see <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E

500|$|The {{first series}} of {{promotions}} in the United Kingdom adopted the strapline [...] "What if...?", and explored various [...] "dream-like" [...] scenarios.

The next few pieces of the campaign, [...] "Pecking Order", [...] "Seats", and [...] "Bus Lane" [...] for television and [...] "Doodle", [...] "Big Grin", and [...] "Oblonger" [...] for radio, became progressively more surreal, and featured oddities ranging from a traffic cone draped in leopard fur to trees growing traffic lights from their branches. In 2002, Matt Gooden, a creative director, and Ben Walker, a copywriter, proposed a new television and cinema advertisement to promote the seventh-generation Honda Accord line that had recently been rolled out in Europe and Japan. The advertisement, based on a complex chain reaction of moving parts from the Accord itself, was approved and given the working title [...] "Cog".|$|E

Dean and Annie revive Hogarth, and the he helps return the Giant to his docile state, while Dean explains the situation to the military. Rogard is ready to stand down when Kent panics and orders the missile launch. Rogard furiously reminds Kent that the missile is locked onto the Giant's current position and they will all be killed in the blast radius. Kent tries to escape but the Giant stops him, and Rogard's men secure him. Hogarth explains to the Giant <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> missile strikes.
