Previously, a custom designed space-based constellation, while technically feasible, would require a substantial monetary investment. However, commercial industry has now been entertaining the concept of hosting payloads on their space-based constellations resulting in low-cost access to space. Examples include the low Earth orbit Iridium Next constellation as well as communication satellites in geostationary orbit. In some of these constellations, data distribution can be provided in real time, a feature relevant to applications {{in the areas of}} space weather and disaster monitoring. Future small-satellite constellations and hosting on commercial satellite constellations also provide outstanding opportunities for Earth remote sensing applications. In particular, we consider multi-spectral <b>weather</b> <b>sensors</b> to address gaps in future terrestrial weather needs. We will present concepts for <b>weather</b> <b>sensors</b> that are very compact, low mass, and low power, and so they can easily be accommodated on micro-satellites and hosted payloads.
