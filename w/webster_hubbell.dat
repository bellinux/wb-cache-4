25|$|This case {{involved}} the second prosecution of <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell</b> by the Independent Counsel.

25|$|United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27 (2000), was United States Supreme Court case {{involving}} <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell,</b> {{who had been}} indicted on various tax-related charges, and mail and wire fraud charges, based on documents {{that the government had}} subpoenaed from him. The Fifth Amendment provides that no person “shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” The Supreme Court has, since 1976, applied the so-called “act-of-production doctrine.” Under this doctrine, a person can invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against the production of documents only where the very act of producing the documents is incriminating in itself.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1998, Independent Counsel Starr {{released}} the Starr Report, concerning offenses {{alleged to have}} been committed by President Clinton, {{as part of the}} Lewinsky scandal. The report mentioned Whitewater only in passing; Clinton friend and advisor, Vernon Jordan, had tried to help <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell</b> financially with [...] "no-show" [...] consulting contracts while he was under pressure to cooperate with the Whitewater investigations. Indeed, it was on this basis that Starr took on the Lewinsky investigation, under the umbrella of the Whitewater Independent Counsel mandate.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{apparent}} {{from the text}} of the subpoena itself that the prosecutor needed respondent's assistance both to identify potential sources of information and to produce those sources.... Given the breadth of the description of the 11 categories of documents called for by the subpoena, the collection and production <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell</b> of the materials demanded was tantamount to answering a series of interrogatories asking a witness this case, <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell</b> to disclose the existence and location of particular documents fitting certain broad descriptions. The assembly of literally hundreds of pages of material in response to a request for [...] "any and all documents reflecting, referring, or relating to any direct or indirect sources of money or other things of value received by or provided to" [...] an individual or members of his family during a 3-year period ... is the functional equivalent of the preparation of an answer to either a detailed written interrogatory or a series of oral questions at a discovery deposition. Entirely apart from the contents of the 13,120 pages of materials that respondent produced in this case, it is undeniable that providing a catalog of existing documents fitting within any of the 11 broadly worded subpoena categories could provide a prosecutor with a [...] "lead to incriminating evidence," [...] or [...] "a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute." ...|$|E

5000|$|Norman Ornstein, a Congressional {{expert at}} the American Enterprise Institute said in May 1998, [...] "Barring some {{dramatic}} change, I think the Burton investigation {{is going to be}} remembered as a case study in how not to do a congressional investigation and as a prime example of investigation as farce." [...] In a May 5, 1998, letter to other Republicans on the committee, Burton admitted that [...] "mistakes and omissions were made" [...] in tape transcripts released to the public of phone calls made by <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell.</b> A committee investigator who was an advocate of releasing the tapes resigned at Burton's request.|$|E
5000|$|Born {{and raised}} in Little Rock, Arkansas, <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell</b> was a three-sport letterman at Hall High School. He {{attended}} the University of Arkansas on a football scholarship where he played offensive tackle for the Arkansas Razorbacks. In his senior year, the Razorbacks were SWC co-champions and beat undefeated Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. Hubbell was selected in the eighth round (197th overall) in the 1969 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, but an injury ended his football career. [...] He graduated from the University of Arkansas {{with a degree in}} Electrical Engineering in 1970, then graduated with a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Arkansas School of Law with honors.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, he was {{admitted}} to the New York Bar; he {{is also a member of}} the District of Columbia bar. He was an Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (1969-1974), senior law clerk for Supreme Court justice Byron R. White (1974-1977). He was the chief prosecutor in the trial of W. Mark Felt and Edward S. Miller in 1980. In 1987, he was chief counsel for the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran. It investigated the Iran-Contra affair, and he interrogated witnesses such as Oliver North. In 1999, he represented <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell,</b> who pled guilty to charges of fraud and income tax evasion.|$|E
5000|$|After Clinton's 1992 election, Foster joined Clinton's presidential {{transition}} team. [...] Once Clinton was inaugurated, Foster {{joined his}} White House staff as Deputy White House Counsel in early 1993. This was despite Foster's initial reluctance {{to leave his}} Little Rock life behind and come to Washington. There he worked under the White House Counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, although Nussbaum would consider the pair to be [...] "co-senior partners". [...] He was also joined with two other Rose Law Firm partners: William H. Kennedy, III, who served as his associate counsel, and <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell,</b> who became Associate Attorney General. [...] The Foster residence was a small rented house in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{economic}} realm, Rose has been termed [...] "the ultimate establishment law firm" [...] {{in the state}} and [...] "the legal arm of the powerful". During the 1970s, for example, its clients included Tyson Foods, Wal-Mart, large brokerage Stephens Inc., Worthen Bank, and the Arkansas Democrat and other Hussman family media holdings. [...] Hillary Rodham became the firm's first female associate, and soon its first female partner, during her husband Bill Clinton's tenure as Arkansas Attorney General and Governor of Arkansas. <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell,</b> Vince Foster, and William H. Kennedy, III were also partners, before becoming Assistant Attorney General, Deputy White House Counsel, and Associate White House Counsel in the Clinton administration, respectively. [...] In all, the firm grew five times in size between the early 1970s and early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971, Foster joined Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in 1974 {{was made}} partner, {{one of only}} nine in the firm at the time. He {{was the head of}} the Arkansas Bar Association {{committee}} that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients. [...] Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate (and later first female partner); Foster and fellow partner <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell</b> were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman. [...] Foster and Rodham worked together on a number of cases. [...] And as Bill Clinton's political career gained force, Foster supported him. [...] They were also personal friends and Foster was the one who taught their daughter Chelsea Clinton how to swim.|$|E
5000|$|Theodore B. Olson, {{who with}} several associates, {{launched}} {{the plan that}} later {{became known as the}} [...] "Arkansas Project", wrote several essays for The American Spectator, accusing Clinton and many of his associates of wrongdoing. The first of those pieces appeared in February 1994, alleging a wide variety of criminal offenses by the Clintons and others, including <b>Webster</b> <b>Hubbell.</b> These allegations led to the discovery that Hubbell, a friend and former Rose Law Firm partner of Hillary Clinton, had committed multiple frauds, mostly against his own firm. Hillary Clinton, instead of being complicit in Hubbell's crimes, had been among his victims. In December 1994, one week after Hubbell pleaded guilty to mail fraud and tax evasion, Associate White House Counsel, Jane C. Sherburne, created a [...] "Task List" [...] which included a reference to monitoring Hubbell's cooperation with Starr. Hubbell was later recorded in prison saying [...] "I need to roll over one more time" [...] regarding the Rose Law firm lawsuit. In his next court appearance, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination (see United States v. Hubbell).|$|E
