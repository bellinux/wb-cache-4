5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are <b>washed</b> <b>and</b> mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was <b>washed</b> <b>and</b> dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E

Since 2005, participants in the LDS Church version of the ritual already come clothed in the temple garment and wear it during the <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> anointing. In the original version of the ceremony, water and oil were applied to various parts of the body by the officiator as specific blessings related to the body parts were mentioned; since the early-21st century, the water and oil are applied only to the head and the symbolic nature of the <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> anointing is emphasized as the blessings for the body parts are related.|$|R

Only after taking bath in cold water, and after wearing such clothes, would the person be in a state of madi.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural {{practices}} such as burning of vegetation and stover in the sloping regions around Lake Colcibolca have resulted in significant sedimentation of the lake. The sediments flowing into the lake are volcanic and become clay when introduced with water forming an impermeable layer of sediment throughout the lake. Navigation on the San Juan River and in Lake Nicaragua {{are affected by the}} progressive sedimentation of both water bodies. Navigation is also an important source of pollution of the water resources, {{due to the fact that}} boats are <b>washed</b> <b>and</b> serviced in both water bodies.|$|E

50|$|In August 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{unveiled}} a global strategy and action plan to integrate WASH with other public health interventions {{in order to}} accelerate elimination of NTDs. The plan aims to intensify control or eliminate certain NTDs in specific regions by 2020. It refers to the NTD roadmap milestones that included for example eradication of dracunculiasis by 2015 and of yaws by 2020, elimination of trachoma and lymphatic filariasis as public health problems by 2020, intensified control of dengue, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases. The plan consists of four strategic objectives: Improving awareness of benefits of joint <b>WASH</b> <b>and</b> NTD actions; monitoring <b>WASH</b> <b>and</b> NTD actions to track progress; strengthening evidence of how to deliver effective <b>WASH</b> interventions; <b>and</b> planning, delivering <b>and</b> evaluating <b>WASH</b> <b>and</b> NTD programmes with involvement of all stakeholders.

25|$|Generally yarn is skeined {{directly}} after spinning or plying. This {{is because}} after spinning or plying the yarn generally gets <b>washed,</b> <b>and</b> a skein {{is the best}} form to have the yarn in for washing. Although balls are easier for knitters and crocheters to use because they don't get tangled as easily, yarn is sometimes taken from a ball and reskeined {{in order to measure}} the yardage of leftover yarn, store it without tension, or to wash out kinks if the yarn was unraveled.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by neoclassical tastes, the short-waisted dresses sported soft, loose {{skirts and}} were often made of white, almost {{transparent}} muslin, which was easily <b>washed</b> <b>and</b> draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues. Since the fabric {{clung to the}} body, revealing what was underneath, it made nudity à la grecque a centerpiece of public spectacle.

The juice will be extracted out by a juice extraction system. The outer skin, seed, stem, and fiber of fruits would be separated from the juice in a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.|$|E

40|$|Background: Heavy metal {{pollution}} {{has always}} been a major cause of environmental contamination and considered a concern for food health. Rice is the most popular food among Iranians and the presence of heavy metals in rice as trace level has received special attention because they are directly related to health. In Iran, it is customary for people to <b>wash</b> <b>and</b> soak the rice before cooking. The aim of this research was to investigate the contents of heavy metals (Pb, Cd and As) in Iranian and imported rice after <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> soaking in Kermanshah in 2011. Methods: 21 samples of the most widely consumed brands of Iranian and imported rice were purchased from local supermarkets in Kermanshah, Iran. 3 samples of each brand were collected and specific volumes of each sample were digested with acid. Heavy metal contents in the digested samples were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: The results showed that the concentration means of Pb, Cd and As in the Iranian rice samples were 275. 17 µg/kg, 13. 28 µg/kg, 53. 69 µg/kg, respectively before <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> concentration means after <b>washing</b> <b>and</b> soaking were 236. 96 µg/kg, 12. 31 µg/kg, 44. 06 µg/kg, respectively.

25|$|Picholine or directly-brined type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives, {{they are}} soaked in lye {{typically}} {{for longer periods}} than Spanish style (e.g. 10–72 hours) until the solution has penetrated three-quarters of {{the way into the}} fruit. They are then <b>washed</b> <b>and</b> immediately brined and acid corrected with citric acid to achieve microbial stability. Fermentation still occurs carried out by acidogenic yeast and bacteria, but is more subdued than other methods. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds and a series of progressively stronger concentrations of salt are added until the product is fully stabilized and ready to be eaten.|$|E
25|$|Salt-cured type (olives {{with minor}} fermentation): Applied only to ripe olives, {{they are usually}} {{produced}} in Morocco, Turkey, and other eastern Mediterranean countries. Once picked, the olives are vigorously <b>washed</b> <b>and</b> packed in alternating layers with salt. The high concentrations of salt draw the moisture out of olives, dehydrating and shriveling them until they look somewhat analogous to a raisin. Once packed in salt, fermentation is minimal and only initiated by the most halophilic yeast species such as Debaryomyces hansenii. Once cured, they are sold in their natural state without any additives. So-called Oil-cured olives are cured in salt, and then soaked in oil.|$|E
