5|$|The Arena browser (also {{known as}} the Arena WWW Browser) is an early (now discontinued) testbed Web browser and <b>Web</b> <b>authoring</b> tool for Unix. Originally {{authored}} by Dave Raggett in 1993, the browser continued its development at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing. As a testbed browser, Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww.

Others countered that the problems ascribed {{to the use of}} XHTML could mostly be attributed to two main sources: the production of invalid XHTML documents by some <b>Web</b> <b>authors</b> and the lack of support for XHTML built into Internet Explorer 6. They went on to describe the benefits of XML-based Web documents (i.e. XHTML) regarding searching, indexing and parsing as well as future-proofing the Web itself.|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsers {{sharing and}} <b>authoring</b> of <b>Web</b> {{contents}} via different Web sites {{is the main}} idea of the Web 2. 0. However, Web users belong to different communities and follow their own semantics (referred to as contexts) to represent and interpret Web contents. Therefore, they encounter discrepancies {{when they have to}} interpret <b>Web</b> contents <b>authored</b> by different persons. This paper proposes a context-aware interaction approach that helps <b>Web</b> <b>authors</b> annotate <b>Web</b> contents with their local context information, so that it becomes possible for Web browsers to personalize these contents according to different usersâ€™ local contexts...|$|R
5000|$|Macromedia {{made two}} {{acquisitions}} in 1996. First, in March 1996, Macromedia acquired iBand Software, {{makers of the}} fledgling Backstage HTML authoring-tool and application-server. Macromedia developed a new HTML-authoring tool, Macromedia Dreamweaver, around portions of the Backstage codebase and released the first version in 1997. At the time, most professional <b>web</b> <b>authors</b> preferred to code HTML by hand using text editors because they wanted full control over the source. Dreamweaver addressed this with its [...] "Roundtrip HTML" [...] feature, which attempted to preserve the fidelity of hand-edited source code during visual edits, allowing users to work {{back and forth between}} visual and code editing. Over the next few years Dreamweaver became widely adopted among professional <b>web</b> <b>authors,</b> though many still preferred to hand-code, and Microsoft FrontPage remained a strong competitor among amateur and business users.|$|R

40|$|The {{culture of}} lay {{indexing}} {{has been created}} by the aggregation strategy employed by web search engines such as Google. Meaning is constructed in this culture by harvesting semantic content from web pages and using hyperlinks as a plebiscite for the most important web pages. The characteristic tension {{of the culture of}} lay indexing is between genuine information and spam. Google's success requires maintaining the secrecy of its parsing algorithm despite the efforts of <b>web</b> <b>authors</b> to gain advantage over the Googlebot. Legacy methods of asserting meaning such as the META keywords tag and Dublin Core are inappropriate in the lawless meaning space of the open Web.

40|$|International audienceWeb {{usability}} {{has been}} considered as a key issue {{to the success of}} the Web. However, Web readers typically face difficulties since Web pages are presented according to local contexts of <b>Web</b> <b>authors.</b> <b>Web</b> <b>authors</b> and readers follow their own local contexts to repreresent and interpret Web contents as they still originate from different communities. Hence, there is a need to transform Web contents created according to the authorsâ€™ contexts into the different contexts of their readers. In this paper, we aim at presenting a solution that provides Web contents according to the readerâ€™s context. Our solution is based on an explicit representation of the authorsâ€™ and readersâ€™ local contexts. We rely on RDFa to annotate contents with the authorâ€™s context and we provide an adaptation process on client-side that generates contextualized Web contents according to the readersâ€™ contexts. We validate our approach through a Firefox extension...|$|R
