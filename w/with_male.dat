5|$|Although each {{adult and}} {{independent}} juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, <b>with</b> <b>male</b> rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting {{out to sea}} when resting and eating, sea otters may wrap themselves in kelp.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, <b>with</b> <b>male</b> background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances <b>with</b> <b>male</b> background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E

5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates <b>with</b> <b>male</b> quality.|$|E
5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters <b>with</b> <b>male</b> song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} {{depart from the}} findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the mean age of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, <b>with</b> <b>male</b> orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|E

5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian tree sparrow {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} {{in many parts of}} the world <b>with</b> <b>male</b> hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Manual's {{enrollment}} numbers, {{which had}} hovered around 400 since the 1890s, soared from 429 in 1919 to 1,039 in 1925. The Manual Crimsons football team, which {{had also been}} consolidated with Male's from 1915 to 1918, had great success in the 1920s, beating Male {{two years in a}} row for the first time in its history. Manual shared athletic facilities <b>with</b> <b>Male</b> for many years, but in the early 1920s alumni raised funds to construct Manual Stadium. The stadium opened in 1924 with 14,021 permanent seats. It was one of the largest high school stadiums in America at the time. The original structure was condemned and closed in 1952 after years of heavy use and minimal upkeep, and was reopened after being rebuilt in 1954. Its modern capacity is 11,463.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1980s FGM {{was widely}} known in English as female circumcision, {{implying}} an equivalence in severity <b>with</b> <b>male</b> circumcision. From 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council {{referred to it}} as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary. References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female genital mutilation in the title of a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females.|$|E
5|$|Wilde was {{initially}} {{buried in the}} Cimetière de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery, inside the city. His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. It was commissioned by Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment {{to be made for}} his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950. The modernist angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete <b>with</b> <b>male</b> genitalia, which have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis to replace them.|$|E
5|$|A queen will {{mate with}} one or more males, and during colony {{foundation}} she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. The life cycle of the ant from egg to adult takes several months. Myrmecia workers exhibit greater longevity in comparison to other ants, and workers are also able to reproduce <b>with</b> <b>male</b> ants. Myrmecia {{is one of the most}} primitive group of ants on earth, exhibiting differentiated behaviours from other ants. Workers are solitary hunters and do not lead other workers to food. Adults are omnivores that feed on sweet substances, but the larvae are carnivores that feed on captured prey. Very few predators eat these ants due to their sting, but their larvae are often consumed by blindsnakes and echidnas, and a number of parasites infect both adults and brood. Some species are also effective pollinators.|$|E

5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been <b>with</b> <b>male</b> writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves <b>with</b> <b>male</b> standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, <b>with</b> <b>male</b> birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E
