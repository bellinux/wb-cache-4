40|$|Demands {{on women}} in middle and senior {{leadership}} positions in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> institutions inevitably challenge their well-being. How they manage these demands is strongly related to their sense of coherence and their spirituality, constructs that have demonstrated positive relations with general and work-related well-being. This study aims to explore the construction of sense of coherence and spirituality of <b>women</b> leaders in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> institutions. It adopts a qualitative research approach, applying constructivist grounded theory. The sample comprises 13 academic and support services <b>women</b> working in <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> who belong to the <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> Resource Services South Africa network, a non-profit organisation that promotes leadership development and representation of women in senior positions in <b>higher</b> <b>education.</b> This study contributes to knowledge on gender-specific well-being concepts by presenting qualitative findings on women leaders’ life-orientation in terms of sense of coherence and spirituality in a <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> institution in South Africa. Themes from the interview data provide key insights on three subcomponents of sense of coherence: manageability, comprehensibility, and meaningfulness. Spirituality furthermore emerged as constructed in inner-connectedness, trans-personality, and a coping resource in the work context. Meaningfulness emerged as central to the life-orientation and spirituality of <b>women</b> leaders in <b>higher</b> <b>education.</b> Finally, a core theoretical idea is presented in proposing an integrated psycho-spiritual perspective, with meaningfulness as central, grounded in a motivational and relational orientation, and facilitating the potential well-being of <b>women</b> leaders in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> institutions.

40|$|Patterns of {{attendance}} in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> in America {{as a whole}} have increased. Increasingly, people are finding that they need a college or technical degree to achieve financial stability and success. This holds true for subsets of the population who were traditionally excluded from <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> such as females and minorities. However, though {{the population as a}} whole is increasing their patterns {{of attendance}} in <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> there is one group notably left behind. Patterns of <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> for female Hispanics or Latinas are the exception to the rule that attendance is improving for the entire population.

In order to identify some of the barriers that Latinas in Rhode Island faced specifically, an online survey instrument was created and disseminated to individuals throughout Rhode Island. The survey focuses on identification of barriers to educational attainment unique to Latinas.

The idea of organizational opportunity provides the basis of the study, and the tenets of the 2 ̆ 2 new scholarship on women and education 2 ̆ 2 which incorporates a feminist perspective provides the framework for the study 2 ̆ 7 s design and methodology. ^ The participants were invited to take part in the study, and the sample was drawn from individual member listings of the current directories of three <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> associations. The participants are women mid-level administrators in selected public, state-supported universities in California with the functional title: Dean of Students (when not identified as the chief student affairs officer), Director of Housing or Residential Education, and Director of Student Activities or College Union. ^ Qualitative research methods were used in collecting the data through the use of a guided, open ended, in-depth interview with the participants. The study 2 ̆ 7 s research questions focus on: (1) how <b>women</b> in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> administration describe organizational opportunity; (2) what organizational opportunities <b>women</b> in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> administration describe as needing to develop professionally; (3) how <b>women</b> in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> administration create organizational opportunity; and (4) what conditions <b>women</b> in <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> administration describe that increase and diminish organizational opportunity for their development. ^ The analysis of the data reveals five major frameworks of the concept of organizational opportunity: (1) Organizational Context; (2) Creating Opportunity; (3) Organizational Access; (4) Organizational Support Through Mentors, and (5) Personal Factors Affecting Organizational Opportunity.
