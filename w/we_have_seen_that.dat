25|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> forcing {{can be done}} using Boolean-valued models, by {{constructing}} a Boolean algebra with ultrafilter from a poset with a generic subset. It is also possible to go back the other way: given a Boolean algebra B, we can form a poset P of all the nonzero elements of B, and a generic ultrafilter on B restricts to a generic set on P. So the techniques of forcing and Boolean-valued models are essentially equivalent.|$|E
25|$|The {{logic of}} this {{concession}} points irresistibly to {{the contention that}} the Thirteenth Amendment operates only to protect the African race. This {{is evident from the}} fact that nowhere in the record does it appear that the parties charged to have been wronged by the defendants had ever been themselves slaves, or were the descendants of slaves. They took no more from the Amendment than any other citizens of the United States. But if, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>that</b> denounces a condition possible for all races and all individuals, then a like wrong perpetrated by white men upon a Chinese, or by black men upon a white man, or by any men upon any man on account of his race, would come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and that protection of individual rights which, prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, was unquestionably within the jurisdiction solely of the states, would, by virtue of that Amendment, be transferred to the nation, and subject to the legislation of Congress.|$|E

500|$|During {{its peak}} years in early 2000, SpongeBob SquarePants {{received}} enormous ratings {{and number of}} viewers. By 2012, {{it was reported that}} the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the show might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger, directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.

But what if we are a bit wrong in creating such impulses? Adding small perturbations to the equations and solving them numerically, it is possible to show that mono-dimensional solitons are stable. They are often referred as [...] solitons, meaning that they are limited in one dimension (x or t, as we have seen) and propagate in another one (z).|$|E
