500|$|Trumble {{was known}} for his cleverness on the field. C. B. Fry said of him, [...] "He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and {{changing}} bowlers." [...] On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to follow-on (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action, he replied, [...] "I had to do it, old chap, but I wonder <b>what</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> will think of it?" [...] Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; New Zealand cricketer, Dan Reese, who played against and alongside Trumble said, [...] "His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Townshend {{was born}} {{ten days after}} Nazi Germany {{surrendered}} in the Second World War {{and grew up in}} the shadow of reconstruction in and around London. According to Townshend, postwar trauma was {{the driving force behind the}} rock music revolution in the UK. “Trauma is passed from generation to generation,” he said, “I’ve unwittingly inherited <b>what</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> experienced.” Townshend notes that growing up in this period produced the narrative that runs through his music of a boy lost in the stresses and pressures of postwar life. In his autobiography, he wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|Phillips, {{a native}} of the North Central section of Detroit, Michigan, grew up in a rough neighborhood. His father, Virgil, wanted to keep him off the streets, so he created a program called REACH (an acronym for religion, education, athletics, {{character}} and hope) where Rashad and others could go to play basketball and stay out of trouble. Later, when he was a senior at college, Phillips said, [...] "I thank God every day for giving me a father who did the things he did for me... I've seen a lot of people fall victim to the streets, but that was never an option for me. I always had a gym to go to. <b>What</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> has done has saved so many lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, law {{enforcement}} officials such as Spencer Lawton, the former Chatham County prosecutor who put Davis on trial, remained convinced of the evidence for Davis's guilt and that Davis's supporters [...] "would know differently if {{they looked at the}} record." [...] He stated: [...] "We have consistently won the case as it has been presented in court. We have consistently lost the case as it has been presented in the public realm, on TV and elsewhere." [...] Members of MacPhail's family were also convinced of Davis's guilt, and thought his execution would bring a measure of peace. His mother reported [...] "That hole in my heart will be there until the day I die, but it [...] may give me some peace and quiet." [...] Mark MacPhail, Jr. stated [...] "It's not animosity or anger or rage that has kept us going; that's not <b>what</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would want. It's justice. The law is what he was all about. That's what we have to uphold." ...|$|E

6000|$|She spared him the invidious {{answer to}} this as, a moment before, his eagerness had spared her reserve; she flung over the [...] "ground" [...] that his {{question}} laid bare the light veil of an evasion, [...] "'Great people,' I've learned to see, mustn't--to remain great--do <b>what</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Unfortunately, Low {{accepted}} this speech literally {{and with his}} remorseless gravity. [...] "If my name annoys you, I can get it changed by the legislature, you know, and I can find out <b>what</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> name was, and take that. My mother, who died in giving me birth, {{was the daughter of}} a chief." ...|$|R
