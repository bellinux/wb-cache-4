5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> come up with a special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E

[...] "The first thing that we said was, 'Too fast'. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{decelerate}} the action. I did a few more matte shots to slow it down. We made it a little bit slower, by putting breathing room back in so there'd be a two-hour oxygen supply for the audience." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Manson recalled, [...] "The {{making of}} this record was very sad for me. Being {{the only girl}} in a gang of four can get pretty lonely. We were all {{struggling}} to find our chemistry together, and as a result, the experience of making and promoting this was tense and unenjoyable. Ironically, our shows were selling out every night.

500|$|Under {{the working}} title [...] "Jellybean", {{the film was}} shot over a span of six weeks in fifty-two locales {{throughout}} the city of Atlanta. Filming {{took place in the}} summer, sometimes in temperatures over a hundred degrees, challenging the cast and crew's ability to stay motivated. [...] "A lot of times we had to motivate each other to say 'listen, up your game. Go hard,'" [...] said Robinson.

Hoglan approached Dark Angel guitarist Jim Durkin: [...] "He came up to me one day and started giving me his criticisms of the band. He said <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be more evil.

500|$|In mid-2000, {{the band}} signed with Richard Branson's V2 Records.

[...] That's what <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> hear." [...] The freedom V2 afforded through its {{hands-off}} approach influenced not only the music, but the album title as well.

500|$|Years later, showrunner D. B. Weiss {{commented that}} the {{explicit}} style of the execution scene was selected in part {{to make it clear}} to the viewers that Eddard Stark, despite being the arguable protagonist of season one, actually was dead: [...] "It’s that rule: 'If you don't see the body then they’re not really dead.' [...] Like when we cut Ned’s head off, we didn’t want a gory Monty Python geyser of blood, but <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> see the blade enter his neck and cut out on the frame where the blade was mid-neck. [...] we needed Ned's death to be totally unambiguous." ...|$|E

500|$|Josh Weinstein has {{expressed}} regret about killing off Grimes after only one episode, describing him as [...] "such an amazing character." [...] In {{an interview with}} The Believer, producer George Meyer said, [...] "Grimes's cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield.

He said things that needed to be said, but once they were said, <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> destroy that person. I'll admit, we took a certain sadistic glee in his downfall.

500|$|On 16 May 1998, Arsenal contested the 1998 FA Cup Final against Newcastle United.

As {{a result of the}} recording troubles with Eternal Idol, Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. [...] "It was a completely new start", Iommi said. [...] "I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided that <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> build up some credibility again". Iommi enlisted former Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell, long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist Laurence Cottle, and rented a [...] "very cheap studio in England".|$|E
