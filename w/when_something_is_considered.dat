The first concerns {{the fact that}} premenstrual syndrome (PMS) can be recognised by the criminal law and {{used as the basis}} of an excuse or in mitigation. The second takes as its starting point the existing academic criticism of the infanticide offence/defence, which in turn gives rise {{to the question of whether}} postnatal illnesses should be able to give rise to a criminal defence or be employed as a factor that goes to mitigation of sentence. In order to move both debates further, I draw on theories from medicine, philosophy and law and I consider the following issues and their impact on the specific questions in this thesis: 1) When are particular symptoms or experiences classified as disease or illness and what is the significance of these labels? 2) What is the theoretical basis for holding an individual criminally responsible and when should people suffering from mental disorder be wholly or partially excused or be able to raise a condition in mitigation? 3) To what extent does the existing criminal law meet these requirements and/or how should it be reformed in order to do so? I begin by looking at the current legal position and at the way in which the legal debate in this area has been conducted so far. I identify a number of questions that have characterised the so-called ‘feminist debate’ which centres around authors who object to the formal recognition of female-specific medical problems for gender-political reasons. An examination of the principal medical literature on both conditions demonstrates that although the symptoms and aetiologies of the two conditions are not settled, their existence is not doubted by medical science. Furthermore, both can be regarded as subcategories of the generic group of mental disorders categorised as depression. I answer the question of <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> a disease by demonstrating the philosophical underpinnings of the concept. The disease and illness labels are used to signify that an individual is not regarded as responsible for their symptoms and thus is excused by society from partaking in their normal social role when ill.

Architecture {{has always had a}} relationship with time, but historically this relationship has been troubled. In 2013 we as architects are currently operating under a false assumption that architecture should only be in a relationship with commodity. This is producing architecture with a very short shelf life, and the architecture is secondary to the commodity it houses. Contemporary architecture only lasts for thirty to one hundred and fifty years and is constrained by budget, the building industry and material warranties. Contemporary society is fast paced and rapidly changing. This rapid change has manifested itself in our architecture and our perception of scales of time. In the modern era, <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> permanent it only lasts roughly one hundred years. Our perception of time in the future and the past is small {{in the grand scheme of}} history. However, this has not always been the case. We have produced architecture that spanned millennia in the past and when we did we've produced great architecture. How is it that great architecture of the past was able to overcome budget, and dedicate itself to time? These great architectures all had great motivating factors that trumped budget, and were perceived as permanent. These motivating factors include; religion, body politic, or precious resources such as water. The societies that built the architecture though that their way of life, their government, etcetera, as permanent. This thesis states that it is possible to align architecture back with time when dedicated to a motivating factor without a limit of time. The thesis project aligns itself with nuclear waste. Nuclear energy will be necessary to serve the energy needs of a rapidly growing population, and as the technology becomes safer and more efficient it will be more prevalent in cities. The only problem with Nuclear energy is the waste. I'm proposing an architecture that aligns nuclear waste with the public through a public bath. Bathing is a tradition in most cultures that has lasted for thousands of years, and will continue in some way for thousands more. The time is 3013 and the site is an inundated Cambridge, Massachusetts. MIT has moved it's nuclear research facilities to an island just east of what was once Central Square, and the nuclear waste from the research is used to warm the waters of a public bath. by John Maher.
