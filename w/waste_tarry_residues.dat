50|$|The {{carbonization}} of wood in {{an industrial}} setting usually requires a temperature above 280°C, which liberates energy and hence this reaction {{is said to be}} exothermic. This carbonization, which can also be seen as a spontaneous breakdown of the wood, continues until only the carbonised residue called charcoal remains. Unless further external heat is provided, the process stops and the temperature reaches a maximum of about 400°C. This charcoal, however, will still contain appreciable amounts of <b>tarry</b> <b>residue,</b> together with the ash of the original wood.|$|R

40|$|The {{synthetic}} dye industry {{is regarded as}} the first science-based industry, which began in 1856 with the discovery of aniline purple, later called mauve, by William Henry Perkin (1838 - 1907, Fig. 1). Perkin, an eighteen year old student at the Royal College of Chemistry in London, was attempting to synthesize quinine, a natural product important in the treatment of the malaria plaguing British colonists. This followed the suggestion of his mentor, August Wilhelm Hofmann, a German chemist and head of the College. The experiment failed. Perkin then repeated the experiment, this time oxidizing aniline, a coal tar derivative, with potassium dichromate, yielding not quinine, but a <b>tarry</b> <b>residue.</b> The eureka moment occurred when he noticed the solution on workup stained cloth a brilliant purple...|$|R

50|$|The {{shift to}} the CWG process {{initially}} resulted in a reduced output of water gas tar {{as compared to the}} volume of coal tars. The advent of automobiles reduced the availability of naphtha for carburetion oil, as that fraction was desirable as motor fuel. MGPs that shifted to heavier grades of oil often experienced problems with the production of tar-water emulsions, which were difficult, time consuming, and costly to break. (The cause of tar changewater emulsions is complex and was related to several factors, including free carbon in the carburetion oil and the substitution of bituminous coal as a feedstock instead of coke.)

40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} of {{the crude}} glycerol from a biodiesel production plant was investigated by thermogravimetry coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The main gaseous products are discussed, and the thermogravimetric kinetics derived. There were four distinct phases in the pyrolysis {{process of the}} crude glycerol. The presence of water and methanol in the crude glycerol and responsible for the first decomposition phase, were shown to catalyse glycerol decomposition (second phase). Unlike the pure compound, crude glycerol decomposition below 500 K leaves behind a large mass fraction of pyrolysis residues (ca. 15 %), which eventually partially eliminate in two phases upon reaching significantly higher temperatures (700 and 970 K, respectively). An improved iterative Coats-Redfern method {{was used to evaluate}} non-isothermal kinetic parameters in each phase. The latter were then utilised to model the decomposition behaviour in non-isothermal conditions. The power law model (first order) predicted accurately the main (second) and third phases in the pyrolysis of the crude glycerol. Differences of 10 - 30 kJ/mol in activation energies between crude and pure glycerol in their main decomposition phase corroborated the catalytic effect of water and methanol in the crude pyrolysis. The 3 -D diffusion model more accurately reproduced the fourth (last) phase, whereas the short initial decomposition phase was poorly simulated despite correlation coefficients ca. 0. 95 - 0. 96. The kinetics of the 3 rd and 4 th decomposition phases, attributed to fatty acid methyl esters cracking and pyrolysis <b>tarry</b> <b>residues,</b> were sensitive to the heating rate...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the {{developments}} {{leading to the}} use of pulverized coal most boilers utilized grate firing where the fuel was mechanically distributed onto a moving grate {{at the bottom of the}} firebox in a partially crushed gravel like form. Air for combustion was blown upward through the grate carrying the lighter ash and smaller particles of unburned coal up with it, some of which would adhere to the sides of the firebox. In 1918 The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company, later Wisconsin Electric, conducted tests in the use of pulverized coal at its Oneida Street power plant. These experiments helped Fred L. Dornbrook to develop methods of controlling the pulverized coal's <b>tarry</b> ash <b>residues</b> with boiler feed water tube jackets that served to reduce the surface temperature of the firebox walls and allowed the ash deposits be easily removed. This plant became the first central power station in the United States to use pulverized fuel.|$|R
40|$|The {{handling}} {{and disposal of}} hot <b>tarry</b> liquid <b>residues</b> can be problematic in industry, in this case, a phthalic anhydride plant using naphthalene as feed stock. The residue from the plant contains an appreciable amount of phthalic anhydride which desublimates from the residue during draining, resulting in an unsafe working environment. In addition, the residue is a hot liquid that solidifies upon cooling, causing additional risks to personnel during {{handling and}} various problems associated with disposal. Research was conducted into finding a treatment method to reduce or eliminate the desublimation of phthalic anhydride from the residue and addressing the hot liquid residue, making the residue safer to handle and easy to dispose of. Laboratory experiments showed that the addition of Dicalite 4151 (a filter aid) in a concentration of 0, 3 kg Dicalite 4151 per kg phthalic anhydride residue, resulted {{in the formation of}} a powdered residue. This was confirmed during plant trials where using the same concentration proved that a powdered residue could be obtained, {{while at the same time}} desublimation of the phthalic anhydride from the residue was negated by distilling the product from the residue mixture. An opportunity exists to test the use of filter aid in other residue producing industries to determine if the same results can be achieved.

40|$|Objective Improper land {{disposal}} {{of hazardous waste}} can result in leaching of hazardous constituents which may contaminate ground and surface water leading to adverse impact on human health and environment consequences. The present study utilized mammalian cell culture for the genotoxicity assessment of waste and its leachate. Methods Genotoxic potential and chemical analysis of pesticide derived <b>tarry</b> <b>waste</b> contaminated soil extract and its leachate was assessed using in vitro human lymphocyte cultures and GC-MS. Results The investigation revealed that the soil extract could cause significant to highly significant genotoxicity {{in the form of}} DNA strand break at 25 μL (P< 0. 01), 50 μL, 100 μL and 200 μL (P< 0. 001) and chromosomal aberration at 25 μL (P< 0. 01) and 50 μL and 100 μL (P< 0. 001). The leachate could cause significant DNA strand break and chromosomal aberration only at 100 μL and 200 μL (P< 0. 01) dose levels.

40|$|The Retrieval Process Development and Enhancement (KPD{ampersand}E) {{program has}} {{developed}} and tested an end effector {{to support the}} waste retrieval mission at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The end effector was developed specifically to remove a sticky waste material from the cooling coils in the High Level Liquid Waste (HLLW) tank, and to vacuum up a sediment layer that has settled beneath the cooling coils. An extensive testing program was conducted in the hydraulic test bed (HTB) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to evaluate {{the performance of the}} end effector under simulated in-tank conditions. A mock up of the cooling coils was installed in the test bed tank, and simulated waste materials were included to represent the sticky waste on the tubes and the particulate waste settled beneath them. The testing program focused on assessing long-duration mining strategies for cleaning the cooling coils and removing the particulate waste forms. The report describes the results of the end effector testing program at PNNL. Section 2 describes the physical characteristics of the HLLW tanks, including the layout of the cooling coils, and it also describes what is known of the waste forms in the tanks. Section 3 describes the cleaning and retrieval strategy that was used in developing the end effector design. Section 4 describes the cooling coil mockup in the hydraulic test bed. Section 5 discusses the rationale used in selecting the simulants for the <b>tarry</b> <b>waste</b> and particulate waste forms.
