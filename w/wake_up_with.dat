Scientific studies on sleep have shown that sleep stage at awakening {{is an important factor in}} amplifying sleep inertia.|$|E

Spontaneous erections are also known as involuntary or unwanted erections and are normal. Such erections can be embarrassing if they happen in public, such as a classroom or living room.|$|E

The network also announced {{it would no longer}} greenlight original long-form programming, and expand live forecast programming on its schedule throughout 2016 once all remaining long-form programs already in development conclude their runs.

[...] Around 50 TWC employees – including production, engineering and financial staff – were laid off, and the television channel's budget was reduced to focus investments on the company's Internet and mobile properties.|$|E
