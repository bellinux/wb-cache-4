500|$|Other {{artists have}} become {{agitated}} {{due to the}} Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that [...] "hey don't know the half of it." [...] Paterson says that he finds a [...] "beauty" [...] and a [...] "cleverness" [...] with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it. Even though fans often try to guess the origins {{of many of the}} samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would [...] "die" [...] if they discovered, for example, where the drums on [...] "Little Fluffy Clouds" [...] originated from. He has said that record labels have cautioned him, [...] "Don't tell anyone <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> your samples until we get them cleared!".|$|E
500|$|In 1966 Drake {{enrolled}} at a tutorial college in Five Ways, Birmingham, {{from where he}} won a scholarship to study English literature at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. He delayed attendance to spend six months at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, beginning in February 1967, where he began to practise guitar in earnest. To earn money, he would often busk with friends in the town centre. Drake began to smoke cannabis, and that spring he travelled with friends to Morocco, where, according to travelling companion Richard Charkin, [...] "that was <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> the best pot". He most likely began using LSD while in Aix, and lyrics written during this period—in particular for the song [...] "Clothes of Sand"—are suggestive of an interest in hallucinogens.|$|E
500|$|Alexander Derek Dougan {{was born}} in Belfast on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan. His father worked at Belfast docks. His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for Linfield, and two of Sandy's {{brothers}} also played {{for some of the}} leading clubs in Belfast. As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street. His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that [...] "on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> the money from". As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys. He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams. He instead joined Distillery in 1953. Manager Jimmy McIntosh handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0–0 Irish Cup first [...] round draw with Glentoran. Maurice Tadman, who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.|$|E
