40|$|The genus Liasis {{comprises}} {{two groups}} of pythons, the olive python, Liasis olivaceus, and the <b>water</b> <b>pythons</b> L. fuscus and L. mackloti.

Maximum likelihood, parsimony and distance analyses showed that A. papuana is the sister lineage to all Liasis and that Liasis fuscus/L. mackloti and L. olivaceus are separate lineages. There is also support for the reciprocal monophyly of the two olive python subspecies, L. olivaceus barroni and L. o. olivaceus, and for distinction of island populations described previously as L. mackloti dunni from Wetar and L. mackloti savuensis from Sawu. These two island populations are as equally distinct as the populations from the island cluster of Babar/Semau/Timor. There is strong support for the recognition of two lineages ('eastern' and 'western') of <b>water</b> <b>pythons</b> in Australia.

The remaining sequences were found to be more closely related to mammalian and amphibian Hepatozoon species. This study confirms that species of Amblyomma harbor DNA of the same Hepatozoon species detected in the water pythons.

However, other studies have demonstrated that TL does not affect survival among old humans.

In contrast to other vertebrates, TL of hatchling pythons was significantly shorter than that of older snakes. However, during their first year of life hatchling TL increased substantially. While TL of older snakes decreased with age, we did not observe any correlation between TL and age in cross-sectional sampling. In older snakes, female TL was longer than that of males. When using recapture as a proxy for survival, our results do not support that longer telomeres resulted in an increased <b>water</b> <b>python</b> survival/longevity.

Reaction norms linking food supply to feeding rates and residual body mass were broadly linear, whereas norms linking food supply to female body size became curvilinear when a dramatic (flooding-induced) famine reduced the mean body size at sexual maturity.

40|$|Energy {{metabolism}} during embryonic {{development of}} snakes differs in several respects from the patterns displayed by other reptiles. There are, however, no previous reports describing {{the main energy source}} for development, the yolk lipids, in snake eggs. There {{is also no}} information on the distribution of yolk fatty acids to the tissues during snake development. In eggs of the <b>water</b> <b>python</b> (Liasis fuscus), we report that triacylglycerol, phospholipid, cholesteryl ester and free cholesterol, respectively, form 70. 3 %, 14. 1 %, 5. 7 % and 2. 1 % of the total lipid. The main polyunsaturate of the yolk lipid classes is 18 : 2 n- 6. The yolk phospholipid contains 20 : 4 n- 6 and 22 : 6 n- 3 at 13. 0 % and 3. 6 % (w/w), respectively. Approximately 10 % and 30 % of the initial egg lipids are respectively recovered in the residual yolk and the fat body of the hatchling. A major function of yolk lipid is, therefore, to provision the neonate with large energy reserves. The proportion of 22 : 6 n- 3 in brain phospholipid of the hatchling is 11. 1 % (w/w) : this represents only 0. 24 % of the amount of 22 : 6 n- 3 originally present in the egg. This also contrasts with values for free-living avian species where the proportion of DHA in neonatal brain phospholipid is 16 – 19 %. In the liver of the newly hatched python, triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesteryl ester, respectively, form 68. 2 %, 7. 7 % and 14. 3 % of total lipid.

40|$|Molecular {{methods were}} used to {{identify}} blood parasites frequently observed in blood smears of water pythons (Liasis fuscus) captured in our study area in the Northern Territory of Australia. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers amplifying the 18 s ribosomal RNA (IRNA) nuclear gene resulted in a short PCR product (180 bp) matching this region in the genus Hepatozoon. However, because of the short sequence obtained, 2 new primers were designed based on 18 s IRNA sequences of 3 Hepotozoon taxa available in GenBank. Using these primers, approximately 600 bp of the parasite's 18 s IRNA gene was amplified successfully and sequenced from 2 <b>water</b> <b>python</b> samples. The new primers {{were used to}} investigate the prevalence of blood parasites in 100 pythons. In 25 of these samples {{we did not observe}} any blood parasites when examining stained slides. All the samples revealed a 600 -bp PCR product, demonstrating that pythons in which we did not visually observe any parasites were infected by Hepatozoon spp. We also analyzed the nucleotide sequences of blood parasites in 4 other reptile taxa commonly encountered in our study area. The sequences obtained from water pythons and from I of these taxa were identical, suggesting that the parasite is capable of infecting hosts at different taxonomic levels...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{antibodies}} (NAbs) {{constitute an}} important component in vertebrate immune system, but, in spite of this, have often been dismissed as "non-specific background" signals. We observed a significant positive relationship between <b>water</b> <b>python</b> (Liasis fuscus) body length/age and levels of antibodies reactive with two administered antigens (tetanus and diphtheria). However, no humoral immune response to the antigens was observed. The lack of elevated immune response, and the age-associated increase in antibody titres, strongly suggest that the antibodies consisted of polyreactive NAbs, and that absence of an elevated immune response was caused by such high levels of NAbs {{that they were able}} to mask the epitopes of the antigens. In our study area pythons feed mainly on rodents that frequently, before being killed, are able to inflict numerous bites to the snakes. The bites most likely transmit pathogens such as bacteria. As NAbs have been shown to act as a first line defence against bacterial infections, the high levels of NAbs in the pythons may be an adaptation to reduce pathogenic effects of bacteria transmitted by the prey when the snakes are feeding. Thus, the results from present study suggest that NAbs may have an important immunological function by reducing deleterious effects of pathogens in wild populations...|$|E
40|$|Using {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) we identified 26 unique {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) genotypes in 104 <b>water</b> <b>pythons.</b> We observed a significant independent association between reduced blood parasite load (Hepatozoon sp.) and python body length/age, presence of a specific RFLP fragment (C-fragment) and the overall number of fragments. The parasite has a negative impact on several python life-history traits such as growth, nutritional status and longevity. Thus, the C-fragment could be considered a 'good gene' (a fitness-enhancing genetic element). However, while the number of fragments affected parasite load, the association between level of parasitaemia and fragment number was not linear, and, hence, minimum parasite infection level was achieved at an intermediate number of fragments. Intermediate MHC fragment numbers were also observed among the largest/oldest pythons, suggesting that both a specific fragment and intermediate levels of MHC polymorphism enhanced python longevity. Thus, our results suggest python MHC is subject to both frequency-dependent and balancing selection...|$|R

In total, nine species of helminth (comprising three cestodes and six nematodes), onepentastome and one protozoan {{were found in}} 180 <b>water</b> <b>pythons,</b> with the Nematoda being the dominant and most diverse group, and a cestode, Bothridium omatum Maplestone & Southwell, 1923, the most prevalent species. In spite of the hosts being present in high numbers the helminth assemblage was depauperate, characterised by low prevalence, intensity, frequency and abundance of species, with neither season nor sex of host affecting abundance. There were, however, significant differences between ages of hosts, juveniles having fewer parasites, and seasonal diversity, with the wet season of 2004 and the dry of 2005 the most similar. Of the Australian python species analysed Morelia spilota (Lacepede, 1804) had the highest species richness. The lower species richness found in L. fuscus was possibly due to its unusual biology.

Detached shell membranes were also found in all successful nests. All but one of 38 unsuccessful nests contained no shell fragments. The exception contained about 60 % of the shell from one egg, but fragments were clearly distinguishable from shells of hatched eggs because they were contaminated with egg yolk. Weight of eggshell in individual nests {{could be related to}} the number of hatchlings (excluding failed nests: r 2 = 0. 67, P 12 g or the equivalent of more than 1 egg) embedded in the nest matrix be regarded as diagnostic of hatching success. We interpret the clear discrimination between successful and failed nests {{as a direct result of}} consistent features of magpie goose biology and the breeding environment. The most important of these are: (i) the prolonged hatching and on-nest brooding period, during which eggshells from hatched eggs are crushed and their movement into the nest matrix promoted; (ii) the continuous addition of vegetation to the nest, often covering shells; (iii) the removal of shells from damaged (but not hatched) eggs by attending adults; and (iv) the dominant egg predator being a large snake (the <b>water</b> <b>python,</b> Liasis fuscus) which consumes eggs whole and hence leaves no shells at the nest site. We suggest that post-hatch surveys of nest structures should be used to improve understanding of spatial variation in nest success within colonies, and to compare success between colonies of different size...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change can}} move the spatial {{location}} of resources critical for population viability, and a species 2 ̆ 7 resilience to such changes will depend upon its ability to flexibly shift its activities away from no-longer-suitable sites to exploit new opportunities. Intuition suggests that vagile predators {{should be able to}} track spatial shifts in prey availability, but our data on <b>water</b> <b>pythons</b> (Liasis fuscus) in tropical Australia suggest a less encouraging scenario. These pythons undergo regular long-range (to > 10 km) seasonal migrations to follow flooding-induced migrations by their prey (native dusky rats, Rattus colletti). However, when an extreme flooding event virtually eliminated rats for a three-year period, the local pythons did not disperse despite the presence of abundant rats only 8 km away; instead, many pythons starved to death. This inflexibility suggests that some vagile species that track seasonally migrating prey may do so by responding to habitat attributes that have consistently predicted prey availability over evolutionary time, rather than reacting to proximate cues that signal the presence of prey per se. A species 2 ̆ 7 vulnerability to climate change will be increased by an inability to shift its activities away from historical sites toward newly favorable areas...|$|R
40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) has been studied in a multitude of mammals by now, but much less is known about its organisation and variation in other vertebrate species. The mammalian MHC is organised as a single gene cluster, but recent studies on birds suggest that this paradigm of MHC organisation has to be supplemented. The domestic chicken thus possesses two separate gene clusters which both contain MHC class I and class II B genes, and we {{have shown that the}} ring-necked pheasant Phasianus colchicus also has two unlinked clusters of class II B genes. We are studying the effect of the MHC on mate choice, survival and reproductive success in natural populations of birds and reptiles. For this reason, we are developing DNA techniques to determine the animals' MHC genotype. The amplification of the hypervariable exon 3 of the class I gene from songbirds and reptiles has provided us with species specific probes {{that can be used in}} Southern blot analysis. The first results indicate very extensive variation in all studied species, that is starlings Sturnus vulgaris, great reed warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus and <b>water</b> <b>pythons</b> Liasis fuscus.

40|$|A female's {{reproductive}} output (size {{and number of}} offspring) may say little about her reproductive success; the 'quality' of her progeny and {{the time that they}} are produced may be more important in this respect. We marked and released 1224 hatchling <b>water</b> <b>pythons</b> (Liasis fuscus) from 116 clutches of laboratory-incubated eggs, in a study site in tropical Australia. Clutches varied widely in the number of eggs, mean offspring sizes, the proportion of eggs that hatched, and recapture rates of offspring. Clutch size was not significantly correlated with the number of recaptured hatchlings in either year, nor was mean offspring size related to recapture probability. Instead, offspring recapture rates varied {{as a function of the}} time of hatching. Recapture rates were higher for hatchlings released in a year with high prey availability than in a year with few prey. In addition, recapture rates were higher for earlier-hatching clutches in the year with few prey. The other significant effect on recapture rates involved offspring viability: some clutches had a much higher proportion of surviving offspring than did others, and recapture rates were higher from clutches with higher hatching success (i. e. proportion of eggs hatching). Hence, the usual measures of {{reproductive output}} (clutch size and offspring size) offer only a poor index of a female's reproductive success in this system...|$|R
40|$|Will {{climate change}} {{threaten}} wildlife populations by gradual shifts in mean conditions, or by increased frequency of extreme weather events? Based on long-term data (from 1991 to 2014), {{the aim of}} the present study was to analyse and compare the sensitivity of predator-prey demography to extreme climatic events versus normal, albeit highly variable, annual deviations in climatic conditions in the Australian wet-dry tropics. From 1991 to 2005, predators (<b>water</b> <b>pythons,</b> Liasis fuscus) and their main prey (dusky rats, Rattus colletti) showed significant climate-driven fluctuations in numbers. These fluctuations were, however, trivial compared to the impact of two massive but brief deluges in 2007 and 2011, which virtually eliminated the dusky rats. The two floods resulted in the pythons experiencing an unprecedented famine in seven out of the last 8 years causing a massive shift in python demography, that is a significant reduction in feeding rates, reproductive output, growth rates, relative body mass, survival, mean body length and numbers (from 3173 in 1992 to 96 in 2013). Our results demonstrate that attempts to predict faunal responses to climate change, even if based on long-term studies, may be doomed to failure. Consequently, biologists may need to confront the uncomfortable truth that increased frequency of brief unpredictable bouts of extreme weather can influence populations far more than gradual deviations in mean climatic conditions...|$|R

Heretofore, the impact of water deprivation on CORT plasma levels has not been thoroughly investigated. However, both baseline CORT and stress-induced CORT are expected to respond towater deprivation {{not only because of}} hydric stress per se, but also because CORT is an important mineralocorticoid in vertebrates. We assessed the effects of water deprivation on baseline CORT and stress-induced CORT, in Children's pythons (Antaresia childreni), a species that experiences seasonal droughts in natural conditions. Weimposed a 52 -daywater deprivation on a group of unfed Children's pythons (i. e.,water-deprived treatment) and provided water ad libitum to another group (i. e., control treatment). We examined body mass variations throughout the experiment, and baseline CORT and stress-induced CORT {{at the end of the}} treatments. Relative bodymass loss averaged ~ 10 % in pythonswithoutwater, a value 2 to 4 times higher compared to control snakes. Following re-exposition to <b>water,</b> <b>pythons</b> from the water-deprived treatment drank readily and abundantly and attained a body mass similar to pythons from the control treatment. Together, these results suggest a substantial dehydration as a consequence of water deprivation. Interestingly, stress-induced but not baseline CORT level was significantly higher in water-deprived snakes, suggesting that baseline CORT might not respond to this degree of dehydration. Therefore, possible mineralocorticoid role of CORT needs to be clarified in snakes. Because dehydration usually induces adjustments (reduced movements, lowered body temperature) to limit water loss, and decreases locomotor performances, elevated stress-induced CORT in water-deprived snakes might therefore compensate for altered locomotor performances. Future studies should test this hypothesis...|$|R

In the present study, we analyze the independent effects of age, blood parasite load, and body condition on the ability to mount a humoral immune response (level of antibody pro-duction to novel antigens).

The lack of such work was most likely {{due to the fact that}} studies on host-parasites interac-tions, until the early 1980 s, had been neglected by most evo-lutionary biologists. However, the seminal paper by Hamilton and Zuk (1982) stressed the importance of including effects of parasitemia in studies of vertebrate evolution. This publi-cation redirected subsequent studies to focus on parasite-host interactions and incorporating immunological processes into vertebrate evolutionary biology (reviewed by Schmid-Hempel, 2003; Schmid-Hempel and Ebert, 2003; Zuk and Stoehr, 2002). Because individual organisms are likely to be subjected to attack by an array of diverse pathogens throughout their life span, the benefits of immunological response mechanisms are obvious (Boots and Bowers, 2004). As a result, in the last decade, a number of studies have examined how resistance to pathogens is associated with fitness and, in turn, how invest-ment into pathogen resistance may compromise investment in other traits such as survival and reproduction (Bonneau...|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of the}} 25th Anniversary G.I. Joe line {{starting}} in 2007, a number of Python Patrol characters made their debut in the new figure style. This included Python Copperhead, who came with a vehicle called the [...] "Sting Raider", {{which was based on}} the original Copperhead's original vehicle, the <b>Water</b> Moccasin; a <b>Python</b> Viper, who was sold as the pilot of a reissued [...] "Python Conquest" [...] plane as a Target exclusive, and the Python Officer and Python Crimson Guard, who were sold as individually carded figures.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Dorney Park {{featured}} {{no major}} new attractions, but rather small {{changes to the}} park, such as a new Fast Pay wristband, allowing guests to add money to an RFID prepaid wristband, allowing them to pay for food and merchandise without carrying cash. On August 28, 2013, Dorney Park announced that a new 65 ft tall water slide complex, Snake Pit, would be constructed for the 2014 season. Snake Pit features six <b>water</b> slides, <b>Python</b> Plummet, which is three free-fall body slides, Constrictor, which is an enclosed tube slide, and Boa Blaster, which is a twin tube slide featuring high speed drops. Snake Pit replaced Riptide Run and The Lily Pads. The first slide pieces of Snake Pit began to arrive at Dorney Park on Wednesday, January 22, 2014. Snake Pit opened on May 30. Also new for 2014 is an in park television channel called FUNtv. FUNtv is shown on television screens in the queue lines {{of many of the}} park's major attractions. Content shown includes weather, music videos, and trivia. The content for FUNtv is controlled out of sister park Kings Island in Mason OH.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} funded principally by the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory {{as an element}} of its broader wetland {{management}} initiative, and to satisfy a Government undertaking to develop comprehensive management strategies and programs for the Magpie Goose. The Australian Nature Conservation Agency and Northern Territory University also provided additional financial support that contributed significantly to achievement of its aims. Many individuals gave generously of their time and expertise. I thank them all for their support. Principal Supervisor Keith Christian provided important guidance and was always available to assist with problems. His comprehensive critical reading of various drafts of the thesis was invaluable. As external supervisor, Bill Freeland provided encouragement and support, in particular by promoting a corporate culture within the Parks and Wildlife Commission which properly recognised and valued the role of research in conservation management. He also undertook the unrewarding task of reading {{all parts of the}} thesis and provided much valuable input. Discussions with David Bowman, Bill Freeland and John Woinarski promoted the development of many of the ideas presented in the thesis, and improved their presentation. Various parts of the manuscript were also read by Phil Bell, David Bowman, Peter Dostine, Roger Jaensch, Tom Madsen and John Woinarksi, all of whom provided valuable comment. Tom Madsen shared important insights to the behaviour of "his" <b>water</b> <b>pythons.</b> Nick Nicholls advised {{on the use of the}} statistical package GLIM. The study would have been impossible without the active support of the Lower Mary River Landcare Group, which has endorsed the long-term maintenance of healthy Magpie Goose populations on the Mary River floodplains as one of its conservation objectives. In particular, the owners, managers and staff of Carmour Plains, Marrakai, and Opium Creek Stations provided unrestricted access to study sites and often supported the field work. Neville Walker promoted, and maintained his interest in the study from its inception. Robert and Bob Townsend, "Speed" Thompson and Clinton Walker helped in many ways, not least in keeping the indispensible airboats running. Kurt Tschimer, Irene Rainey, Donna Jackson, Oswald Tory, James McKinnon, Rick Hope, Ray Chatto, Dave Farlam, Carole Palmer, Tony Spring, Stephen Turner, and Adam, Kim, Jason and Vicki Whitehead assisted with collection of data and maintenance of associated databases. Greg Connors solved a range of computing and logistical problems. Chris Babcock advised on the design and construction of floating clam traps used at nests. Carole Palmer potted some of the more successful battery-powered transmitters. Leg-bands were provided by the Australian Nature Conservation Agency through the Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme. In addition to observations taken in the course of the study, a number of the original analyses presented here also draw on data held in the Parks and Wildlife Commission 2 ̆ 7 s corporate databases. This information was collected by a number of staff and consultants, the most notable being Peter Bayliss and Kate Yeomans, Keith Saalfeld, Ray Chatto, Tony Spring, Bruce Wilson and Peter Brocklehurst. Raw climate data were provided by the Darwin office of the Bureau of Meteorology and the National Climate Centre. The Northern Territory Power and Water Authority provided data on guage heights and flows for relevant river systems. I am grateful to all of these individuals and organisations for generously making their data available for use in the analyses presented here...|$|R
