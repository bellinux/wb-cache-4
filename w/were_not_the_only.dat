5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> tactic Rommel {{used against}} aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops {{landing in the}} water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E

5|$|Replacing Porter was Brigadier General Gustavus Adolphus DeRussy, whose {{division}} was spread across multiple forts in the Arlington Line defenses.

The two generals' divisions <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> units to have their headquarters at Fort Corcoran, however.|$|E
5|$|The Sami <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> people {{subject to}} repressions.

A {{significant portion of the}} people deported to Kola were peasants from southern Russia subjected to dekulakization. Prisoner labor was often used when building new factories and for manning those which were operational: in 1940, for example, the whole Severonikel Metallurgy Mining Complex was turned over to the NKVD system.|$|E

On October 11, 1528, the French sacked and burned the {{settlement}} of San Germán during an attempt to capture the island, destroying many of the island's first settlements—including Guánica, Sotomayor, Daguao and Loiza—before the local militia forced them to retreat. The only settlement that remained was San Juan.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, {{and there is}} much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|In the 15 {{years since}} he had left Red River, his {{megalomania}} had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, delusions of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was quite ready to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of {{a few thousand dollars}} he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E
5|$|Prison officials, {{fed up with}} Stroud's {{activities}} and their attendant publicity, intensified their efforts to transfer him out of Leavenworth. Stroud, however, discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas. To this end, he married Jones by proxy, which infuriated the prison's administrators, who would not allow him to correspond with his wife. Prison officials <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> ones perturbed with Stroud's marriage; his mother was also incensed. They had a close relationship, but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones, believing women were nothing but trouble for her son. Whereas previously {{she had been a}} strong advocate for her son, helping him with legal battles, she now argued against his application for parole, and became a major obstacle in his attempts to be released from the prison system. She moved away from Leavenworth and refused any further contact with him until her death in 1937.|$|E

In September 1950, a regular season game between Loyola University (Los Angeles) (now Loyola Marymount University) and the Texas College of Mines was {{cancelled}} {{because of the}} policy that excluded black players from playing in El Paso. Finally on October 27, 1950, officials took a vote that allowed the Texas college to include black players in games at the El Paso location. A year after the grant was passed, the Sun Bowl hosted its first integrated football game between the College of the Pacific (now University of the Pacific) and Texas Tech University.|$|E
5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message {{at the heart of the}} film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.|$|E
5|$|Much of Japan's {{industrial}} capacity was also destroyed by Allied bombing. Over 600 major industrial facilities were destroyed or badly damaged, {{contributing to a}} large decline in production. Absenteeism caused by the air attacks further reduced output. It {{is not possible to}} determine the exact damage bombing caused to Japan's economy, however, as the Allied naval blockade also contributed to general breakdown which occurred from late 1944. Statistics compiled by the USSBS show a correlation between the number of B-29 sorties directed at different industries and the amount by which their production declined, but air attacks <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason for these differences. In addition to the heavy bomber attacks, the operations by Allied aircraft carriers tightened the blockade by disrupting Japanese coastal shipping; the naval aircraft were unable to carry enough bombs to seriously damage Japanese industrial plants, however. Compounding the effects of the air attacks, Japan's rice crop of 1945 failed. The resulting shortage of rice caused widespread malnutrition, and mass starvation would have occurred had the war continued. In financial terms, the Allied air campaign and attacks on merchant ships destroyed between one third and a quarter of Japan's wealth.|$|E
