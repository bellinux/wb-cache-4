2500|$|The San Francisco pop-punk Band J Church's 1994 song [...] "Hate So Real" [...] is a first-person {{tale of the}} murders, {{including}} the names {{of several of the}} victims and the line [...] "Now Caril can't deny me/ and to this day I swear/ she should be sittin' on my lap <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chair." [...] Also, their song [...] "In Vain" [...] from their 1993 release Yellow, Blue and Green features themes from the Starkweather/Fugate saga and pictures of the two featured in the artwork.|$|E
60|$|Here I possess these {{gathered}} {{treasures of}} time, {{the harvest of}} so many generations, laid up in my garners: and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window there is the lake, and the circle of the mountains, and the illimitable sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] Harry laughed. [...] "I find it, sometimes, very {{difficult}} to act up to my position. I never quite feel that I am an earl, except {{on the rare occasions}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords--which I only do when my vote is wanted, on an important division.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, and statues too, and {{buildings}} above all things. The colours of new paintings are so glaring, and the faces are so bright and self-conscious, {{that they look}} to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exhibition like coloured prints in a child's new picture-book.

6000|$|... "You know," [...] he declared, [...] "if I {{might be}} {{permitted}} to say so, I think you are taking the gaming here a little too seriously. If you have been unlucky, {{it is very easy}} to arrange an advance for you. Would you like some money? If so, I will see to it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank to-morrow. I can let you have a hundred pounds at once, if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The sky-breaker came at evening very suddenly, for I {{had hardly}} seen any {{stirring}} in {{the tops of}} the green trees over which I look as over a sea, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the temple at morning. And yet when he came, it was as if an elephant had strayed from the armies of the great kings of India.

60|$|If I {{had been}} an ancient Briton, I would not have {{contented}} myself with blue paint, but I would have bankrupted the rainbow. I so enjoy gay clothes in which women clothe themselves that it always grieves me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opera to see that, while women look like a flower-bed, the men are a few gray stumps among them in their black evening dress. These are two or three reasons why I wish to wear white clothes: When I find myself in assemblies like this, with everybody in black clothes, I know I possess something that is superior to everybody else's. Clothes are never clean. You don't know whether they are clean or not, because you can't see.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no sweeter tobacco {{comes from}} Virginia, and no better brand than the Three Castles," [...] says Mr. Franks, drawing a great brass tobacco-box from his pocket, and {{thrusting}} a quid into his jolly mouth. [...] "You don't {{know what a}} comfort it is, sir! you'll take to it, bless you, as you grow older. Won't he, Mr. Trail? I wish you had ten shiploads of it instead of one. You might have ten shiploads: I've told Madam Esmond so; I've rode over her plantation; she treats me like a lord <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house; she don't grudge me the best of wine, or keep me cooling my heels in the counting-room as some folks does" [...] (with a look at Mr. Trail). [...] "She is a real born lady, she is; and might have a thousand hogsheads as easy as her hundreds, if there were but hands enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We shall remember, mother!--we shall remember!' {{continued}} the Pagan softly, 'and be happy in our remembrances! My brother, who loves me not, will love you when I am gone! You will walk {{in my little}} garden, and think on me {{as you look at}} the flowers that we have planted and watered together in the evening hours, when the sky was glorious to behold, and the earth was all quiet around us! Listen, mother, and kiss me! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> far country, I will make a garden there like my garden here, and plant the same flowers that we have planted here, and in the evening I will go out and give them water at the hour when you go out to give my flowers water at home; and so, though we see each other no more, it will yet be as if we laboured together in the garden as we labour now!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What does {{it matter}} to me?" [...] bursts out the Marquis, {{garnishing}} his conversation with the usual expletives which adorned his eloquence when he was strongly moved. [...] "What do I care for Barnes Newcome, and his confounded affairs and family? I never {{want to see him}} again, but in the light of a banker, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> City, where he keeps my account. I say, I {{have nothing to do with}} him, or all the Newcomes under the sun. Why, one of them is a painter, and will paint my dog, Ratcatcher, by Jove! or my horse, or my groom, if I give him the order. Do you think I care for any one of the pack? It's not the fault of the Marchioness of Farintosh that her family is not equal to mine. Besides two others in England and Scotland, I should like to know what family is? I tell you what, Hench. I bet you five to two, that before an hour is over my mother will be here, and down on her knees to me, begging me to break off this engagement." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cunningham has {{followed}} the lead of that polished and instructed person, Mr. Ben Tillett, in rebuking me for (as the associates say) attacking Mr. Booth's personal character. Of course, when I was writing, I did not doubt that this very handy, though not too clean, weapon would be used by one or other of Mr. Booth's supporters. And my action was finally decided by the following considerations: I {{happen to be a}} member of one of the largest life insurance societies. There is a vacancy in the directory at present, for which half a dozen gentlemen are candidates. Now, I said to myself, supposing that one of these gentlemen (whose pardon I humbly beg for starting the hypothesis), say Mr. A., in his administrative capacity and as a man of business, has been the subject of such observations as a Judge on the Bench bestowed upon Mr. Booth, is he a person for whom I can properly vote? And, if I find, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> meeting of the policy-holders, that most of them know nothing of this and other evidences of what, by the mildest judgment, must be termed Mr. A.'s unfitness for administrative [289] responsibilities, am I to let them remain in their ignorance? I leave the answer and its application to men of sense and integrity.|$|E
60|$|L. No; of bronze, or copper, or some {{of their}} foul patent metal--it is no matter what. I meant a model of our chief British eagle. Every feather was made separately; and every {{filament}} of every feather separately, and so joined on; and all the quills modelled of the right length and right section, and at last the whole cluster of them fastened together. You know, children, I don't think much of my own drawing; but take my proud word for once, that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Zoological Gardens, and {{happen to have a}} bit of chalk in my pocket, and the Gray Harpy will sit, without screwing his head round, for thirty seconds,--I can do a better thing of him in that time than the three years' work of this industrious firm. For, during the thirty seconds, the eagle is my object,--not myself; and during the three years, the firm's object, in every fibre of bronze it made, was itself, and not the eagle. That is the true meaning of the little Pthah's having no eyes--he can see only himself. The Egyptian beetle was not quite the full type of him; our northern ground beetle is a truer one. It is beautiful to see it at work, gathering its treasures (such as they are) into little round balls; and pushing them home with the strong wrong end of it,--head downmost all the way,--like a modern political economist with his ball of capital, declaring that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its virtues. But away with you, children, now, for I'm getting cross.|$|E

60|$|This, as {{an account}} of Cairo, dear M-, you will {{probably}} be disposed to consider as incomplete: the fact is, I have seen nothing else as yet. I have peered into no harems. The magicians, proved to be humbugs, have been bastinadoed out of town. The dancing-girls, those lovely Alme, of whom I had hoped {{to be able to}} give a glowing and elegant, though strictly moral, description, have been whipped into Upper Egypt, and as you are saying in your mind-- Well, it ISN'T a good description of Cairo: you are perfectly right. It is England in Egypt. I like to see her there with her pluck, enterprise, manliness, bitter ale, and Harvey Sauce. Wherever they come they stay and prosper. From the summit of yonder Pyramids forty centuries may look down on them if they are minded; and I say, those venerable daughters of time ought to be better pleased by the examination, than by regarding the French bayonets and General Bonaparte, Member of the Institute, fifty years ago, running about with sabre and pigtail. Wonders he did, to be sure, and then ran away, leaving Kleber, to be murdered, in the lurch--a few hundred yards from the spot where these disquisitions are written. But what are his wonders compared to Waghorn? Nap massacred the Mamelukes at the Pyramids: Wag has conquered the Pyramids themselves; dragged the unwieldy structures a month nearer England than they were, and brought the country along with them. All the trophies and captives that ever were brought to Roman triumph were not so enormous and wonderful as this. All the heads that Napoleon ever caused to be struck off (as George Cruikshank says) would not elevate him a monument as big. Be ours the trophies of peace! O my country! O Waghorn! Hae tibi erunt artes. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pyramids I will sacrifice in your name, and pour out libations of bitter ale and Harvey Sauce in your honour.|$|E
6000|$|Birds'-nests, in the Huckleberry {{and other}} shrubs, and in trees, {{are already being}} filled with the {{withered}} leaves. So many have fallen in the woods, that a squirrel cannot run after a falling nut without being heard. Boys are raking them in the streets, if only {{for the pleasure of}} dealing with such clean crisp substances. Some sweep the paths scrupulously neat, and then stand to see the next breath strew them with new trophies. The swamp-floor is thickly covered, and the Lycopodium lucidulum looks suddenly greener amid them. In dense woods they half-cover pools that are three or four rods long. The other day I could hardly find a well-known spring, and even suspected that it had dried up, for it was completely concealed by freshly fallen leaves; and when I swept them aside and revealed it, it was like striking the earth, with Aaron's rod, for a new spring. Wet grounds about the edges of swamps look dry with them. At one swamp, where I was surveying, thinking to step on a leafy shore from a rail, I got into the water more than a foot deep. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river the day after the principal fall of leaves, the sixteenth, I find my boat all covered, bottom and seats, with the leaves of the Golden Willow under which it is moored, and I set sail with a cargo of them rustling under my feet. If I empty it, it will be full again to-morrow. I do not regard them as litter, to be swept out, but accept them as suitable straw or matting for the bottom of my carriage. When I turn up into the mouth of the Assabet, which is wooded, large fleets of leaves are floating on its surface, as it were getting out to sea, with room to tack; but next the shore, a little farther up, they are thicker than foam, quite concealing the water for a rod in width, under and amid the Alders, Button-Bushes, and Maples, still perfectly light and dry, with fibre unrelaxed; and at a rocky bend where they are met and stopped by the morning wind, they sometimes form a broad and dense crescent quite across the river. When I turn my prow that way, and the wave which it makes strikes them, list what a pleasant rustling from these dry substances grating on one another! Often it is their undulation only which reveals the water beneath them. Also every motion of the wood-turtle on the shore is betrayed by their rustling there. Or even in mid-channel, when the wind rises, I hear them blown with a rustling sound. Higher up they are slowly moving round and round in some great eddy which the river makes, as that at the [...] "Leaning Hemlocks," [...] where the water is deep, and the current is wearing into the bank.|$|E
6000|$|Clive {{used to give}} droll {{accounts}} of the young disciples at Gandish's, who were of various ages and conditions, and in whose company the young fellow took his place with that good temper and gaiety which have seldom deserted him in life, and have put him at ease wherever his fate has led him. He is, in truth, as much {{at home in a}} fine drawing-room as in a public-house parlour; and can talk as pleasantly to the polite mistress of the mansion, as to the jolly landlady dispensing her drinks from her bar. Not one of the Gandishites but was after a while well inclined to the young fellow; from Mr. Chivers, the senior pupil, down to the little imp Harry Hooker, who knew as much mischief at twelve years old, and could draw as cleverly as many a student of five-and-twenty; and Bob Trotter, the diminutive fag of the studio, who ran on all the young men's errands, and fetched them in apples, oranges, and walnuts. Clive opened his eyes with wonder when he first beheld these simple feasts, and the pleasure with which some of the young men partook of them. They were addicted to polonies; they did not disguise their love for Banbury cakes; they made bets in ginger-beer, and gave and took the odds in that frothing liquor. There was a young Hebrew amongst the pupils, upon whom his brother-students used playfully to press ham sandwiches, pork sausages, and the like. This young man (who has risen to great wealth subsequently, and was bankrupt only three months since) actually bought cocoa-nuts, and sold them at a profit amongst the lads. His pockets were never without pencil-cases, French chalk, garnet brooches, for which he was willing to bargain. He behaved very rudely to Gandish, who seemed to be afraid before him. It was whispered that the Professor was not altogether easy in his circumstances, and that the elder Moss had some mysterious hold over him. Honeyman and Bayham, who once came to see Clive at the studio, seemed each disturbed at beholding young Moss seated there (making a copy of the Marsyas). [...] "Pa knows both those gents," [...] he informed Clive afterwards, with a wicked twinkle of his Oriental eyes. [...] "Step in, Mr. Newcome, any day you are passing down Wardour Street, and see if you don't want anything in our way." [...] (He pronounced the words in his own way, saying: [...] "Step id, Bister Doocob, ady day idto Vordor Street," [...] etc.) This young gentleman could get tickets for almost all the theatres, which he gave or sold, and gave splendid accounts at Cavendish's of the brilliant masquerades. Clive was greatly diverted at beholding Mr. Moss at one of these entertainments, dressed in a scarlet coat and top-boots, and calling out, [...] "Yoicks! Hark forward!" [...] fitfully to another Orientalist, his younger brother, attired like a midshipman. Once Clive bought a half-dozen of theatre tickets from Mr. Moss, which he distributed to the young fellows of the studio. But, when this nice young man tried further to tempt him on the next day, [...] "Mr. Moss," [...] Clive said to him with much dignity, [...] "I am very much obliged to you for your offer, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> play, I prefer paying at the doors." ...|$|E
