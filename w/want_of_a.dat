He sought the co-operation of the then existing theatre groups to realize his plans to establish a bilingual theatre in Lucknow. But his effort failed to elicit any response from them. He even brought the production rights of Mohan Rakesh’s well known play, Adhe-Adhure, which he could not stage for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable cast. In his bid to switch over to Hindi drama, he invited Delhi groups to produce, under TAW’s auspices, plays in Hindi with a view to making local groups conscious of the potentialities and challenges of Hindi Theatre.|$|E
25|$|Fawkner was keen {{to secure}} {{his place in}} history. He opened Melbourne's first hotel {{on the corner of}} William Street and Flinders Lane. He {{published}} the Melbourne Advertiser on 1 January 1838 which was the district's first newspaper. The Advertisers first nine or ten weekly editions were handwritten in ink. The old wooden printing press brought to Tasmania by Lt. Governor David Collins in 1803, and some worn typeface were eventually obtained from Launceston and the first printed edition appeared on 5 March 1838. It was to last for a further 17 editions when it was closed down on 23 April 1838 for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> newspaper license from Sydney. The Port Phillip Patriot and Melbourne Advertiser was commenced on 6 February 1839 by newly licensed John Pascoe Fawkner. It was published daily commencing on 15 May 1845.|$|E
25|$|A {{marriage}} {{should be}} conducted through a contract and a mandatory sum of wealth provided to the bride, which here refers to the mahr. Once a mahr has been ascertained {{with the realization that}} it is an obligation of a Muslim husband, the groom is required to pay it to the bride at the time of marriage unless he and his bride can mutually agree to delay the time of some of its payment. In 2003, Rubya Mehdi published an article in which the culture of mahr among Muslims was thoroughly reviewed. There is no concept of dowry as such in Islam, although mahr is often translated into English as dowry in the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more accurate word. A dowry as such is a payment to the groom from the bride's family, and is not an Islamic custom. Bride prices are also expressly prohibited.|$|E

25|$|Reed Hall was {{the main}} {{building}} at Dixmont and was named after the first superintendent of Dixmont, Dr. Joseph A. Reed. It was typical of other Kirkbride facilities with the exception that the outermost wings swept forward instead of to the rear in the typical V-shape. This was to afford {{a better view of}} the river valley and better airflow, which was said to be more calming to the patients in keeping with the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> serene setting. Early on, It had gas lighting, a central hot air system for heat, and more than ample supply of water from the Ohio River. Construction of the west wing was not complete until 1868, at which time construction of the east wing began. The center section of the building contained the front lobby, administrative offices, and chapel. This was mostly destroyed by fire in 1995.|$|E
25|$|In the film, Abraham Lincoln {{is portrayed}} in a {{positive}} light due to his belief in conciliatory postwar policies towards southern whites. The president's views are directly contrasted by Austin Stonewall, a character shown in a negative light who acts as an antagonist. The assassination of Lincoln leads to the effective transition between the war and reconstruction, both of which are represented by the two acts of the film. In including the assassination, the film also establishes to the audience that the plot of the movie has historical basis. Franklin wrote the film's depiction of Reconstruction as a hellish time when black freedmen ran amok, raping and killing whites with impunity until the Klan stepped in is not supported by the facts. Franklin wrote that most freed slaves continued to work for their former masters in Reconstruction for the <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> better alternative, and though relations between freedmen and their former masters were not friendly, very few freedmen sought revenge against the people who had held them in chains. The character of Silas Lynch has no basis in fact, and during the Reconstruction no black or mulatto men served as the lieutenant governor of South Carolina.|$|E

500|$|The {{first ever}} tour of a New Zealand {{representative}} {{team to the}} British Isles was planned for 1905, and a preliminary tour of Australia and New Zealand was undertaken to help fund the tour.

According to Winston McCarthy, New Zealand's forwards were at [...] "sixes and sevens mainly through <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good lock." [...] Following the conclusion of the preliminary tour of Australia and New Zealand it was clear that a specialist lock forward needed {{to be added to the}} side. Fanning, who had kept Cunningham out of the New Zealand side in 1903 and 1904, had retired following the 1904 season and consequently Cunningham did enough to earn selection as the team's only specialist lock.|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{sought to}} hold on to Kentucky and to secure {{territorial}} claims to the region by launching sporadic expeditions against hostile Indian settlements north of the Ohio River. George Rogers Clark, a Virginia militia officer in Kentucky, believed that the Americans could ultimately win the border war by capturing Detroit. He laid the groundwork for this objective in 1779 by seizing the British outpost of Vincennes and capturing the British commander of Detroit, lieutenant governor Henry Hamilton. [...] "This stroke", said Clark, [...] "will nearly {{put an end to the}} Indian War." [...] Clark prepared for a Detroit campaign in 1779 and again in 1780, but each time called off the expedition because of insufficient men and supplies. [...] "Detroit lost for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few Men", he lamented.|$|E

[...] In the concluding article, published in October, 1957, Dewar wrote that the failure of the Navy to adequately support the Army at Gallipoli [...] "is {{to be found in the}} system of training officers which consciously or unconsciously suppressed independent thought and suggestions from subordinates." [...] Despite his later close association with Churchill, he criticised the former First Lord's unrealistic expectations and also Lord Fisher's inability to rein him in for <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> naval staff; and Admiral of the Fleet (at the time Commodore) Roger Keyes for actively trying to gain support for forcing the straits again instead of acting as chief of staff and only advising the Naval Commander at the Dardanelles.|$|E

Cope's companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions. Cope would suffer from a [...] "severe attack of nightmare" [...] in which [...] "every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night... sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumber." [...] Nevertheless, Cope continued to lead the party from sunrise to sunset, sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds. The severe desert conditions and Cope's habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him, and in 1872, he broke down from exhaustion. Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879.|$|E

He and his entourage were provided with Sayes Court to reside in during their stay by William III. The Russians spent three months in London before leaving to tour the country. Benbow promptly asked for reparations from the Treasury, {{in order to be}} able to reimburse Evelyn and recover his own losses. He complained that the Russians had caused considerable damage to his house, with [...] "much of the furniture broke, lost or destroyed". Christopher Wren was instructed to survey the property and declared it [...] "entirely ruined". Benbow lost [...] "twenty fine paintings" [...] and [...] "several fine draughts and other designs relating to the Sea" [...] from his personal property. The Treasury eventually allowed payment of £350 9s. 6d. in compensation.|$|E

Money was freely lent, without security, to drovers to enable them to purchase cattle, and the <b>wants</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large agricultural district were soothed in a similarly paternal manner.’ It may be that such harsh criticism was due to the writer being a heavy depositor in the bank.|$|R
