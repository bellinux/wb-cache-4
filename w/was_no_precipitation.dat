40|$|Ag {{nanoparticles}} with diameter in {{the range}} of 10 - 25 nm had been synthesized using a simple sucrose ester micellar-mediated method. Ag nanoparticles were formed by adding AgNO 3 solution into the sucrose ester micellar solution containing sodium hydroxide at atmospheric condition after 24 h of aging time. Trace amount of dimethyl formamide (DMF) in the sucrose ester solution served as a reducing agent while NaOH acted as a catalyst. The produced Ag nanoparticles were highly stable in the sucrose ester micellar system as there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>precipitation</b> after 6 months of storage. The as-synthesized Ag nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-vis). Formation mechanism of Ag nanoparticles in the micellar-mediated synthesis is postulated. The antibacterial properties of the Ag nanoparticles were tested against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Gram-positive) and Aeromonas hydrophila (Gram-negative) bacteria.

However, due to their lower formability the forming processes are still in development. This paper investigates one such forming process called hot stamping. The investigation started by carrying out hot tensile testing of an AW- 7 xxx alloy, that is, AW- 7921 at temperatures between 350 °C and 475 °C, to measure the strength and formability. Formability was found to improve with increasing temperature and was sensitive to the strain rate. Dynamic recovery is considered as usual reason for the formability improvement. However, examining the precipitation states of the as-received condition and after hot stamping using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the dissolution of precipitates was also believed to contribute to this increase in formability.

40|$|Duplex and superduplex {{stainless}} steels present superior mechanical and corrosion properties {{when compared to}} usual {{stainless steels}}. This superiority is based on chemical composition when in a balanced microstructure (approximately 50 % of ferrite). During welding, changes may occur in both, the chemical composition and volume fraction of phases in the material, which may generate the presence of intermetallic phases and, as a consequence, modify the mechanical and corrosion properties of this group of stainless steels. The objective of this work is to apply ASTM A 923 - Practice A to verify the presence of intermetallic phases in welded joints of UNS 32750 su-perduplex stainless steel. Tubes of UNS 32750, with external diameters of 18 and 44 mm and a thickness of 1. 5 mm, were welded using orbital GTAW, with filler metal 25 Cr- 10 Ni- 4 Mo and a diameter of 0. 8 mm.

When tephra is produced, prevailing winds can transport the tephra over large distances, {{where they are}} then deposited due to gravitational and/or precipitational fallout. The goal {{of this paper is}} to detect and chemically analyse middle to late Holocene cryptotephras in the Netherlands and trace these tephras back to their source. The Rheinberg and Zijderveld cores are sampled and a separation method based on heavy liquid separation was adapted for use on clay-rich material. Instead of ashing the samples in a furnace, which would result in producing bricks from the clay, H 2 O 2 is used to dissolve all the organic material. The material is then subjected to heavy liquid separation. The particles remaining were then analysed with the optical microscope and a tephra shard count was done. The particles were deemed tephra based on their morphology and optical properties. However, after chemical analysis using the SEM, all of these supposed tephra particles turned out to be biogenic silica or mica. No Icelandic tephras were present. The biogenic silica was mistaken to be tephra due to its tephra-like morphology and the same optical properties. The absence of tephras can be explained in three possible ways: 1) the ashcloud did not extend as far as the Rheinberg and Zijderveld localities, 2) the deposition occurred by wet fallout and since there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>precipitation</b> in the Netherlands there was no tephra deposition and 3) the localities were not suitable for deposition of tephra due to the possible presence of running water...|$|E

Since colder air can hold less water vapour, moisture condenses to form clouds and precipitates as rain or snow above the mountain's upwind slopes. The change of state from vapour to liquid water is accompanied by heating, and the subsequent removal of moisture as precipitation renders this heat gain irreversible, leading to the warm, dry foehn conditions in the mountain's lee.

40|$|Various {{carbohydrates}} {{have been}} added to the fluid cultures of different strains of spirochetes in order to determine the behavior of the latter toward the carbohydrates. In the present experiment, amygdalin, arabinose, beerwort, dextrin, galactose, glycogen, glucose, inulin, lactose, levulose, maltose, mannite, raffinose, saccharose, and starch were tested with seven strains of Treponema pallidum and one strain each of Treponema calligyrum, Treponema microdentium, Treponema mucosum, and Spirochata refringens. The results may be summarized as follows: 1. In the media containing glycogen and glucose, Treponema microdentium did not grow as vigorously as in other sugar media, and an earlier degeneration set in. One strain of the pallidum and the calligyrum and mucosum showed a poor growth in the glycogen medium. Similarly, there was little growth in the second transfer of these spirochetes in the glucose medium. The growth of the spirochetes in the media containing carbohydrates other than those Just mentioned was generally good, and no difference could be distinguished between these and the control cultures without any carbohydrate. The only phenomenon which might be interpreted as indicating a favorable influence of these media upon growth was the abundant growth of the mucosum, which showed uniform length, regular curves, and active motility somewhat better than in the sugar-free medium. 2. The height of acidity was found in the cultures containing glycogen and glucose in the microdentium, amounting to 0. 1 N 4. 8 cc. for 10 cc. of the fluid culture. In the other sugar media the acidity varied between 0. 1 N 2 cc. and 0. 1 N 3. 2 cc. for the same amount. In the control cultures, the acidity fluctuated from 0. 1 N 0. 8 cc. to 0. 1 N 2 cc. There was no visible alteration in the appearance of the media after the spirochetes had grown for 3 or 4 weeks. In the case of Treponema microdenlium, a slight opalescence developed in the glycogen and glucose media after several weeks' standing, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>precipitation</b> or coagulation of the proteins of the culture media. 3. There was no unusual morphological change in the spirochetes grown in the media containing any of the carbohydrates employed. The only phenomena which should be mentioned are (a) the frequent presence of the terminal appendages (or projections) in the refringens, and in most of the pallidum strains, and (b) the appearance of minute, retractile spherical bodies along the side of the spirochetes in the microdenlium cultivated in the glucose or glycogen media. Judging from the earlier degeneration of the species in the above mentioned media, these peculiar bodies may be interpreted as indicating a phase of plasmoptysis associated with the unfavorable surroundings prior to degeneration. Experimental evidence was not found for considering these spherules as a resistant or spore form of the spirochete...|$|E

The overall goal of the rainfall manipulation project is to understand the coupled ecological and hydrological responses of a grassland, shrubland and a mixed grass-shrub vegetation community to extended periods of increased or decreased rainfall. Rainfall manipulation plots have been established in each of these three vegetation communities in the Five Points area of Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. In each vegetation community, three control plots, three drought treatment plots, and three water addition plots have been installed, each approximately 10 x 15 m in size. In each plot, vertical profiles of soil moisture probes have been installed under each cover type (canopy and interspace in grassland and shrubland; grass canopy, shrub canopy and interspace at the ecotone (mixed grass-shrub) site). The probes measure differences in infiltration and soil water content and potential associations with these different cover types. In addition, TDR probes have been installed diagonally in each cover type to integrate the water content of the top 15 cm of soil. Each plot contains 18, 1 m 2 quads made up of 6, 1 m 2 quads along each of the 3 transects located across each plot. Each spring and fall, the following parameters are measured in every quad: live plant cover, height, and abundance by species; dead plant cover; soil cover; litter cover; and rock cover. Data collection began in the drought and control plots in the spring of 2002. Data collection began in the water addition plots in the spring of 2004. In the grassland and shrubland communities, all nine currently established plots are located together. The three drought plots were located under a single large roof with a 0. 5 m path separating each plot (drought treatments ended in 2006). The control plots and water addition plots are similarly grouped, but without the shelter structure. In the ecotone community, the plots are in three groups; each group is comprised of one drought plot, one water addition plot, and one control plot. Control plots received no experimental treatment, while the sliding roofs over the drought plots were used to divert precipitation, producing a long-term drought. The roofs covering the drought plots were lowered when there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>precipitation</b> so that the amount of sunlight received by the drought plots was minimally affected. Water addition was intended to impose a complementary increase in water supply on the water addition plots. ...|$|E

Another experiment using the same model but with the initial vortex replaced by a disturbance with a different structure shows that a state resembling the observed pre-genesis disturbances can be simulated and this state can lead to spontaneous cyclogenesis, a rapid transition between two quasi-equilibria. This spontaneous cyclogenesis is associated with the generation of a new convective region at large radius and its subsequent contraction, which reminds one of the observed eye-wall replacement, but the distinction from the latter is obvious...|$|R

This thesis demonstrates that whilst precipitation does impact on traffic speeds, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> universal significant single factor relationship.

In addition to speed flow, the impact of precipitation on road traffic accidents was also investigated. Fifteen percent of accidents in the UK occur in wet weather. Precipitation related accidents are shown to have a prolonged impact on the road network and can continue to cause a decrease in traffic speed and flow for up to three hours afterwards. With increased instances of heavy precipitation predicted as a result of climate change, these findings highlight the subsequent impact on journey speeds, travel times, traffic flows and the associated economic costs...|$|R

Understanding of the phase behaviour of systems containing asphaltenes is very important to develop effective asphaltene deposition mitigation strategies. In order to get a better understanding of asphaltenes and in particular to get more insight in relations between molecular structural features and observed macroscopic behaviour, the phase behaviour of two poly-aromatic molecules (violanthrone- 79 and hexa-tert-butylhexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene) was studied. Although both compounds do not represent all specific features of real asphaltenes, it is expected that to some extend they do. For instance, real asphaltenes are ill-defined mixtures and hard to characterize, while the selected poly-aromatic compounds form a well-defined system with toluene and CO 2. The poly-aromatic compounds were selected based on their molecular features and their tendency to self-assemble. The phase behaviour of solutions of these compounds in toluene was studied in the presence of different concentrations of carbon dioxide with a so-called Cailletet apparatus. The results in this work showed that the concentration of carbon dioxide affects the precipitation of the poly-aromatic compounds. At low concentration there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>precipitation,</b> i. e., carbon dioxide acts as a co-solvent, while at higher concentration, carbon dioxide acts as an anti-solvent and the poly-aromatic molecule in the ternary system precipitates.

Cyclone center-relative compositing mean fields are constructed for four life stages: 1) developing, 2) maximum deepening, 3) minimum center sea level pressure (SLP), and 4) decaying. These stages are distinguished by a value {{and a kind}} of differentiation in center SLP using a database of cyclone tracking derived from a reanalysis dataset. The developing processes of the composited cyclone are documented. In developing stage, the・ water vapor pass (WVP) has south-north (high-low) contrast corresponding to the temperature distribution. Corresponding to the cold-dry air mass advections, WVP concentration starts from western part of the cyclone center in the maximum deepening stage. The concentration is distinct along the cold front in the minimum SLP stage. The horizontal distributions at the maximum deepening stage agree with the previous study using global objectively analyzed dataset (GANAL).

The Antares project [...] "Mars Small-Scale Weather" [...] (MSW) has recently identified some minor weaknesses in current global climate models (GCMs) due to the GCMs' more primitive soil modeling [...] "heat admission {{to the ground and}} back is quite important in Mars, so soil schemes have to be quite accurate. [...] " [...] Those weaknesses are being corrected and should lead to more accurate future assessments, but make continued reliance on older predictions of modeled Martian climate somewhat problematic.At low latitudes the Hadley circulation dominates, and is essentially the same as the process which on Earth generates the trade winds. At higher latitudes a series of high and low pressure areas, called baroclinic pressure waves, dominate the weather. Mars is drier and colder than Earth, and in consequence dust raised by these winds tends to remain in the atmosphere longer than on Earth as there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>precipitation</b> to wash it out (excepting CO2 snowfall). One such cyclonic storm was recently captured by the Hubble space telescope (pictured below).|$|R
30|$|Stage 1 : Fast calcite precipitation—slow analcite {{dissolution}} (Fig.  12). At {{the beginning}} of the simulation, the mineral saturation index showed that pore water in the Xing’anling Formation was oversaturated with respect to calcite and undersaturated with respect to analcite, causing rapid calcite precipitation. Because the calcite reaction rate is high, this stage lasts a very short time (10  s). Only a little analcite can be dissolved in such a brief time, and the concentrations of Al 3 + and SiO 2 (aq) in the fluids <b>are</b> low, so <b>no</b> <b>precipitation</b> of kaolinite or quartz occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the reserve}} is in the [...] "North Tibetan Plateau-Kunlun Mountains alpine desert" [...] ecoregion, an area {{characterized}} by extreme aridity, high winds, and very cold winters. [...] The northeast {{of the reserve}} around Lake Ayakum is in the Qaidam Basin semi-desert. Qaidam is the Mongolian word for 'salt', and the region is one of gravelly desert and some saline meadows and salt lakes. [...] Temperatures reach an average high of 56.5 F in August, and average lows of -18.6 F in January. There <b>is</b> little to <b>no</b> <b>precipitation</b> in most years, but some frost cover.|$|R
40|$|Chemical and {{magnetic}} states of iron doped tin oxide (SnO 2) as a diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) {{at room temperature}} have been investigated using 57 Fe Mössbauer spectrometry, XRD and magnetometery. The influence of the doping conditions of SnO 2 with iron on the generation of oxygen defects was reviewed and discussed {{on the basis of}} ab initio calculations. The magnetic properties depended on preparation conditions, such as thermal decomposition and sol-gel processing as well as 57 Fe and super-dilute 57 Mn implantation. It was shown that Sb codoping in Fe doped SnO 2 increases the saturation magnetization. Doping of Fe(Sb) -SnO 2 with nonmagnetic Zn ions up to 7 % also increases the magnetization although there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>precipitation</b> of crystalline magnetic phases. The co-doping of two transition metal ions (Fe-Co, Fe-Mn, Fe-Ni and Fe-V) in SnO 2 matrix enhanced the magnetization as compared with that of single metal ion doped samples. It is suggested from different valence states of doped metal ions that double exchange interactions occur through or near the oxygen vacancies in SnO 2. The SnO 2 doped with dilute 57 Fe may show the intrinsic and/or extrinsic DMS properties. Oxygen vacancies {{play an important role in}} the intrinsic DMS. The intrinsic nature of DMS is supported by both, experimental results and ab initio calculations. The long range interactions between diluted magnetic ions are considered to occur through electrons produced by oxygen vacancies or electrons induced by Sb 5 + doping...|$|R
