25|$|Door <b>weatherstripping</b> is {{particularly}} important for energy efficiency. German-made Passive House doors use multiple weatherstrips, including magnetic strips, to meet higher standards. These weatherstrips are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage.|$|E
25|$|Many doors {{may have}} good R-values at their center, but their overall energy {{efficiency}} is reduced {{because of the}} presence of glass and reinforcing elements, or because of poor <b>weatherstripping</b> and the way the door is manufactured.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} keep the supply of {{electricity}} consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand. If this is done by changing loads it is referred to as demand side management (DSM). [...] For decades, utilities have sold off-peak power to large consumers at lower rates, to encourage these users to shift their loads to off-peak hours, {{in the same way that}} telephone companies do with individual customers. [...] Usually, these time-dependent prices are negotiated ahead of time. [...] In an attempt to save more money, some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minute-by-minute spot prices, which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen, and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money. Demand side management can be manual or automatic and is not limited to large industrial customers. In residential and small business applications, for example, appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of water heaters, air conditioning units, refrigerators, and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw. Energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to off-peak hours. A particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more energy efficient equipment. For example, many utilities give rebates for the purchase of insulation, <b>weatherstripping,</b> and appliances and light bulbs that are energy efficient. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient, as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional air-sourced heat pumps or resistive heating. Companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products, but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment, like boilers, or use more efficient processes to produce products. Companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment. Facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS).|$|E

50|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>weatherstripping</b> can be significantly increased by specialty coatings during manufacture. Coatings for <b>weatherstripping</b> must adhere {{to all of}} these weatherstrip materials. Like other paints and coatings, a large variety of weatherstrip coatings are commonly available, with a large variety of coating performances. Silicone is the most difficult to adhere to, but at least one coating is commercially available. After bonding to the weatherstrip, these coatings provide chemical and ultraviolet resistance, decrease the static coefficient of friction (thereby reducing the force required to open or close doors), and reduce or eliminate noise. In vehicles without coated <b>weatherstripping,</b> the <b>weatherstripping</b> is much more likely to cause the above-mentioned issues along with others such as rust following premature failure of the paint. That some cars have non-coated <b>weatherstripping</b> is surprising, given that the cost of the coating is less than US$1 to US$3 per vehicle, whereas the rubber and steel is tens of dollars; an entire car set of <b>weatherstripping</b> may be worth US$100 to US$300 in the total cost of the vehicle, which includes all labor and costs of the manufacturing equipment.|$|E

50|$|Every {{exterior}} door, or door to an uninsulated room {{such as an}} attic, must be weatherstripped {{as required}} by building codes in various jurisdictions. The materials used in door <b>weatherstripping</b> are thresholds, a piece of material (either a sweep or a J-hook) to match {{the door to the}} threshold, and the actual <b>weatherstripping</b> itself. Doors can usually be divided into private homes and commercial properties. Some of these doors receive custom <b>weatherstripping</b> at the factory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Weatherstripping</b> is {{the process}} of sealing {{openings}} such as doors, windows, and trunks from the elements. The term can also refer to the materials used to carry out such sealing processes. The goal of <b>weatherstripping</b> is to prevent rain and water from entering entirely or partially and accomplishes this by either returning or rerouting water. A secondary goal of <b>weatherstripping</b> is to keep interior air in, thus saving energy on heating and air conditioning.|$|E
50|$|Low-energy {{buildings}} {{require special}} doors with special <b>weatherstripping</b> standards, {{based on the}} alignment of the threshold and jamb gasketing, multiple <b>weatherstripping,</b> and special seals - including special silicone or synthetic rubber seals, but also compression and steel magnetic weatherstrips.|$|E
50|$|Pre-weatherstripped {{doors for}} private homes are usually made of {{fiberglass}} {{or a similar}} material and are shipped from the factory <b>weatherstripped.</b> The doors have a kerf in the door stop so that a foam, rubber, or vinyl strip can be placed inside for the door to rest against when closed. These doors also have the threshold — usually a molded piece of plastic — nailed to the frame in the factory. These units are not difficult to install and require only very little skill.|$|R

50|$|Each mast of the Viaduct is {{equipped}} with a monoaxial layer of eleven pairs of cable-stays; laid face to face. Depending on their length, the cable stays were made of 55 to 91 high tensile steel cables, or strands, themselves formed of seven strands of steel (a central strand with six intertwined strands). Each strand has triple protection against corrosion (galvanisation, a coating of petroleum wax, and an extruded polyethylene sheath). The exterior envelope of the stays is itself coated along its entire length with a double helical <b>weatherstrip.</b> The idea is to avoid running water which, in high winds, could cause vibration in the stays and compromise the stability of the viaduct.|$|R

40|$|Conservation is {{recognized}} as one important was Americans can lower their energy use and save money. The purpose {{of this research was}} to determine the energy and economic savings which 50 low and moderate income level homeowners in Delaware Count could generate by implementing nine conservation measures. The conservation measures included: 1. In the winter turn down the thermostat during the day and night if the present setting is greater than 68 ° F. 2. Reduce the hot water heater setting to 100 °- 120 °F. 3. Caulk and <b>weatherstrip</b> where needed. 4. Insulate the hot water pipes and the furnace heat ducts. 5. Install shower flow controllers. 6. Insulate and <b>weatherstrip</b> the attic recess. 7. Turn off the furnace pilot light during the summer. 8. Insulate the hot water heater if in an unheated basement or garage. 9. Seal the chimney in the winter when not used. The nine conservation measures were recommended by the researcher on a house-by-house basis. The researcher found that the type of heating fuel used in the home, {{the presence or absence of}} certain appliances in the home, the past involvement (if any) of the homeowner in other conservation programs, and the lifestyle practices of the household determined which of the nine conservation measures could be implemented in the home. The researcher estimated the amount of energy (BTU’s) and money which could be saved by implementing the conservation measures which were recommended for each homeowner and supplied this information to the study group. This investigation revealed that all 50 homeowners would have payback periods of less than one year if the conservation measures were implemented with short-lived material requiring annual replacement with the average savings being approximately $ 97. 00. When longer-lived materials which would last five years or more were employed, only 27 of the homeowners would have payback periods shorter than one year unless homeowners for whom a furnace thermostat setback had been recommended did so by more than one degree Fahrenheit. The investigation revealed that when the thermostat was turned down three degrees Fahrenheit 40 homeowners would have payback periods less than one year and that 43 would have payback period of shorter than one year if a six degree Fahrenheit setback was employed.

In the first phase, an existing single equation kinetic model is used to predict the crosslinking density under sulfur vulcanization at variable temperatures. The model requires the calibration of only three kinetic constants. The variation with respect to temperature of such parameters is then evaluated by means of two experimental cure curves performed at two different temperatures. In the second phase, kinetic reaction parameters are implemented in finite element software, to perform thermal analyses on an extruded <b>weatherstrip.</b> Once evaluated the final mechanical properties of the item point by point, a set of compression tests is numerically simulated, assuming that the rubber behaves as a Mooney–Rivlin material under the large deformations.
