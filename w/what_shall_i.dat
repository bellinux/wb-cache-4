She {{was best known}} for her {{performances}} of songs such as [...] "The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery", [...] "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)" [...] and [...] "Oh Mr Porter <b>What</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>I</b> Do". [...] She received both criticism and praise for her use of innuendo and double entendre during her performances, but enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the [...] "Queen of the Music Hall".|$|E
500|$|Sometime during August 1861, Sam Jr. {{enlisted in}} the Confederate States Army 2nd Texas Infantry Regiment, Company C Bayland Guards, sending Margaret into melancholia. She dreaded that her first-born child would never be home again. [...] "My heart seems almost broken... <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> do? How shall I bear it? When I first heard the news, I thought I would lie down and die," [...] she wrote to her mother. Houston tried to help out by {{assuming}} care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston. Her fears seemed well-founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh. A second bullet was stopped by his Bible, bearing an inside inscription from Margaret. He was found languishing in a field by a Union Army clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket. Taken prisoner and sent to Camp Douglas in Illinois, he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October.|$|E

2500|$|The wider U.S. {{economy was}} soon {{hit by the}} effects of the Trent crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock {{exchange}} fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community [...] "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough". A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers. Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General Meigs [...] "General, <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> do? The people are impatient; Chase has no money, and he tells me he can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is out of the tub. <b>What</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> do?"

2500|$|When Mary was three, Godwin {{left his}} daughters {{in the care}} of James Marshall while he {{travelled}} to Ireland. Godwin's tone in his letters demonstrates how much he cared about them. [...] His letters show the stress he placed on giving his two daughters a sense of security. [...] "And now <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> say for my poor little girls? I hope they have not forgot me. I think of them every day, and should be glad, if the wind was more favourable, to blow them a kiss a-piece from Dublin to the Polygon.. but I have seen none that I love so well or think half so good as my own." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1915, Rogers {{began to appear in}} Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential—and regular—customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on {{the news of the day}} {{followed}} a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, [...] "Well, <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> talk about? I ain't got anything funny to say. All I know is what I read in the papers." [...] He would make jokes about what he had read in that day's newspapers. The line [...] "All I know is what I read in the papers" [...] is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{influence of}} Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school. Aristotle's notable students included Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Eudemos of Rhodes, Harpalus, Hephaestion, Mnason of Phocis, Nicomachus, and Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great {{is seen in}} the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained [...] "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?" ...|$|E

2500|$|An anecdote {{characteristic}} of rabbinical sympathy for inferiors and domestics is thus related: The wife of R. Jose had a quarrel with her maid, {{and her husband}} declared her in the wrong; whereupon she said to him, [...] "Wherefore didst thou declare me wrong {{in the presence of}} my maid?" [...] To which the rabbi replied, [...] "Did not Job (xxxi. 13) say, 'If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me, what then shall I do when God riseth up? And when He visiteth, <b>what</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> answer Him?'" [...] (Gen. R. xlviii. 3). When Assi died, R. Hiya b. Abba, who had been his associate as judge and as teacher, went into mourning as for a relative (Yer. Ber. iii. 6a). The day of his death is recorded as coincident with a destructive hurricane (M. Ḳ. 26b).|$|E
2500|$|Nine {{days after}} the {{shipwreck}} Anna landed in Cardiff, Wales, and cabled Horatio, [...] "Saved alone. <b>What</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> do [...] [...] [...]". After receiving Anna's telegram, Horatio immediately left Chicago to bring his wife home. On the Atlantic crossing, the captain of his ship called Horatio to his cabin {{to tell him that}} they were passing over the spot where his four daughters had perished. He wrote to Rachel, his wife's half-sister, [...] "On Thursday last we passed over the spot where she went down, in mid-ocean, the waters three miles deep. But I do not think of our dear ones there. They are safe, folded, the dear lambs". Horatio later wrote the famous hymn [...] "It Is Well with My Soul", commemorating his daughters. Philip Bliss, who composed the music for the hymn, called his tune Ville du Havre, after the name of the stricken vessel.|$|E
2500|$|Smith was despondent over {{losing his}} {{child and the}} manuscript.

All is lost! all is lost! <b>What</b> <b>shall</b> <b>I</b> do? I have sinnedit is I who tempted the wrath of God." [...] After returning to Harmony without Harris, Smith dictated to Emma his first written revelation, which rebuked him for losing the manuscript pages, but pinned most of the blame upon Harris [...] However, the revelation assured Smith that all was not lost, because if Smith repented of what he had done, God would [...] "only cause thee to be afflicted for a season, and thou art still chosen, and wilt again be called to the work" [...]|$|E
