5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E

Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the worldview that the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.|$|E

25|$|In May 2016, Peter {{was joined}} on his 'Eudaimonia' tour by Drew McConnell (bass), Miki Beavis (violin), Katia de Vidas (keyboard), Stephany Kaberian (accordion) and Rafa (drums). He was also joined by Jack Jones of Trampolene on guitar, who was {{support on the}} tour. He shared new track ‘The <b>Whole</b> <b>World</b> <b>Is</b> Our Playground' on 4 May 2016. In November 2016 Jack Jones was {{announced}} as lead guitarist in Peter's band The Puta Madres, joining Drew McConnell (bass), Miki Beavis (violin), Katia de Vidas (keyboard) and Rafa (drums). Peter Doherty and the Puta Madres played a gig in Argentina, followed by a week of shows in France including two nights for the reopening of the Bataclan. They played Kentish Town Forum in London and Manchester Albert Hall in December 2016 and several dates across Europe in February and March 2017.|$|E
25|$|Edgar, in his madman's guise, {{meets his}} blinded {{father on the}} heath. Gloucester, not {{recognising}} him, begs Tom to lead him to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience—he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear, and the mutilation of Gloucester, and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan; receiving news of Cornwall's death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan's instigation, Albany joins his forces with hers against the French. Goneril's suspicions about Regan's motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald {{that she is a}} more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now completely mad. He rants that the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> corrupt and runs off.|$|E
25|$|The <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> said to {{be filled}} with living beings. In all the three parts, there is the {{existence}} of very small living beings called nigoda. Nigoda are of two types: nitya-nigoda and Itara-nigoda. Nitya-nigoda are those which will reborn as nigoda throughout eternity where as Itara-nigoda will be reborn as other beings too. The mobile region of universe (Trasandi) is one Rajju wide, one Rajju broad and fourteen Rajju high. Within this, there are animals and plants everywhere where as Human beings are restricted to 2.5 continents of middle world. The beings inhabiting lower world are called Naraki (Hellish beings). Deva (roughly demi-gods) live in whole of the top and middle world and top three realms of lower world. Living beings are divided in fourteen classes (Jivasthana) : 1. fine beings with one sense. 2. Crude beings with one sense. 3. beings with two sense. 4. beings with three sense. 5. Beings with four sense. 6. beings with five sense without mind. 7. beings with five sense with a mind. These can be under-developed or developed which makes it a total of fourteen. Human beings get any form of existence and are the only ones which can attain salvation.|$|E

500|$|Todd Steiner, {{executive}} director of the Turtle Island Restoration Network raised money for a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible. [...] "Jairo’s murderers must be brought to justice so that [...] know that this will never be tolerated," [...] said Steiner in a statement. [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> watching to make sure the Costa Rican government brings these thugs to justice and makes sea turtle nesting beaches safe for conservationists to do their work."

500|$|Eleven {{weeks before}} the Beatles' arrival in the U.S. President JohnF. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The nation was in mourning, in fear, and in disbelief. The {{assassination}} came after a fifteen-year build-up of Cold War tension. The motivation and identity of the assassin would be doubted by many Americans for decades, despite the Warren Commission's issued report in September 1964. As the United States tried to restore a sense of normality, teenagers in particular struggled to cope, as their disbelief began {{to be replaced by}} a personal reaction to what had happened: in school essays, teenagers wrote that [...] "then it became real", and [...] "I was feeling the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> going to collapse on me", and [...] "I never felt so empty in all my life".|$|E
500|$|In 1964, Smythe {{opposed the}} Lester Pearson government's plan {{to replace the}} {{traditional}} Canadian flag with a completely new design. He wrote to Pearson, whom he had known since the 1920s: [...] "In the Olympic Games, the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> represented and when Canada sometimes wins a Gold Medal everybody knows, when the Red Ensign (see Canadian Red Ensign) is raised to the masthead, that Canada has won." [...] Smythe disagreed that a new flag would help to unify the country. Smythe switched his support to John Diefenbaker. Smythe wrote over 300 letters to Members of Parliament. In 1965, he unsuccessfully lobbied for the Red Ensign to be flown at the Gardens instead of the new Flag of Canada. Harold Ballard ordered the new flag flown because calls were more than three to one in favour of the new flag.|$|E

[...] In the storyline, Khan rushes to deal with the threat in Manhattan. However, Wilson revealed, [...] "She will face a very personal enemy as the chaos in Manhattan spills over into Jersey City, and she will be forced to make some very difficult choices. There will also be a very special guest appearance by a superhero Kamala—and the fans—have been waiting to meet for a long time." ...|$|E

500|$|On December 31, 1999, a pizza {{delivery}} {{boy named}} Philip J. Fry delivers a pizza to [...] "Applied Cryogenics" [...] in New York City {{only to discover}} that the order was actually a prank call. Dejected and demoralized, he stops in the deserted lab to eat the pizza while outside the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> getting ready to celebrate the beginning of New Year. At midnight, Fry falls into an open cryonic tube and is frozen as it immediately activates. He is defrosted on Tuesday, December 31, 2999, in what is now New New York City. He is taken to a fate assignment officer named Leela, a purple-haired cyclops. To his misfortune, Fry is assigned the computer-determined permanent career of delivery boy, and flees into the city when Leela tries to implant Fry's career chip designating his job.|$|E
500|$|In a {{directive}} letter dated 30 July 1942, Ostojić urged all Chetnik commanders to [...] "develop the strongest possible {{oral and written}} propaganda". He stated that, [...] "the people must be persuaded that the Chetniks are their only friends {{and that it is}} from them that they can expect freedom and a happy life" [...] and instructed the Chetniks to [...] "work day and night and maintain the spirit of the people". He wrote, [...] "the hour of freedom is near. Allied aid for the Chetniks is assured, and the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> admiring them." [...] In August, he launched a counterattack against Ustaše troops returning to Foča as the Italians withdrew their garrisons from the hinterland. The Chetniks feared the Ustaše were about to unleash another round of genocidal violence on the Serb population in the area. At least 2,000 local Muslims were subsequently killed in Foča by forces under Ostojić's command.|$|E
500|$|Celebrations {{surrounding}} the inauguration, {{praise of the}} event's significance and congratulations to Obama on his inauguration were internationally diverse. In Kenya, the home country of Obama's father, people celebrated the inauguration as a public holiday. Indonesians and Americans in Jakarta watched the inauguration at a free midnight ball featuring performances by students from State Elementary School Menteng 01, the school that Obama attended as a child. The city of Obama in Japan celebrated the event with fireworks, bell-ringing and hula-dancing at the Hagaji Temple. Governor General Michaëlle Jean and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada extended congratulations on behalf of Canadians, while Mexican President Felipe Calderón wished Obama [...] "great success in the work as the new President of the United States". Israeli President Shimon Peres described Obama's inauguration as a [...] "great day" [...] for the United States, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown noted that [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> watching the inauguration of President Obama, witnessing {{a new chapter in}} both American history and the world's history." ...|$|E

500|$|On 11 August 1586, {{after being}} {{implicated in the}} Babington Plot, Mary was arrested while out riding and taken to Tixall. In a {{successful}} attempt to entrap her, Walsingham had deliberately arranged for Mary's letters to be smuggled out of Chartley. Mary was misled into thinking her letters were secure, while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham. From these letters {{it was clear that}} Mary had sanctioned the attempted assassination of Elizabeth. She was moved to Fotheringhay Castle in a four-day journey ending on 25 September, and in October was put on trial for treason under the Act for the Queen's Safety before a court of 36 noblemen, including Cecil, Shrewsbury, and Walsingham. Spirited in her defence, Mary denied the charges. She told her triers, [...] "Look to your consciences and remember that the theatre of the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> wider than the kingdom of England". She protested that she had been denied the opportunity to review the evidence, that her papers had been removed from her, that she was denied access to legal counsel and that as a foreign anointed queen she had never been an English subject and thus could not be convicted of treason.|$|E
500|$|Sages like Asvala, {{the priest}} in Janaka's court, Artabhaga, Bhujyu, Ushasta, and Uddalaka debated {{with him and}} asked {{questions}} philosophical subjects to which Yajnavalkya provided convincing replies and they lost the debate. It was then the turn of Gargi {{to take up the}} challenge. Gargi, as one of the disputants in the debate, questioned Yajnavalkya on his claim of superiority among the scholars. She held repeated arguments with him. Gargi and Yajnavalkya's exchange centered on the ultimate [...] "warp" [...] of reality ("warp" [...] means [...] "the basic foundation or material of a structure or entity). Her initial dialogue with Yajnavalkya tended to be too metaphysical, such as unending status of the soul, away from practical situations. She then changed her approach and asked him pointed questions related to the environment existing in the world, the question of the very origin of all existence. Her question was specific when she asked him [...] "since this <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> woven back and forth on water, on what then is woven back and forth", a question that related to the commonly known cosmological metaphor that expressed the unity of the world, its essential interconnectedness. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (3.6), the sequence of her posing a bevy of questions to Yajnavalkya and his replies is narrated as: ...|$|E
