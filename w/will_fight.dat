50|$|The {{difference}} between incitement and fighting words is subtle, {{focusing on the}} intent of the speaker. Inciting speech is characterized by the speaker's intent to make someone else the instrument of his or her unlawful <b>will.</b> <b>Fighting</b> words, by contrast, are intended to cause the hearer to react to the speaker.|$|R

As the three of them swap stories, Tyrion reveals that, when he was 16, he married a woman named Tysha whom Jaime and he had rescued. When his father Tywin learned of this, he made Jaime confess that Tysha was actually a hired prostitute. Tywin then made Tyrion watch as Lannister guardsmen all had sex with her, each paying her one silver coin provided by Lord Tywin.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males compete {{for access to}} females. Such competition can {{take the form of}} fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female for weeks at a time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> with other coalitions for control of females.|$|E

5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player; the guards <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> alongside the player, and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information. A wide array of alien enemies populate the game, including headcrabs, bullsquids, headcrab zombies, and Vortigaunts. The player also faces human opponents, in particular, Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins who are dispatched to contain the extra-dimensional threats and silence all witnesses.|$|E

Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will drops both coins into the chest, with his and Jack's blood on them. The curse is lifted, causing Barbossa to die from Jack's gunshot; the rest of Barbossa's crew, realizing that they are no longer immortal, surrender and are arrested.|$|E
5|$|The Azorov {{government}} {{stated that}} it <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> corruption. However several of its members are assigned to two or more government positions, and, of course, are paid for them. That fact reflects direct disregard for the Constitution of Ukraine. Some of the members do not even qualify to the assigned positions either as in case with Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy who {{was elected to the}} Supreme Council of Justice. Some {{of the members of the}} government received their government assignments without a basic knowledge of the state language as in case with the Minister of Internal Affairs Mohyliov. The President Yanukovych gave him two months (until August 2010) to learn the language.|$|E

5|$|The Markendeya Purana praises Varahi as a granter of boons and the regent of the Northern direction, in a hymn {{where the}} Matrikas are {{declared}} as the protectors of the directions. In another instance {{in the same}} Purana, she is described as riding a buffalo. The Devi Bhagavata Purana says Varahi, with the other Matrikas, is created by the Supreme Mother. The Mother promises the gods that the Matrikas <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> demons when needed. In the Raktabija episode, Varahi is described as having a boar form, fighting demons with her tusks while seated on a preta (corpse).|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|Demons can {{be talked}} with in battle and {{recruited}} {{if the right}} conversation is initiated. Once {{a part of the}} player's party, they <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> alongside them. In addition to standard demons, the player can ally with one human companion, with three being available on the first playthrough and a fourth unlocking during the second. When the player or their human partner dies in battle, they are granted a Guardian Spirit, who revives them at the last save point and teaches them new skills and alter the player's stats. The Guardian's specialties affect how stats are changed: a higher power ranking will raise the player's strength, but lower magic will decrease their Magic Point meter. The Guardian changes each time the player dies.|$|E

5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of heat {{over the course of}} a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E
5|$|Notably, KOF 94 innovated {{the genre}} by {{replacing}} a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting {{games with a}} format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose {{the order in which}} each of their team member enters the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to go first on their respective teams <b>will</b> <b>fight.</b> When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to jump in and perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's side, {{will be unable}} to help him because he will be fighting Jörmungandr. The god Freyr will engage the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will come forward and set his foot on to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E

5|$|The {{head of the}} Black Dragons (David Carradine, {{credited}} as Grand Master), pays a {{visit to}} Guam to take the matter into his own hands. It turns out {{that he is a}} man prominently seen ringside in Max's flashbacks. The Black Dragons kidnap Christy, enticing Max and Jane to come to their hideout. Max and Grand Master reach an agreement that Max <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> Arnold Chon's character to death. If Max wins, Max and the Goody sisters can go free. Max almost deals a deadly blow to the enforcer's head, but stops himself at the last moment, sparing his life, yet winning the fight. He turns over the urn to the yakuza, and receives a priceless katana as a gift. Max and his allies celebrate the end of the adventure in a party. The film ends with Max embracing Jane Goody on a beach during sunset.|$|E
5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy X-2, set {{two years}} after Final Fantasy X, Yuna {{is a member of}} the sphere hunting group Gullwings, along with Rikku and Paine. In the game's {{international}} version, the Gullwings go their separate ways before the game's opening, with Yuna returning to Besaid Island. The trio then reunite to explore a tower. In X-2, Yuna journeys to Spira in search of the truth behind a sphere containing a video featuring a man resembling Tidus in prison. During her journey, Yuna discovers the man from the sphere was actually Shuyin, a spirit who wishes to destroy Spira in revenge for the death of his lover, Lenne. The Gullwings defeat Shuyin who departs to the afterlife with Lenne's spirit. Depending on the player's progress throughout the game, the Fayth may revive Tidus so that she can reunite with him. The HD Remastered version of the game adds a new audio drama where Yuna becomes a part of the group called Yevoners whose main temple is located on Besaid. In the story she breaks up with Tidus after telling him she loves somebody else before declaring she <b>will</b> <b>fight</b> Sin once again.|$|E
