40|$|The {{first phase}} of the study of the {{performance}} of a <b>wormgear</b> transmission is reported. In this phase the work included the selection of a double-enveloping <b>wormgear</b> type, and its dimensions, suitable for use in helicopter transmissions; the 3 -D graphics representation of the selected <b>wormgear</b> using the I-DEAS software; the analysis of the kinematics of meshing; the analysis of load sharing among the meshing teeth; and the implementation of the analyses in a computer program. The report describes the analyses, their results, {{and the use of the}} computer programs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the contact patch resulting during the {{engagement in the}} worm face gears with modified geometry. The worm face gears, a gear known as spiroid, which {{was the subject of}} research is composed of a cylindrical worm flank with equal pressure angles which drives a <b>wormgear</b> face plane. The study of the contact between gear teeth was done for two combinations of materials: a hardened steel worm gear and the <b>wormgear</b> of cast iron and the other case a hardened steel worm and <b>wormgear</b> of steel in improved condition. The gears mounted in two gears have undergone a test upload and then the contact stains that occurred on teeth flanks wormgears were analyzed. This element highlights the mode of transmission of the load during operation an indicator of the quality of this gear in terms of loading. The tests have been made for the worm drive highlighting the behavior on both flanks of the <b>wormgear</b> face plane. ...|$|E

The resulting contact pattern of the meshing tooth surfaces is suitable for the implementation of hydrostatic lubrication Fluid film lubrication of the contact is formulated considering external pressurization as well as hydrodynamic wedge and squeeze actions. The lubrication analysis is aimed at obtaining the oil supply pressure needed to separate the worm and gear surfaces by a prescribed minimum film thickness. The procedure of solving the mathematical problem is outlined...|$|E
40|$|Research and {{development}} of <b>wormgear</b> drives have significantly focused on their geometrical accuracy, loadability tests, and their wear resistance and efficiency. The research {{has been going on}} in several directions. Individual method of problem solving is development new worm-gear sets and tools for their manufacturing. In the present study, worms with concave profile of their thread have been considered. To avoid the technological difficulties relevant to the application of special cutting tools for machining such gear sets, a rigid incongruent generating pair consisting of a standard hob and toroidal tool has been developed for processing the concave worm profile. The generating surface of the developed toroidal tool, which is essential for the tool manufacturing, was modeled on the basis of hob-toroidal tool interaction. The proposed method of modeling w as divided into three steps: first, the common surface for both hobbing and toroidal tools has been found in terms of hyperboloid of revolution of one sheet, then, the matrix method of transforming the coordinates, from the hob-axis reference frame to the toroidal tool-axis reference frame, has been utilized, and finally, an equation described the generating surface of the toroidal tool has been derived and presented. By using the proposed model and the obtained final equation the worm thread surface machined by the mentioned tool can be defined and experimented...|$|E
