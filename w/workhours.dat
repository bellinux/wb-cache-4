50|$|Tripartism {{became a}} popular form of {{economic}} policy during the economic crisis of the 1930s. Tripartism was supported {{from a number of}} different political perspectives at this time: one was Catholic social teaching; fascism supported this for fascist unions but repressed communist and social democratic unions; and in democratic politics. Tripartism is a prominent economic policy in Europe, particularly where Christian Democratic parties influenced by Catholic social teaching have held power; it is a core part of the economic systems in Scandinavia and the Benelux that were put in place by social democratic governments. An example is a national income policy agreement in Finland. Tripartite agreements are an important component in practical labour law, since they cover not only wages, but also issues such as policies on benefits, vacation, <b>workhours</b> and worker safety.|$|E
40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed at}} disentangling {{the effects of}} {{overtime}} hours from those of long <b>workhours.</b> For part-time workers, overtime work is not intertwined with long <b>workhours</b> {{as it is for}} full-time workers. Therefore, part-time and full-time employees were compared with regard to the association between overtime and well-being (fatigue and work motivation). Such comparisons may also shed more light on the psychological meaning of overtime work for part-time and full-time workers. Methods A survey study was conducted among a representative sample of Dutch employees (N= 2419). An analysis of covariance was used to investigate whether the relationship between overtime and well-being differs between marginal part-time (8 - 20 contractual <b>workhours),</b> substantial part-time (21 - 34 hours), and full-time (>= 35 hours) workers. Work characteristics (ie, job demands, decision latitude, and job variety), age, and gender were treated as covariates. Results No significant relationship between overtime and fatigue was found for any of the contract-hour groups. For the part-time workers, overtime was not related to higher work motivation, whereas for full-time workers it was. Conclusions It is important to distinguish between overtime and long <b>workhours,</b> given the differential overtime-motivation relationship among part-time and full-time workers. This finding suggests that part-time employees work overtime for reasons other than motivation or that working overtime does not enhance work motivation for this group of employees. Overtime work seems to have a different meaning for part-time and full-time workers...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{the present}} study was to test whether {{construction}} workers, who are known to have a relatively higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), had higher concentrations of cortisol in saliva and a lower relative variability when compared with white-collar workers. Methods Data from two groups of male construction workers with physically demanding job assignments, with either regular or extended <b>workhours</b> (N= 40) and a group of white-collar workers recruited from both the private and the public sector (N= 118) were examined. All of the workers had participated in previous research projects with similar methodology. Saliva was sampled during ordinary workdays at awakening, between 30 and 45 minutes after awakening, and approximately 14 hours after awakening. Results Compared with the white-collar workers, the construction workers had higher mean concentrations of cortisol in saliva, 36 % and 14 % for construction workers with regular and extended <b>workhours,</b> respectively. The observed differences weakened when the exact sampling time (time of day) was taken into consideration in the statistical modeling. Compared with the white-collar workers, the construction workers had a lower relative variability in salivary cortisol as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV 76 % versus 99 %). A detailed analysis revealed that the construction workers with regular <b>workhours</b> had the highest concentration of cortisol in saliva but the lowest relative variability when compared with the construction workers with extended <b>workhours</b> (CV 72 % versus 82 %). Conclusions The results suggest that physically demanding construction work is associated with a less variable and increased cortisol excretion when compared with white-collar work...|$|E
40|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) is a disorder caused by medianus nerve entrapment in carpal tunnel in {{the wrist and}} gives many symptoms as painfully, numbness, hyperesthesia at nerve medianus area. The objective {{of this study was}} to asses CTS in garment factory workers and determine the prevalence of CTS, CTS relation to age, sex, <b>workhour,</b> and repeated biomechanical pressure in hand/wrist. A cross sectional design was used in the study conducted in Jakarta in 2002, to 814 person sample with simple random sampling method. Data collection was done through interviews, inspections, and examinations. The study found that prevalence of CTS was 20. 3 % (n= 814) in work unit. Workers who worked with high repeated biomechanical pressure in right hand/wrist was 74. 1 %, in left hand/wrist were 65. 5 %. Carpal {{tunnel syndrome}} in female higher than CTS in male (p= 0. 04). There was  110 significant correlation between increased of age, <b>workhour,</b> repeated biomechanical pressure in hand/wrist and increased of CTS.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{commuting}} on labour supply patterns. A labour supply model is introduced which shows that commuting distance increases daily <b>workhours,</b> whereas the effect on total labour supply is ambiguous. This paper addresses these issues empirically using the socio-economic panel data for Germany between 1997 and 2007. Endogeneity of commuting distance is accounted for by using employer-induced changes in commuting distance. In line with the theoretical model developed, we find that commuting distance has a slight positive effect on daily <b>workhours.</b> Further, we find a similar effect on weekly labour supply, but no effect on workdays. Distinguishing between males and females, it appears that the effects on labour supply are mainly through the behaviour of females, but the effects for females are still small.

40|$|California's longstanding {{requirement}} {{that most women}} receive time-and-a-half pay for <b>workhours</b> beyond eight in one day was extended to men in 1980. Analyzing Current Population Survey data from 1973, 1985, and 1991, we find that this overtime penalty substantially reduced the amount of daily overtime worked by California men relative to men in other states. Comparisons that use women to control for California-specific shocks show even stronger effects.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of design effort and cost plays {{a vital role}} in authorizing funds and controlling budget during the project development process. Typically, the design phase consists of various engineering activities that require substantial efforts in delivering final construction documents for bid preparation. Estimating these efforts accurately and efficiently is critical for transportation agencies to properly allocate funds and assign appropriate time and resources. Previous studies have reported several problems associated with the {{estimation of}} design effort such as lack of predictive tools, inaccurate forecasts and misallocation of efforts. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a proactive scheme to estimate more accurate and reliable design efforts and costs in order improve the confidence of the design office at the negotiation table with consulting firms and finally enhance the accountability and transparencies of funding decisions. This study develops advanced design effort and cost estimation models using multivariate linear regression (MLR), multivariate polynomial regression (MPR) of second degree and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. First, the study develops a master database that consolidates various data points of historical pretensioned prestressed concrete beam (PPCB) bridge projects designed by external consultants. The master database includes data attributes such as bridge design attributes, various physical attributes of bridges, consultant’s proposed fees and <b>workhours,</b> Iowa Department of Transportation (DOTs) proposed fees and <b>workhours,</b> contracted fee and work hours and actual amount of fee paid after the completion of design. Seven MLR, MPR and ANN models have been developed to estimate design fees and work hours at different negotiation and design stages. Two approaches are used to predict cost and <b>workhours,</b> the first one utilized the data from bridge design attributes and the other one utilizes bridge design attributes along with number of various kinks of design sheets. The MLR, MPR and ANN models are developed using commercial prediction analytics software JMP pro. The performances of all the models are evaluated by comparing the MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error). The MLR models did not perform well because of their inability to recognize non-linear patterns whereas MPR models performed slightly better due to the ability of recognizing some non-linearity in the data. However, ANN models are able to detect non-linear patterns along with interactions in the training data. The results reveal that ANN models perform significantly better with MAPE range of 5 - 13 % with only bridge data attributes and MAPE range of 4 - 12 % with bridge data attributes and different design sheets as inputs...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent {{international}} {{data show}} that physicians often attend work while ill, termed sickness presenteeism. The current study investigated if sickness presenteeism scores among European physicians varied according to national paid sick leave legislation. We hypothesized that prevalence of presenteeism was higher in countries {{with lower levels of}} paid sick leave. We used repeated cross-sectional survey data, phase I (2004 / 2005, N = 1326) and phase II (2012 / 2013, N = 1403), among senior consultants at university hospitals in Sweden, Norway, and Italy. Analyses of variances assessed cross-country differences in presenteeism. To assess the impact of country on presenteeism, we used multiple regression analyses controlled for sex, age, family status, work hours, and work content. The results from phase I supported the initial hypothesis. At phase II, presenteeism scores had decreased among the Italian and Swedish sample. The results are discussed with regard to changes in legislation on <b>workhours</b> and medical liability in Italy and Sweden between phase I and II...|$|E
40|$|A new {{paradigm}} for transport economists has been established: revenues of a welfare-maximising road tax should {{be employed to}} reduce {{the level of a}} distortionary income tax. An essential assumption to reach this conclusion is that the number of workdays is optimally chosen, whereas daily <b>workhours</b> are fixed, implying that given a road tax, workers may only reduce their commuting costs by reducing total labour supply. However, a labour supply model which also allows for optimally chosen daily hours implies that commuting costs increase daily hours, whereas the effect on total labour supply is ambiguous. This paper addresses this issue empirically by analysing the relationship between labour supply patterns and commuting distance using the socio-economic panel data for Germany between 1997 and 2007. Endogeneity of commuting distance is accounted for by using employer-induced changes in commuting distance. In line with the theoretical model developed, we find that commuting distance has a positive effect on daily hours. Our analysis does not find a negative effect of commuting distance on total labour supply, suggesting that a reduction in the income tax, as advocated in the literature, may not be necessary.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether worktime control buffered {{the impact of}} worktime demands on work–family interference (WFI), using data from 2, 377 workers from various sectors of industry in The Netherlands. We distinguished among three types of worktime demands: time spent on work according to one’s contract (contractual hours), {{the number of hours}} spent on overtime work (overtime hours), and the number of hours spent on commuting (commuting hours). Regarding worktime control, a distinction was made between having control over days off and vacations (leave control) and having control over starting and finishing times (flextime). These three worktime demands were expected to have separate as well as joint effects on WFI, whereas worktime control should buffer these adverse effects of worktime demands on WFI. Stepwise regression analyses showed that working high numbers of contractual and overtime hours was indeed associated with high WFI. Further, worktime control indeed made a difference in terms of WFI: whereas leave control contributed directly to lower WFI, flextime buffered the adverse effects of long contractual <b>workhours.</b> Our results suggest that very long working days should be prevented, and that worktime control may be a powerful tool to help workers maintaining a good work–family balance...|$|E
40|$|Pt. 1 : Human labor will be {{required}} at an extraterrestrial facility during its acquisition and operational periods for all functions {{which can not be}} automated. It appears to be realistic to consider the annual number of <b>workhours</b> as a variable. In this case quite a number of influencial factors, should be taken into consideration if precise results are desirable. Some factors can already be defined and introduced as additional relationships into the simulation model. Examples are: length of duty cycle, crew size, number of trainees, size of training and Earth support staff. Pt. 2 : Proposing new major space programs requires credible estimates of expected benefits and/or utility of the new program, including the inherent risks to be taken. Risk models have to be an integrated part of overall system models which have to include resource requirements. Several approaches of risk assesment and risk management respectively are presented and discussed under various aspects. Emphasis is placed on finding a generally accepted, fairly simple methodological approach to assess the relative risks of future mission concepts and architectures proposed. The approach selected must be practical, transparent, affordable and fit the available data base. (orig.)

40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed at}} {{opening up the}} black box of {{overtime}} work among university faculty members by providing information on (i) when faculty members work overtime, (ii) what activities are undertaken during overtime, and (iii) how overtime is experienced. Methods Data were collected among 120 Dutch faculty members who completed a general questionnaire (addressing general overtime hours, work characteristics, and well-being) and a 9 -day diary study (with information on daily overtime hours, activities, and experiences). Analyses of variance were {{used to analyze the}} data. Results Overtime was very prevalent among faculty members, high overtime workers being nonfatigued, engaged employees with positive work characteristics. Overtime was unevenly distributed over the week, being common on Sunday and Monday and uncommon on Friday and Saturday. Overtime activities during the weekend differed from those during the workweek, relatively much time being spent on research during weekend overtime. Overtime activities were experienced differently than activities during regular hours, overtime work being experienced as less effortful and less stressful than regular <b>workhours</b> and weekend overtime being less pleasurable than regular hours and evening overtime. Conclusions This detailed day-to-day mapping and evaluation of overtime work contributes {{to a better understanding of}} overtime work by demonstrating meaningful patterns of overtime over the (work) week and meaningful associations between overtime activities and time-contingent experiences. It is suggested that worktime control plays an important role in explaining the results...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} whether long <b>workhours</b> {{in combination with}} an extended workweek (12 hours/ 7 days), as requested by the workers, impaired attention and cognitive performance and whether the degree of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation {{was related to the}} response to the performance tasks. METHODS: A group of 41 male construction workers between 21 and 60 (mean 39) years of age who worked 84 hours a week, with alternate weeks off, was compared with a group of 23 male construction workers between 24 and 65 (mean 43) years of age who had a traditional 40 -hour work schedule. Neurobehavioral test performance, self-ratings of fatigue and sleepiness, and salivary cortisol levels were evaluated in a counterbalanced repeated-measures design. RESULTS: The 84 -hour group did not show any signs of reduced test performance or elevated fatigue and sleepiness. The 84 -hour group had faster reaction times on day 7 than on days 1 and 5. Although the expected activation of the HPA axis was only found in the total study sample when workdays 1 and 5 were collapsed, the HPA activation can be considered normal. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that an 84 -hour work regimen in response to requests from workers does not induce more performance deficits than an ordinary 40 -hour workweek. An extended work schedule of 84 hours cannot in the short-term be considered to affect basic mental capabilities negatively...|$|E
40|$|A survey {{instrument}} {{was developed to}} assess the anticipated impact of smoke-free university policy on faculty and staff and to recommend health education interventions based on stages of change theory and employee interest. Four months before the policy was implemented, the 25 -item anonymous questionnaire {{was sent to a}} random sample of 1, 000 faculty/staff. A majority of university workers (85. 5 %) are not smokers and approve of the no-smoking policy. Smokers (14. 5 %) are older than nonsmokers, {{are more likely to have}} a high school versus higher education, and are more likely to be maintenance or clerical workers. Most smokers smoke less than one packper day and smoke outdoors during <b>workhours.</b> More smokers were in later stages of change (planning to stop soon) than expected. Interest in availability of smoking cessation activities differed by smoking status and change stage. Tobacco smoking is the single most important preventable cause of death in our society. Although the prevalence of smoking has declined substantially for men, it has declined only slightly for women, and little for those without a high school diplomat Across the country, 25. 6 % of adults smoked in 1992, the same as in 1991 and 1990.

40|$|Objectives This study {{examined}} {{the degree to which}} long <b>workhours</b> in combination with an extended workweek (12 hours/ 7 days) with permanent day shifts (0700 - 1900), as requested by the workers, influenced biomarkers for stress, metabolic processes, and diurnal rhythm. Methods Construction workers (N= 50) working 84 hours a week, with alternate weeks off, were compared with construction workers (N= 25) having a traditional 40 -hour work schedule. The participants were all male and between the ages of 21 to 65 years. Blood samples were obtained in the morning immediately {{prior to the start of}} work on workday 1, 5, and 7 to assess cholesterol, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, melatonin, prolactin, testosterone, and uric acid. Psychosocial circumstances were assessed with a questionnaire. Results The 84 -hour group had higher melatonin concentrations and reported higher job-control scores than the 40 -hour group. For both groups, the melatonin, cortisol, and cholesterol concentrations were lower on workday 5 than on workday 1. In the 84 -hour group, most of the biomarkers were significantly lower in concentrations on workday 7 than on workday 1. Only testosterone showed a significant decrease between workdays 5 and 7. The concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone and uric acid remained stable across all of the days, as did the melatonin concentrations between workdays 5 and 7. Conclusions Working of one's own freewill on an 84 -hour regimen is not, in the short-term, necessarily more harmful for health than working on a 40 -hour regimen with a similar type of heavy worktasks. However, working on an 84 -hour schedule beyond the ordinary 40 -hour week results in signs of a functional shift in hormonal regulation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Female {{greenhouse}} workers, who {{constitute a}} major occupational group exposed to pesticides at childbearing age, were studied {{to measure the}} effects of pesticide exposure on time to pregnancy. METHODS: Data were collected through postal questionnaires with detailed questions on time to pregnancy, lifestyle factors (eg, smoking habits, coffee and alcohol consumption), and worktasks (eg, application of pesticides, re-entry activities, and <b>workhours)</b> of the respondents and their partners in a 6 -month period prior to conception {{of the most recent}} pregnancy. The relation between time to pregnancy and exposure to pesticides among 398 female greenhouse workers and 524 referents was studied in a Cox's proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The crude fecundability ratio for female greenhouse workers versus the reference group was 1. 18 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 03 - 1. 35], but correction for confounding changed the fecundability ratio to 1. 11 (95 % CI 0. 96 - 1. 29). An evaluation of specific biases for time-to-pregnancy studies showed that these results were biased by the reproductively unhealthy worker effect. Restricting the analyses to full-time workers or first pregnancies only resulted in an adjusted fecundability ratio of 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 67 - 1. 19) and 0. 90 (95 % CI 0. 62 - 1. 32), respectively. Among the primigravidous greenhouse workers, an association was observed between prolonged time to pregnancy and gathering flowers (fecundability ratio 0. 46, 95 % CI 0. 18 - 1. 19). CONCLUSIONS: This study may offer some evidence for the hypothesis of adverse effects of pesticide exposure on time to pregnancy, but {{more research is needed to}} elucidate these effects...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} impact of {{dyspepsia}} on productivity while at work and in regular daily activities in endoscoped (STARS I study) and in uninvestigated (STARS II study) dyspeptic patients. METHODS: Dyspeptic patients (with symptoms of pain or burning centered in the upper abdomen) were enrolled into 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational studies of similar design. During the week before start of treatment, patients rated dyspeptic symptoms daily using a 4 grade scale (0 =none to 3 =severe) and only those with a sum symptom score of 5 or more during the last 7 days of the runin period were included in the study. In STARS I, all patients underwent an endoscopy at baseline, and those with abnormal findings were excluded. Before start of treatment, patients completed the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) to assess symptom severity in three dimensions (heartburn, regurgitation, dyspepsia), and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire to assess disease-specific absence from work, reduced productivity while at work, and reduced productivity while carrying out regular daily activities. Both questionnaires use a recall period of 1 week. RESULTS: Productivity results were obtained from 568 and 452 patients (of which 372 and 344 were employed) in the STARS I and II studies, respectively. Overall, patients reported that dyspeptic symptoms had a substantial impact on productivity (Table). This impact was slightly more pronounced in the endoscoped than in the uninvestigated patients. However, because these were two different populations the reasons for this difference are unclear. Mean number of <b>workhours</b> lost per employed patient and week due to absence from work and reduced productivity while at work was 11. 1 hours (1. 9 + 9. 2) in endoscoped patients and 8. 7 hours (2. 0 + 6. 7) in uninvestigated patients. Results on reduced productivity were more strongly correlated with the RDQ dyspepsia dimension (r = 0. 2 to 0. 4) than with the other dimensions (r = 0. 1 to 0. 2), which lends support to the observed productivity loss mainly being related to non-GERD dyspepsia. CONCLUSION: Non-GERD dyspepsia has a substantial impact on productivity while at work and in regular daily activities in both endoscoped and uninvestigated patients. Productivity results, mean values and 95 % confidence intervals (CI...|$|E
