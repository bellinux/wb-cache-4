5|$|In {{common with}} all major {{warships}} of her day, Dreadnought was fitted with anti-torpedo nets, {{but these were}} removed early in the war, since they caused considerable loss of speed and <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> defeated by torpedoes fitted with net-cutters.|$|E
5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{attempts}} by the Mint to adjust the design, the coins proved to strike indistinctly, and {{to be subject to}} wear—the dates <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> worn away in circulation. In 1938, after the expiration of the minimum 25-year period during which the design could not be replaced without congressional authorization, it was replaced by the Jefferson nickel, designed by Felix Schlag. Fraser's design is admired today, and has been used on commemorative coins and the gold American Buffalo series.|$|E
5|$|Following Walker's death, alumni and {{students}} began {{to raise funds}} to construct a monument {{to him and his}} fifteen years as leader of the university. Although the funds <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> raised, plans were delayed for over two decades as MIT made plans to move to a new campus on the western bank of the Charles River in Cambridge. The new Beaux-Arts campus opened in 1916, and featured a neo-classical Walker Memorial building housing a gymnasium, students' club and lounge, and a commons room.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. The trigger for th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and dacite erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E

5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of Great Naktong Offensive were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. The Americans, who had been better equipped than the North Koreans, <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> able to defeat their opponents once they {{had the chance to}} form a continuous line, according to historian T. R. Fehrenbach. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{foundations}} {{are located in}} confined spots adjacent to I-66 and the electrified third rail of the Orange Line, making access difficult. Dulles Transit Partners offered to inspect seven foundations that <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> accessible, but the FTA insisted that all foundations be tested. Dulles Transit Partners and MWAA agreed to test all foundations before the bridge piers were built upon them. This required {{the portion of the}} Orange Line between the West Falls Church and East Falls Church Metro stations to be taken out of service on weekends while the tests were conducted. The foundations were acceptable and the bridge construction proceeded using the existing foundations.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Tornado was {{the clear}} favorite. Georgia Tech outplayed Vanderbilt {{and had the}} ball for three-fourths of the game. Several of Vanderbilt's players left with injuries. Its ends <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> skirted by the Tech backs Buck Flowers, Red Barron, and Frank Ferst. Tech's first {{touchdown}} came when Barron ripped off a 55-yard run. Captain Flowers once made a drop kick from 44 yards out. Ferst came in for Flowers {{in the middle of}} the second quarter when Georgia Tech started to use substitutes.|$|E

5|$|The Helgoland {{class was}} {{the second type of}} German dreadnoughts, built during 1908–1912. The class was {{composed}} of four ships: Helgoland, Oldenburg, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen. The ships incorporated significant improvements over the previous Nassau type, including more powerful main guns and an improved propulsion system. The Helgolands <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> distinguished from the preceding Nassaus by the three funnels that were closely arranged, compared to the two larger funnels of the previous class. The ships retained the unusual hexagonal main battery layout of the Nassau class.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Engineers Signal Service, {{formed in}} 1912, was given {{responsibility}} for communications that included signal dispatch, telegraph, telephone and later wireless communications, from army headquarters to brigade {{and down to}} battery level for the artillery. For most of the war, the Army's primary methods of communication were signal dispatch (employing runners, messengers on horseback, dogs, and carrier pigeons), visual signalling, telegraph, and telephone. At {{the start of the}} war, the Army had a small number of wireless sets, which in addition to being heavy and unreliable, operated on longwave. In 1915, trench wireless sets were introduced, but the transmissions <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> intercepted by the listening Germans.|$|E
5|$|The four {{civilians were}} tried on December 13. The {{principal}} prosecution witness, a servant {{of one of}} the accused, made claims that <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> rebutted by defense witnesses. In the face of this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.|$|E

5|$|The {{spread of}} disease was {{significantly}} more rampant {{in areas of}} poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than {{the children of the}} wealthy.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected by the addition of dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E
5|$|United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell {{determined}} that Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in the Mariana Islands would better serve as B-29 bases, {{but they were}} in Japanese hands. Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war, and the islands were captured between June and August 1944. Air bases were developed, and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944. These bases <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> resupplied by cargo ships. The XXI Bomber Command began missions against Japan on November 18, 1944.|$|E

5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on {{the morning}} of 25 November, the Portuguese {{garrison}} at Ngomano received word from a British intelligence officer that an attack was about to commence. Nevertheless, when the attack came they were unprepared. In order to distract Pinto and his men, the Germans shelled the camp from across the river with high explosive rounds. While the artillery attacked the camp, the Germans moved their forces upstream and crossed the Rovuma safely out sight of Pinto and his men. The Portuguese did not resist von Lettow-Vorbeck's forces when they crossed the river and remained encamped at Ngomano. The Germans <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> able to flank the Portuguese positions and completely envelop them with six companies of German infantry attacking the camp from the south, south-east and west.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were then}} made to {{establish}} batteries {{to the west}} and north of the city, but these efforts were hampered by heavy rain, delaying the construction of defensive earthworks which allowed the garrison to maintain a constant fire on the work parties, which suffered consequent casualties. Fire was especially heavy against the siege lines {{to the north of the}} city, which <b>were</b> <b>easily</b> targeted by the French gunners on 12 August. Operations to establish batteries on this front continued for several days even as losses mounted; on 15 August, Lieutenant Colonel George Maule, Braithwaite's chief engineer, was killed by cannon fire while returning from a night inspection of the trenches. On the night of 21 August the main battery, known as the Royal Battery, came under heavy shellfire and was damaged, but repairs were successful and on the morning of 22 August its 24-pounder long guns opened return fire on the city.|$|E
