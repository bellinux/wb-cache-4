500|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts late in February 1604 Thomas's cousin, Robert Catesby, {{invited him to}} his house in Lambeth, but Thomas was indisposed and could not attend. [...] Catesby sent a second letter that Thomas did respond to, and when he arrived he found his cousin with John Wright, a devout Catholic and a renowned swordsman. [...] Catesby planned to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament, killing the king. Thomas did not immediately recoil from the idea. [...] As a former soldier he was a practical man, and he agreed with Catesby that should the plot succeed, it would [...] "breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations". He also offered a warning {{of the price of}} failure: [...] "the scandal would be so great which the Catholic religion might hereby sustain, as not only our enemies, but our friends also would with good reason condemn us." [...] He nevertheless agreed to join the conspiracy, and as Catesby had not entirely given up hope of foreign support—"because <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> no peaceable and quiet way untried"—Thomas returned to the continent.|$|E
