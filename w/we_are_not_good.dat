Over the last fifteen years we have built behavior-based artificial creatures situated in the world like insects [2] and recently we have built robots with which we can have human-like social interaction [1]. But we never quite forget that these systems are machines and not alive. We build these models to better understand the biological systems, but the models never work as well as biology. On the other hand scientists have gotten very good at modeling fluids, materials, planetary dynamics, nuclear explosions, and all manner of physical systems. We can put some parameters into a program, let it crank, and get accurate predictions of the physical character of the modeled system. But, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> at modeling living systems, neither in the small, nor in the large. Motivation: Perhaps we are missing something fundamental and currently unimagined in each of our various models of behavior, perception, cognition, evolution, natural selection, morphogenesis, etc. If this turns out to be true then we will need to have some new ways of thinking about the issues of living systems if we are to make progress.

Scott (1998) quotes General Howell M.

This is an extreme dilemma, because combat systems, without timely, relevant information, are useless. On the other hand, you can’t take out an enemy tank with just information. We need {{to strike a balance between}} ‘shooters ’ and ‘information systems ’ if we’re going to be successful in the future. But we aren’t even sure how information should be measured — is it measured in bits, or what? The word “crisis ” is not too strong for our approaching predicament. Our leaders have recognized and articulated the importance of information. JV 2010 defines Information Superiority to be “The capability to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while exploiting or denying an adversary’s ability to do the same”, and subordinates other dimensions of warfare. The Revolution in Military Affairs is mainly a revolution about information. It has been stated by many authors that the Allied advantage in Desert Storm was most strikingly an information advantage, rather than one of firepower. It is not as if we haven’t been warned about the growing importance of information, and yet we do not seem to have the evaluation tools that we need. Why is the problem so difficult?

40|$|While {{variations}} in medical practice are a norm and each patient poses {{a multitude of}} challenges, many clinicians are not comfortable in dealing with unexpected complex issues {{even though they may}} have enough knowledge as demonstrated by passing a number of tricky certifying (or exit) examinations. One reason for the lack of self-efficacy, even if being endowed with good knowledge, is that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> in learning from errors. A regular reflective practice offers superb learning opportunities when a clinician is “stuck in a mire”. Difficult clinical situations warrant a flexible and, at the same time, an evidence-based approach to ensure that crucial decision-making process is correct and efficient. Each clinical case offers a great opportunity to reinforce these “threshold concepts”, however, not everyone of us is “blessed” with these crucial not-so-difficult-to-acquire skills so necessary to be a life-long learner. The faculty of this course (a totally on-line MSc in Transplant Sciences) aims for unceasing engagement with students in order to facilitate them to negotiate through “stuck places” and “tricky bends” in their own work place. This course, not just meant for knowledge transfer, provides a platform that allows participants (the students and faculty) to learn from each other’s experience by using “e-blackboard”. The mainstay of this course are twofold: (a) Emphasis on achieving critical decision-making skills, (b) Regular feedback to allow reflective practice and, thereby, constantly learning from errors and reinforcing good practices. The aim {{of this article is to}} assess the performance of educators and how well the “ethos of critical threshold” has been accepted from the perspective of students. Methods: The critical thresholds of each chapter in 4 modules of this totally on-line course were defined to a razor-sharp precision. Learning objectives of learning activity were defined to achieve constructive alignment with critical threshold. We employed level 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Kirkpatrick pyramid, (a) for the evaluation of performance of educators of program, and (b) to evaluate the acceptance of this non-traditional format in clinical medicine education by postgraduate 80 students in 22 countries. Results: Students’ survey (Kirkpatrick level 1) was done only for module 1 of cohort 1 reported students’ satisfaction rate of 93 %. Excluding a total of 12 drop-outs in 2 modules (n= 10 in first cohort’s module 1, and n= 2 in module 2), as many as 93 % of students of first cohort passed module. Nine out of 60 registrants of module 1 in 2 nd cohort took recess for one year requesting to join back as a part of 3 rd cohort commencing one year later, all 51 who continued passed though 3 of them had to resit. All those who passed module 1 (both cohorts) and 2 (1 st cohort) registered for their respective next module (return on investment Kirkpatrick level 5). Conclusion: For a successful model in distance learning in clinical transplantation it is imperative for the students to accomplish well defined “critical-decision making” skills. In order to learn critical thresholds, a regular feedback is integral to learning from reflective practice. This course equips the students to develop skills of negotiating “sticky mire”, as obvious from perceived high return of investment...|$|E
40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world where}} data {{surround}} us in every aspect of our lives. The key challenge for humans and machines is how we can make better use of such data. Imagine what would happen if you were to have intelligent machines that could give you insight into the data. Insight that will enable you to better 1) reason about, 2) learn, and 3) understand the underlying phenomena that produced the data. The possibilities of combined human-machine intelligence are endless and will impact our lives in ways we can not even imagine today. Synergistic human-machine intelligence aims to facilitate the analytical reasoning and inference process of humans by creating machines that maximize a human's ability to 1) reason about, 2) learn, and 3) understand large, complex, and heterogeneous data. Combined human-machine intelligence is a powerful symbiosis of mutual benefit, in which we depend on the computational capabilities of the machine for the tasks <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> at, and the machine requires human intervention for the tasks it performs poorly on. This relationship provides a compelling alternative to either approach in isolation for solving today's and tomorrow's arising data challenges. In his regard, this dissertation proposes a diverse analytical framework that leverages synergistic human-machine intelligence to maximize a human's ability to better 1) reason about, 2) learn, and 3) understand different biomedical imaging and healthcare data present in the patient's electronic health record (EHR). Correspondingly, we approach the data analyses problem from the 1) visualization, 2) labeling, and 3) mining perspective and demonstrate the efficacy of our analytics on specific application scenarios and various data domains. In the first part of this dissertation we explore the question how we can build intelligent imaging analytics that are commensurate with human capabilities and constraints, specifically for optimizing data visualization and automated labeling workflows. Our journey starts with heuristic rule-based analytical models that are derived from task-specific human knowledge. From this experience, we move on to data-driven analytics, where we adapt and combine the intelligence of the model based on prior information provided by the human and synthetic knowledge learned from partial data observations. Within this realm, we propose a novel Bayesian transductive Markov random field model that requires minimal human intervention and is able to cope with scarce label information to learn and infer object shapes in complex spatial, multimodal, spatio-temporal, and longitudinal data. We then study the question how machines can learn discriminative object representations from dense human provided label information by investigating learning and inference mechanisms that make use of deep learning architectures. The developed analytics can aid visualization and labeling tasks, which enables the interpretation and quantification of clinically relevant image information. The second part explores the question how we can build data-driven analytics for exploratory analysis in longitudinal event data that are commensurate with human capabilities and constraints. We propose human-intuitive analytics that enable the representation and discovery of interpretable event patterns to ease knowledge absorption and comprehension of the employed analytics model and the underlying data. We propose a novel doubly-constrained convolutional sparse-coding framework that learns interpretable and shift-invariant latent temporal event patterns. We apply the model to mine complex event data in EHRs. By mapping the event space to heterogeneous patient encounters in the EHR we explore the linkage between healthcare resource utilization (HRU) in relation to disease severity. This linkage may help to better understand how disease specific co-morbidities and their clinical attributes incur different HRU patterns. Such insight helps to characterize the patient's care history, which then enables the comparison against clinical practice guidelines, the discovery of prevailing practices based on common HRU group patterns, and the identification of outliers that might indicate poor patient management...|$|E

Fulfilling [...] "all righteousness" [...] or being restored to our original righteousness became the hallmark of the Wesleyan tradition.|$|R
6000|$|However, it is {{the tall}} one, {{the one of the}} private lessons, that is the most remarkable. These private lessons, my good Prosper, are the most {{brilliant}} invention of the age, and a real stroke of genius on the part of Miss Miranda! They also take place in the petit salon, but with the doors tightly closed, and with explicit directions to every one in the house that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> disturbed. And <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> my <b>good</b> Prosper; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not!</b> Not a sound, not a shadow, interrupts our felicity. My cousine is really admirable; the shop deserves to succeed. Miss Miranda is tall and rather flat; she is too pale; she hasn't the adorable rougeurs of the little Anglaise. But she has bright, keen, inquisitive eyes, superb teeth, a nose modelled by a sculptor, and a way of holding up her head and looking every one in the face, which is the most finished piece of impertinence I ever beheld. She is making the tour du monde entirely alone, without even a soubrette to carry the ensign, for the purpose of seeing for herself a quoi s'en tenir sur les hommes et les choses--on les hommes particularly. Dis donc, Prosper, it must be a drole de pays over there, where young persons animated by this ardent curiosity <b>are</b> manufactured! If <b>we</b> should turn the tables, some day, thou and I, and go over and see it for ourselves. It is as well that we should go and find them chez elles, as that they should come out here after us. Dis donc, mon gras Prosper [...] .|$|R

Head teacher Michael Firth called the report [...] "flawed" [...] and appealed against its findings, saying, [...] "86% of the lessons were graded as being good or outstanding. But now we have heard that teaching requires improvement". In March 2014, the school’s complaint was upheld and the Ofsted inspection was ruled to have been [...] "mismanaged and mal-administered". The head teacher said, [...] "It’s a brave school that takes on Ofsted, some people said we should just leave it but {{we have got to}} have confidence in the system. It’s great news for the town, all students from 13-18 require a good school in Royston and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> it. If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> doing a <b>good</b> job the town suffers. We do think there is an issue with spelling, punctuation and grammar but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> having a jolly good go at improving it." ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: As {{considered}} {{in the rest of}} this volume, the effects of the IDEFICS intervention on obesity rates <b>were</b> <b>not</b> encouraging. This paper considers how far findings from the IDEFICS study and similar intervention studies are relevant to the policy process and political decision-making. Methods: The paper offers theoretical and policy-level arguments concerning the evaluation of evidence and its implications for policymaking. The paper is divided into three parts. The first considers problems in the nature and applicability of evidence gained from school- and community-level obesity interventions. The second part considers whether such interventions present a model that policy-makers could implement. The third part considers how we should think about policy measures given the limited evidence we can obtain and the many different goals that public policy must take account of. Results: The paper argues that (1) there are clear reasons why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> obtaining <b>good</b> evidence for effective school- and community-level interventions; (2) public policy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in a <b>good</b> position to mandate larger-scale, long-term versions of these interventions; and (3) there are serious problems in obtaining ‘evidence’ for most public policy options, but this should not deter us from pursuing options that tackle systemic problems and have a good likelihood of delivering benefits on several dimensions. Conclusions: Research on school- and community-level obesity interventions has not produced much evidence that is directly relevant to policymaking. Instead, it shows {{how difficult it is to}} affect obesity rates without changing wider social and economic factors. Public policy should focus on these...|$|R
