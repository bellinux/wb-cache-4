5|$|On the Wednesday at 1:00, Galatasaray fans {{attacked}} {{a bar in}} Strøget in Copenhagen, where some Arsenal fans were located. The Arsenal fans left the bar to confront the Galatasaray fans, {{which led to a}} fight lasting for an hour before riot police managed to control it and arrested four Britons and four Turks. In the fight, Paul Dineen, an Arsenal fan, was stabbed, leading to Arsenal offering fans refunds if they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to the game. Dineen was released from hospital later in the day and attended the match as a guest of the Arsenal directors.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the {{training}} for Apollo 11 that Collins told Deke Slayton {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> again.

25|$|For {{the third}} group of astronauts, {{training}} began with a 240-hour course of the basics of spaceflight.

At the end, Alan Shepard, who {{was head of the}} astronaut office, asked the fourteen to rank their fellow astronauts in the order they would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> with them in space. Collins picked David Scott in the number one position.|$|E

25|$|This led {{naturally}} {{to the second}} issue, involving the sortie rate of the aircraft. In the initial calculations they had assumed similar sortie rates as commercial aircraft like the Boeing 747, flying long multi-hour flights from the oil fields in Alaska to California. However, the sortie rates of commercial aircraft are based on customer preferences on what times they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly,</b> not the actual ability of the aircraft. Assuming much shorter routes and 24-hour operation, sortie rates {{on the order of}} 18 to 20 flights a day seemed possible. This greatly reduced the number of aircraft that were needed to provide any particular level of service.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for virtual {{airlines}} to provide a list of flights that can be completed by members. Each flight is considered a route {{as part of the}} virtual airline's scheduled flights. This functions in much the same was as a real airline functions, whereby they publish a list of the flights that customers can book flights on. In some virtual airlines the members can fly whichever flights they want, others the management has to assign them those flights, and in others it is possible to bid for routes they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly.</b> International flights are, by virtue of the distance traveled, much longer than domestic routes and typically only available to senior members.|$|E
25|$|President Eisenhower did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> American U-2 pilots {{over the}} Soviet Union {{because he felt}} that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or {{captured}} {{that it could be}} seen as an act of aggression. At a time like the Cold War, any act of aggression could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the Royal Air Force fly these missions in place of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). With the United Kingdom still reeling from the aftermath of the Suez Crisis and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower {{to be able to use}} the U-2 plane to see what the Soviet Union was hiding, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.|$|E

25|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{study of}} sleep in small invertebrates is complicated. Insects go through circadian rhythms of activity and passivity but some {{do not seem}} to have a homeostatic sleep need. Insects {{do not seem to}} exhibit REM sleep. However, fruit flies appear to sleep, and systematic disturbance of that state leads to cognitive disabilities. There are several methods of measuring cognitive functions in fruit flies. A common method is to let the flies choose whether they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> through a tunnel that leads to a light source, or through a dark tunnel. Normally, flies are attracted to light. But if sugar is placed in the end of the dark tunnel, and something the flies dislike is placed in the end of the light tunnel, the flies will eventually learn to fly towards darkness rather than light. Flies deprived of sleep require a longer time to learn this and also forget it more quickly. If an arthropod is experimentally kept awake longer than it is used to, then its coming rest period will be prolonged. In cockroaches that rest period is characterized by the antennae being folded down and by a decreased sensitivity to external stimuli. Sleep has been described in crayfish, too, characterized by passivity and increased thresholds for sensory stimuli as well as changes in the EEG pattern, markedly differing from the patterns found in crayfish when they are awake.|$|E
500|$|In September 2002, Radiohead {{moved to}} the Ocean Way Recording studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles, with {{producer}} Nigel Godrich and artist Stanley Donwood, who have both worked with the band since their second album, The Bends (1995). The location was suggested by Godrich, who had used the studio to produce records by Travis and Beck and {{thought it would be}} a [...] "good change of scenery" [...] for Radiohead. Yorke said: [...] "We were like, 'Do we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> halfway around the world to do this?' But it was terrific, because we worked really hard. We did a track a day. It was sort of like holiday camp." ...|$|E
500|$|During filming, Cameron {{made use}} of his virtual camera system, {{a new way of}} {{directing}} motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, [...] "It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale." [...] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because {{there is no need for}} repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a [...] "form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements".|$|E
50|$|There was one {{usage of}} a single-ply code wheel, where only two {{challenge}} symbols were used; in the Amiga game Rocket Ranger, the player turned {{the wheel to}} match their Ranger's current location, then read a value from the hole corresponding to the location where they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>to.</b> The holes were in a simple column. Since {{this was the only}} mechanism for the player to specify where they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly,</b> it was impossible for crackers to remove it from the game without destroying the entire gameplay.|$|R

2500|$|In Long Beach, on December 28, 1920, Earhart and {{her father}} visited an {{airfield}} where Frank Hawks (who later gained fame as an air racer) gave her a ride that would forever change Earhart's life. [...] "By the time I had got two or three hundred feet [...] off the ground," [...] she said, [...] "I knew I had to fly." [...] After that 10-minute flight (which cost her father $10), she immediately determined to learn to fly. Working {{at a variety of}} jobs including photographer, truck driver, and stenographer at the local telephone company, she managed to save $1,000 for flying lessons. Earhart had her first lesson on January 3, 1921, at Kinner Field near Long Beach. Her teacher was Anita [...] "Neta" [...] Snook, a pioneer female aviator who used a surplus Curtiss JN-4 [...] "Canuck" [...] for training. Earhart arrived with her father and a singular request: [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly.</b> Will you teach me?" [...] In order to reach the airfield, Earhart had to take a bus {{to the end of the}} line, then walk four miles (6km). Earhart's mother also provided part of the $1,000 [...] "stake" [...] against her [...] "better judgement".|$|E

2500|$|On June 12, 1942, Bong flew {{very low}} ("buzzed") over {{a house in}} nearby San Anselmo, {{the home of a}} pilot who had just been married. He was cited and {{temporarily}} grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day. For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman's clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, [...] "If you didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> down Market Street, I wouldn't have you in my Air Force, but you are not to do it any more and I mean what I say." [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "We needed kids like this lad." [...] In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge. Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the Southwest Pacific Area.|$|E
