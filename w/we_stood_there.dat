2500|$|... 1935: Film {{director}} King Vidor {{was born}} in Galveston and survived the great Galveston Hurricane of 1900. [...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away. [...] I felt as if the sea was going to break {{over the edge of the}} bowl and come puring down upon us.|$|E
2500|$|A Brulé Sioux warrior stated: [...] "In fact, Hollow Horn Bear {{believed}} that the troops were in good order {{at the start of}} the fight, and kept their organization even while moving from point to point." [...] Red Horse, an Oglala Sioux warrior, commented: [...] "Here [...] the soldiers made a desperate fight." [...] One Hunkpapa Sioux warrior, Moving Robe, noted that [...] "It was a hotly contested battle", while another, Iron Hawk, stated: [...] "The Indians pressed and crowded right in around Custer Hill. But the soldiers weren't ready to die. <b>We</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> a long time." [...] In a letter from February 21, 1910, Private William Taylor, Company M, 7th Cavalry, wrote: [...] "Reno proved incompetent and Benteen showed his indifference – I will not use the uglier words that have often been in my mind. Both failed Custer and he had to fight it out alone." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> looking, as the {{afternoon}} light flooded the plain. Suddenly the silence was broken.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there,</b> and my dream of Utopia runs off me like water from an oiled slab. Of course--we lunched at our club. We {{came back from}} Switzerland by no dream train but by the {{ordinary}} Bale express. We have been talking of that Lucerne woman he harps upon, and I have made some novel comment on his story. I have touched certain possibilities.|$|R
6000|$|So mindless {{were those}} outpourings! - [...] Though I am not aware That I have gained by subtle thought on things [...] Since <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> psalming <b>there.</b>|$|R
60|$|This is {{all that}} you have to learn in the room below; but as <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> hear a {{trampling}} of feet in the apartment above,--the quick yet careful opening and shutting of doors,--and voices come and go about the house, and whisper consultations on the stairs. Now comes the roll of wheels, and the Doctor's gig drives up to the door; and, as he goes creaking up with his heavy boots, we will follow and gain admission to the dimly-lighted chamber.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{in silence}} for several long minutes. Then {{she turned to me}} with a little sigh.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} the kerb, {{and for a second}} or so <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> without speaking. Then I beckoned to a hansom.|$|E
6000|$|... "I patted 'im on the {{shoulder}} arter we 'ad shook 'ands, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> smiling {{at each other and}} paying each other compliments.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> here <b>stood,</b> <b>there</b> {{passed a}} hungry figure, in ragged raiment: hollow cheeks, and hollow eyes. Wistfully he eyed the offerings; but retreated; {{knowing it was}} sacrilege to touch them. There, they must decay, {{in honor of the}} god Ananna; for so this dead tree was {{denominated}} by Mohi.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> horrified, <b>there</b> over the corpse of Foulata. All the manhood seemed to {{have gone out of}} us. The first shock of this idea of the slow and miserable end that awaited us was overpowering. We saw it all now; that fiend Gagool had planned this snare for us from the first.|$|R
5000|$|..... they didn't {{give the}} poor people who were killed any dignity...I bent down to kiss and talk to son and as <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> up <b>there</b> was a {{policeman}} who came from behind me... trying to usher me and my husband out.... I had to scream at the police officer to allow us privacy... the total attitude was, you've identified number 33 so go!" ...|$|R
60|$|I knocked briskly on the iron-studded gates. <b>We</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> waiting, Cavalcanti and Falcone afoot with me, the men {{on horseback}} still, a silent phalanx.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{we heard}} the sound of voices. They were coming from the forest through which we had passed when we had come from camp.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> {{momentarily}} forgetful of {{all else}} than our new found happiness, {{the ferocity of}} the bombardment increased until scarce thirty seconds elapsed between the shells that rained about the palace.|$|E
60|$|We {{were too}} astounded to speak. <b>We</b> could only <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> staring in amazement. A great broken bough upon the grass showed whence he had gained his {{leverage}} to tilt over our bridge. The face had vanished, but presently {{it was up}} again, more frantic than before.|$|R
60|$|I {{took her}} {{for a walk in}} the wood, to that very point indeed on the lip of the crater whence we had watched her play her part as priestess at the Feast of the First-fruits. After <b>we</b> had <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> a while <b>we</b> went down among the great cedars, trying to retrace the last part of our march through the {{darkness}} of that anxious night, whereof {{now for the first time}} I told her all the story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Plimmer {{came down}} to the ship the very next evening. Fine-looking woman she was, and, wot with 'er watch and chain and di'mond rings and {{brooches}} and such-like, I should think she must 'ave 'ad five or six pounds' worth of jewell'ry on 'er. She gave me a very pleasant smile, and I gave 'er one back, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> chatting <b>there</b> like old friends till at last she tore 'erself away and went on board the ship.|$|R
60|$|One by one {{the boys}} and girls crept out, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> gazing, open-mouthed, till those two entered the village and were hid from sight. It was then that we named her the Brave.|$|E
6000|$|... "As <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> {{just before}} I left him, for {{he said he}} wanted to be alone with his dead for a time, we heard a snarly sort of voice near the bushes by the shore calling out: ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> for a moment, spellbound by {{the sight}} of those fearsome creatures occupying the very thrones of the sovereigns of England, the low growl was repeated, and a great male rose slowly to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|That settles the matter. The pebbles {{could not}} come from Wales; there are no flints there. They {{could not have been}} made before the chalk; for out of the chalk they came; and the only {{explanation}} which is left to us, I believe, is, that over the tops of the chalk downs; over our heads where <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> now, <b>there</b> once stretched layers of sand and gravel, [...] "Tertiary strata" [...] as I have been calling them to you; and among them layers of this same hard sandstone.|$|R
5000|$|Carradine's parents {{divorced}} {{when he was}} 2 years old. A bitter custody battle led to his father gaining custody {{of him and his}} brothers, Christopher and Keith. During the custody battle, the children had spent three months in a home for abused children as wards of the court. His brother, Keith, said of the experience, [...] "It was like being in jail. There were bars on the windows, and we were only allowed to see our parents through glass doors. It was very sad. <b>We</b> would <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> {{on either side of the}} glass door crying".|$|R
6000|$|It was depressingly still, and miserably cold. Now {{this whole}} thing was a {{practical}} joke, and the robbers were personal friends of ours in disguise, and twenty more lay hidden within ten feet of us during the whole operation, listening. Mike knew all this, and was in the joke, but I suspected nothing of it. To me it was most uncomfortably genuine. When <b>we</b> had <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{in the middle of the}} road five minutes, like a couple of idiots, with our hands aloft, freezing to death by inches, Mike's interest in the joke began to wane. He said: ...|$|R
60|$|Very quietly I {{thrust the}} door open, and <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> upon the threshold--Cavalcanti and I--father and lover of that sweet maid {{who was the}} prey of this foul Duke. We stood whilst a man might count a dozen, silent {{witnesses}} of that loathsome scene.|$|E
60|$|Unvanquished philosopher! As <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{looking at}} the flying {{landscape}} and sinking lesser hills, {{one by one the}} great snow peaks slowly arose behind them, lifting themselves, as if to take a last wondering look at the man they had triumphed over, but had not subdued.|$|E
60|$|Little {{was said}} by us lads as <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> beneath {{the shelter of}} the lean-to. Each {{realized}} that in a short time he might be a prisoner, and all knew, or believed they knew, that there was much trouble in store for us through Seth Jepson.|$|E
30|$|<b>We</b> had to <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> {{and stare}} at this man, hardly more than a boy, buried alive under a hill of rubble, with death barely an inch from his chest, and {{miraculously}} still alive. All we could do was marvel; all of us, we marveled, for {{there was not a}} man amongst us who had seen a thing like that before (Ghosh 2005 a, 241).|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a long}} square, {{the shape}} of a grave; the rain had made it sink down and show the shape. The minute <b>we</b> come and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> looked at one another and never said a word. When the dog had dug down only a few inches he grabbed {{something}} and pulled it up, and it was an arm and a sleeve. Tom kind of gasped out, and says: ...|$|R
60|$|We were {{admitted}} by the maid, who came {{running down the}} hall stairway, with a preoccupied air, to the open door where <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> waiting. <b>There</b> were two great syringa-bushes on each hand close to the portal, which were in full flower, and which flung their sweetness through the doorway and the windows; but when we found ourselves in the dim old-fashioned parlor, we were aware of this odor meeting and mixing with another which descended from the floor above--the smell of some medicated pastille. There was a sound of anxious steps overhead, and a hurried closing of doors, with the mechanical sound of labored breathing.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> {{helpless}} to part. He {{did not offer}} to leave me, and I could not find it in my heart to abandon him. After a most painful time, he drew another long breath, and asked, [...] "Would {{you be willing to}} let me take the chances?" ...|$|E
60|$|But I had not a shot left, nor did {{either of}} us have a clasp knife. <b>We</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> while the doe gasped and quivered. The {{peculiar}} sound, probably made by the intake of air through the laceration of the throat, {{on the spur of the}} moment seemed pitifully human.|$|E
60|$|Whether Archie {{had been}} aware that <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{ready to make}} this supreme effort, I cannot say; but {{something}} must have warned him that the time for action had come, because the crash of thunder had not died away when I could see dimly his head and shoulders through the aperture.|$|E
60|$|We {{remained}} silent and motionless, not daring {{to gaze at}} each other, much like a band of mourners who have gathered around the lifeless body of a dear friend, and so <b>we</b> would have <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> until all the courage oozed out from our hearts, {{had it not been}} for dear little Frenchie, himself quite as brave a man and as good a patriot as the one who had just left us.|$|R
60|$|The Story Girl {{ran over}} to the buggy and climbed in. Uncle Blair {{followed}} her. Her arms were full of Mrs. Dale's chrysanthemums, held close up to her face, and her beautiful eyes shone softly at us over them. No good-byes were said, as she wished. We all smiled bravely and waved our hands as they drove out of the lane and down the moist red road into {{the shadows of the}} fir wood in the valley. But <b>we</b> still <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> for <b>we</b> knew we should see the Story Girl once more. Beyond the fir wood was an open curve in the road and she had promised to wave a last farewell as they passed around it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were most}} of us wounded by that time, more or less, but kept blazing away as long as <b>we</b> could <b>stand.</b> Then <b>there</b> came cheers of triumph {{mingling}} with the shouts and cries of battle. The ships of the enemy were beginning to strike. One after another the flags went down. Before long the cry was, `Five have struck!' then `Ten, hurrah!' then fifteen, then twenty, hurrah!" ...|$|R
