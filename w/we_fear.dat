5|$|The team {{nickname}} is The Lions, previously The Dockers. The original Dockers name {{arose from}} the job {{of many of the}} club's supporters in the early 1900s. The club did not like the moniker and changed the nickname after press headlined Millwall as 'Lions of the South', after knocking Football League leaders Aston Villa out of the 1899–1900 FA Cup. Millwall, then a Southern League side, went on to reach the semi-final. The club adopted the motto: <b>We</b> <b>Fear</b> No Foe Where E'er We Go. In the 2000s the club started to recognise its unique link with London's docks by introducing Dockers' Days, and archiving the club's dock roots in the Millwall FC Museum. Dockers' Days bring together past successful Millwall teams who parade on the pitch at half-time. Supporters who were dockers are allowed to attend the game for free. In 2011, Millwall officially named the east stand of The Den as the 'Dockers Stand' in honour of the club's former nickname.|$|E
25|$|The second {{so-called}} sura, entitled al-Hafd (haste) {{translates as}} follows: 'O Allah, we worship You and to You we pray and prostrate and to You we run and hasten to serve You. We hope for Your mercy and <b>we</b> <b>fear</b> Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers.' Obviously these two pieces constitute so-called 'qunut', i.e. supplications which Muhammad sometimes {{said in the}} morning prayer or witr prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran. They are in fact identical to some parts of qunut reported in the collections of hadith. See: Nawawi, al-adhkar, Cairo, 1955, pp.57–8.|$|E
500|$|Irwin, {{after his}} death, was {{described}} by Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland, as a [...] "modern-day Noah." [...] British naturalist David Bellamy lauded his skills as a natural historian and media performer. Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki paid tribute to Irwin, noting that [...] "umanity will not protect that which <b>we</b> <b>fear</b> or do not understand. Steve Irwin helped us understand those things that many people thought were a nuisance at best, a horror at worst. That made him a great educator and conservationist." ...|$|E
60|$|By this time, I confess, I {{felt almost}} like a criminal. Never in my life had danger loomed so near--not even when we {{returned}} with the Arabs from the oasis. For then <b>we</b> <b>feared</b> for our lives alone; now, <b>we</b> <b>feared</b> for our honour.|$|R

500|$|The Huns {{and their}} successors greatly {{impressed}} their neighbours with their archery. Germanic tribes transmitted their respect orally for a millennium; in the Scandinavian Hervarar saga, the Geatish king Gizur taunts the Huns and says, [...] "Eigi gera Húnar oss felmtraða né hornbogar yðrir." [...] (<b>We</b> <b>fear</b> neither the Huns nor their hornbows.) The Romans, {{as described in}} the Strategikon, Procopius's histories, and other works, changed the entire emphasis of their army, from heavy infantry to cavalry, many of them armed with bows. Maurikios's Strategikon describes the Byzantine cavalry as bow-armed cursores and lance-armed defensores.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} state support for many industries, {{this did not}} extend to shipping. In 1933 de Valera's {{government}} established the Turf Development Board, turf became Ireland's primary source of fuel during the emergency years and was stockpiled as imported coal was in short supply. In 1935 civil servants in deValera's own department warned him of the consequences a war {{would have on the}} importation of fuel. He ignored that warning. Earlier, in 1926 the Ports and Harbours Tribunal was initiated. The tribunal received [...] "abundant evidence" [...] of [...] "inefficient, uneconomic and extravagant management". It submitted a report in 1930 with recommendations which were not implemented until after the war. The tribunal observed [...] "the public generally do not, <b>we</b> <b>fear,</b> appreciate the importance of our harbours ...". Vickers-Armstrongs liquidated their subsidiary Vickers (Ireland) Ltd. on 15 November 1938; their Dublin Dockyard had ceased operation in 1937.|$|E
500|$|However, not all {{critics were}} as {{enthusiastic}} about the film; Graham Greene of the British Spectator called it a [...] "huge inflated gas-blown object" [...] and criticized its length, comparing it to the feat of a flagpole sitter. A number of critics, although praising the film in general, felt that Myrna Loy, who appears rather late on in the film, gave a lackluster performance as Billie Burke. Nugent said that [...] "Miss Loy is a stately Bille Burke, and somewhat lacking, <b>we</b> <b>fear,</b> in Miss Burke's effervescence and gaiety", and Cecilia Agner thought she came across as [...] "stilted, like her rigidly waxed and set blonde wig". Harrison Carroll of the Los Angeles Herald-Express, however, sympathized with the difficulty of her role in portraying a prominent living actress, confessing that he was pleased that Loy {{did not attempt to}} imitate Burke's mannerisms. Emily W. Leider believes that any of her character flaws were due to a [...] "mushy" [...] script, rather than her performance as an actress.|$|E

500|$|George Gilfillan, in an 1845 {{essay on}} Keats, placed the poem among [...] "The finest of Keats' smaller pieces" [...] and {{suggested}} that [...] "In originality, Keats has seldom been surpassed. His works 'rise like an exhalation.' His language has been formed on a false system; but, ere he died, was clarifying itself from its more glaring faults, and becoming copious clear, and select. He {{seems to have been}} averse to all speculative thought, and his only creed, <b>we</b> <b>fear,</b> was expressed in the words— Beauty is truth,—truth beauty". The 1857 Encyclopædia Britannica contained an article on Keats by Alexander Smith, which stated: [...] "Perhaps the most exquisite specimen of Keats' poetry is the 'Ode to the Grecian Urn'; it breathes the very spirit of antiquity,—eternal beauty and eternal repose." [...] During the mid-19th century, Matthew Arnold claimed that the passage describing the little town [...] "is Greek, as Greek as a thing from Homer or Theocritus; it is composed with the eye on the object, a radiancy and light clearness being added." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{action was}} {{considered}} a defeat by the Admiralty and was not reported in the London Gazette. The British naval authorities were particularly disturbed by rumours that began to circulate concerning the death of Captain Corbet and the behaviour of his crew during the battle. Prominent among these rumours was the suggestion that Corbet had been murdered by his disaffected crew: historian William James wrote in 1827 that [...] "There are many who will insist, that Captain Corbett's [...] death-wound was inflicted {{by one of his}} own people." [...] although he goes on to point out the unlikelihood of Corbet being shot by one of his own cannon. He gives more credence to the story that Corbet committed suicide to avoid the shame of defeat, that he [...] "cut the bandages from his amputated limb, and suffered himself to bleed to death." [...] This story was also alluded to in Edward Pelham Brenton's 1825 history: [...] "Corbet did not (<b>we</b> <b>fear</b> would not) survive his capture". The truth of Corbet's end will never be known with certainty, although James ultimately concludes that Corbet's wound was almost certainly a mortal one and thus the most likely cause of death.|$|E
500|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm {{met with}} a mixed {{reception}} on exhibition, and while critics generally praised Etty's technical ability, {{there was a certain}} confusion as to what the painting was actually intended to represent and a general feeling that he had seriously misunderstood what The Bard was actually about. The Library of the Fine Arts felt [...] "in classical design, anatomical drawing, elegance of attitude, fineness of form, and gracefulness of grouping, no doubt Mr. Etty has no superior", and while [...] "the representation of the ideas in the lines quoted [...] are beautifully and accurately expressed upon the canvas" [...] they considered [...] "the ulterior reference of the poet [...] was entirely lost sight of, and that, if this be the nearest that Art can approach in conveying to the eye the happy exemplification of the subject which Gray intended, <b>we</b> <b>fear</b> we must give up the contest upon the merits of poetry and painting." [...] Similar concerns were raised in The Times, which observed that it was [...] "Full of beauty, rich in colouring, boldly and accurately drawn, and composed with a most graceful fancy; but the meaning of it, if it has any meaning, no man can tell", pointing out that although it was intended to illustrate Gray it [...] "would represent almost as well any other poet's fancies." [...] The Examiner, meanwhile, took issue with the cramped and overladen boat, pointing out that the characters [...] "if not exactly jammed together like figs in a basket, are sadly constrained for want of room", and also complained that the boat would not in reality [...] "float half the weight which is made to press upon it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the heart}} of civil-military {{relations}} {{is the problem of}} how a civilian government can control and remain safe from the military institution it created for its own protection. A military force that is strong enough to do what is asked of it must not also pose a danger to the controlling government. This poses the paradox that [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>fear</b> others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then <b>we</b> <b>fear</b> the very institution we created for protection".|$|E

A letter published by 11 prominent computer scientists on August 11 supported the defendants' assertions and claimed that the precedent of the gag order will [...] "stifle research efforts and weaken academic computing research programs.

2500|$|Wordsworth's poetry, {{especially}} when the Lyrical Ballads had been published 26 years earlier, was such a radical departure that scarcely anyone understood it. Even at the time Hazlitt was writing this essay, [...] "The vulgar do not read , the learned, who see all things through books, do not understand them, the great despise, the fashionable may ridicule them: but the author has created himself {{an interest in the}} heart of the retired and lonely student of nature, which can never die." [...] "It may be considered as a characteristic of our poet's writings," [...] Hazlitt reflects, [...] "that they either make no impression on the mind at all, seem mere nonsense-verses, or that they leave a mark behind them that never wears out. ... To one class of readers he appears sublime, to another (and <b>we</b> <b>fear</b> the largest) ridiculous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilberforce {{is a man}} [...] "of many {{excellent}} and admirable qualifications": he is eloquent, [...] "amiable, charitable, conscientious, pious, loyal, [...] humane". But he is also [...] "tractable to power" [...] and [...] "accessible to popularity". These qualities, according to Hazlitt, are inherently contradictory and render Wilberforce ineffectual. [...] "Loyalty, patriotism, friendship, humanity, are all virtues; but may they not sometimes clash?" [...] He is too afraid of criticism and too in love with praise. [...] "We can readily believe", Hazlitt explains, [...] "that Mr. Wilberforce's first object and principle of action is {{to do what he}} thinks right: his next (and that <b>we</b> <b>fear</b> is of almost equal weight with the first) is to do what will be thought so by other people." [...] The result, muses Hazlitt, is that he becomes accused, and understandably so, of [...] "affectation, cant, hollow professions, trimming, fickleness, and effeminate imbecility." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{recently}} the purchasers, eaters, and consumers of opium have become numerous. Deceitful merchants {{buy and sell}} it to gain profit. The customs house at the Ch'ung-wen Gate was originally set up to supervise the collection of imports (it had no responsibility with regard to opium smuggling). If we confine our search for opium to the seaports, <b>we</b> <b>fear</b> the search will not be sufficiently thorough. We should also order the general commandant of the police and police- censors at the five gates to prohibit opium and to search for it at all gates. If they capture any violators, they should immediately punish them and should destroy the opium at once. As to Kwangtung [...] and Fukien , the provinces from which opium comes, we order their viceroys, governors, and superintendents of the maritime customs to conduct a thorough search for opium, and cut off its supply. They should in no ways consider this order a dead letter and allow opium to be smuggled out! ...|$|E
