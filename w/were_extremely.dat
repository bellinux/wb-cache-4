5|$|Casualty figures <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> variable, but British {{casualties}} (killed, wounded, or captured) {{appear to}} have been in the low 30s according to press accounts (contrary to Dickinson's claim of 49 prisoners taken), while militia casualties were relatively small in number.|$|E
5|$|Brüning's {{austerity}} measures brought little economic {{improvement and}} <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> unpopular. Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically {{at people who}} had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.|$|E
5|$|Burial 69 {{was found}} {{in front of the}} base of Group 18 Structure 2. The remains <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> poorly {{preserved}} but the deceased may have been laid out on their back with the head towards the north. Associated funerary offerings included a tripod plate, a polychrome vase and a flint projectile point. The burial was securely dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{measurement}} technique is coherent, it naturally rejects incoherent radiation. Additionally, because the time slice of {{the measurement}} <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> narrow, the noise contribution to the measurement <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> low.|$|R
50|$|The Moulton {{notation}}, or Tongan notation <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> {{popular and}} <b>is</b> still cherished by the Tongans. It <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> common to see bandmasters writing out {{the music on}} the blackboards in the church halls during choir practices.|$|R
50|$|Dominance is also {{unrelated}} to the distribution of alleles in the population. Some dominant alleles <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> common, while others <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare. The most common allele in a population may be recessive when combined with some rare variants.|$|R
5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. The bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E
5|$|Operations in Borneo <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> {{sensitive}} and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official acknowledgement {{of involvement in}} cross-border missions only occurred in 1996. Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General Suharto to power, a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict. 3,500 Australians served during Confrontation; casualties included 16 dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded.|$|E
5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} {{found themselves in}} a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E
50|$|This {{activity}} <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> {{dangerous because}} optimum highmark terrain is typically {{in areas where}} avalanche danger <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> high. Snowmobilers <b>are</b> the recreation group {{most likely to be}} killed in an avalanche, largely due to the activity of highmarking.|$|R

5|$|The band's Battle Born World Tour proved {{their most}} {{widespread}} yet {{with the band}} visiting new territories including Russia and China. The tour was named the 43rd highest grossing worldwide during 2013. On June 22, 2013, the band played their biggest show to date at the 90,000 capacity Wembley Stadium; the band performed a song specifically written for the occasion. Reviews of the show <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> positive.|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} on Sunday, 29 November <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> unsettled. There were {{a series of}} thunderstorm cells that formed {{early in the morning}} — despite it being more common for thunderstorms to form in the late afternoon in the south-east Queensland region. These storms, which had periodic bursts of severe lightning, cleared quickly.|$|E
5|$|With the unpopularity of the doctrine, the {{judiciary}} developed several ways around it. These were at times both complex and extremely artificial, {{and used the}} law relating to trusts and agencies, along with other areas and ideas such as collateral contracts.

5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, {{such as those of}} the dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> popular.|$|E
5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E

5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|As of 2001, {{there were}} 18,878 homes in El Hatillo, of which 13,545 were occupied; the {{remaining}} homes were either unoccupied, occasionally used, under construction, or for sale. An average of four people made up each household. Regarding wealth, 74.7% {{of the population}} were above poverty level, 21.5% were poor, and 3.8% <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> poor. According to the 2001 census, each household in the municipality received an average of 1,316,906 Venezuelan bolívares (1316.906 bolívares fuertes) per month, equal to US$1,832 at the time, or US$21,984 per year.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was offered}} {{command of the}} Army of the Potomac {{following}} Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's failure in the Peninsula Campaign. He refused this opportunity because of his loyalty to McClellan {{and the fact that}} he understood his own lack of military experience, and detached part of his corps in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign. He received telegrams at this time from Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter which <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> critical of Pope's abilities as a commander, and he forwarded on to his superiors in concurrence. This episode later played a significant role in Porter's court-martial, in which Burnside appeared as a star witness.|$|E

40|$|The {{distinction}} between {{food and medicine}} may be reduced by producing human pharmaceuticals in food crops. The benefits of such an approach are abundantly clear. Producing biopharmaceutical molecules synthetically, or purifying them from microbial fermentation systems, can <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult and expensive. Plants, on the other hand, especially food crops such as corn, <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> efficient producers of large amounts of protein. This ability could <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> important {{for the production of}} oral vaccines, for example, where large doses are typically required to elicit immunity...|$|R
50|$|The tree <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> {{vulnerable}} to fire, and is damaged by even low-intensity burns. The resinous bark {{is capable of}} igniting quickly, and a crown fire will almost certainly kill the tree. However, populations of Pinus longaeva are known to <b>be</b> <b>extremely</b> resilient, and as a primary succession species, {{it is believed that}} populations of the tree would reestablish itself quickly after a fire. That said, large-scale fires <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> uncommon where the species grows, and are not {{a major factor in the}} species' long-term viability.|$|R
5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building {{in the middle of a}} raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E
5|$|Claiming that {{publishers}} {{would no}} longer accept anti-interventionist books, Townsend began self-publishing pamphlets. Between 1938 and 1940 he wrote a series of pamphlets which <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> popular and widely circulated among anti-interventionists. Two of them, The High Cost of Hate and America Has No Enemies In Asia, had a circulation of at least 60,000 copies, while another, There Is No Halfway Neutrality printed 30,000 copies. The last pamphlet in the series, Seeking Foreign Trouble, {{attracted the attention of}} the German embassy in Washington DC which bought and distributed more than 500 copies of it.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{shared the}} same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck {{supporting}} the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, although the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, with {{the center of gravity}} over the hips.|$|E
