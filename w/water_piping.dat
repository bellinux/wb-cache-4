25|$|After some {{positive}} effect was noticed using both the core spray system and feed <b>water</b> <b>piping,</b> TEPCO decided on 16 September {{to increase the}} amount of water pumped into the No. 2 reactor by one ton, in an attempt to further lower the temperature in the core, to a total of 7 tons per hour. The same was done for reactor No. 3, where 5 tons were added, bring the total to 12 tons per hour. TEPCO also added that the volume of cooling water into the No. 1 reactor would be increased as necessary.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September at 11AM (JST) TEPCO began injecting {{water into}} the No. 2 reactor using the core spray system piping in {{addition}} to the feed <b>water</b> <b>piping</b> already being used as this method seemed to be effective in reducing the temperature in the No. 3 reactor. At that time the temperature {{at the bottom of the}} No. 2 reactor was still 114.4 degrees Celsius (237.92°F), compared to the 84.9°C degrees(184.82°F) in the No.1 reactor and the 101.3°C (214.34°F) in the No. 3 reactor. The new method has led to some temperature decrease, but not as significant as the decrease that occurred in the No.3 reactor.|$|E

It carried debris, trees, and rocks, forming a temporary dam along the Choluteca River laden with sewage. Because the landslide was slow-moving, officials were able to evacuate before the river was stopped due to the temporary dam. Another smaller landslide destroyed several houses in the Colonia El Reparto section of the capital, although it was also slow-moving, and the residents were able to evacuate. Other landslides destroyed over 20houses along the rivers in the city due to erosion along river banks.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the cycles}} of {{concentration}} increase, the water {{may not be able}} to hold the minerals in solution. When the solubility of these minerals have been exceeded they can precipitate out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the heat exchangers. The temperatures of the recirculating <b>water,</b> <b>piping</b> and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water. [...] Often a professional water treatment consultant will evaluate the make-up water and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for {{the cycles of}} concentration. The use of water treatment chemicals, pretreatment such as water softening, pH adjustment, and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration.|$|E
2500|$|In {{municipal}} politics, Gray {{was elected}} councillor in 1852 and alderman of Dublin Corporation, and {{took an interest}} in the improvement of the city. As chairman of the committee for a new water supply to Dublin, Dr. Gray actively promoted what would become the [...] "Vartry scheme". The Vartry Reservoir scheme involved the partial redirection and damming of the Vartry river in County Wicklow, the building of a series of <b>water</b> <b>piping</b> and filtering systems (and related public works) to carry fresh water to the city. This work was particularly important in the improvement of conditions in the city, and to public health, as it improved sanitation and helped reduce outbreaks of cholera, typhus and other diseases associated with contaminated water. On the opening of the works on 30 June 1863, Gray was Knighted by the Earl of Carlisle, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Partially in recognition of these efforts, Gray would later be nominated for the position of Lord Mayor of Dublin for the years 1868–69, but he declined to serve.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electrical}} connection to earth {{can be used}} as a reference potential for radio frequency signals for certain kinds of antennas. The part directly in contact with the earth - the [...] "earth electrode" [...] - can be as simple as a metal rod or stake driven into the earth, or a connection to buried metal <b>water</b> <b>piping</b> (the pipe must be conductive). Because high frequency signals can flow to earth due to capacitative effects, capacitance to ground is an important factor in effectiveness of signal grounds. Because of this, a complex system of buried rods and wires can be effective. An ideal signal ground maintains a fixed potential (zero) regardless of how much electric current flows into ground or out of ground. Low impedance at the signal frequency of the electrode-to-earth connection determines its quality, and that quality is improved by increasing the surface area of the electrode in contact with the earth, increasing the depth to which it is driven, using several connected ground rods, increasing the moisture content of the soil, improving the conductive mineral content of the soil, and increasing the land area covered by the ground system.|$|E
