5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on <b>winter</b> <b>flounder,</b> Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E

50|$|Fishing is {{a popular}} {{activity}} for those visiting Dickinson Bayou. In dry summers drought the water becomes saltier and produces many smaller saltwater fish not usually seen in brackish water. These include ladyfish, redfish, croaker, piggy perch, and an occasional speckled trout. In the <b>winter</b> months, <b>flounder</b> make an appearance in {{the section of the}} bayou closest to the bay. Spring brings out small largemouth bass and catfish in the lower reaches of the bayou.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface is}} {{extremely}} irregular, {{and is so}} broken into detached portions by intervening masses of rock and impenetrable copses of furze and briars, as to render it unpracticable to ascertain, {{with any degree of}} correctness, the probable number of acres under cultivation. The ground in some parts rises into numerous hills of moderate height, and in other parts, especially towards the north, into mountainous elevation forming a chain of heights skirting the lofty and conspicuous mountain of Criffel. For nearly two miles along the eastern coast the surface is tolerably level, and divided into several fields of good arable land. The coast is bold and rocky, and in many places rises into lofty and precipitous cliffs, overhanging the Firth, from which, at low water, the sea retires, leaving a broad tract of level sands. In the crevices of these rocks is found abundance of samphire, of which considerable quantities are collected with great hazard. The Firth is about nine leagues in breadth at this place; the river Urr is navigable for eight miles from it, for vessels of not more than eighty tons, and the Southwick burn joins the Frith on the boundary of the parish. The salmon-fishery is carried on upon a small scale, and during the season smelts are also found; cod is taken with lines during the <b>winter,</b> and <b>flounders,</b> in 1834, were taken in such numbers that cart-loads were distributed throughout the neighbouring parishes.|$|R
5000|$|Larval <b>Winter</b> <b>flounder</b> {{are known}} to feed on nauplii, harpacticoids, calanoids, polychaetes, {{invertebrate}} eggs, and phytoplankton.

6000|$|And now I come to {{the next}} great vital element for which [...] "our house" [...] must provide,--WATER. [...] "Water, water, everywhere,"--it must be plentiful, it must be easy to get at, it must be pure. Our {{ancestors}} had some excellent ideas in home living and housebuilding. Their houses were, generally speaking, very sensibly contrived,--roomy, airy, and comfortable; but in their water arrangements they had little mercy on womankind. The well {{was out in the}} yard; and in <b>winter</b> one must <b>flounder</b> through snow and bring up the ice-bound bucket, before one could fill the tea-kettle for breakfast. For a sovereign princess of the republic, this was hardly respectful or respectable. Wells have come somewhat nearer in modern times; but the idea of a constant supply of fresh water by the simple turning of a stop-cock has not yet visited the great body of our houses. Were we free to build [...] "our house" [...] just as we wish it, there should be a bath-room to every two or three inmates, and the hot and cold water should circulate to every chamber.|$|R

50|$|The <b>winter</b> <b>flounder,</b> Pseudopleuronectes americanus, (also {{known as}} black back) is a right-eyed ("dextral") {{flatfish}} {{of the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is native to coastal waters of the western north Atlantic coast, from Labrador, Canada to Georgia, United States, although it is less common south of Delaware Bay. It {{is the most common}} near-shore (shallow-water) flounder in the waters from Newfoundland down through Massachusetts Bay, reaching a maximum size around 61 cm in length and 2.25 kg in weight. The species grows larger on Bank, where they can reach a length of 70 cm and weight of 3.6 kg. Although <b>winter</b> <b>flounder</b> historically supported large commercial and recreational fisheries, biomass and landings have decreased since the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Pleurocidin is an {{antimicrobial}} peptide {{found in}} the mucus secreted by {{the skin of the}} <b>winter</b> <b>flounder</b> (Pleuronectes americanus). It exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Pleurocidin assumes an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation similar to other linear antimicrobial peptides and {{may play a role in}} innate host defence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>flounder</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at about {{two to three}} years of age and a total length of 25-30 cm, with variance across their range. Mature adults (excluding those on Georges Bank) generally migrate in two phases, where adults enter shallow estuaries in the late fall and early spring to spawn in late winter or early spring before returning to deeper parts of the estuary or offshore waters. However, these migration patterns may be altered or individuals may stay inshore year round if temperatures remain at 15°C or lower or if enough food is available. Genetic analyses and tagging studies indicate that there is little mixing between the <b>Winter</b> <b>flounder</b> populations in the Gulf of Maine, South of Cape Cod, and on Georges Bank.|$|E
50|$|Type I-hyp AFP (where hyp {{stands for}} hyperactive) {{are found in}} several righteye flounders. It is {{approximately}} 32 kD (two 17 kD dimeric molecules).

The northern edge of CA-I is fished intensely.|$|E
50|$|Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, {{and rivers}} support diverse {{shellfish}} and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and <b>winter</b> <b>flounder</b> (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} <b>winter</b> <b>flounder,</b> northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, cunner, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports blueback herring, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, cunner, <b>winter</b> <b>flounder,</b> and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>flounder</b> lay up to 3.3 million demersal, {{adhesive}} {{eggs that}} are retained within their spawning grounds. Depending on temperature, larvae of approximately 3 mm in length hatch {{in two to}} three weeks. These larvae are planktonic at first, but transition to a bottom-oriented lifestyle over time. Around five to six weeks after hatching, the left eye of the larval flounder begins to migrate to {{the right side of the}} body. The “flounder-like” juveniles then settle onto the seafloor and move into saltwater coves, coastal salt ponds, estuaries, and protected bays, where they may grow up to 100 mm within the first year. Adult <b>winter</b> <b>flounder</b> may grow as large as 70 cm and reach ages of 15+ years. Growth varies across their distribution, with northern populations generally growing slower than those at the southern end of their range.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} marine {{fish in the}} Sound include porgy, butterfish, <b>winter</b> <b>flounder,</b> summer flounder, {{windowpane}} flounder, fourspot flounder, northern and striped sea robin, little skate, menhaden, Atlantic silversides, black seabass, blackfish (tautog), cunner, bluefish, and smooth dogfish. Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. <b>Winter</b> <b>flounder</b> may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander {{in and out of}} the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.|$|E
