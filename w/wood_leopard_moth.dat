50|$|The de Havilland DH.85 <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> is a three-seat high-wing cabin {{monoplane}} {{designed and}} built by the de Havilland Aircraft Company in 1933.|$|R
2500|$|The {{success of}} the three-seat, high-wing de Havilland <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth,</b> {{introduced}} in 1933, had proved {{that there was a}} market for this class of aircraft. Until 1935 Pobjoy Airmotors Ltd had not previously built an aircraft, but concentrated successfully on engines. [...] In June 1935 the company name was changed to Pobjoy Airmotors and Aircraft Ltd and at the same moment they introduced their only original aircraft design, the Pobjoy Pirate, aimed at the <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> market. They naturally chose to power it with one of their own seven cylinder radial engines. [...] At the time, the most powerful variant was the 90hp (67kW) Niagara III, much less powerful than the 145hp (108kW) Gipsy Major 10 of the <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth.</b> [...] The Pobjoy, though was less than half the weight of the de Havilland engine and Pobjoy believed that with the advantage of this weight saving (about 160lb or 73kg) they could build a lighter and smaller aircraft that would perform as well.|$|R
40|$|The <b>leopard</b> <b>moth,</b> Zeuzera pyrina (Lep: Zeuzeridae), is an {{important}} pest {{of a wide range}} of trees and shrubs including walnut and apple across the world. The natural populations of the <b>leopard</b> <b>moth</b> in different geographical areas of Iran show significant differences in some of their biological characteristics such as time of emergence, generation time and host specificity. So, we hypothesized that these populations may represent different subspecies that move toward a speciation event in their evolutionary route. In this study, we evaluated the genetic diversity of six different geographically isolated populations of the <b>leopard</b> <b>moth</b> using the sequence alignment of cytochrome oxidase c subunit one (COI). A fragment of 642 base pairs was amplified in all six populations and the phylogenetic tree was created based on sequenced fragments. Our results revealed significant differences in the nucleotide sequence of COI gene in these populations. Differences in climatic conditions of these regions seem to be the most powerful force driving this diversity among the studied populations...|$|R

40|$|The <b>leopard</b> <b>moth,</b> Zeuzera pyrina L. (Lep: Zeuzeridae) is an {{important}} polyphagous pest {{of a wide range}} of trees and shrubs across Europe and Asia. The efficient control of the <b>leopard</b> <b>moth</b> by direct spraying of infested branches and trees is usually impractical because the larvae feed internally and escape from exposure to the used insecticides. Sexual pheromones emitted by females may provide an efficient alternative method to explore the pest, disrupt its mating or capture and kill it. In the present study, we evaluated the efficiency of one Iranian-formulated (in three doses: 1, 1. 5, and 2 mg per trap) and three non-Iranian-formulated sexual pheromones in attraction and capturing of adult males of the <b>leopard</b> <b>moth</b> in Walnut orchards of Alborz province and three different regions of Kerman province (Rabor, Baft, Darremorid). We found a wide diversity in response of adult males to different pheromones in the four studied regions. This diversity seems to be resulted from isolation of the populations and may present a preliminary stage of divergence and speciation in this species...|$|R
50|$|Musa {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the giant <b>leopard</b> <b>moth</b> and other Hypercompe species, including H. albescens (only recorded on Musa), H. eridanus, and H. icasia.|$|R

25|$|The Pobjoy Pirate was a three-seat, high-wing {{monoplane}} {{designed to}} compete with the de Havilland <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> using a low power but light Pobjoy radial engine. Flight tests showed the Pirate to be uncompetitive and its development was rapidly abandoned.|$|R

40|$|The <b>leopard</b> <b>moth</b> borer, Zeuzera pyrina L., is a one of {{the main}} pest which causes yield loses in {{pomegranate}} orchards. This study was conducted in Antalya province pomegranate orchards between 2011 and 2013. This study aimed to determine first adult flight date, the effectiveness of different types of traps, alternative biological products and combinations of pheromone traps and biological products. Delta type trap and dry funnel trap were assessed to determine the appropriate type of trap and delta type trap found to be more efficient than the other. Biological products, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae were used for controlling of <b>leopard</b> <b>moth</b> borer and B. bassiana were found to be more effective. Efficiency of delta type pheromone trap and B. bassiana combination was found as 71. 8 and 84. 3 % in 2012 and 2013 respectively...|$|R
5000|$|... 44 <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moths</b> were {{impressed}} into military service in Britain {{and others in}} Australia during World War II, mostly as communications aircraft.

50|$|At {{the end of}} 1940 the FP headquarters, {{recognising}} {{the need}} for aviation support for the force, began forming the Aviation militaire de la Force Publique equipped with requisitioned civilian machines and based at N'Dolo Airport in Leopoldville.

5000|$|Further work on {{improving}} the area began in early April 1935, when Derwent Hall Caine landed his <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> at Close Lake, {{in order to}} oversee some of the work.

50|$|Sesioidea is the {{superfamily}} currently containing clearwing moths (Sesiidae), castniid moths (Castniidae) {{and little}} bear moths (Brachodidae). There is evidence from head and thoracic morphology {{that the first}} two families, internally feeding in plants as caterpillars, are sisters, whilst some brachodids are known to feed on leaf surfaces (Edwards et al., 1999). Sesioidea {{are considered to be}} the sister group of Cossoideahttp://tolweb.org/Apoditrysia which contain the also internal-feeding Goat and <b>Leopard</b> <b>moths.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 27 May 1933 and in July won the King's Cup Race at {{an average}} speed of 139.5 mph (224.5 km/h), piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland. A total of 133 aircraft were built, including 71 for owners in the British Isles, and 10 for Australia. Other examples were exported to France, Germany, India, South Africa and Switzerland. Production of the <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> ended in 1936.|$|R
5000|$|Several spurges {{are grown}} as garden plants, among them {{poinsettia}} (E. pulcherrima) and the succulent E. trigona. E. pekinensis (...) {{is used in}} traditional Chinese medicine, where it is {{regarded as one of}} the 50 fundamental herbs. Several Euphorbia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), like the spurge hawk-moths (Hyles euphorbiae and Hyles tithymali), as well as the giant <b>leopard</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|R
