5|$|Adams resented Hamilton's {{influence}} <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> {{and considered}} him overambitious and scandalous {{in his private}} life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President. Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, {{but it did not}} work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President. Adams resented the intrigue since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after Adrienne's death, Lafayette mostly {{remained}} quietly at La Grange as Napoleon's power in Europe waxed, and then waned. Many influential people {{and members of the}} public visited him, especially Americans. He wrote many letters, especially to Jefferson, and exchanged gifts with him, as the Frenchman had once done <b>with</b> <b>Washington.</b>|$|E

5|$|Movieland settled <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> in April 2007 under terms {{similar to}} the FTC {{settlement}} but specific to Washington consumers, agreeing to pay Washington $50,000 as consumer reimbursement and to prominently state all important contract terms, including {{the cost of the}} subscription service, in advertisements.|$|E
5|$|After one {{intersection}} with 5900 South, which presently serves {{only the}} toll road company's headquarters {{and a single}} commercial building, private maintenance gives way to a four-lane city street with sidewalks just shy of 5800 South. The roadway continues northeasterly {{to the top of}} the hill near 5600 South, where pre-existing Adams Avenue (500 East) heads north, passing the Ogden Regional Medical Center to an intersection <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> Boulevard (US-89) on the Washington Terrace-South Ogden border. Adams Avenue continues through South Ogden and into Ogden as a minor street one block east of US-89, with a gap near 4600 South and more north of downtown Ogden. In 2006 approximately 1,400cars traveled the parkway on an average weekday.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his later}} works, {{following}} in his traditional sketches {{about his life}} and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may {{have been based on}} painter Chester Harding. His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> Irving at Sunnyside.|$|E

5|$|Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, {{such as the}} ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited {{influential}} {{white men}} to sit on her school board of trustees, gaining participation by James Gamble (of Procter & Gamble) and Thomas H. White (of White Sewing Machines). When Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute visited in 1912, he advised her {{of the importance of}} gaining support by white benefactors for funding. Bethune had met <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, both leagues {{were dealing}} with serious {{financial}} problems. The St. Louis Blues {{were on the verge}} of bankruptcy. Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing. In 1976, for the first time in four decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies, while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons. Two years later, after failed overtures about merging the Barons <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> and Vancouver, the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978–79.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} Richland, M-89 meets up with M-43, {{and the two}} share a brief routing {{together}} for a mile (1.6km) as M-43 heads southwest out of Richland while M-89 heads east, passing {{to the south of}} Gull Lake. After passing the lake, the highway turns southeast towards Battle Creek. As M-89 begins to enter the outskirts of Battle Creek it follows Michigan Avenue. It passes through the neighborhoods of Level Park-Oak Park and Urbandale, the first residential areas of the city. As the highway continues towards Battle Creek it has a junction with M-37. M-89 continues on Michigan Avenue until an intersection <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> Avenue where the route turns to the southwest where it crosses the Kalamazoo River one last time. The trunkline terminates a few blocks later at Dickman Road, otherwise known as the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94).|$|E

He returned in 1947 and spent two games on the major league roster {{before returning to the}} minor leagues, where he won multiple minor league batting titles. He bounced around in various minor league organizations until 1954, when the Washington Senators picked him up. Levan spent the next two seasons <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> before spending four years with the Chattanooga Lookouts. While in Chattanooga, Levan became the last person banned by baseball's governing organizations for conspiring to fix games, which ended his professional career.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{was content}} to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in {{opposition}} and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement <b>with</b> <b>Washington,</b> negotiated in 1874; Macdonald {{had come to believe}} that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{advocated}} for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates {{in celebration of}} {{the enactment of the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said that she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted <b>with</b> <b>Washington.</b>|$|E

5|$|SR666 is {{not part}} of the National Highway System, a system of routes {{important}} to the nation's economy, mobility and defense. The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). ODOT's 2010 annual average daily traffic (AADT) calculations showed that the lowest traffic levels were present on the section that is at the intersection <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> Township Road 112 (Bateman Road), where only 510 vehicles used the highway daily; the peak traffic volume was 5,340 vehicles AADT along a section of SR666 near its southern terminus.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in China, MacMurray fell into disagreement <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> over U.S. policy towards the ruling Kuomintang (Nationalist) government, which had been demanding immediate revisions to or a cessation of the treaty system in place between the two countries. Whereas Washington wished to make concessions to the Nationalist government, MacMurray favored the enforcement of existing treaties. These differences of opinion led him to resign in November 1929, whereupon he became a professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University.|$|E
5|$|The French {{arrived in}} Armenia {{in the late}} evening on Friday, December 9 and {{relieved}} the exhausted Armenian workers who then returned to Yerevan. Japan sent a monetary gift of $9 million while Italy had {{plans to build a}} prefabricated village for the victims, and West Germany offered to send more than a dozen heavy cranes. The Americans donated generously as well, <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. Private donations from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated 20,000 pounds of supplies.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} was divided between radicals and moderates, and narrowly {{passed a resolution}} agreeing {{to submit to the}} government's terms. The popular referendum was held on September 11 and also produced mixed results. Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated. The final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws. The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and David Redick to meet <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> and to halt the progress of the oncoming army. Washington and Hamilton declined, arguing that violence was likely to re-emerge if the army turned back.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators met for {{the final}} time at 7p.m. Booth {{assigned}} Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward at his home, George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and David E. Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar <b>with</b> <b>Washington)</b> to the Seward house {{and then to a}} rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln with his single-shot Deringer, and then stab Grant, at Ford's Theatre. They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue.|$|E
5|$|The early 1990s {{also served}} up {{a series of}} {{difficult}} experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in Newsday. The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton was having an affair <b>with</b> <b>Washington</b> Post columnist Richard Cohen. In January 1994, he locked horns with his executive producer on World News Tonight, Emily Rooney. The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings on the defensive.|$|E
