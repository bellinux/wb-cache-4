40|$|When steel drills, crankshafts, or {{gear wheels}} are hardened, the frames which hold the {{workpieces}} {{are subject to}} high thermal stress. They have to withstand temperatures of up to 1300 deg C and changes in temperature of up to 300 degrees per second. Even special highquality heat-resistant steels age rapidly under those conditions. But now a material used in aerospace applications could help bring about a drastic reduction in the high process costs of heat treatment. Carbon-fibre-reinforced carbon (CFRC) is twenty times stronger than steel at 1 000 deg C. Unlike metals, its strength increases at higher temperatures. However, the great advantage of the new material is its low weight. "CFRC frames are {{at least five times}} lighter than conventional steel frames. As a result, the net capacity of the <b>workpiece</b> <b>holders</b> and batch loaders can often be increased by up to 100 per cent"(explains Jörg Demmel, an engineer at the Fraunhofer Technology Development Group (TEG) in Stuttgart. That reduce s the costs per part considerably, because better use is made of the heat-treatment furnaces and the energy consumption is then lower. Another advantage is that CFRC hardly expands on heating. Whereas a steel part changes its length by about 15 mm per metre when heated from 20 degree to 1000 degree, CFRC does not change its size or shape noticable. "The frames remain distortion-free, even under large changes in temperature" says Demmel; "That makes it much easier to automate the workpiece handling of the heat treatment". Altogether, the process costs can be reduced by up to 50 per cent by using CFRC <b>workpiece</b> <b>holders.</b> In collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for the Mechanics of Materials (IWM), the TEG has now optimized the CFRC constructions and successfully employed them in several industrial applications.

40|$|AbstractMilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} used {{machining}} processes thanks to its high flexibility and high achievable quality. The performance of milling machines is constantly increasing, improving the convenience and increasing the competitiveness of this operation. However, the trend of performance improvement has found a technological limit: self-excited vibrations due to the dynamics of the system machine-workpiece-tooling (i. e. chatter). Chatter is the most dangerous dynamic phenomena that could happen during milling; due to its regenerative nature, it could lead the machine and the tooling system to a heavy fault or to the disruption of the workpiece. This paper develops an active <b>workpiece</b> <b>holder</b> that avoids chatter vibrations by a smart actuation of the workpiece. The design of the <b>workpiece</b> <b>holder</b> is a difficult task due to strict product requirements and the need to create a decoupled structure. The decoupling of the structure is a fundamental requirement of the product because this affects the controllability of the system. Axiomatic Design Theory is used to support the definition of the product requirements and the product architecture. After the definition of the optimal structure of the workpiece, the design features are integrated in order to obtain a functional decoupled structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{total removal}} of {{grinding}} wheel material includes two main parts. The larger {{of the two}} {{is the result of}} dressing and truing operation and the other relatively small part is due to the wheel wear which takes place during the actual grinding process. The frequency of dressing and truing operations depends on the cutting conditions, wheel characteristic, etc. However in dry grinding as there is no cutting fluid to transfer the heat from the contact zone, the wheel wear during grinding and the frequency of dressing is much higher due to the higher grinding forces and temperatures. Vibration grinding reduces wear of the grinding wheel during the process considerably and decreases the frequency of dressing operation significantly. Hence it increases the efficiency of the process and reduces the cost. The investigation carried out in the KSF institute shows the improvement on the surface roughness, reduction of the grinding forces, thermal damage of the ground surface and radial wear of the grinding wheel in case of using vibration grinding comparing to conventional grinding.

40|$|The model {{presented}} {{in the first part}} of this work is used here to estimate the diameter error in the most common turning operations. In fact, the diameter error is considered as a variable depending on the deflections of the tool, <b>workpiece</b> <b>holder</b> and workpiece, which are considered the main factors responsible for the machining accuracy. The proposed model has been applied to the three most common turning schemes related to workpiece fixturing, where the workpiece is clamped in a chuck, or supported between two centers, or clamped in a chuck at the spindle and supported on a center at the tailstock. Some numerical examples have been computed using the proposed model to predict the diameter error along the workpiece and the cutting force along the workpiece axis, as well as the influence of the cutting force components on the error prediction. The results provide additional insight into error formation in the turning process. Finally, some experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the developed model. Good agreement has been obtained between numerical and experimental results.

40|$|Modern {{industry}} {{expectations in}} terms of milling operations often demand the milling of the flexible details by using slender ball-end tools. This is a difficult task because of possible vibration occurrence. Due to existence of certain conditions (small depths of cutting, regeneration phenomena), cutting process may become unstable and self-excited chatter vibration may appear. Frequency of the chatter vibration is close to dominant natural frequency of the workpiece or the tool. One of the methods of chatter vibration avoidance is matching the spindle speed to the optimum phase shift between subsequent cutting edges passes (i. e. the Liao-Young condition). However, the set of optimum spindle speeds {{from the point of}} view of vibration reduction may be not optimum one from other points of view. For example milling efficiency or machine tool capabilities cannot be assured. This article presents the idea of a <b>workpiece</b> <b>holder</b> with adjustable stiffness and discusses a new variant of its realization. In the holder, milling process is performed at constant spindle speed and feed speed. In order to avoid vibration the holder stiffness is modified. Stiffness changes modify natural frequencies of the workpiece and thus it is possible to modify dynamic properties of the workpiece in such a way that arbitrary chosen, constant spindle speed will be optimum, due to the Liao-Young condition performance. Calculation of the optimum stiffness is performed before milling, based on the workpieces modal identification results and the finite element model simulations...|$|E
40|$|During the {{machining}} of a part, a new surface is generated together with its dimensional deviations. These deviations {{are due to}} the presence of several phenomena (workpiece deflection under strong cutting forces, vibration of the machine tool, material spring-back, and so on) that occur during machining. Each elementary phenomenon results in an elementary machining error. Consequently, the accuracy of the manufactured workpiece depends on the precision of the manufacturing process, which it may be controlled or predicted. The first part of this work presents a new model to evaluate machining accuracy and part dimensional errors in bar turning. A model to simulate workpiece dimensional errors in longitudinal turning due to deflection of the tool, <b>workpiece</b> <b>holder</b> and workpiece is shown. The proposed model calculates the real cutting force according to the Unified Generalized Mechanics of Cutting approach proposed by Armarego, which allows one {{to take into account the}} three-dimensional nature (3 D) of the cutting mechanism. Therefore, the model developed takes advantage of the real workpiece deflection, which does not lie in a plane parallel to the tool reference plane, and of the real 3 D cutting force, which varies along the tool path due to change in the real depth of cut. In the first part of the work the general theory of the proposed approach is presented and discussed for 3 D features. In the second part the proposed approach is applied to real cases that are mostly used in practice. Moreover, some experimental tests are carried out in order to validate the developed model: good agreement between numerical and experimental results is found. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Purpose of {{the work}} and approach: Photovoltaic wafer {{manufacturing}} faces serious challenges with the increase in manufacturing quantity and the increase in wafer size (156 mm edge length in common use). At the same time the wafer thickness is decreasing with 210 µm in commercial use and the aim to further decrease the wafer thickness down to 150 µm. The actual most used method for cutting wafers is based on wire saws. Manual separation is still widely in use, but is now at its limits. The hand span cannot cover these large wafers and yield cannot be maintained with the manual separation of very thin and large wafers Therefore a solution for automated separation is highly desirable to increase yield and throughput. This paper presents a solution for a high throughput, automatic separation of wet wafers which will have been tested in a manufacturing environment {{at the time of the}} conference. The idea to this solution is based on experiences made in electronic and paper industry. It is based on rolls and a separator, separating a stack of wafers one by one. To achieve this, the stack of wafers is conveyed to a separator which allows only one wafer to pass. With this new principle concept an industrial partner approached Fraunhofer IPA to jointly build up a prototype. To proof the method in principle, a prototype was built by Fraunhofer IPA. Based on this prototype, the method was evaluated as practicable and a industry suitable design was jointly developed by ACI-ecotec and Fraunhofer IPA. The current version of the separation equipment has been tested with multi- and monocrystalline wafers of all available sizes and thicknesses including 156 mm-wafers with a thickness of 150 µm. Scientific innovation and relevance & results: Wafer separation and cleaning was a discrete process in the past. This approach needed a large quantity of carriers, space and resources. The required number of handling operations is always influencing wafer breakage and therefore additional costs. With the availability of inline cleaning (single wafer cleaning) the need for more continuous processing steps increased. The proposed solution implements the continuous wafer flow by separating the whole ingot from the <b>workpiece</b> <b>holder</b> with a fully automated separation afterwards, feeding the wafers directly to the cleaning, testing and classification equipments. The approach addresses significantly the quality issues, by introducing minimal stress to the wafers. This is achieved by the absence of vacuum grippers as well as the use of only lateral force on the wafer, avoiding bending and twisting the wafer. Further work will be invested to increase the reliability and the fault tolerance of the method. The wafering is a very hazardous environment using different chemicals and producing a considerable amount of contamination (silicon, slurry, etc.) To deal with this environment, studies have been conducted, to improve the equipment into a state of high reliability as well as easy and fast maintenance. The experiments and studies have been transformed into a working equipment. With this the wafering can deal with the upcoming generations of large and thin wafers. Conclusions: An innovation was introduced for affordable and reliable automatic separation. This innovation was filed for a patent. Based on this further studies and experiments will be conducted to further improve the method and maybe extend the application to cell and module manufacturing...|$|E
