We {{demonstrated}} that eyes of young animals of various species (chick, tree shrew, marmoset, and rhesus macaque) can shorten in the axial dimension {{in response to}} myopic defocus. METHODS. Chicks <b>wore</b> positive or <b>negative</b> lenses over one eye for 3 days. Tree shrews were measured during recovery from induced myopia after 5 days of monocular deprivation for 1 to 9 days. Marmosets were measured during recovery from induced myopia after monocular deprivation, or <b>wearing</b> <b>negative</b> lenses over one or both eyes, or from wearing positive lenses over one or both eyes. Rhesus macaques were measured after recovery from induced myopia after monocular deprivation, or <b>wearing</b> <b>negative</b> lenses over one or both eyes. Axial length was measured with ultrasound biometry in all species. RESULTS. Tree shrew eyes showed a strong trend to shorten axially to compensate for myopic defocus. Of 34 eyes that recovered from deprivation-induced myopia for various durations, 30 eyes (88 %) shortened, whereas only 7 fellow eyes shortened. In chicks, eyes wearing positive lenses reduced their rate of ocular elongation by two-thirds, including 38. 5 % of eyes in which the axial length became shorter than before. Evidence of axial shortening in rhesus macaque (40 %) and marmoset (6 %) eyes also occurred when exposed to myopic defocus, although much less frequently than that in eyes of tree shrews. The axial shortening was caused mostly by the reduction in vitreous chamber depth. CONCLUSIONS. Eyes of chick, tree shrew, marmoset, and rhesus macaque can shorten axially when presented with myopic defocus, whether the myopic defocus is created by wearing positive lenses, or {{is the result of}} axial elongation of the eye produced by prior <b>negative</b> lens <b>wear</b> or deprivation. This eye shortening facilitates compensation for the imposed myopia. Implications for human myopia control are significant. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|If emmetropic animals <b>wear</b> <b>negative</b> or {{positive}} spec-tacle lenses, their eyes respond with enhanced or reduced axial growth, respectively. The growth changes {{compensate for the}} imposed refractive errors, largely independent of brain pro-cessing or accommodation [1].

Biochemical substances that are thought to be involved in retinal control of eye growth include the growth factor TGFβ [3 - 5], retinoic acid [6, 7], and the nuclear transcription factor ZENK (also known as Zif 269, EGR- 1, NGFI-A, and Krox- 24).

40|$|PURPOSE: Negative-lens-induced defocus causes {{accelerated}} ocular elongation and myopia, whereas positive-lens-induced defocus produces reduced ocular elongation and hyperopia. Short durations {{of positive}} lens wear result in markedly stronger temporal effects than do {{short periods of}} <b>negative</b> lens <b>wear</b> in the chick model of refractive development. In mammalian and nonhuman primate models, there have been equivocal results in inhibiting myopia by short periods of positive lens wear when compared with data from the chick model. The {{purpose of the present}} study was an evaluation of full-time - 9. 5 D <b>negative</b> lens <b>wear</b> interrupted by short periods of daily + 4 D positive lens wear in preventing experimental myopia in the tree shrew. METHODS: One treatment group <b>wore</b> <b>negative</b> lenses (- 9. 5 D) binocularly for 23 hours a day (10 hours of which were spent in total darkness), interrupted by 1 hour of wearing positive lenses (+ 4 D) binocularly for 12 days. Another group of animals <b>wore</b> <b>negative</b> lenses (- 9. 5 D) binocularly for 23 hours a day, interrupted by two 30 -minute periods of positive lens (+ 4 D) wear daily, again for 12 days. The animals were raised on a 14 -hour/ 10 -hour light-dark cycle. Animals wearing - 9. 5 D lenses binocularly, interrupted by 0 -powered lenses for either 1 hour or two 30 -minute periods daily for 12 days, acted as controls. RESULTS: Continuous wear of - 9. 5 D lenses binocularly induced a - 10. 8 D myopic shift in refraction. Full-time wear of - 9. 5 D lenses binocularly, interrupted by 1 hour of 0 -power lens wear binocularly, caused a myopic shift of 3. 6 D over 12 days, whereas wearing - 9. 5 D lenses, interrupted by 1 hour every day of + 4. 0 D lens wear binocularly, whether it was continuous or divided into two 30 -minute periods, caused a myopic shift of only 0. 7 D over 12 days. CONCLUSIONS: Daily intermittent + 4 D positive lens wear effectively inhibits experimentally induced myopia and may prove a viable approach for preventing myopia progression in children.

The range of the ankle motion is also significantly greater in the negative heeled shoes, remaining in dorsiflexion longer throughout the stance and swing phases of gait. The increased duration of dorsiflexion leads to lengthening of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle-tendon units {{and the length of}} the moment arm of the Achilles tendon. [...] A similar post-operative exercise effect involving increased dorsiflexion is often desired after surgeries involving the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles or Achilles tendon.

40|$|Interface {{adhesion}} between {{cast iron}} substrate and oxide layer formed during dry unidirectional sliding wear was studied by using thermo-mechanically processed 4. 8 Ni- 1. 5 Cr cast iron. The {{purpose of the}} present work is to reveal the difference of the adhesion behaviour between martensitic matrix with a higher hardness and austenitic matrix with low hardness. The 4. 8 Ni- 1. 5 Cr alloy was sandwiched as a middle layer with low carbon steel as outer layers and thermo-mechanically processed via (1) hot rolling (HR), (2) hot rolling and heat treatment (HT), and (3) hot rolling, heat treatment and hot compression (HC), respectively. The applied normal loads were 20 and 40. N, and the sliding speeds were 45 and 78. mm/s in sliding wear test. The durations of the wear test were 2 and 7. min, respectively for different testing rounds. It was found that the wear after running-in was always mild under the conditions of 20. N and 45. mm/s or 20. N and 78. mm/s for all the tested samples. Prior to the transition into mild oxidational <b>wear,</b> <b>negative</b> displacements of pins were observed for HT and HC samples when the applied load was raised to 40.

40|$|PURPOSE. Myopia can {{be induced}} in {{chickens}} {{by having them}} <b>wear</b> either <b>negative</b> lenses (lens-compensation myopia [LCM]) or diffusers (form-deprivation myopia [FDM]), whereas posi-tive lenses cause lens-compensation hyperopia (LCH). These three conditions were compared with respect to (i) their early time course and (ii) the effect of two manipulations of the lighting. METHODS. Longitudinal changes in ocular dimensions and re-fractive error were measured in chicks maintained under three different conditions: (i) wearing either 215 D lenses or dif-fusers in a normal light/dark cycle; (ii) wearing either 115 D lenses, 215 D lenses, or diffusers with brief periods of strobo-scopic lights {{at the beginning and}} end of the dark period; (iii) wearing either 16 D lenses, 26 D lenses, or diffusers with the nights interrupted by brief periods of white light. In addition, scleral and choroidal proteoglycan synthesis was measured in eyes that <b>wore</b> positive lenses, <b>negative</b> lenses, or diffusers for 3 hours followed by different periods of darkness. RESULTS. (i) The time course of the changes in axial length over the first 72 hours was significantly faster in LCM than in FDM. Indeed, the diffusers did not begin to significantly affect the total length of the globe for 3 days, although the vitreous chamber had deepened after 9 hours, because the choroid thinned extremely rapidly (within 1 hour) with either diffusers or negative lenses. (ii) Scleral proteoglycan synthesis was higher in eyes with negative lenses than in those with diffusers at 11 hours, but the reverse was true at 27 hours. (iii) Brief periods of stroboscopic light attenuated FDM more than LCM. (iv) In contrast, interruption of the nights by brief periods of light attenuated LCM more than FDM. (v) Neither lighting manipulation affected LCH. (vi) Choroidal proteoglycan syn-thesis decreased similarly with 3 hours of wearing either dif-fusers or negative lenses. CONCLUSIONS. Although both negative lenses and diffusers cause similar increases in the rate of ocular elongation, the responses differ in time course and in the effect of manipulations of the daily lighting. The responses to positive lenses differ from bot...|$|R

The tribological {{performance of the}} PtRuN-DLC films was systematically investigated using ball-on-disc microtribological test. The Raman {{results showed that the}} increased negative substrate bias significantly increased the number of sp 3 bonds in the PtRuN-DLC films {{as a result of the}} increased kinetic energies of impinging ions. The adhesion strength of the PtRuN-DLC films apparently decreased with increased negative substrate bias due to the promoted residual stress in the films. The tribological results clearly revealed that the increased negative substrate bias decreased the friction and wear of the PtRuN-DLC films by improving the sp 3 bonded cross-linking structures of the films. It can be concluded that the PtRuN-DLC films could effectively prevent their underlying Si substrates from <b>wear</b> as the <b>negative</b> substrate bias had a significant influence on the tribological properties of the PtRuN-DLC films.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe made a {{comprehensive}} study, involving observations on 45 marmosets, {{of the effects}} on ocular growth and refraction of wearing spectacles from the ages of 4 – 8 weeks. This period was within the period early in life when the eye grows rapidly and refraction changes from hyperopia to its adult value of modest myopia. In one series of experiments we studied the effect of lenses of powers − 8, − 4, + 4 and + 8 D fitted monocularly. In another series of experiments we studied the effect of lenses of equal and opposite powers fitted binocularly, with the two eyes alternately occluded, so as to give an incentive to use both eyes, and in particular to accommodate, for {{at least part of}} each day, through the negative lens. The vitreous chamber of eyes that <b>wore</b> <b>negative</b> lenses of − 4 D or − 8 D, combined with alternate occlusion, elongated more rapidly than that of the fellow eye (negative lens eye–positive lens eye, 0. 21 ± 0. 03 mm (S. E. M.), P< 0. 01 and 0. 25 ± 0. 06 mm, P< 0. 05, respectively) and became relatively more myopic (2. 8 ± 0. 26 D, P< 0. 01 and 2. 4 ± 0. 61 D, P< 0. 05 respectively). Eyes that wore − 4 D lenses monocularly elongated more rapidly and became myopic than fellow eyes. Eyes that wore + 4 D or + 8 D lenses were less strongly affected: animals that wore + 8 D lenses monocularly (without alternate occlusion) developed a slight relative hyperopia (0. 99 ± 0. 21 D, P< 0. 01), with the more hyperopic eyes also slightly shorter (0. 09 ± 0. 05 mm) than their fellow eyes, but eyes wearing + 4 D lens were not significantly different from their fellow eyes. Animals that wore − 8 D lenses monocularly (without alternate occlusion) developed a slight relative hyperopia after three weeks of lens-wear (0. 85 ± 0. 26 D, P< 0. 05). These were the only eyes that responded in a non-compensatory direction to the optical challenge of spectacle wear, and we interpret this effect as one due to visual deprivation. After the removal of lenses, the degree of anisometropia slowly diminished in those groups of animals in which it had been induced, but in the three groups in which the largest effects had been produced by lens-wear the overall mean anisometropia (0. 68 ± 0. 24 D, P< 0. 01) and vitreous chamber depth (VCD) discrepancy (0. 09 ± 0. 03 mm, P< 0. 01) were still significant {{at the end of the}} experiments, when the animals were 273 days old. The reduction of anisometropia in these groups was associated with an increase in the rate of elongation of the vitreous chamber in the eyes that had previously grown normally i. e. the less myopic eyes grew more rapidly than their fellow eyes: in the seven weeks following lens-wear these eyes became more myopic and longer than normal eyes (refraction P< 0. 001; VCD P< 0. 001). Control experiments showed that occlusion of one eye for 50 % of the day had no effect on eye growth and refraction, and therefore that alternate occlusion itself had no effect...|$|R
40|$|During a {{machining}} process, cutting parameters must {{be taken}} into account, since depending on them the cutting edge starts to wear out to the point that tool can fail and needs to be change, which increases the cost and time of production.

The measurement errors that occur when radiographically projecting a three-dimensional THA were modeled.

An error analysis was performed by virtually simulating 144 wear measurements under varying conditions with and without application of the correction: the mean absolute error was reduced from 1. 8  mm (range, 0 – 4. 51  mm) to 0. 11  mm (range, 0 – 0. 27  mm). For clinical validation, radiostereometric analysis was performed on 47 patients to determine the true wear at 1, 2, and 5  years.

40|$|One {{traffic safety}} {{problem that has}} been {{observed}} in several studies is the wear of the windscreens. The risk of dazzling increases when driving with a worn windscreen, which may have the consequence that the driver does not discover objects or people {{on the road in}} front of the vehicle. The behaviour of 24 drivers has been studied in a driving simulator using three windscreens with different level of usage. To achieve dazzling in the driving simulator a lamp was mounted in front of the windscreen in the simulator. The lamp simulated a setting sun. When the driver had to make way for an obstacle on the road, this was more difficult with the worn windscreens, despite the lower speed. The drivers discovered the obstacles later, used a harder brake power and took a more powerful action to avoid the obstacle. Altogether this indicates a more risky driving behaviour, in other words decreased traffic safety. The sight length to a cone was also measured. The results showed that the sight length became shorter with worn windscreen. When the drivers were asked to express their opinion about the experiment, they assessed both the simulated environment and the driving task as relatively realistic. Even though this is a simulated situation, with its limitations, the results indicate that driving under dazzling conditions with a <b>worn</b> windscreen has <b>negative</b> effects on driver behaviour...|$|R

40|$|When a young growing eye <b>wears</b> a <b>negative</b> or {{positive}} spectacle lens, the eye compensates for the imposed defocus by accelerating or slowing its elongation rate {{so that the}} eye becomes emmetropic with the lens in place. Such spectacle lens compensation {{has been shown in}} chicks, tree-shrews, marmosets and rhesus monkeys. We have developed a model of emmetropisation using the guinea pig in order to establish a rapid and easy mammalian model. Guinea pigs were raised with a + 4 D, + 2 D, 0 D (plano), − 2 D or − 4 D lens worn in front of one eye for 10 days or a + 4 D on one eye and a 0 D on the fellow eye for 5 days or no lens on either eye (littermate controls). Refractive error and ocular distances were measured at the end of these periods. The difference in refractive error between the eyes was linearly related to the lens-power worn. A significant compensatory response to a + 4 D lens occurred after only 5 days and near full compensation occurred after 10 days when the effective imposed refractive error was between 0 D and 8 D of hyperopia. Eyes wearing plano lenses were slightly more myopic than their fellow eyes (− 1. 7 D) but showed no difference in ocular length. Relative to the plano group, plus and minus lenses induced relative hyperopic or myopic differences between the two eyes, inhibited or accelerated their ocular growth, and expanded or decreased the relative thickness of the choroid, respectively. In individual animals, the difference between the eyes in vitreous chamber depth and choroid thickness reached ± 100 and ± 40 μm, respectively, and was significantly correlated with the induced refractive differences. Although eyes responded differentially to plus and minus lenses, the plus lenses generally corrected the hyperopia present in these young animals. The effective refractive error induced by the lenses ranged between − 2 D of myopic defocus to + 10 D of hyperopic defocus with the lens in place, and compensation was highly linear between 0 D and 8 D of effective hyperopic defocus, beyond which the compensation was reduced. We conclude that in the guinea pig, ocular growth and refractive error are visually regulated in a bidirectional manner to plus and minus lenses, but that the eye responds in a graded manner to imposed effective hyperopic defocus...|$|R
40|$|Titanium alloys, {{mainly because}} of their poor thermal conductivity, need to be cut at {{relatively}} low cutting speeds to avoid a severe diffusion <b>wear,</b> with obvious <b>negative</b> consequences on the profitability of machining. An important amount of research activities {{has been done in}} order to increase productivity in titanium machining operations {{and one of the most}} promising solutions is represented by the use of liquid nitrogen as a coolant during the machining operation. The aim of this paper is to compare traditional and cryogenic turning of Ti 6 Al 4 V in a region of cutting parameters particularly relevant to the aerospace industry where no previous data are available. The cutting parameters are those typical of titanium alloys rough machining which is considered, cost-wise, the most important operation because, for aerospace components, the so-called Buy-To-Fly ratio can reach values up to 20 : 1. The experiments have been performed using a full factorial design in order to statistically evaluate, using ANOVA and regression analyses, the significance of the input factors on the process most interesting outputs. The considered input factors are: type of cooling method, cutting speed and feed rate. The main analysed responses are: tool wear, surface roughness, cutting forces, coefficient of friction and chip morphology. The results show the significance of the cooling method on the tool life and that cryogenic machining is able to increase the tool life with respect to wet cutting. On the other hand, the beneficial effect of the liquid nitrogen cooling is reduced at high cutting speed and feed rate. Besides, the results showed that a small but significant reduction can be achieved for both the repulsion force and the coefficient of friction at the tool-workpiece interface...|$|R
40|$|Simulation of wear in {{artificial}} joint implants {{is critical}} for evaluating implant designs and materials. Traditional protocols employ the gravimetric method to determine the loss of material by measuring {{the weight of the}} implant components before and after various test intervals and after the completed test. However, the gravimetric method cannot identify the location, area coverage or maximum depth of the wear and it has difficulties with proportionally small weight changes in relatively heavy implants. In this study, we compare the gravimetric method with two geometric surface methods; an optical light method (RedLux) and a coordinate measuring method (CMM). We tested ten Adept hips in a simulator for 2 million cycles (MC). Gravimetric and optical methods were performed at 0. 33, 0. 66, 1. 00, 1. 33 and 2 MC. CMM measurements were done before and after the test. A high correlation was found between the gravimetric and optical methods for both heads (R 2 = 0. 997) and for cups (R 2 = 0. 96). Both geometric methods (optical and CMM) measured more volume loss than the gravimetric method (for the heads, p = 0. 004 (optical) and p = 0. 08 (CMM); for the cups p = 0. 01 (optical) and p = 0. 003 (CMM)). Two cups recorded <b>negative</b> <b>wear</b> at 2 MC by the gravimetric method but none did by either the optical method or by CMM. The geometric methods were prone to confounding factors such as surface deformation and the gravimetric method could be confounded by protein absorption and backside wear. Both of the geometric methods were able to show the location, area covered and depth of the wear on the bearing surfaces, and track their changes during the test run; providing significant advantages to solely using the gravimetric method...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} dental pathologies of fifty {{individuals}} from a 19 th century Dutch rural cemetery divided in even groups {{of men and}} women, and four age categories. Between these groups the amounts of ante-mortem tooth loss, caries, calculus, attrition and activity-related wear were examined. The results are that ante-mortem tooth loss was relatively high even under thirty-five years of age, while {{no significant differences between}} the sexes were visible. Caries amounts were significantly high among women, but in the comparison between age groups only the early young adults seemed to be affected less than the other three age groups. Calculus deposits were significantly higher among men and went up from the early young adults to the late young adults but then lowered again towards the middle and old adults, probably as a result of ante-mortem tooth loss in these groups. Attrition rates were significantly higher among men and across the age groups a slight increase in attrition rates was visible. Activity-related wear was high in men with more than 90 % of all individuals presenting signs of wear, especially due to clay pipe smoking resulting in pipe notches. Three women also showed clear signs of pipe notches due to smoking clay pipes. In contrast to earlier results there seems to be a slight statistical correlation between the total amount of caries and the amount of <b>wear,</b> a small <b>negative</b> correlation between the amount of caries and the average rate of attrition per individual and a small positive correlation between attrition and activity related wear. The previously discussed data also gives a few clues toward the diet of both men and women. Women were probably more likely to eat sweets and sugary foods than men due to their large amount of caries while men were likely to eat starchy foods such as bread that were also abrasive resulting in higher rates of calculus and attrition. The general state of oral health is difficult to ascertain but it is clear that calculus, caries and attrition rates were high while not so much attention was given to cleaning the teeth or visiting a physician to have sick teeth pulled...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxide film}} formed on {{metallic}} substrate during un-lubricated dry sliding {{is a critical}} factor affecting the wear resistance of the sliding components and the coefficient of friction. A healthy and well-maintained tribo-oxide layer kept with proper thickness and good surface conditions provides a solid sheet of lubrication between the rubbing pair by separating them from direct metallic contact and, thus preventing the sliding surfaces from severe damage. The {{purpose of this study}} is to further examine the relationship between the so-called protective tribo-glaze and the substrate underneath, such as the adhesion between the two components with different thermal expansion coefficients, the influence of growth of these oxide plateaux on the coefficient of friction and so forth. The adherence of an oxide layer onto the metallic substrate, mainly steels and cast irons, is reviewed. Hot compression and heat treatment were conducted on the samples tested using the Gleeble 3500 in this work. The sample is a composite material consisting of three layers, where the formability-poor cast iron is the core layer and low carbon steels are the outer layers. This sandwich-structural material is produced by hot rolling process through which the interface strengths between the cast iron and steels were greatly enhanced with a metallurgical bonding condition, after they were cast together, by pouring the molten steel which has a higher melting point into a casting device, followed by molten cast iron. The sliding wear test was carried out using CETR wear testing apparatus for three sample conditions of cast iron layer before they were cut from the cast iron layers. The three sample conditions are hot rolled sample that was hot rolled into composite with metallurgical bonding at a low carbon steel and cast iron interfaces, heat treated sample that was destabilised in the Gleeble 3500 at 1050 °C for 8 min in a vacuum after hot rolling, and hot compressed sample that was hot compressed in a vacuum (40 % reduction at a strain rate of 1 /s) in the Gleeble 3500 at 1050 °C for 8 min. The wear test on these three samples was conducted under dry sliding conditions at room temperature, after sliding parameters of 20, 40 N, and 45 and 78 mm/s were pre-set for different sliding tests in the CETR setup. Sliding durations of 7. 5 min and 2 min were selected for various testing conditions in this study. Optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to observe the worn surfaces of these samples. After misalignment and running-in, it was found that the wear was always mild for all the testing conditions, due to the formation of oxide plateaux on the disc specimen, cast rubbed against the upper high chrome steel ball shaped specimen. When the load was increased to 40 N, a so-called <b>negative</b> <b>wear</b> response occurred on the heat treated sample and the hot compressed sample. However, the hot rolled sample failed to respond in a similar manner under the same sliding condition. The <b>negative</b> <b>wear</b> from these samples generally lasted for some 2 min, followed by a reverse trend where the displacement of the pin became positive, which is what happened to the hot rolled sample during the whole sliding period. A 2 -minute test was carried out on these samples. The results revealed that the worn surfaces of the heat treated and hot compressed samples were coated with a protective oxide plateau which contributed to a negative displacement of pins, which was ready to be break off due to their approach to the critical thickness determined by surface fatigue and their brittle nature. However, the worn surface of hot rolled sample was not covered with such a healthy protective film that was replaced by discontinuous oxide plateaux which had been spalled off during rubbing and oxidised wear debris dispersed ready to be compacted into glaze on the worn track. The differences of stabilities and maintenance of oxide layer formed on these samples were discussed. The relationship between the formation of an oxide layer on the heat treated and hot compressed samples and the coefficient of friction as a function of sliding time was also discussed. It was concluded that the lowering coefficient of friction caused by the formation and development of a protective oxide layer only operates when the surface is kept well before approaching its critical thickness at which the surface severely cracks and is shown as scales instead of a whole oxide continent. This shows that the development of wear resistance offered by this layer is not synchronised with its growth in height...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2015. Major: Organizational Leadership, Policy, and Development. Advisor: Rosemarie Park. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 174 pages. Abstract Businesses like the Building Construction Industry (BCI) depend {{to a large}} extent on the viability of the workforce. Consequently, businesses invest heavily on the development of their employees. Regardless of the level of pro-activeness in developing and updating of human capital, it is bound to deteriorate owing to inevitable changes in the individual and workplace technology. This deterioration is known as human capital or skills obsolescence. Human capital obsolescence could be classified into technical and economic obsolescence. Technical obsolescence originates from worker's wear (illness and injuries) or atrophy due to lack of use of skills and knowledge. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the technical human obsolescence and the kind of retraining workers are engaging in to encounter skills obsolescence in the BCI in Nigeria. There are studies proffering solutions to human capital obsolescence, but there are hardly any targeting specific occupations like the BCI in developing countries like Nigeria. The available studies are not only limited to developed economies, but study clusters of occupations using variables such as wage scales that vary per occupation, and evaluate only general skills to the detriment specific to occupational skills. There is increasing evidence that BCI workers increasingly sustain injuries, sometimes fatal, at work. Also, there are contradictions in the literature on prevalence of skills obsolescence. Evidence exists that skills obsolescence leads to job loss, lack of job satisfaction, unemployment, poor productivity, and low craftsmanship. This descriptive survey was conducted in Southern Nigeria. The population consisted of 236, 175 BCI workers in the regional headquarters (Enugu, Lagos, and River States). The 387 participants with a minimum of high school education were randomly selected for the study. Data was collected using researcher-made questionnaire. The data were analyzed using Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis H test statistics and SPSS software. Among the findings are evidence of attrition of experience older workers; the most preferred professional training technique was Job Rotation; worker's age had no correlation with physical <b>wear,</b> but had <b>negative</b> correlation with skills atrophy; years of work experience had no relationship with skills obsolescence. Based on the findings, changes in institutional strategies for the improvement of skills and general working conditions in the industry are recommended. There should be accountability on the side of the employer for providing opportunity for skills improvement and better working conditions and opportunities for workers to improve their skills. Thus, it is also recommended that the industry intermittently conducts a skills obsolescence survey with the view of finding if and where obsolescence exists...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChick eyes {{compensate}} for defocus imposed by spectacle lenses by making compensatory changes in eye length and choroidal thickness, a laboratory model of emmetropization. To investigate {{the roles of}} longitudinal chromatic aberration and of chromatic mechanisms in emmetropization, we examined the participation of different cone classes, and we compared the efficacy of lens compensation under monochromatic illumination with that under white light of the same illuminance to the chick eye. Chicks <b>wore</b> positive or <b>negative</b> 6 D or 8 D lenses on one eye for 3 days, under either blue (460 nm) or red (620 nm) light at 0. 67 lux or under white light at 0. 67 or 0. 2 lux (all measures are corrected for chick photopic sensitivity). The illumination conditions were chosen to differentially stimulate either the short-wavelength and ultraviolet cones or the long-wavelength and double cones. Measurements are expressed as the relative change: the inter-ocular difference {{in the amount of}} change over the 3 days of lens wear. We find that under this low illumination the two components of lens compensation were differentially affected by the monochromatic illumination: in blue light lens compensation was mainly due to changes in eye length, whereas in red light lens compensation was mainly due to changes in choroidal thickness. In general, white light produced better lens compensation than monochromatic illumination. Negative lensesUnder white light negative lenses caused an increase in eye length (60 μm) together with a decrease in choroidal thickness (− 51 μm) relative to the fellow eye. Under blue light, although there was an increase in eye length (32 μm), there was no change in choroidal thickness (5 μm). In contrast, under red light there was a decrease in choroidal thickness (− 62 μm) but no increase in eye length (8 μm). Relative ocular elongation was the same in white and monochromatic light. Positive lensesUnder white light positive lenses caused a decrease in eye length (− 142 μm) together with an increase in choroidal thickness (68 μm) relative to the fellow eye. Under blue light, there was a decrease in eye length (− 64 μm), but no change in choroidal thickness (2 μm). In contrast, under red light there was an increase (90 μm) in choroidal thickness but less of a decrease (− 36 μm) in eye length. Lens compensation by inhibition of ocular elongation was less effective under monochromatic illumination than under white light (white v red: p= 0. 003; white v blue p=. 014). The differential effects of red and blue light on the choroidal and ocular length compensatory responses suggest that they are driven by different proportions of the cone-types, implying that, although chromatic contrast is not essential for lens compensation and presumably for emmetropization as well, the retinal substrates exist for utilizing chromatic contrast in these compensatory responses. The generally better lens compensation in white than monochromatic illumination suggests that longitudinal chromatic aberration may be used in lens compensation...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background and Aims: Myopia is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} {{disorder of the eye}} that can lead to pathological outcomes including blindness. It is increasing in prevalence and has enormous public health impacts and societal costs. Genetic and environmental factors are involved in the aetiology of myopia, but the cause(s) of the increasing prevalence are unknown. Animal models have been used {{to determine the effects of}} hyperopic and myopic defocus on the refractive status and ocular growth of the eye, with defocus imposed using both spectacle lenses and diffusers. Experiments using animals suggest that multiple cues and biochemicals are likely to be used in the detection and compensation for defocus. Determining the response to defocus in the mammalian eye, which is phylogenetically similar to the human eye, will help to elucidate both how defocus alters eye growth and how it can be manipulated to assist with the recovery from myopia. The guinea pig is a useful mammalian model of the effect of myopic and hyperopic defocus on eye growth as it rapidly compensates for lenses and diffusers. In this thesis, the guinea pig will be used to determine the effects of myopic and hyperopic defocus during lens-wear (induction) and recovery from myopia, when imposed monocularly and binocularly and when imposed sequentially on the eye. Methods: In Chapter 2, different groups of guinea pigs wore lens powers from - 10 D to + 15 D on one eye for 10 - 13 days before being measured. Repeated measures were performed on animals wearing a - 8 D lens (n= 5), no lens (n= 4), or a + 5 D lens (n= 6) for approximately 2 weeks. Refractive error (RE) and ocular length (OL) were measured at the end of the experiment to determine the range and features of compensation to myopic and hyperopic defocus. Chapter 3 determined the temporal properties of hyperopic defocus in isolation (without a competing signal) and competition. Guinea pigs wore monocular - 4 D lenses (n= 111) for repeated periods interspersed with different dark intervals over 12 days, or monocular - 5 D lenses (n= 152) for repeated periods interspersed with different length free viewing periods over 7 days. Ocular parameters were measured at the conclusion of the lens wear periods. In Chapter 4, the recovery from myopia was investigated when either one (n= 28) or both (n= 13) eyes were first made myopic by minus lens-wear, and then <b>wore</b> either <b>negative</b> lenses, lens mounts or positive lenses to manipulate the subsequent defocus experienced. Additionally, the fellow eyes of animals (n= 33) were manipulated during the recovery from myopia to assess the yoked effects during inhibitory growth. Guinea pigs (n= 21) also wore + 10 D lenses monocularly or binocularly to determine whether compensation was more complete for isometropic defocus. Finally, in chapter 5, guinea pigs (n= 50) had myopic and hyperopic defocus imposed on their eyes sequentially for varying percentages of the day period to determine if myopic defocus preferentially guides eye growth. Results: In Chapter 2, it was found that compensation in RE in the guinea pig eye occurred for a larger range of hyperopic defocus compared to myopic defocus (- 8 D to + 6 D lens powers), but a reduction in the vitreous chamber elongation was induced with all positive lens powers tested (up to + 15 D). The response to myopic defocus also involved a thickening of the crystalline lens and an initial myopic refractive error. In Chapter 3, hyperopic defocus presented in isolation, led to growth signals which were resistant to decay (time constants of 22 hrs for RE and 31 hrs for OL). In contrast, much shorter decay times occurred when hyperopic defocus was presented in competition with a daily free viewing period (36 min). In Chapter 4, recovery from myopia was suppressed by more than 2 D when the fellow eye was becoming myopic. The recovery from myopia was increased by adding extra myopic defocus to a recovering eye with a + 4 D lens. Compared to eyes wearing a lens mount control, an extra + 0. 15 D /day of recovery occurred over 13 days (p = 0. 004). However, recovery was not enhanced when the initial myopia and additional myopic defocus was approximately equal in both eyes. When + 4 D lenses were worn binocularly, the recovery from myopia was + 4. 3 D, the same as in animals with unimpeded vision wearing lens mounts only. Binocular + 10 D lens wear led to no overall differences in compensation for refractive error compared to monocular lens wear, although when the data from the preferred eyes were compared, the vitreous chamber was 98 µm smaller in binocular lens-wearing animals. Finally, Chapter 5 showed that guinea pig eyes experiencing sequential myopic and hyperopic defocus tended to average the defocus presented, though animals wearing + 5 D lenses for only 2 of 8 hours became significantly more hyperopic than the weighted average of defocus predicted (+ 1. 46 D, p = 0. 019). Conclusion: The results of this thesis suggest that the guinea pig eye does not change its refractive error when myopic defocus is imposed on normally growing eyes, despite compensatory changes in the vitreous chamber. However, adding myopic defocus to an eye which was already myopic enhanced its recovery. Presenting single vision myopic defocus binocularly did not cause refractive error compensation during lens-wear or recovery from myopia. The mammalian eye responds to high amounts of hyperopic defocus, and this defocus causes a long lasting acceleration in eye growth when presented in isolation, but when presented in competition with periods without lens-wear, the growth signal rapidly decays. Hyperopic defocus was also found to reduce the capacity of a fellow eye to recover from myopia. However, eye growth was biased towards compensation for myopic defocus when the signals were presented sequentially. Taken together, these results suggest eye growth and growth inhibition do not arise from a single bi-directional signal, but rather separate processes underlie the response to myopic and hyperopic defocus in the guinea pig eye...|$|R
