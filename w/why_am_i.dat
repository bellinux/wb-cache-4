5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the radar screen. I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: <b>why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
500|$|I mean, don't you {{sometimes}} stop and go, don't you feel hyper aware {{of who you}} are in the moment? And then think, 'God, I'm me inhabiting my flesh and bones, saying my words, breathing the air that I breathe but you're also outside of it and thinking, 'But why? <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> me? Why... why... what is my place here?' [...] Well, that happens to me all the time.|$|E

500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me {{wandering}} around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then <b>why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E
500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends that I had forgotten for years.

2500|$|Other {{songs of}} the album are of a private nature. The song [...] "Achterbahn" [...] was written by Plate {{following}} a state of panic in his flat which caused him to shout [...] "Ich kann nicht mehr! Ich will nicht mehr!" [...] ("I can't go on any longer! I want to end it all!"). These words are sung {{at the start of}} the song. Another song, [...] "Amo Vitam", initially contained the lines [...] "Ich liebe das Leben, ich liebe den Sex, doch warum bin ich einsam?" [...] ("I love life, I love sex, but <b>why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> lonely?"). The lines, written by Plate, were translated into Latin for the final produced song by a friend with the help of his former Latin teacher. Latin was used because Plate felt that the language sounded very dramatic.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{detailed}} review of four sittings done by medium Tyler Henry, Edward and Susan Gerbic reviewed all the statements on the TV show Hollywood Medium. In their opinion not one statement made by Henry was accurate, yet each sitter {{felt that the}} reading was very successful. In after interviews with each sitter all four claimed that Henry had made specific statements, but after reviewing the show it showed that he had not. Each sitter misremembered the statement. One of many examples of this was when Henry during a session with celebrity Ross Matthews stated [...] "Bambi, <b>why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> connecting to Bambi"? Matthews stated that his father who was a hunter would not shoot deer because of the movie Bambi. In the post interview, Matthews stated that [...] "it was weird that Henry knew that my father would not shoot deer because of Bambi", when {{that is not what}} was said, Matthews had misremembered what Henry had said.|$|E
2500|$|Lichtblau and John {{illustrate}} {{the split between}} the German and Jewish communities with a sample from one of Straucher's parliamentary speeches, which reads: [...] "Why [...] are the Germans engaged in an economic and political war against the Jews? I {{as well have been}} raised and educated only as a German. <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> inferior? [...] we are drawing the obvious conclusion! And nevertheless we remain friends of the German people because we are admirers of the prodigious German culture. We as a people want to be loyal friends of the German people and of other peoples, if {{and to the extent that}} they acknowledge our equal rights and equal worth!" [...] Straucher also reacted against the claims of Viennese politicians that Bukovina was destitute and [...] "semi-asiatic", deeming them [...] "most unfair". His other statements of the time are proof of Austrian patriotism, loyalism and reverence for Hasburg Emperor Franz Joseph I.|$|E

2500|$|Rogers was {{intelligent}} and could read well before kindergarten. [...] Following {{an education in}} a strict religious and ethical environment as an altar boy at the vicarage of Jimpley, he became a rather isolated, independent and disciplined person, and acquired a knowledge and {{an appreciation for the}} scientific method in a practical world. His first career choice was agriculture, at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he {{was a part of the}} fraternity of Alpha Kappa Lambda, followed by history and then religion. [...] At age 20, following his 1922 trip to Peking, China, for an international Christian conference, he started to doubt his religious convictions. [...] To help him clarify his career choice, he attended a seminar entitled <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> entering the Ministry?, after which he decided to change his career. [...] In 1924, he graduated from University of Wisconsin and enrolled at Union Theological Seminary. He later became an atheist.|$|E
2500|$|In self-analysis, Jackson {{uncovered}} vital details regarding her past, saying, [...] "Certain {{things may}} happen, {{and you just}} dismiss them instead of stopping and saying, [...] "Why am I feeling this way? <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> acting out in this way?" [...] She had suppressed various traumas throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, using evasion tactics to prevent thoughts from surfacing. She also recalled feeling unaccepted and ostracized for her skin color. She was persistently haunted by a memory of a school teacher intensely scolding her, causing her classmates to erupt in laughter. [...] "Oh, God, it sounds so stupid. But being a kid you're just so frightened... I never talked about it, so it stayed with me all those years. I felt not deserving, not good enough... that's still the way I feel about myself sometimes", she declared. As a child, she managed discomfort by speaking to her animals, later turning to overeating as an anesthetic, causing fluctuations in weight. Jackson said, [...] "I {{began to realize that}} whenever something really painful was going on, I would eat, and that's how I would run away from it. But I would just be creating another problem in another area instead of just dealing with that pain".|$|E
