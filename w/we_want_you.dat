They elaborate on points previously raised in Why <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> to be Rich, and criticize {{a dearth of}} financial literacy education in the U.S. system. The authors warn of the middle-class squeeze and the harm this will cause to the American middle class.

25|$|Midas Touch elaborates on points made by Trump and Kiyosaki {{in their}} prior work Why <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> to be Rich. The coauthors assert their ideas {{will lead to}} an uptick in the American economy. Trump and Kiyosaki lament the lack of {{financial}} literacy espoused in the U.S. education structure. They argue students should be taught how to become business owners instead of learning how to go work for another company. Trump and Kiyosaki write that such students are instructed to achieve academic excellence through avoiding risk. They say those who do engage in risk will learn from their mistakes and be stronger for it.|$|E
25|$|Why <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> to Be Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E

25|$|Trip Brennan of The Intercept {{reviewed}} both Why <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> to be Rich and Midas Touch, and {{was critical}} of both books. Brennan criticized Midas Touch for its support of multi-level marketing, a practice he described as a pyramid scheme in disguise. He wrote negatively of the book's discounting of investment in mutual funds. BuzzFeed News wrote about the work during Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, and contrasted the book's views on the changing American economy with Trump's statements from the campaign trail. BuzzFeed News was critical Trump had shifted his perspective from the book, where he had previously written U.S. industrial jobs would never return and individuals needed to learn to cope with new skills in the Information Age. Business Insider similarly compared the work with Trump's 2016 campaign message, noting the book ended with a passage embracing immigrants whereas the Trump campaign {{was critical of}} illegal immigration from Mexico.|$|E

[...] The idea of casting Steve Buscemi in the lead role came about when Scorsese mentioned wanting to work with the actor, whom Winter knew well having worked with him on The Sopranos. Winter sent the script out to Buscemi, who responded very enthusiastically. [...] "I just thought, 'Wow. I'm almost sorry I've read this, because if I don't get it, I'm going to be so sad.' My response was 'Terry, I know you're looking at other actors'... and he said, 'No, no, Steve, I said <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>you.</b> Explained Scorsese, [...] "I love the range he has, his dramatic sense, but also his sense of humor." ...|$|E
