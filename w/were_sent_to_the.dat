5|$|By {{two days}} after the storm, the {{government}} of Mexico sent two airplanes to Acapulco, where the food, clothing, and medicine were distributed by truck or helicopter to the affected areas. The Mexican government arranged plans to drop food and medical aid into isolated villages, although food supplies were initially insufficient for the great number of people affected by the storm. Five army units and three helicopters <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region to assist in the aftermath, although planes encountered difficulties in landing due to flooded runways. Army soldiers were responsible for rescue operations, while paratroopers <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> most affected areas to distribute aid.

50|$|Round robin DNS {{is often}} used to load balance {{requests}} between a number of Web servers.

The second user who accesses the home page will <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next IP address, and the third user will <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third IP address.

The Claws' best known player, Mel Daniels, was disappointed at the Claws' fate and retired rather than play for another team. In Terry Pluto's book on the ABA, [...] "Loose Balls", Daniels recalled that the Claws' players were allowed to take equipment and furniture from the team office in lieu of payment.|$|R

Together with the 7th Division they formed the Australian I Corps. However, France fell to German forces in July 1940, before I Corps arrived. While the rest of the division was training in the Middle East, the division's third artillery regiment, the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 2/1st Anti-tank Regiment <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom to help bolster the garrison there in light of an expected invasion following the Fall of France.

Some other studies have considered parallel broadcast channels in which simultaneous common and independent messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers [5, 12, 13], or simultaneous common and confidential messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers [14].|$|R
