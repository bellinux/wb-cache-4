5|$|Cantor {{developed}} important {{concepts in}} topology and {{their relation to}} cardinality. For example, he showed that the Cantor set is nowhere dense, but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the rationals are everywhere dense, but countable. He also showed that all countable dense linear orders <b>without</b> <b>end</b> points are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally {{across the bottom of}} the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward {{the bottom of the screen}}. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue <b>without</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{has been}} the subject of many biographical films. The {{earliest}} was a silent film made by Carl Froelich in 1913 and featured in the title role the composer Giuseppe Becce, who also wrote the score for the film (as Wagner's music, still in copyright, was not available). Amongst other film portrayals of Wagner are: Alan Badel in Magic Fire (1955); Lyndon Brook in Song <b>Without</b> <b>End</b> (1960); Trevor Howard in Ludwig (1972); Paul Nicholas in Lisztomania (1975); and Richard Burton in Wagner (1983).|$|E

25|$|As Snyder's {{involvement}} in {{environmental issues and}} his teaching grew, he seemed {{to move away from}} poetry for much of the 1980s and early 1990s. However, in 1996 he published the complete Mountains and Rivers <b>Without</b> <b>End,</b> a mixture of the lyrical and epic modes celebrating the act of inhabitation on a specific place on the planet. This work was written over a 40-year period. It has been translated into Japanese and French. In 2004 Snyder published Danger on Peaks, his first collection of new poems in twenty years.|$|E
25|$|Aurea (also {{known as}} Aura) – July 19, 856. Born in Córdoba in Al-Andalus and a {{daughter}} of Muslim parents. She witnesses the execution of her brothers, Adolphus and John on 27 September 822 (their feast day). (Adolphus is the saint of the fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral in the epic historical novels The Pillars of the Earth and World <b>Without</b> <b>End</b> by Ken Follett.) In her widowhood she quietly became a Christian and a nun at Cuteclara, where she remained {{for more than twenty}} years. She was discovered by Muslim relatives, brought before a judge, and renounced her Christianity under duress. However, she regretted this, and continued to practice Christianity in secret. When her family discovered this, she was again brought before a court, refused to repent a second time, and was executed.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Tacfarinas sent envoys to Rome {{to offer}} peace {{in return for}} land in the {{province}} {{for himself and his}} followers. It is doubtful that this implied a desire by Tacfarinas' men to become sedentary farmers. More likely, they simply sought restored access to their traditional grazing grounds. If his demands were not met, Tacfarinas warned, he would wage a war <b>without</b> <b>end</b> on the Romans. Although this was probably a serious offer, Tiberius was outraged. He considered it the height of impudence that a man whom he regarded as a deserter and common brigand should be demanding terms like a foreign head of state. The offer was dismissed and Tacfarinas resumed hostilities. Tiberius now demanded that the Senate appoint an especially experienced general to command in Africa so that Tacfarinas could be dealt with once and for all. The man selected by Tiberius was Quintus Junius Blaesus, a veteran who as governor of Pannonia had narrowly escaped lynching by his troops in the great mutinies that broke out on Tiberius' accession in 14 AD. Blaesus owed his selection to his nephew, Sejanus, Tiberius' commander of the Praetorian Guard and trusted right-hand man. For the task, Tiberius gave Blaesus an additional legion (the IX Hispana, transferred from Pannonia on the Danube) and its attached auxiliary regiments, doubling the total force in Africa to around 20,000. He also authorised Blaesus to offer a general pardon to any of Tacfarinas' associates who surrendered - but not to Tacfarinas himself, who was to be captured or killed at all costs.|$|E

500|$|Schumann, {{the last}} sonatas' dedicatee, {{reviewed}} {{the works in}} his Neue Zeitschrift für Musik in 1838, upon their publication. He {{seems to have been}} largely disappointed by the sonatas, criticizing their [...] "much greater simplicity of invention" [...] and Schubert's [...] "voluntary renunciation of shining novelty, where he usually sets himself such high standards", and claiming the sonatas [...] "ripple along from page to page as if <b>without</b> <b>end,</b> never in doubt as to how to continue, always musical and singable, interrupted here and there by stirrings of some vehemence which, however, are rapidly stilled".

500|$|Interpretations of the song's meaning {{vary from}} one {{listener}} to the next; some people {{view it as}} a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium. In this interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, [...] "I've asked you <b>without</b> <b>end</b> / When will you go with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name" [...] ("") are taken to express the [...] "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom", the [...] "sense of loss and disorientation" [...] among China's youth in the 1980s. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as [...] "recast the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole." [...] The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī wú suŏ yŏu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means [...] "to have nothing" [...] and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning [...] "I have nothing" [...] (implying that it is a song about two people), or [...] "we have nothing" [...] (understanding it as social commentary).|$|E
