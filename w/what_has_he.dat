500|$|In chapter 38, High {{provides}} more {{detail about the}} einherjar. Gangleri says that [...] "you say that all those men that have fallen in battle {{since the beginning of}} the world have now come to Odin in Val-hall. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> got to offer them food? I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." [...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there will seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." [...] She left in tears.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, {{this whole}} {{controversy}} was forgotten quickly and served {{only as an}} excuse to play one of the show's favorite clips involving Donald Sterling: [...] "Biiiiiig Magic Johnson. [...] <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done..." ...|$|E
6000|$|The breathless {{sense of}} really monstrous {{injustice}} cut {{the power of}} speech in Soames' throat. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done! <b>What</b> <b>had</b> they done to him! ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, {{and he started}} violently back. In {{the shadow of the}} room stood a great shadowy figure--silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows. Every muscle in Raut's body suddenly became tense. When could the door <b>have</b> opened? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> heard? Had <b>he</b> heard all? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> seen? A tumult of questions.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{business}} <b>had</b> <b>he</b> at Chaldicotes? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> to do {{with such}} friends as that? I {{do not know how}} I am to forgive him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is {{this man}} to whom my being yearns? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been to me? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> to do with thee? Speak, O Oracle and make the secret clear. Speak, I command, even though {{afterwards}} thou dost slay me--if thou canst." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] said Cassy. [...] "Haven't I waited?--waited till {{my head is}} {{dizzy and}} my heart sick? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> made me suffer? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> made {{hundreds}} of poor creatures suffer? Isn't he wringing the life-blood out of you? I'm called on; they call me! His time's come, and I'll have his heart's blood!" ...|$|E
6000|$|GILBEY. [horrified, pitiable] Oh my-- [his breath fails him]. Do {{you mean}} {{that when he was}} in the police court he was in the dock? Oh, Maria! Oh, great Lord! <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> got for it? [Desperate] Will you tell me or will you see me go mad on my own carpet? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{witnesses}} who came next {{did their best}} to press the charge against the prisoner home to him. Having the arsenic in his possession, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done with it? The evidence led the jury to infer <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done with it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> {{happened}} in these {{five days to}} make her like this to him? He took her hands and tried to kiss them; but she said quickly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! what! he {{mentioned}} that? He observed me signalling the lads, did <b>he?</b> <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{to say about}} his friend Hunsden--anything sweet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|What brave tales {{could he}} not tell me. He fought in the first Crusade, heard the clarion voice of Peter, met the great Godfrey face to face, stood, hand on sword-hilt, at Runny-mede, perhaps. Better than a whole library of {{historical}} novels would an evening's chat be with such a ghost. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done with his eight hundred years of death? where has he been? <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> seen? Maybe he has visited Mars; has spoken to the strange spirits who can live in the liquid fires of Jupiter. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> learned of the great secret? Has he found the truth? or is he, even as I, a wanderer still seeking the unknown? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> got in {{his hand}} now? More cucumbers? No. A long strip of paper. It's the bill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then your {{chat with}} Comrade Downing {{was not of}} the old-College-chums-meeting-unexpectedly-after-years'-separation type? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been doing to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see--it was {{the only}} way to avoid a tete-a-tete!' said Albinia. 'Well done, Genevieve. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been saying to you, my dear?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been thinking? Suppose {{after all}} that ending with Mrs. Skelmersdale was simply a beginning. So far <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never looked sex in the face....|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, {{in answer}} to the woman's remark, [...] "that was {{certainly}} foolish of him. But <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{to do with the}} row, anyway?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{suppose he}} has--explained," [...] said Mr. Brumley slowly and with {{infinite}} distaste. [...] "Lady Harman, <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> explained?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He changed!' {{returned}} the other. 'What for? <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> suffered? There is change enough for twenty in me. Isn't that enough?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} Dan Baxter {{wants to}} be major," [...] said Stuffer. [...] "Talk about gall! <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> ever done for the school? Nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Where <b>had</b> <b>he</b> {{been in his}} time? he repeated, when I {{asked him}} the question. Lord, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been everywhere! And <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been? Bless you, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been {{everything}} you could mention a'most! ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl's first proud {{impulse was}} to turn coldly away and leave him. But some strange tumult in her heart kept her still. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> come to say? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{relief was}} but momentary. Why was Jimmy {{in the room}} at that time? Why <b>had</b> <b>he</b> a lamp? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> been doing? The {{questions}} shot from her brain like sparks from an anvil.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, the veechy {{is a good}} {{fellow at}} the bottom, Griffin; though he'll never burn the bay of Naples. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> to say now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Martha," [...] said a tall, broad-shouldered, deep-voiced man at her elbow, [...] "don't wop {{the poor}} cheeld like that. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been doin'--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, the man, bating he is a pestilent Roundhead and Puritan," [...] said Whitaker, [...] "is no bad neighbour. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> done to thee, man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Amyas sat thunderstruck. His {{first impulse}} was to ask, [...] "Lundy? What knew you of him? <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> or you to do at Lundy?" [...] but pity conquered curiosity.|$|R
60|$|The breathless {{sense of}} really monstrous {{injustice}} cut {{the power of}} speech in Soames' throat. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>HE</b> done! <b>What</b> <b>had</b> they done to him! And with quite unconscious dignity {{he put his hand}} on his breast, and looked at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, Brixton!" [...] he cried, {{looking up}} in some {{surprise}} as the young man advanced; [...] "you seem to have bin in the wars. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>'e</b> been fightin' wi', lad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! mamma, mamma, don't! I haven't said anything. I haven't {{complained of}} Mr. Comfort. <b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> said now? You forget {{that you have}} not told me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know she}} is very fond of him, and {{she has always been}} his favourite. <b>What?</b> <b>Has</b> <b>he</b> been in love with her all this time, poor fellow?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>he</b> been saying?" [...] {{demanded the}} aristocratic bully, coolly. [...] "Has he {{been telling you}} how I had to polish him off for {{insulting}} me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} I don't see yet," [...] I said. [...] "I don't {{understand}} Oscar's embarrassment in speaking to you. As you interpret him, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> to be afraid of?" ...|$|R
60|$|Tommy {{felt his}} {{ascendancy}} less sure than a moment before. His hold had slipped a little. But <b>he</b> was puzzled. <b>What</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> said wrong? He spoke {{out on the}} impulse of the moment.|$|R
60|$|Who was <b>he</b> and <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>he</b> done? On {{this she}} pondered {{half the night}} through, while fever coursed through her veins and her brows were moist and aching, her heart palpitating with pain.|$|R
