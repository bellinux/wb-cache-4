5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
25|$|In early 1989, {{he made a}} {{programme}} (broadcast in July) on {{his visit}} to Russia and his impressions on that country. The BBC originally <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a programme on India but the Indian high commission in London, England refused him a visa. When he visited Russia, Powell went to the graves of 600,000 people who died during the siege of Leningrad and saying {{that he could not}} believe a people who had suffered so much would willingly start another war. He also went to a veterans' parade (wearing his own medals) and talked with Russian soldiers with the aid of an interpreter. However, the programme was criticised by those who believed that Powell had dismissed the Soviet Union's threat to the West since 1945 and that he had been too impressed with Russia's sense of national identity. When German reunification was on the agenda in mid-1989, Powell claimed that Britain urgently needed to create an alliance with the Soviet Union in view of Germany's effect on {{the balance of power in}} Europe.|$|E

Branham interpreted their deaths as God's punishment for his resistance to holding revivals for the Oneness Pentecostals, something he felt God had <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] This {{appears to have been}} an embellishment to enhance his relationship with the Pentecostals.|$|E

500|$|Santamental, {{released}} in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he {{responded with a}} quip about his suitability for the project. The company <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, {{who had to be}} creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, [...] "But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{positive}} {{response to the}} opening sequence by Banksy, creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi {{and asked him if}} he could do something similar. Originally, they only <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it, but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself, explaining that [...] "If we had done it that way, no one would even have known that I {{had anything to do with}} it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose". [...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work. You can’t write visual performance. You have to actually draw it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] portrayed D'Angelo {{as a sex}} symbol to {{mainstream}} music audiences, which had repercussions on The Voodoo Tours second half. During the tour, female fans yelled out {{for him to take}} his clothes off, while others tossed clothes onto the stage. As trumpeter Roy Hargrove recounted, [...] "We couldn't get through one song before women would start to scream for him to take off something [...] It wasn't about the music. All they <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was take off his clothes." [...] This led to frustration and both onstage and offstage outbursts by D'Angelo, with him breaking stage equipment. Questlove later said, [...] "He'd get angry and start breaking shit. The audience thinking, 'Fuck your art, I wanna see your ass!', made him angry." [...] Although some were cancelled due to D'Angelo's throat infection during the tour's mid-March dates, many shows were cancelled due to his personal and emotional problems. D'Angelo chose on several occasions to not perform on scheduled dates, and delayed others to do physical workouts like stomach crunches. According to Questlove, three weeks worth of concert dates were cancelled, including two weeks worth of shows in Japan. He elaborated on the experience in a 2003 interview for The Believer, saying that: ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{versions}} of how Williams {{got his first}} guitar. His mother stated that she bought it with money from selling peanuts, but many other prominent residents of the town {{claimed to have been}} the one who purchased the guitar for him. While living in Georgiana, Williams met Rufus [...] "Tee-Tot" [...] Payne, a street performer. Payne gave Williams guitar lessons in exchange for meals prepared by Lillie Williams or money. Payne's base musical style was blues. He taught Williams chords, chord progressions, bass turns, and the musical style of accompaniment that he would use in most of his future songwriting. Later on, Williams recorded one of the songs that Payne taught him, [...] "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It". Williams musical style contained influences from Payne along with several other country influences, among them [...] "the Singing Brakeman" [...] Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, and Roy Acuff. In 1937 Williams got into a fight with his physical education coach about exercises the coach <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama. Payne and Williams lost touch, though eventually, Payne also moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939. Williams later credited him as his only teacher.|$|E
500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Ives' obscurity {{lifted a}} bit in the 1940s, when he met Lou Harrison, a fan of his music who began to edit and promote it. Most notably, Harrison {{conducted}} the premiere of the Symphony No. 3, The Camp Meeting (1904) in 1946. The next year, it won Ives the Pulitzer Prize for Music. He gave the prize money away (half of it to Harrison), saying [...] "prizes are for boys, and I'm all grown up". He himself was a great financial supporter of twentieth century music, often supporting works that were written by other composers. This he did in secret, telling his beneficiaries it was really his wife who <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Nicolas Slonimsky said in 1971, [...] "He financed my entire career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Especially in the 19th {{century and}} to a lesser extent today, their large size and {{conspicuous}} coloration, as well as the odd morphology of some (e.g. the Lebiini), made many ground beetles a popular object of collection and study for professional and amateur coleopterologists. High prices were paid for rare and exotic specimens, and in the early to mid-19th century, a veritable [...] "beetle craze" [...] occurred in England. As mentioned above, Charles Darwin was an ardent collector of beetles when he was about 20 years old, to the extent that he would rather scour the countryside for rare specimens with William Darwin Fox, John Stevens Henslow, and Henry Thompson than to study theology as his father <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In his autobiography, he fondly recalled his experiences with Licinus and Panagaeus, and wrote: ...|$|E

Prince's father was a pianist and songwriter, {{and his mother was}} a jazz singer.

In 1991, Prince's father told A Current Affair, [...] "I named my son Prince because I <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything I wanted to do."
