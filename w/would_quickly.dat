5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz Plan <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Piłsudski's {{government}} depended more on his {{charismatic authority}} than on rational-legal authority. None {{of his followers}} could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death the Sanation structure <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> fracture, returning Poland to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political contention.|$|E

5|$|One {{surprising}} {{prediction of}} the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur. For instance, the duplicated {{version of the}} protein should still be functional, since otherwise evolution <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> select against such proteins. Likewise, partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional. Such intermediates have been extensively documented in protein families such as DNA methyltransferases.|$|E
5|$|Small {{quantities}} of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both {{claimed to be}} possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> break down in the Martian atmosphere. Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinization.|$|E
5|$|Although Quatermass 2 was financially successful, its {{box office}} {{performance}} was eclipsed by the massive success of another Hammer film, The Curse of Frankenstein, {{which was to}} be the first of their many Gothic horror films. As a result it would be ten years before Hammer adapted the next Quatermass serial for the cinema with Quatermass and the Pit in 1967. Quatermass 2 was, however, the first film for which Hammer pre-sold the distribution rights in the United States, a financial model that <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> become the norm for subsequent Hammer productions.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} Colonel Michaelis {{went to the}} 1st Cavalry Division command post in Hwanggan and asked {{division}} commander Major General Hobart R. Gay for permission to withdraw his regiment through that division. Gay telephoned the Eighth Army headquarters {{and asked if he}} should attack in an effort to relieve the pressure on the 27th Infantry, or if that regiment should withdraw into the 1st Cavalry Division's area, move south to Kumch'on, and then turn toward Sangju to rejoin the 25th Division. The Eighth Army decided the 27th Regiment should withdraw, as Gay feared it <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> be surrounded if it tried to hold its position.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> decay.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} in London, UK; her keel was laid in 1872. Deutschland and her sister Kaiser were ordered shortly {{after the end of}} the Franco-Prussian War, under the assumption that the French <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> attempt a war of revenge. The ship was launched on 12 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 20 July 1875. Deutschland cost the German government 8,240,000gold marks. She was the last German capital ship built by a foreign shipbuilder.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} apparent to U.S. planners that, {{in a military}} confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces, NATO aircraft <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> suffer heavy losses. This came {{as a result of}} sophisticated Soviet defense networks, which used surveillance radars and radar-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery to seek and eliminate enemy aircraft. Consequently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a study on low-observability aircraft, seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft. Five companies were initially invited, three of which bowed out early. The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} in London, UK; her keel was laid in 1871. Kaiser and her sister Deutschland were ordered shortly {{after the end of}} the Franco-Prussian War, under the assumption that the French <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> attempt a war of revenge. The ship was launched on 19 March 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 13 February 1875. Kaiser cost the German government 8,226,000gold marks.|$|E
5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E

5|$|Roentgenium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 28.7g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3.

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{originally had}} high expectations of encountering a densely populated region that <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> submit to Spanish rule, with the natives being parcelled out in encomienda to the conquistadores, effectively as slave labour. The fierce resistance to Luis Marín's expedition quickly extinguished such hopes. However, {{within two years}} of this first reconnaissance, titles of encomienda were being issued and used as justification to seize slaves. Chamula was given to Bernal Díaz, and Zinacantan was given to Francisco de Marmolejo.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} phreatomagmatic eruptions {{caused by}} the easy access of water to the erupting vents threw rocks up to a kilometre (0.6mi) away from the island, and sent ash clouds as high as 10km (6mi) up into the atmosphere. The loose pile of unconsolidated tephra <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> have been washed away had the supply of fresh magma dwindled, and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away from the island during {{this stage of the}} eruption.|$|E

5|$|With {{the death}} of Kuchlug, the Mongol Empire secured control over the Qara Khitai. Another segment of the Qara Khitai, from a dynasty founded by Buraq Hajib, survived in Kirman as vassals of the Mongols, but ceased to exist as an entity {{during the reign of}} the Mongol Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü. The Mongols now had a firm outpost in Central Asia {{directly}} bordering the Khwarazm Empire. Relations with the Khwarazms <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> break down, leading to the Mongol invasion of that territory.|$|E
5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there were two {{suburban}} tramways on the east side, the Ekeberg Line (opened in 1919) and the Østensjø Line (1923). Only the latter would {{be connected to the}} T-bane; the Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway, but three new lines were to be built—the Grorud Line on the north side and the Furuset Line {{on the south side of}} Groruddalen and the Lambertseter Line on the east of Nordstrand. These areas were all chosen as new suburbs for Oslo, and <b>would</b> <b>quickly</b> need a good public transport system; suburban lines would first be built out extending from the existing tramway, and later a final section with tunnel to the central station would be built. The Lambertseter Line was opened in 1957, from Brynseng to Bergkrystallen while the Østensjø Line was extended to Bøler in 1958.|$|E
