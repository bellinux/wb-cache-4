6000|$|THE WORK OF KEATS. [...] "None but {{the master}} shall praise us; and none but the master shall blame" [...] {{might well be}} <b>written</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> leaf of every volume of Keats's poetry; for never was there a poet more devoted to his ideal, entirely {{independent}} of success or failure. In strong contrast with his contemporary, Byron, who professed to despise the art that made him famous, Keats lived for poetry alone, and, as Lowell pointed out, a virtue went out of him into everything he wrote. In all his work we have the impression of this intense loyalty to his art; we have the impression also of a profound dissatisfaction that the deed falls so {{far short of the}} splendid dream. Thus after reading Chapman's translation of Homer he writes: ...|$|R

Live coding, as a performance tool is a particular activity that incorporates <b>writing</b> code <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fly</b> with <b>the</b> shared experience of the activity being involved. Many creative platforms are equipped with exuberant tools available to the users to process materials. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary live coding platforms are formed as blank canvases like a tabula rasa so that users may decide what to include for their requirements.

40|$|Live coding {{commonly}} takes {{pieces of}} code from algorithmic composition systems. However, sometimes algorithmic generators either do not consistently show high-level properties, like dramatic transition among parts, or simply, our aesthetic criterion prefers some particular cases {{among all the}} possible. In such cases {{it is useful to}} have tools for exploring the output space of generative systems, in order to identify and categorize outputs with specific properties. This paper presents an approach to creating linguistic rules out of human-evaluated patterns and their potential uses in live coding to create high-level structures. The methodology starts with a set of sampled examples from an algorithmic system that are evaluated by the user through qualitative linguistic variables. Then, the examples along with the user's evaluation are analysed through an inductive and rule extraction methodology. For a particular example case, these rules are extracted and evaluated. Its application then as information used for <b>writing</b> code <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fly,</b> as well as its implementation in the form of filters or generators is presented...|$|R
5000|$|Riding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{success of}} {{extensive}} touring in 2002, Carus with Paul Keenan (who later joined Australian band Eskimo Joe) on drums and Noel Manyam on bass guitar released the Carus's first studio album in February 2003, Songs from Martin St. The album which boasts {{an eclectic mix}} of rock, reggae and folk stylings reached number 18 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Australian Independent Records chart. The album established the band as a leading group in the new roots-folk scene along with similar artists such as John Butler Trio and The Waifs. The release of the album was followed by extensive national touring and a tour of Europe. Carus recorded a solo performance titled, Live at the Norfolk in October 2003 which is one of his most popular releases. With Paul Keenen leaving Carus & the True Believers to drum for Australian rock band Eskimo Joe, Carus recruited old friend Jason McGann who had previously drummed for The John Butler Trio. In April 2004, Long Nights are Gone, the second album by Carus & the True Believers was recorded in one day in Fremantle with half the songs <b>written</b> and recorded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same day. Recorded in Carus's parents bedroom, Long Nights Are Gone depicts the process of <b>writing</b> & recording <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fly.</b> In 2006, Long Nights Are Gone was edited for the German market, combined with the EP The Breakdown and repackaged. In Australia, the album managed to further boost the prominence of the band with the single, [...] "Ain't no Crime" [...] taking out the number 1 spot on Triple J's Net 50. With another lineup change, after Long Nights Are Gone, Andy Fry replaced Noel Manyam on bass. Andy Fry also played Bass for The John Butler Trio.|$|R
