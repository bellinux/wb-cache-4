5|$|In 1878, the Bannock {{people and}} {{northern}} Shoshone tribes {{participated in the}} Bannock War, a war against <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> in the region over the destruction of camas root — {{a major source of}} food for the natives — by white settlers' hogs. The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict, and once the <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> had won the war, the natives were allotted into various reservations. The Northern Paiute were sent to the Yakama Indian Reservation, and in later years have been dispersed throughout several reservations in the western United States.|$|E

5|$|In the 1850s, European-Americans {{settled in}} the area that is now Omak and built houses and inaugurated mining, logging and {{agricultural}} activities. As more <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> arrived, a dispute about land ownership arose between them and the Native Americans.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota's early economy {{relied heavily}} on the soil, {{minerals}} and ecology of the area, as {{nearly all of the}} earliest <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> in the area were farmers, miners, or trappers. Although other economic sectors have risen in prominence in recent years, early dependence on the land laid the foundation for the future economic activity of the state.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo Bay {{massacre}} or Elliston massacre {{refers to}} a fatal clash between settlers and Aboriginal Australians in late May 1849 on the cliffs of Waterloo Bay near Elliston, South Australia {{which led to the}} deaths of a number of Aboriginal people, and forms part of the Australian frontier wars. The events leading up to the fatal clash included killings of three <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> by Aboriginal people, and the killing of one Aboriginal person and the death by poisoning of five others by <b>white</b> <b>settlers.</b> The limited archival records indicate that three Aboriginal people were killed or died of wounds from the clash, and five were captured, however, accounts of the killing of up to 260 Aboriginal people at the cliffs have persistently circulated since at least 1880.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} {{uninhabited}} by Europeans until after World War II, when a severe drought caused white Afrikaans speaking farmers (Boers) to move in. The farm was later procured by the apartheid government {{as part of}} the Odendaal Plan and became part of the Damaraland bantustan. The <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> left in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The attacks {{followed}} {{an increase in}} tension after the Hall sisters were released at Fort Blue Mounds on June 1. The sisters had been kidnapped during the Indian Creek massacre in May and were brought to Blue Mounds by a party of Ho-Chunk. Militia leader Henry Dodge became suspicious of the Ho-Chunk and took them prisoner, though they were later released as tension between the Ho-Chunk and <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> increased. The attacks also lent credence {{to the belief that}} more Ho-Chunk were set to join Black Hawk's war against <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> in Illinois and Michigan Territory. Though other attacks on the fort were expected they never happened and Fort Blue Mounds served as a supply center for the remaining days of the war.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1860s a deep rift had {{developed}} between Irataba, who was proactive in cooperating with <b>white</b> <b>settlers,</b> and Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated {{but did not}} approve of white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was Aha macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him {{as leader of the}} Fort Mohave group.|$|E

5|$|From {{fewer than}} 6,120 <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> in 1850, Minnesota's {{official}} population grew to over 1.7million by 1900. Each {{of the next}} six decades saw a 15 percent increase in population, reaching 3.4million in 1960. Growth then slowed, rising 11 percent to 3.8million in 1970, and an average of 9 {{percent over the next}} three decades to 4.9million in the 2000 Census.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{presence}} of <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government {{to establish the}} Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government. In the process, railroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase.|$|E
5|$|Rising anxiety {{levels in}} the <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> caused Captain James W. Stephenson to gather 12 volunteers and move toward {{the area of the}} {{disturbances}} from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at Apple River Fort and then traveled eastward. Stephenson and his men rose before dawn on June 18 and started following the trail of the band of Sauk who had stolen the horses. The militia marched through pounding rain before they finally caught up with the Sauk.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bad Axe, {{also known}} as the Bad Axe Massacre, was a battle between Sauk (Sac) and Fox Indians and United States Army regulars and militia {{occurred}} 1–2 August 1832.

It marked {{the end of the war}} between <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> and militia in Illinois and Michigan Territory, and the Sauk and Fox tribes under warrior Black Hawk.|$|E
5|$|The Black Hawk War {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} 77 <b>white</b> <b>settlers,</b> militiamen, and regular soldiers. This figure does not include the deaths from cholera suffered by the relief force under General Winfield Scott. Estimates of how many members of the British Band died during the conflict range from about 450 to 600, or about half of the 1,100 people who entered Illinois with Black Hawk in 1832.|$|E
5|$|After {{the arrival}} of <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against the settlers, {{including}} the unsanctioned slaughter of their livestock. As a result, the settlers engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were swiftly defeated, and the survivors agreed to never return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill with mud, leaving it shallow and hard to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents.|$|E

5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the <b>white</b> <b>settlers.</b> He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{war started}} they made {{numerous}} improvements to the parcel of land. On June 14, 1832 five men were attacked by a Kickapoo war party, three whites were killed instantly, including Spafford. In total at least one Native and four <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> {{were killed in the}} action. Two men managed to escape. One mistakenly feared for days that Fort Hamilton had been captured, before finally seeking refuge there. The incident at Spafford Farm eventually led to the Battle of Horseshoe Bend (also known as the Battle of Pecatonica).|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, <b>white</b> <b>settlers</b> killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E
