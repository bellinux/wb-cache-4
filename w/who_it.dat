PepsiCo was accused of behaving in an imperious manner towards franchisees, <b>who</b> <b>it</b> believed were holding back the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners.|$|E

5|$|Written by David Fisher, {{this story}} was {{discussed}} with Script Editor Douglas Adams in late 1979, shortly before Adams left Doctor <b>Who.</b> <b>It</b> would have featured the Doctor battling the Nephilim, creatures who travel through time in sleeping units that look like sarcophagi.

5|$|Henry went to {{convoluted}} legal {{means to}} justify his succession. Many Lancastrians asserted {{that his mother had}} had legitimate rights through her descent from Edmund Crouchback, <b>who</b> <b>it</b> was claimed was the elder son of Henry III of England, set aside due to deformity. As the great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, was the heir presumptive to Richard II and Henry used multiple rationales stressing his Plantagenet descent, divine grace, powerful friends, and Richard's misgovernment. In fact Mortimer never showed interest in the throne. The later marriage of his sister Anne to Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge consolidated this claim to the throne with that of the more junior House of York. Henry planned to resume war with France, but was plagued with financial problems, declining health and frequent rebellions. He defeated a Scottish invasion, a serious rebellion by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland in the North and Owain Glyndŵr's rebellion in Wales. Many saw it as a punishment from God when Henry was later struck down with unknown but chronic illnesses.|$|E

5|$|In 1021/22, however, Xiphias, now {{posted at}} Caesarea as strategos of the Anatolic Theme, fell out with Basil II {{because he was}} not allowed to {{accompany}} the Emperor on his campaign against the Kingdom of Georgia. Xiphias allied himself against the Emperor with the magnate Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos, whose father had risen in revolt {{in the early years of}} Basil II's reign. The two men planned to kill Basil, and that one of them should take his place; <b>who</b> <b>it</b> would be remained undecided, but it was mainly Phokas' name and followers that lent the conspiracy weight. The conspiracy was apparently also known and supported by King George I of Georgia, who thus hoped to force Basil to abandon his invasion. When the emperor learned of the plot, however, he did not turn back, but instead sent letters to the two rebel leaders separately, aiming to sow distrust between them. Basil's ploy bore fruit very soon, for on 15 August 1022, Xiphias assassinated Phokas. The latter's supporters dispersed, and the nascent rebellion collapsed. Xiphias was then forced to surrender to the Emperor's envoy, Theophylact Dalassenos, who became the new strategos of the Anatolics.|$|E

5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., <b>who,</b> <b>it</b> will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

5|$|Several {{causes for}} the decline and sudden {{disappearance}} of the hoopoe starling have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on Réunion, <b>who</b> <b>it</b> survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that {{the introduction of the}} common myna (Acridotheres tristis) led to competition between these two starling species. The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself. However, the hoopoe starling coexisted with the myna for nearly 100years and they may not have shared habitat. The black rat (Rattus rattus) arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe starling, the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the Réunion slit-eared skink (Gongylomorphus borbonicus) became extinct due to predation by the introduced wolf snake (Lycodon aulicum), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.|$|E

5|$|The central {{conflict}} in many Final Fantasy games {{focuses on a}} group of characters battling an evil, and sometimes ancient, antagonist that dominates the game's world. Stories frequently involve a sovereign state in rebellion, with the protagonists taking part in the rebellion. The heroes are often destined to defeat the evil, and occasionally gather {{as a direct result of}} the antagonist's malicious actions. Another staple of the series is the existence of two villains; the main villain is not always <b>who</b> <b>it</b> appears to be, as the primary antagonist may actually be subservient to another character or entity. The main antagonist introduced at the beginning of the game is not always the final enemy, and the characters must continue their quest beyond what appears to be the final fight.|$|E

As they {{pull up to the}} front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her to try to convince them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices <b>who</b> <b>it</b> is, Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E
