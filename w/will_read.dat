5|$|Some Augustan historians {{argue that}} {{indications}} pointed toward his sister's son Marcellus, {{who had been}} quickly married to Augustus' daughter Julia the Elder. Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' <b>will</b> <b>read</b> aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23BC, instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably {{the only one of}} his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.|$|E
5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model <b>will</b> <b>read</b> 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they <b>will</b> <b>read</b> according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} other {{professional}} scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by peer review (in which other scientists, {{chosen by the}} editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, <b>will</b> <b>read</b> and critique articles), before publication. In the case of Nature, they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.|$|E
25|$|Cephalus, his father, was {{a native}} of Syracuse, and on the {{invitation}} of Pericles had settled at Athens. The opening scene of Plato's Republic is set at the house of his eldest son, Polemarchus, in Piraeus. The tone of the picture warrants the inference that the Sicilian family were well known to Plato, and that their houses must often have been hospitable to such gatherings. Further, Plato's Phaedrus opens with Phaedrus coming from conversation with Lysias at the house of Epicrates of Athens: he meets Socrates, with whom he <b>will</b> <b>read</b> and discuss the speech of Lysias he heard.|$|E
25|$|Since reviewers are {{normally}} selected from {{experts in the}} fields discussed in the article, the process of peer review helps to keep some invalid or unsubstantiated claims out {{of the body of}} published research and knowledge. Scholars <b>will</b> <b>read</b> published articles outside their limited area of detailed expertise, and then rely, to some degree, on the peer-review process to have provided reliable and credible research that they can build upon for subsequent or related research. Significant scandal ensues when an author is found to have falsified the research included in an article, as other scholars, and the field of study itself, may have relied upon the invalid research.|$|E
