50|$|Hooper built six {{or seven}} more of these bodies on DE36 chassis. These {{differed}} from the show car in small details, usually in the positioning of the headlights and side lights and in details regarding the <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b> Some of the <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> were louvered diagonally. Four examples of the type, including the show car, were known to exist in 2010.|$|R

5000|$|SS.19A : The SS.19 {{was later}} fitted with two <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> {{and a single}} spatted tailwheel.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} simplify maintenance, the <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> and landing gear {{fairings}} were deleted {{in the production}} examples ...|$|R
50|$|In 1962 the Beagle A.61 Terrier 2 was {{introduced}} {{with a greater}} span tailplane, <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> and a metal propeller.|$|R
50|$|A two-seat variant was {{developed}} {{with a second}} open cockpit {{in tandem with the}} pilot's and with a Townend ring and <b>wheel</b> <b>spats,</b> but this didn't sell either.|$|R
25|$|Almost all A5Ms had open cockpits. A closed cockpit {{was tried}} but found little favor among Navy aviators. All had fixed, non-retractable undercarriage. <b>Wheel</b> <b>spats</b> were {{a feature of}} {{standard}} fighters but not training aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|DF 2000 Plus: 75kW (100hp) Rotax 912 ULS engine, {{composite}} 3-bladed propeller with ground-adjustable pitch. Electrical {{elevator trim}} control and flap actuation, flap hinge fairing, partial cabin ventilation and additional instrumentation. [...] <b>Wheel</b> <b>spats</b> and landing light.|$|R
50|$|The {{single seat}} cockpit {{is covered with}} a {{windscreen}} and a separate, prominent, single piece blown bubble canopy. The Pegasus has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with oleo-pneumatic shock absorbers within faired legs carrying the main wheels within long <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite this setback, the Air Ministry {{ordered a}} second Long-range Monoplane (K1991) in July 1930, this flying on 30 June 1931. While {{similar to the}} first aircraft, it {{had a number of}} differences, {{including}} the addition of an autopilot and <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Aero Boero AB-115 is an Argentine civil utility aircraft. It was {{developed}} from the AB-95-115, a refined AB-95 with a more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics. Specific differences included <b>wheel</b> <b>spats,</b> a redesigned engine cowling molded of fiberglass, and aluminum ailerons and flaps.|$|R
50|$|Design {{elements}} {{carried over}} from the Green Goddess included the flush rear <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> on spring-balanced rods and the headlights and pass lights faired into the front wings behind Perspex covers. The bezels holding the headlight covers were plain, and were not fluted as on the Green Goddess.|$|R
50|$|The new gearbox {{will be part}} of a {{long term}} project to restore the car to its 1925 specification. This would also require the {{fabrication}} of two full length exhaust pipes, a new seat and upholstery, and the re-manufacture of a slightly dropped nose cone and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b>|$|R

50|$|Efforts to {{increase}} the DA40's cruising speed centered on the propeller and <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b> The <b>wheel</b> fairing streamlining was improved, a three-blade scimitar-type constant speed propeller was incorporated and the Powerflow exhaust system from the XL was retained. The canopy contour was also revised, with the sides being more vertical before curving into the roof, which provides more shoulder and head room.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} had {{a unique}} front grille and hood {{that was only}} used on the SVO line, thinner side moldings, smoother sail panels behind the rear quarter windows, small rear <b>wheel</b> <b>spats,</b> and a biplane spoiler that was also unique to the SVO. The pinstriped taillights introduced on the SVO were later used on the 1993 Cobra model, as well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} tubing, with its double-surface Raven wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its 11.0 m span wing {{is supported by a}} single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. The carriage features a cockpit fairing with a windshield and <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b> Hydraulic brakes are standard equipment. The standard engine is the four-cylinder, four-stroke [...] Rotax 912UL.|$|R
25|$|The G.4/31 {{was a large}} angular biplane with fixed <b>spatted</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> {{powered by}} a 690hp (515kW) Bristol Pegasus IM3 with a Townend ring. There was a single forward-firing machine gun for the pilot and a Scarff ring mounted Lewis gun for the observer. Underwing bomb racks on the lower wings and {{provision}} to carry a torpedo between the main undercarriage units was also envisioned.|$|R
2500|$|The final variant was the MS.345 which {{appeared}} in 1935. It had dihedral on the wings and a taller fin and rudder. The shock absorber mounting was simplified, with the four struts per side replaced with a Y-shaped strut between wing and undercarriage leg. [...] The leg struts were now faired together and the <b>wheels</b> <b>spatted.</b> It was powered by a 100kW (140hp) Renault 4Pei engine.|$|R

25|$|At {{the start}} of Operation Barbarossa, the single Gruppe of the Luftwaffe that was {{dedicated}} to ground support was II.(Schl)/LG 2, operating 22 Hs 123s (along with 38 Bf 109Es). In service use on the Eastern Front, the remaining aircraft had been field-modified with the main <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> removed, additional armour and extra equipment fitted as well as mounting extra machine guns and even cannons in under-wing housings.|$|R
50|$|The Monocoupe 110 Special {{variant of}} 1931 {{was built to}} meet the needs of racing pilots. The {{wingspan}} was shortened from the standard 32 ft to 23 ft, a 125 h.p. Warner Scarab was installed and fairings and <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> added. Maximum speed increased from 150 mph to 220 mph. Seven of the Specials were built by Monocoupe and three further aircraft were modified to a similar standard by homebuilders.|$|R
50|$|The Pottier P.50 Bouvreuil ("Bullfinch") was a single-seat, {{single-engine}} racing aircraft {{developed in}} France {{in the late}} 1970s and marketed for homebuilding. It was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with an enclosed cockpit. The undercarriage was of tailwheel configuration, and the P.50 was designed from the outset to offer the builder the alternative of fixed or retractable main units. Construction throughout was of wood, except for the engine cowling and main <b>wheel</b> <b>spats,</b> which were fibreglass mouldings.|$|R
50|$|The 90 {{continued}} in production renamed 90 MK II {{with a new}} chassis and independent front suspension. The headlamps were raised by three inches to meet American regulations and the front driving lamps were replaced {{with a pair of}} small air intake grilles. The 90 MK II also had an enlarged OHV engine with 2267 cc. The MK IIA arrived in 1952, the main update on this model was the removal of the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For 1934, Nash {{introduced}} {{completely new}} styling, called [...] "Speedstream", featuring generous use of ornamental moldings in body panels and fenders, {{in a very}} streamlined and Art Deco way. The designs were influenced by Russian Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky and the new bodies featured streamline accents, bullet-shaped headlights, horizontal hood ribs, rear <b>wheel</b> <b>spats,</b> and built-in luggage boots with a full beaver-tail rear end. The Ambassador Eight series for this year was limited to various four-door sedan body styles.|$|R
5000|$|Quite {{unlike other}} Aeronca designs, the Model L was a [...] "cantilever" [...] (no {{external}} struts for bracing) low-wing monoplane, that featured side-by-side seating {{in a completely}} enclosed cabin. The design reflected the greater attention being paid to aerodynamics in the period, including large <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> for the fixed undercarriage and a Townend ring for the engine. The aircraft was of mixed-construction with a welded steel fuselage and wings with spruce spars and ribs, all covered with fabric.|$|R
50|$|Ignoring prototypes, 1,182 Go 145s {{were built}} in Germany for Luftwaffe service. An unknown number of license-produced Go 145s were also built. Further {{development}} of the aircraft was done. The Gotha Go 145B was fitted with an enclosed cockpit and <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> (an aerodynamic <b>wheel</b> housing on fixed-gear). The Go 145C was developed for gunnery training and was fitted with a single 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine gun in the rear cockpit, requiring removal of that cockpit's flight controls.|$|R
50|$|The B-34 was an {{all-metal}} single-bay biplane {{of conventional}} configuration, with tailwheel undercarriage. The mainwheels of the prototype were fitted with large spats. The first prototype underwent testing from 2 February 1932, {{leading to a}} large number of modifications being made, in particular the tail and engine cowling designs were considerably revised. The resulting B-34.1 served as the prototype for the 12 production machines ordered by the Czechoslovakian Air Force. These had an even larger vertical tail, interplane struts of narrower chord, and no <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The A-22's {{structure}} is almost completely all-metal {{with only the}} engine cowling, wing fillets and <b>wheel</b> <b>spats</b> being made of composites. The wings and control surfaces are fabric covered. The aircraft has excellent visibility, due to {{the large amount of}} glazing, including convex doors, that allow the occupants to look straight down. The A-22 uses a 3-axis control system, giving the pilot full control over the aircraft. The A-22 uses flaperons in place of ailerons and flaps, giving a stall speed of [...] with the flaperons fully down.|$|R
50|$|The V.4 had widely spaced main {{landing gear}} with {{streamlined}} <b>wheel</b> <b>spats.</b> It was moved to Istres in December 1933 to try and achieve a French Air Ministry prize for a French aircraft to beat the world speed record before January 1934. It was due to make an attempt to fly on 27 December 1933 but strong winds kept the aircraft grounded. Further attempts in February 1934 to fly were thwarted by engine problems and lack of government finance. The project was abandoned without the aircraft have flown.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rear}} the fin was almost triangular, and built as an {{integral}} part of the fuselage. The fabric covered rudder was rounded, and moved between the separate elevators, which with the tail plane formed an elliptical shape. As a result, the elevator hinges, like those of the ailerons were strongly forward swept. The tailplane was supported from the fin near the rudder post with a pair of external struts. There was a long tailskid. The main undercarriage had two cantilever forks with rubber-in-compression springing, its legs faired and the <b>wheels</b> <b>spatted.</b>|$|R
