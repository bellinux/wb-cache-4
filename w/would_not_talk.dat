[...] and that [...] "Today's {{violence}} is again an indication of a criminal regime that has lost any common sense. When the regime tries to counter a peaceful demonstration by using thugs... there are few words that do justice to this villainy and I think it can only hasten that regime's departure." [...] A coalition of opposition parties agreed to hold talks with the newly formed government. However, ElBaradei and the Muslim Brotherhood stressed they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to any government representative, including Vice President Omar Suleiman, until Mubarak's resignation.|$|E
500|$|A {{few members}} of Cho's family, those who {{remained}} in South Korea, had concerns about his behavior during his early childhood. Cho's relatives {{thought that he was}} selectively mute or mentally ill. According to Cho's uncle, Cho [...] "didn't say much and did not mix with other children." [...] Cho's maternal great-aunt described Cho as [...] "cold" [...] and a cause of family concern from as young as eight years old. According to his great-aunt, who met him twice, Cho was extremely shy and [...] "just <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> at all." [...] He was otherwise considered [...] "well-behaved," [...] readily obeying verbal commands and cues. The great-aunt said she knew something was wrong after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister but little news about Cho. During an ABC News Nightline interview on August 30, 2007, Cho's grandfather reported his concerns about Cho's behavior during childhood. According to Cho's grandfather, Cho never looked up to him to make eye contact, never called him grandfather, and never moved to embrace him.|$|E

2500|$|... "Old Scouts" [...] Robert E. Strahorn, Captain Jack Crawford and Col. Buffalo Bill Cody {{shaped the}} popular {{vision of the}} American West through their images and narratives. At The Wigwam, the home of their friend Major Israel McCreight ("Cante Tanke") [...] in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, they could relax, smoke {{and talk about the}} Old West. While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877, in later years they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> of it. All {{expressed}} remorse.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{and during}} each start, Halladay had a {{distinct}} trademark {{in which he}} went into a complete [...] "isolation mode", immersing himself in complete concentration and in more or less his own words: To plan every pitch he would pitch while on the mound. During this time, he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to anyone except the manager or the pitching coach. He would not even reply to a [...] "hello" [...] or wave from a teammate or spectator, nor talk to the media until he had been relieved or had completed the game.|$|E
2500|$|While the Old Scouts found adventure, {{glory and}} fame in the Sioux War, {{in later years}} they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> of it. Captain Jack and Strahorn were with General George Crook at the Battle of Slim Buttes and {{expressed}} remorse. [...] Crawford declined to give any details of his observations at Slim Buttes. [...] He said {{it was something he}} neither wanted to discuss or hear of; he said it hurt him even to have to think about it. Captain Jack said he had taken [...] "one top-knot" [...] at the Battle of Slim Buttes during a fight in which he [...] "came near losing" [...] his own hair. He later regretted his bloody deed and never spoke of it in his public performances ...|$|E

2500|$|Crosby pursued Polly, and in May 1921, {{when she}} would not respond to his ardor, Crosby {{threatened}} suicide if Polly did not marry him. Polly's husband {{was in and out}} of sanitariums several times, fighting alcoholism. Crosby pestered Polly to tell her husband of their affair and to divorce him. In May, she revealed her adultery to Dick and suggested a separation, and he offered no resistance. Polly's mother insisted that she stop seeing Crosby for six months to avoid complete rejection by her society peers, a condition she agreed to, and she left Boston for New York. Divorce was [...] "unheard of...even among Boston Episcopalians." [...] Peabody's parents were outraged that she would ask for a divorce and at her affair with Crosby. Dick's father Jacob Peabody even visited Harry's father, Stephen Crosby, on January 4, 1922 to discuss the situation, but Harry's father <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> to him; despite his disapproval of Harry's irregular behavior, he loved his son. Stephen Crosby at first attempted to dissuade Harry from marrying Polly, and even bought him the Stutz he'd been asking for, but Harry would not be persuaded to change his mind. For her part, Polly's former friends pilloried her as an adulteress, leaving Polly stunned by the quick turn-about in their attitude towards her. Polly later described Harry's character as: [...] "He seemed to be more expression and mood, than man," [...] she wrote, [...] "yet he was the most vivid personality I've ever known, electric with rebellion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Max Tackett, a 33-year-old Arkansas State Police officer rookie at the time, {{realized}} that a car had been stolen on the nights of the murders, and a previously stolen car was found abandoned. On Friday, June 28, 1946, Tackett found a car that had been reported stolen in a parking lot. He staked out the car until someone came back to it. He arrested a 21-year-old woman. She said she had just married her husband in Shreveport, but he was currently in Atlanta, Texas trying to sell another stolen car. Homer Carter, chief of police in Atlanta, told Tackett that a man had tried selling a stolen car {{to one of his}} citizens. Tackett asked the citizen if he would recognize the suspect, but the man said that he would not. Tackett noticed that the citizen had a distinct look, which included a cowboy hat and boots. Tackett told the citizen, [...] "You wouldn't recognize him, but he would recognize you." [...] Max then asked the citizen if {{he would be willing to}} walk with him into several public places. Tackett had the idea that the suspect would not want to see the citizen and would try to avoid him. On a Saturday in July, Tackett walked into the Arkansas Motor Coach bus station on Front Street, near Union Station, with the citizen. Tackett saw a man run out the back of the building. He chased after him and caught him on the fire escape. The man, Youell Swinney, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk,</b> but his wife Peggy confessed in great detail that he was the Phantom Killer and that he killed Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Austin let it go. If they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about Cayman, she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about Betty, but she listened. After all, she {{had given}} them a lead.|$|E
6000|$|... "No one can help," [...] he {{told her}} grimly. [...] "It is all {{finished}} and done with. I <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> any more about it. I didn't come {{here to talk about}} it. I came to see you. So this is where you live!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Phillotson, {{with sudden}} testiness. [...] "I <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> of this, but--I am {{convinced}} I did only what was right, and just, and moral. I have suffered for my act and opinions, but I hold to them; though her loss was {{a loss to}} me {{in more ways than}} one!" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{first she}} was too weak and too happy to notice that Gilbert and the nurse looked grave and Marilla sorrowful. Then, as subtly, and coldly, and remorselessly as a sea-fog {{stealing}} landward, fear crept into her heart. Why was not Gilbert gladder? Why <b>would</b> he <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about the baby? Why <b>would</b> they <b>not</b> let her have it with her after that first heavenly--happy hour? Was--was there anything wrong? ...|$|R

6000|$|What {{on earth}} could all this mean? It {{could not be}} that his {{grandfather}} {{knew that he was}} in love with Miss Staveley; and had this been known his grandfather <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>talked</b> of Harriet Tristram. [...] "Oh yes; of course a fellow should marry well. I don't think much of marrying for money." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Caroline Spalding had {{a spirit}} of her own, and had already {{made up her mind}} that she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>talked</b> down by Miss Petrie. [...] "Uncle Jonas," [...] said she, [...] "asks him because we like him; and would do so too if he kept the store in Broadway. But if he did keep the store perhaps we should not like him." ...|$|R
5000|$|The United Nations has {{expressed}} concern about the fairness of the election and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed [...] "grave concern" [...] that Aung San Suu Kyi <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be released before the election and thus it would [...] "lack credibility." [...] He accused the government of being [...] "slow and incomplete" [...] to meet political commitments, and said it was [...] "deeply frustrating" [...] that the government <b>would</b> <b>not</b> hold <b>talks</b> with the [...] "international community." ...|$|R

60|$|Then {{they sat}} down, {{and for some}} time they were too tired even to notice anything; but by-and-by they saw that under the tiles of the roof a number of {{swallows}} were sitting, chattering merrily to each other. Of course the swallows {{had no idea that}} the children understood their language, or they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>talked</b> so freely; but, as it was, they said whatever came into their heads.|$|R
60|$|Neigh's {{footsteps}} approached, and {{the well-known}} figure entered. Ethelberta received him smilingly, {{for she was}} getting so used to awkward juxtapositions that she treated them quite as a natural situation. She merely hoped that Ladywell <b>would</b> <b>not</b> hear them <b>talking</b> through the partition.|$|R
50|$|During the interview, {{the police}} officer {{revealed}} details of the crime that implicated Sinclair. Some of those details were false. Sinclair responded by saying {{he had nothing to}} say and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>talking,</b> and that he wanted to talk to his lawyer about what the officer was saying. The officer replied by again repeating that it was Sinclair's choice whether he wanted to speak or not. This happened four or five times during the interview.|$|R
