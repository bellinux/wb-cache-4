5|$|In 2016, {{due to a}} {{mounting}} debt {{in funding}} of the athletic program, the university polled its students {{on whether or not}} they <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the students <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, Charles Cornwallis {{arrived at}} Petersburg with 1,500 men after {{suffering}} heavy casualties at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. He immediately assumed command, as Phillips had recently {{died of a}} fever. Cornwallis had not received permission to abandon the Carolinas from his superior, Henry Clinton, but he believed that Virginia {{would be easier to}} capture, feeling that it <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> of an invading British army.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} with ESRO {{was approved by}} the Parliament of Norway on 9 July 1965 and the final contract was signed on 13 August. It included clauses that secured non-members access to use the station if there was sufficient capacity, that Norwegian authorities were granted all necessary information about the installation's use, and that NTNF <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> all auxiliary installations.|$|E

5|$|Labor's leader, Don Dunstan, also {{introduced}} a bill for reform of the Legislative Council, which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage. Hall himself stated he <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the Legislative Council could only be abolished through a referendum. Dunstan agreed, but Hall's own party split on the issue. The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E
5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, {{and the track}} only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a bankruptcy court judge refused to approve the plan. Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur. In early June 2010, Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the extension of}} I-70; however, the route still had {{to be approved by}} the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners {{approved the}} extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.|$|E

5|$|The 1975–76 {{season was}} Orr's final {{season with the}} Bruins and it was tumultuous. Orr's {{contract}} was ending after the season, potentially making him a free agent. The Bruins were sold by Storer Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr {{as a condition of}} the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as to whether it would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> it.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body {{with representatives of the}} District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> bond referenda to finance the system. Because the least expensive way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, the Russian {{government}} outlined that it {{planned to}} purchase 164 aircraft by 2018. The Ukrainian government in October 2000 {{estimated that the}} country had a requirement for 65 aircraft. By then, the Russian government had awarded the Polyot plant, which was based in Omsk, the right to produce the aircraft, ahead of Aviakor and Aviastar of Samara and Ulyanovsk, respectively. The Kiev Aircraft Production Plant was expected to produce the first aircraft in 2003, and Polyot, in 2004. As the An-70 flight test programme had reached its final stages {{by the end of}} 2000, it was expected that the Russian and Ukraine Defence Ministries <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> of mass production at the start of 2001. On 27 January 2001, however, the second An-70 prototype made a crash landing on its belly after losing power in two engines on take-off during cold weather testing in Omsk, and was severely damaged. Four of the 33 people onboard were injured. It looked as though the A400M was now going to have the market all to itself. Antonov recovered the crashed aircraft and repaired it, but the project still lacked funding.|$|E

5|$|Other slip ramps {{were planned}} in the Philadelphia area at PA 29 near the Great Valley Corporate Center and at PA 252 in Valley Forge in the 1990s. Residents opposed the PA 29 (exit 320) ramp, fearing it would spoil the rural area. In 1999, the turnpike {{commission}} canceled {{plans to build}} a slip ramp at PA 252 and instead focused on building one at PA 29. The turnpike commission approved funding for the PA 29 ramp in 2002. The project was put on hold in 2009 because of engineering and design problems in widening the adjacent portion of the turnpike. It was announced that the turnpike commission <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> construction of the slip ramp at PA 29 in August 2010, and construction began in March 2011. The interchange, which has access to and from both directions of the tollway, opened on December 11, 2012; Governor Tom Corbett cut the ribbon.|$|E

But no construction began. By November 1933, the Works Progress Administration WPA was ready to pay the state and county to employ out-of-work, unskilled laborers on construction projects. To {{take advantage of the}} offer, Arlington County officials began work to fix the route for the approach to Arlington Memorial Bridge. A joint CFA/NCPC group studied the Lee Highway and other approaches to the bridge on November 15, and on December 4 the CFA said it <b>would</b> <b>approve</b> any approach that Virginia and Arlington County did.|$|E
