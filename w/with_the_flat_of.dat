25|$|Of course, the {{inevitable}} happens. Just {{as in the}} Middle English Breton lai Sir Degare, Sir Degarébel marries his mother. Following recognition of the device on his shield, however, mother and son are quickly made aware of each other’s true identity and another tournament is swiftly arranged. By chance, Sir Eglamour is passing and resolves {{to take part in}} this tournament. Father and son fight together, each unaware of the other’s identity, but Sir Eglamour knocks Sir Degarébel from his horse <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> his sword, wins Christabel in marriage, the device on Sir Eglamour's shield gives away his identity and the romance concludes with recognition, celebration and reunion.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent and}} the {{intensity}} of the movement took viceregal authorities by surprise. San Miguel and Celaya were captured with little resistance. On 21 September 1810, Hidalgo was proclaimed general and supreme commander after arriving to Celaya. At this point, Hidalgo's army numbered about 5,000. However, {{because of the lack of}} military discipline, the insurgents soon fell into robbing, looting and ransacking the towns they were capturing. They began to execute prisoners as well. This caused friction between Allende and Hidalgo as early as the capture of San Miguel in late September 1810. When a mob ran through this town, Allende tried to break up the violence by striking at the insurgents <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> his sword. This brought a rebuke from Hidalgo, accusing Allende of mistreating the people.|$|E
25|$|Anawrahta was {{ruthless}} {{and stern}} not {{to any particular}} ethnic group but to all his subjects, for he felt that harsh measures were needed in building up a new nation. He never accepted {{the cult of the}} god-king, and he was impatient even with gods that his people worshipped; men came to say that he beat up gods <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> his lance. He achieved his aims but only at the price of his own popularity. His subjects admired and feared him, but did not love him. His execution of two young heroes for a trifling breach of discipline after the conclusion of his Nanzhao campaign angered people, and to appease them he declared that the two dead heroes were now gods who could be worshipped. His forcing of Kyansittha to become fugitive increased his popularity although this action at least was justified for the great paladin, like the Lancelot of the Round Table, was in love with one of his queens.|$|E

500|$|Tone clusters...on {{the piano}} [...] whole scales of tones used as chords, {{or at least}} three {{contiguous}} tones along a scale {{being used as a}} chord. And, at times, if these chords exceed the number of tones that you have fingers on your hand, {{it may be necessary to}} play these either <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> the hand or sometimes with the full forearm. This is not done from the standpoint of trying to devise a new piano technique, although it actually amounts to that, but rather because this is the only practicable method of playing such large chords. It should be obvious that these chords are exact and that one practices diligently in order to play them with the desired tone quality and to have them absolutely precise in nature.|$|E
500|$|Moustache {{is said to}} {{have left}} the cuirassiers after he was struck by a cavalryman <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> his sword. [...] De Fivas says that he {{attached}} himself to a unit of dragoons which he followed to Spain, taking part in two campaigns with them during which he would walk ahead of their column and bark warnings whenever he heard a noise. [...] During a battle in the Sierra Morena mountain range in southern Spain Moustache is alleged to have led back to camp the horses of dragoons killed on the battlefield. [...] Shortly after this he {{is said to have}} been secretly taken by a Colonel who wished to own him. [...] After spending seventeen days in captivity the dog apparently escaped by an open window and joined with a gunboat crew. [...] Afterwards he participated in the Battle of Badajoz where he was struck by a cannonball and killed on 11 March 1812, at the age of twelve years.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E

2500|$|While the Hobbit leads had {{scenes in}} Hobbiton {{interiors}} and Rivendell exteriors in Kaitoke Park with new arrival Ian Holm, Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies filmed scenes involving the Rohirrim countryside. Mortensen broke his toe kicking an Orc helmet on camera, Bloom fell off {{his horse and}} broke a rib, and Rhys-Davies' scale double Brett Beattie dislocated his knee. They spent two days injured during the [...] "orc hunting" [...] sequence seen in the second film. Soon after, they spent a month of day shoots at Helm's Deep and another three months of night shoots handled by Mahaffie, in Dry Creek Quarry outside of Wellington, during which Mortensen's tooth was knocked out and Bernard Hill was hit on the ear <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> a sword.

2500|$|Other {{sources say}} that executions of apostates have been [...] "rare in Islamic history". While Al-Hallaj was officially {{executed}} for possessing a heretical document suggesting hajj pilgrimage was not required of a pure Muslim, it is thought {{he would have been}} spared execution except that the Caliph at the time Al-Muqtadir wished to discredit [...] "certain figures who had associated themselves" [...] with al-Hallaj. (Previously al-Hallaj had been punished for talking about being at one with God by being shaved, pilloried and beaten <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> <b>of</b> a sword. He was not executed because the Shafi'ite judge had ruled that his words were not [...] "proof of disbelief.") According to historian Bernard Lewis, in the [...] "early times" [...] of Islam, [...] "charges of apostasy were not unusual, and ... the terms `unbeliever` and `apostate` were commonly used in religious polemic ... in fact such accusations had little practical effect. The accused were for the most part unmolested, and some even held high offices in the Muslim state. As the rules and penalties of the Muslim law were systematized and more regularly enforced, charges of apostasy became rarer." [...] When action was taken against an alleged apostate, it was {{much more likely to be}} [...] "quarantine" [...] than execution, unless the innovation was [...] "extreme, persistent and aggressive".|$|E

When, as in some cases, the mob refused to listen to him, and continued their work, the dragoons belabored them heartily <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>flats</b> <b>of</b> their swords; and the surprise caused by seeing the British uniforms in their midst, and their ignorance of {{how many of the}} British had entered, did more even than the efforts of the dragoons to allay the tumult.
