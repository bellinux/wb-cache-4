With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of Slumdog Millionaire, Pinto signed up for two art house productions. In Woody Allen's comedy-drama You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010), she acted {{alongside}} Antonio Banderas, Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins, Anupam Kher and Naomi Watts. She played a [...] "mystery woman" [...] who draws {{the attention of the}} character played by Brolin. Premiering at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, the film received mixed reviews upon its release. Pinto then starred in Julian Schnabel's Miral (2010), based on a semi-biographical novel by Rula Jebreal, playing an orphaned Palestinian woman <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> refugee camp in Israel. Before the film's production began in the Palestinian territories, Pinto prepared for the role by visiting several refugee camps in the area. She stated that she could relate to her character's experiences because of her knowledge about her relatives' experiences during the partition of India in the 1940s. The film received largely negative reviews, and Pinto's performance divided critics: Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent wrote that [...] "Miral... is played very engagingly by Freida Pinto", while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that [...] " [...] looks uneasy and miscast".|$|E
500|$|West's {{breakthrough}} came a {{year later}} on October 23, 2002, when, while driving home from a California recording studio after working late, he fell {{asleep at the wheel}} and was involved in a near-fatal car crash. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to a hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, [...] "Through the Wire", expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West [...] "all the better artists have expressed what they were going through". West added that [...] "the album was my medicine", as working on the record distracted him from the pain. [...] "Through the Wire" [...] was first available on West's Get Well Soon... mixtape, released December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called The College Dropout, whose overall theme was to [...] "make your own decisions. Don't let society tell you, 'This is what you have to do.'" [...] The album saw West tear down the outdated idea that rappers had {{to be a part of}} the gang life to create rap music. West never gave into the stereotype of the street kid <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tough world where the only form of survival was to join the gang. He was none of that, nor did he ever try to be any of that. West became a rapper in his own right, without adapting his style, without changing his appearance, without making his music fit the mold that those in the rap industry expected.|$|E

2500|$|Juror 8 {{suggests}} a secret ballot, {{from which he}} will abstain and agrees to change his vote if the others unanimously vote [...] "guilty".

An angry Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy towards slum children. However, Juror 9 reveals {{it was he who}} changed his vote, agreeing there should be some discussion. Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the verbal threat that one witness claimed to have heard the boy tell his father: [...] "I'm going to kill you", as well as arguing that this phrase often is used by people who do not mean it literally. Juror 5 changes his vote. Juror 11 also changes his vote, believing the boy would not likely have tried to retrieve the murder weapon from the scene if it had been cleaned of fingerprints.|$|E
2500|$|Most Japanese musicians {{felt that}} they could not sing rock in Japanese, so the {{popularity}} of Japanese rock gradually declined. As a result, there were debates such as [...] "Should we sing rock music in Japanese?" [...] and [...] "Should we sing in English?" [...] between Happy End and Yuya Uchida about Japanese rock music. This confrontation was called [...] Happy End proved that rock music could be sung in Japanese, and one theory holds that their music became one of the origins of modern J-pop. The Beatles also inspired Eikichi Yazawa, who grew up in an underprivileged family, his father dying when he was a child.
