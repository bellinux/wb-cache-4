5|$|Entering {{the day of}} December 31, Stauskas led {{the nation}} in three point field goal percentage. This is {{somewhat}} confusing because various sources have various eligibility thresholds. ESPN reports leaders based on a 2 three point attempts per game minimum, while BigTen.org only requires a minimum of 1.5 attempts per game for eligibility. NCAA.org requires a minimum of 2.5 made per game, and Stauskas had been the leader since the December 9 <b>weekly</b> <b>report.</b> On January 16, Sporting News named Stauskas the surprise player {{of the first half of}} the year. As late as January 28 Stauskas was leading the Big Ten in free throw shooting percentage (.833) as well as three pointers made and was second in 3-point shooting percentage (.490). On that day, Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes. It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the Fab Five 1992–93 team did so on December 5, 1992. On January 31, Stauskas and Robinson were named to the Wayman Tisdale Award (USBWA National Freshman of the Year) top 12 midseason list, recognizing their performances as being among the 12 best freshman performances in the NCAA competition. Stauskas finished the 18-game 2012–13 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season schedule with a 37% three point-percentage on 30-for-81 shooting during conference play.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to a Mediterranean fruit fly (also known as “Medfly”) outbreak, officials from the Florida Department of Agriculture sprayed pesticides (primarily malathion) and bait over five counties during {{the spring and summer}} of 1998. [...] Scientists from the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences stated that malathion was being sprayed in a manner that did not pose a significant risk to public health. [...] During the eradication effort, the Florida Department of Health investigated 230 cases of illness that were attributed to the pesticide. [...] Officials from the Florida Department of Health and the SENSOR-Pesticides program published an article in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality <b>Weekly</b> <b>Report</b> (MMWR) that described these case reports and recommended alternative methods for Medfly control, including exclusion activities at ports of entry to prevent importation, more rapid detection through increased sentinel trapping densities, and the release of sterile male flies to interrupt the reproductive cycle. [...] The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) incorporated these suggestions into their 2001 Environmental Impact Statement on the Fruit Fly Cooperative Control Program. [...] These impact statements guide the USDA's development of insect control strategies and decisions.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Poe {{was unable}} to {{complete}} studies at the University of Virginia due to gambling debts. He left the university in March 1827 and the already-strained relationship with his foster father, John Allan, grew worse. Poe determined to go to Boston, where he was born. When Poe's biological mother Eliza Poe died, the only object she left him was a watercolor painting of the city, {{on the back of}} which she had written, [...] "For my little son Edgar, who should ever love Boston, the place of his birth, and where his mother found her best and most sympathetic friends." [...] John Allan, a merchant in Richmond, Virginia, refused to give his foster son the $12 for the trip, though it is likely Poe got the money from his foster mother Frances Allan. John Allan was not aware of Poe's decision or whereabouts and, not concerned, wrote [...] "I'm thinking Edgar has gone to Sea to seek his own fortunes". After arriving in Boston in April 1827, Poe served briefly as clerk for a wholesale merchandise warehouse on the waterfront, then as an office clerk and reporter for an obscure newspaper, the <b>Weekly</b> <b>Report.</b> After several weeks, in desperation, he enlisted in the United States Army for a five-year term under the pseudonym [...] "Edgar A. Perry"; he gave his age as 22, though he was only 18, likely because he would have needed parental consent if under 21. He was assigned to the First Regiment of Artillery and stationed at Boston Harbor's Fort Independence.|$|E

[...] The report claimed that no children with dangerously high blood lead levels were found, {{even in the}} homes with the worst lead levels. Officials in other cities, such as New York City and Seattle, cited the report as justification for a less-than-aggressive response to high lead levels in their own water.

2500|$|Various fairly {{standardized}} {{abbreviations for}} vaccine names have developed, although the standardization {{is by no}} means centralized or global. For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible, is available at a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page. The page explains that [...] "The abbreviations [...] this table (Column 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ACIP Work Groups, the editor of the Morbidity and Mortality <b>Weekly</b> <b>Report</b> (MMWR), the editor of Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP." [...] Some examples are [...] "DTaP" [...] for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, [...] "DT" [...] for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and [...] "Td" [...] for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. At its page on tetanus vaccination, the CDC further explains that [...] "Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism." [...] Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC's page called [...] "Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations", with abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records. The United States Adopted Name system has some conventions for the word order of vaccine names, placing head nouns first and adjectives postpositively. This is why the USAN for [...] "OPV" [...] is [...] "poliovirus vaccine live oral" [...] rather than [...] "oral poliovirus vaccine".|$|E
