2500|$|The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission {{states that}} it [...] "assumed" [...] melted fuel rods in unit 2 have {{released}} radioactive substances into the coolant water, which subsequently leaked out through an unknown route to the unit 2 turbine building basement. To {{reduce the amount of}} leaking water, TEPCO reduced the amount of water pumped into the unit 2 reactor, from 16 tons per hour to 7 tons per hour, which could lead to higher reactor temperatures. The highly radioactive water halts work on restoring the cooling pumps and other powered systems to reactors 1–4. TEPCO confirms finding low levels of plutonium in five samples during 21 and 22 March. Enriched levels of Plutonium-238, relative to Plutonium-239 and Plutonium-240, at two of the sites in the plant (solid <b>waste</b> <b>area</b> and field) indicate that contamination has occurred at those sites due to the [...] "recent incident". Nonetheless, the overall levels of plutonium for all samples are about the same as background Pu levels resulting from atmospheric nuclear bomb testing in the past. However, these weapons did not use fuel that has decayed significantly. Such nuclear accidents as this one are a potent source of biologically accumulating isotopes of transuranic elements such as curium and americium which are incorporated into bones, complexed into the Ca/PO4 hydroxide.|$|E
2500|$|A {{chapter of}} The Atrocity Exhibition is titled [...] "Crash!", and in 1970 Ballard {{organised}} {{an exhibition of}} crashed cars at the New Arts Laboratory, simply called [...] "Crashed Cars". The crashed vehicles were displayed without commentary, inspiring vitriolic responses and vandalism. In both the story and the art exhibition, Ballard dealt with the sexual potential of car crashes, a preoccupation he also explored in a short film in which he appeared with Gabrielle Drake in 1971. His fascination with the topic culminated in the novel Crash in 1973. The main character of Crash is called James Ballard and lives in Shepperton, though other biographical details do not match the writer, and curiosity {{about the relationship between}} the character and his author increased when Ballard suffered a serious automobile accident shortly after completing the novel. [...] Regardless of real-life basis, Crash, like The Atrocity Exhibition, was also controversial upon publication. In 1996, the film adaptation by David Cronenberg was met by a tabloid uproar in the UK, with the Daily Mail campaigning actively for it to be banned. In the years following the initial publication of Crash, Ballard produced two further novels: 1974's Concrete Island, about a man who becomes stranded in the <b>waste</b> <b>area</b> of a high-speed motorway, and High-Rise, about a modern luxury high rise apartment building's descent into tribal warfare.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{relatively}} prime m and n we determine precisely the <b>wasted</b> <b>area</b> {{when a large}} p × q rectangle is packed with m × n tiles in the most efficient manner. The case m = 1 is considered first, and we derive a formula for the <b>wasted</b> <b>area</b> depending only on the residue classes of p and q (mod n). This result has also been obtained by various other authors. Then by regarding an m × n tile as a union of 1 × n or 1 × m tiles a lower bound for the <b>wasted</b> <b>area</b> is obtained. Finally, {{by a series of}} explicit constructions, we show that for sufficiently large p, q, this lower bound is actually the correct value...|$|R

40|$|The Bear Creek Watershed {{is located}} on the U. S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The 2800 -acre {{watershed}} contains numerous disposal areas previously used for waste management by the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant. Inventory records indicate that more than 18 million-kg (44 million-lbs) of uranium were disposed at three principal <b>waste</b> disposal <b>areas</b> in the eastern third of the valley. In addition, it is estimated that nearly 3, 000, 000 gal of waste oils and solvents were poured into debris-filled trenches.
