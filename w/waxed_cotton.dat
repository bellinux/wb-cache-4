25|$|Early {{in the war}} Philips and {{his crew}} had become {{dissatisfied}} with the conventional garb of oilskins and designed a special form of clothing more suitable for submarines. Ursula's navigating officer, Lt Lakin, was a keen motorcyclist and wore a one-piece <b>waxed</b> <b>cotton</b> motorcycling suit made by Barbour. Philips asked the company to adapt the suit, splitting it into jacket and trousers and adding a hood. The suit became standard watch-keeping clothing in Royal Navy submarines.|$|E
25|$|Abbott's {{investigations}} {{have led to}} questions concerning the assumptions police had made on the case. Police had believed that the Kensitas brand cigarettes in the Army Club packet were due to the common practice {{at the time of}} buying cheap cigarettes and putting them in a packet belonging to a more expensive brand (Australia was still under wartime rationing). However, a check of government gazettes of the day indicated that Kensitas were actually the expensive brand, which opens the possibility (never investigated) that the source of the poison may have been in the cigarettes that were possibly substituted for the victim's own without his knowledge. Abbott also tracked down the Barbour <b>waxed</b> <b>cotton</b> of the period and found packaging variations. This may provide clues to the country where it was purchased.|$|E
500|$|Driven by {{the needs}} of the fishing and {{commercial}} sailing industry, in 1795 Arbroath-based sailmaker Francis Webster Ltd had perfected the art of adding linseed oil to flax sails, creating an oiled flax. This developed in the late-19th century into <b>waxed</b> <b>cotton,</b> which drove Arbroath as a manufacturing centre, until the early 1970s manufacturing began to decline. A major employer, Keith & Blackman, closed in 1985 and Giddings and Lewis-Fraser wound down its operations at about the same time, with the entire plant eventually demolished {{to make way for a}} Safeway (now Morrisons) supermarket. Alps Electric Co. was a large employer in Arbroath from 1990 to 2001, employing 180 staff. Following the closure of the plant, all 180 staff were made redundant ...|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes the}} potential of a cutinase from the fungus Fusarium solani pisi for <b>cotton</b> <b>wax</b> degradation in order to design an efficient low temperature scouring process. The main characteristics, relevant to <b>cotton</b> <b>wax</b> removal with F. solani pisi cutinase are given. The additive effect of cutinase on pectinase was investigated and optimum incubation conditions were determined. Compatibility of cutinase with surfactants, essential for the rapid migration of enzymes into the fabric, is explored. A clear strategy is presented to achieve a rapid enzymatic <b>cotton</b> scouring process. <b>Wax</b> removal with cutinase reduces pectinase incubation time and increases the hydrolytic rate of pectinase. Cutinase appears {{to be effective in}} the degradation of <b>cotton</b> <b>waxes</b> at low-temperature, allowing the design and introduction of a competitive innovative enzymatic scouring process...|$|R

50|$|The {{historic}} Lacandón {{would at}} times trade with outsiders, {{but there is}} little to no documentation regarding this contact. What trade was documented showed that it was the most contact the Lacandón had with the outside world at the time.

As time progressed into the 19th and 20h centuries, the goods the Lacandón were given during trade became more advanced, such as firearms, kerosene, coffee, sugar, and clothing among other things. There is evidence that showed that some Lacandón kept regular trade with ranches in Chiapas, and through contact learned languages such as Spanish, Ch'ol, and Tzeltal Maya. This allowed the Lacandón to more easily understand Tzeltal Maya culture and Christianity.|$|R

40|$|The two {{principal}} reasons that can hinder industrial success of bioscouring are {{the inability to}} remove <b>cotton</b> <b>waxes</b> at low-temperature and that bioscouring is a slow diffusion controlled process. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to develop an improved cotton scouring process by applying mechanical action and enzyme treatment to efficiently remove the cuticle and primary wall compounds from the cotton fibre. The role of the mechanical action for improving the bioscouring process is discussed. To study the effect, a known amount of mechanical energy was applied using the ‘wedge apparatus’ before and after the enzyme treatment. The effect of mechanical action was evaluated for a faster scouring process with cutinase, pectinase and optimum incubation conditions such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, enzyme concentration, and incubation time were determined. It is demonstrated that cutinase from fungus Fusarium solani pisi is effective in the degradation of <b>cotton</b> <b>waxes</b> at low-temperature in less than 30 min after applying mechanical action. Wax removal with cutinase reduces pectinase incubation time and increases hydrolytic rate of pectinase. By the introduction of mechanical energy a fast one-step low-temperature enzymatic cotton scouring process is developed at lab scale...|$|R

Evidence is presented to show that after a suitable period of rehydration, previously stressed cotton leaves produce more wax than leaves prior to stressing...|$|R
