2500|$|On July 11, 2011, Justin Richmond, {{creative}} director at Naughty Dog told NowGamer that the multiplayer {{for the game}} is hundreds of hours long, stating [...] "We're going to continue adding new content after launch with downloadable content (DLC) like treasures, new character parts and so on. While we can't talk about DLC right now, I'd say the content easily amounts to {{hundreds and hundreds of}} hours. I mean, you can play competitive, co-op, multiple modes", Richmond continued, [...] "I just can't quantify it enough". On October 14, 2011, Justin Richmond, confirmed that it won't be releasing any downloadable content for Uncharted 3: Drake's Deceptions single-player mode. [...] "There's a very specific reason," [...] said Richmond. [...] "Whenever <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and think we should do some single-player DLC, someone pitches something and we realize – that's a five hour level." [...] "Dialling back our ambition is difficult," [...] added Arne Meyer, Naughty Dog's Community Strategist. [...] "We'd rather build out another game than we would do episodic content," [...] continued Richmond. [...] "We're so small that we can't afford to have a whole team working on DLC." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration {{tribunal}} in the Hague {{announced its}} ruling {{in favor of}} the Philippines in its case filed under the Benigno Aquino III administration in 2013 against China on issues regarding the South China Sea under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including the latter's nine-dash line claim which the tribunal ruled had no legal basis. Three days after, during a testimonial dinner in San Juan, Duterte asked former President Fidel Ramos to lead the Philippine envoy to Beijing for bilateral negotiations with China over the disputes. Ramos accepted the offer on July 23, but resigned on October 31. During his first State of the Nation Address on July 25, Duterte said that his administration [...] "strongly affirms and respects" [...] the ruling and would use it as a guide to negotiate for a resolution on the territorial disputes. Duterte prefers to discuss the issue quietly and directly with China and has vowed not to raise the issue before the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. [...] Duterte said [...] "he would not want to antagonize China" [...] and would want to [...] "maintain good relations with China" [...] to [...] "create an environment where <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and talk directly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{schools on}} all {{education}} levels offer service-learning programs, which {{allow students to}} serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit. According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because {{we see it as}} a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'" [...] When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, [...] "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs." [...] Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds {{by the fact that it}} [...] "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..." [...] While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs, According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students." [...] They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: [...] "Students like service-learning. When <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction." ...|$|E
