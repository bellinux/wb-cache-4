5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to suspect that he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible {{to serve in the}} Armed Forces because of a {{systolic}} heart murmur, which he believed the doctor diagnosed because he was tired of sending young men off to die. He successfully appealed against the decision, and enlisted on 14 August 1917 as a cadet in the Hampshire Regiment before being sent to the Royal Engineers Oxford University Officer Training Corps. He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.|$|E

She was described as an industrious and inquisitive child with a strong love of studying the Bible, learning and reading, and she developed affectionate relationships with her teachers. She continued her education throughout her adolescence at the Congregational School of Ambatonakanga, the Friends High School for Girls, and the LMS Girls' Central School. She was baptized as a Protestant at Ambohimanga on April 5, 1874. Her teachers consistently described her as ranking among their strongest students.|$|E

5|$|At age six, Rainilaiarivony began {{two years}} of study {{at one of the}} new schools opened by the London Missionary Society (LMS) for the {{children}} of the noble class at the royal palace in Antananarivo. Ranavalona shut down the mission schools in 1836, but the boy continued to study privately with an older missionary student. When Rainilaiarivony reached age 11 or 12, the relatives who had raised him decided he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make his own way in the world. Beginning with the purchase and resale of a few bars of soap, the boy gradually grew his business and expanded into the more profitable resale of fabric. The young Rainilaiarivony's reputation for tenacity and industriousness, as he fought against his predestined misfortunes, eventually reached the palace, where at the age of 14 the boy was invited to meet Queen Ranavalona I. She was favorably impressed, awarding him the official ranking of Sixth Honor title of Officer of the Palace. At 16 he was promoted to Seventh Honor, then promoted twice again to Eighth and Ninth Honor at age 19, an unprecedented ascent through the ranks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
5|$|Gofraid {{died in the}} Hebrides {{the year}} after his {{expulsion}} from Dublin. Whether this is evidence {{that he had been}} driven from Mann is uncertain. According to the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, Gofraid was succeeded in the Isles by his eldest son, Lagmann, who appears to have been forced to fend off factions supporting the claims of his younger brothers. At some point, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach, and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lagmann's younger brother, Amlaíb mac Gofraid (died 1153), <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lagmann faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lagmann by itself, it approached Muirchertach for assistance in placing Amlaíb mac Gofraid upon the throne. Muirchertach was certainly a formidable potential ally, having recently imposed his dominance over the kingdoms of Connacht, Leinster, Mide, and Dublin. In consequence of this predominance, the clause as stated by the chroniclethat Muirchertach was to provide the Isles with a regent from his own kinmay well have been a condition on his intervention, rather than a request of the Islesmen themselves. Whatever the case, the chronicle reveals that Muirchertach then installed Domnall upon the throne.|$|E

5|$|Seven years later, {{an older}} Link awakens {{in an area}} of the Sacred Realm known as the Chamber of Sages and is met by Rauru, one of the seven sages who protect the {{entrance}} to the Sacred Realm. Rauru explains that Link's spirit was sealed for seven years until he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf, who has now taken over Hyrule. The seven sages can imprison Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm, but five are unaware of their identities as sages. Link is returned to the Temple of Time; there he meets the mysterious Sheik, who guides him to free five temples from Ganondorf's control, allowing each temple's sage to awaken. Link befriended all five sages as a child: Saria, the Sage of the Forest Temple; Darunia, the Sage of the Fire Temple; Ruto, the Sage of the Water Temple; Impa, the Sage of the Shadow Temple; and Nabooru, the Sage of the Spirit Temple. After the five sages awaken, Sheik reveals herself to be Zelda in disguise, and the seventh sage. She tells Link that Ganondorf's heart was unbalanced, causing the Triforce to split into three pieces. Ganondorf acquired only the Triforce of Power, while Zelda received the Triforce of Wisdom and Link the Triforce of Courage.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's rival for {{leadership}} of the new regime was Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, whose conservative supporters had allied with Dudley's followers to create a unanimous Council, which they, and observers such as the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V's ambassador, expected to reverse Somerset's policy of religious reform. Warwick, on the other hand, pinned his hopes on the king's strong Protestantism and, claiming that Edward <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> rule in person, moved himself and his people closer to the king, {{taking control of the}} Privy Chamber. Paget, accepting a barony, joined Warwick when he realised that a conservative policy would not bring the emperor onto the English side over Boulogne. Southampton prepared a case for executing Somerset, aiming to discredit Warwick through Somerset's statements that he had done all with Warwick's co-operation. As a counter-move, Warwick convinced parliament to free Somerset, which it did on 14 January 1550. Warwick then had Southampton and his followers purged from the Council after winning the support of Council members in return for titles, and was made Lord President of the Council and great master of the king's household. Although not called a Protector, he was now clearly the head of the government.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{another set}} of late myths detail the adventures of Isis {{after the birth of}} Osiris's posthumous son, Horus. Isis was said to have given birth to Horus at Khemmis, thought to be located on the Nile Delta. Many dangers faced Horus after birth, and Isis fled with the newborn to escape the wrath of Set, the murderer of her husband. In one instance, Isis heals Horus from a lethal {{scorpion}} sting; she also performs other miracles in relation to the cippi, or the plaques of Horus. Isis protected and raised Horus until he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> face Set, and subsequently become the pharaoh of Egypt. In some stories, Isis is referred to as Horus' sister.|$|E
25|$|The {{dates of}} his {{lifetime}} are not recorded, but extrapolated from writings that {{have survived the}} ages. In Protagoras Plato wrote that, before a gathering of Socrates, Prodicus, and Hippias, Protagoras stated that he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be the father of any of them. This suggests a birth date of not later than 490 BC. In the Meno {{he is said to}} have died at approximately the age of 70, after 40 years as a practicing Sophist. His death, then, may be presumed to have occurred circa 420 BC, but is not known for certain, since assumptions about it are based on an apparently fake story about his trial for impiety in Athens.|$|E

25|$|Donnchad {{was the son}} of Brian (king of Munster) and {{his wife}} Gormlaith (daughter of Murchad, king of Leinster). His year of birth is unknown, but a date 980s is likely, as it would accord with the {{political}} policy of his father at the time and mean that Donnchad <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be militarily active in the 1010s, when he first appears in historical records. Brian's son Murchad, Donnchad's half-brother, died with his father at Clontarf. Another brother or half-brother, Domnall, had died in 1011. Two other half-brothers, Conchobar and Flann, are mentioned in some sources but leave no trace in the Irish annals. So, of Brian's sons, only Donnchad and his half-brother Tadc are known to have survived their father. According to Geoffrey Keating's account in Foras Feasa ar Éirinn, an account which is not backed by any annalistic evidence, Donnchad, leading the survivors of the Dál gCais back from Clontarf faced armies from Osraige and Munster which were faced down.|$|E
25|$|Alexios was {{the second}} son and the last of five {{children}} of the sebastokratōr Andronikos Komnenos, second son of Emperor John II Komnenos, and his wife Irene. His birth was celebrated by the poet Theodore Prodromos, who composed a laudatory poem on the occasion. The Greek scholar Konstantinos Varzos, in his prosopographical study of the Komnenoi, placed his birth on Easter Day 1135 (or possibly 1134 or 1136) as he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> participate in a campaign in 1149/50. His father died in August 1142, while on campaign {{with his father and}} brothers in southern Asia Minor. Andronikos died only a little while after his elder brother Alexios, and probably of the same illness. This provided the occasion for another poem by Prodromos, who claims that the young Alexios was the only solace for his devastated mother. The Prosopography of the Byzantine World database on the other hand interprets the poems as indicating that Alexios was born in 1142, during his father's absence on campaign.|$|E
25|$|The exact date of Ömer's {{birth is}} unknown; {{as a young}} man, he was {{presented}} to the Byzantine envoy George Sphrantzes in 1435, and by 1444 he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> assume his father's duties as uç beyi ("marcher-lord") of Thessaly during Turahan's temporary disgrace. In the same year, Ömer led a raid against the Duchy of Athens, which was falling {{under the influence of the}} energetic Byzantine prince Constantine Palaiologos, the ruler of the Despotate of the Morea. This display of force, coupled with the decisive Ottoman victory in the Battle of Varna, convinced the Duke of Athens, Nerio II Acciaioli, to revert to his Ottoman allegiance. Ömer also participated in the retaliatory campaign of Sultan Murad II against Palaiologos in late 1446. The Ottomans breached the Hexamilion wall and devastated the Morea, forcing the despots to become Ottoman vassals. In 1449, as Constantine Palaiologos became the new Byzantine emperor and left the Morea, his brothers Demetrios Palaiologos and Thomas Palaiologos began to quarrel about their share of the rule of the Despotate. Eventually the dispute was settled through the mediation of Constantine and Ömer, who used the opportunity to completely demolish the Hexamilion.|$|E
