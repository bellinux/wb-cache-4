25|$|Though {{initially}} one of {{the most}} outspoken de Mella supporters, Chicharro did not integrate fully in the Mellista group; some speak even of “chicharrismo”, others dubbed him “mauro-ciervista”. While de Mella <b>was</b> <b>firm</b> on his Traditionalist principles and opted for a grand conservative party built upon them, Chicharro started to lean towards the vision of Victor Pradera, embracing a more loose Right-wing alliance held together by a lowest common denominator. In the early 1920s he effectively left the Mellistas; some scholars consider him paradigmatic for many rebellious Carlists who joined de Mella in 1919, but soon abandoned him to pursue their own goals and to amalgamate in other Right-wing groupings.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. State Department and {{the embassy}} {{actively}} began {{to support the}} position of UFCo, which was a major US company. The Guatemalan government had to fight the pressure. The US officially acknowledged that Guatemala {{had the right to}} conduct their own politics and business, but U.S. representatives said they were trying to protect UFCo, a US company that generated much revenue and contributed to the US economy. Arbenz's administration said that Guatemala needed Agrarian Reform to improve its own economy. Arbenz said he would adopt policies for a nationalist economic development if necessary. He argued that all foreign investment would be subject to Guatemalan laws. Arbenz <b>was</b> <b>firm</b> in promoting the Agrarian Reform and within a couple of years had acted quickly; he claimed that Guatemalan government was not prepared to make an exception for the U.S. concerning Decree 900 and that it was not Guatemalan's fault that the American corporation had lied in its tax forms and declared an artificially low value on their land.|$|E

By now the Army of Helvetia was 34,992-strong, but this campaign isolated Lecourbe {{from the rest}} of the army. On 9 March 1799, the French Directory realized that having many independent armies was a bad idea and subordinated Masséna to Jourdan. A furious Masséna submitted his resignation on the 16th. The government <b>was</b> <b>firm</b> in its decision however, and Masséna finally backed down and agreed to remain in command. It is possible that the drama may have made Masséna overly-aggressive in the next few days. By 19 March Jourdan's army was coming abreast of Masséna, with its right flank division under Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino on Lake Constance. Jourdan asked Masséna to link with Ferino at Bregenz. On the 20th Archduke Charles ordered Hotze to reinforce his army with 10,000 troops drawn from the Vorarlberg.|$|E
25|$|After many years, Asad {{was again}} invited by another President of Pakistan, General Zia ul-Haq, in 1983 {{and that was}} his last visit to this country. When he arrived at Islamabad, which {{he had not yet}} seen, he was {{received}} at the plane with great honour and escorted to the Presidency. During his sojourn in Islamabad, there was a series of meetings with members of the Ansari Commission in order to prepare a kind of programme for the President for the future. Asad agreed with some, and as usual disagreed with others, which he found retrograde. On one point he <b>was</b> <b>firm</b> and insistent that Muslim women should have exactly the same rights in the political sphere as had men, to the extent of becoming Prime Minister. Asad also spared some time to meet with his surviving friends in Lahore and Islamabad and {{at the request of the}} President made several radio and television appearances, as always spontaneous. On his return, he was besieged by letters from literally hundreds of admirers in Pakistan, offering him land, a house, everything but he refused politely, as his concept of Pakistan was beyond all these worldly trivialities.|$|E
25|$|Magloire {{restored}} the elite to prominence. The {{business community and}} the government benefited from favorable economic conditions until Hurricane Hazel hit the island in 1954. Haiti made some improvements on its infrastructure, {{but most of these}} were financed largely by foreign loans. By Haitian standards, Magloire's rule <b>was</b> <b>firm,</b> but not harsh: he jailed political opponents, including Fignolé, and shut down their presses when their protests grew too strident, but he allowed labor unions to function, although they were not permitted to strike. It was in the arena of corruption, however, that Magloire overstepped traditional bounds. The president controlled the sisal, cement, and soap monopolies. He and other officials built imposing mansions. The injection of international hurricane relief funds into an already corrupt system boosted graft to levels that disillusioned all Haitians. To make matters worse, Magloire followed in the footsteps of many previous presidents by disputing the termination date of his stay in office. Politicians, labor leaders, and their followers flocked to the streets in May 1956 to protest Magloire's failure to step down. Although Magloire declared martial law, a general strike essentially shut down Port-au-Prince. Again like many before him, Magloire fled to Jamaica, leaving the army with the task of restoring order.|$|E

Chamberlain was confident that improvements in British defence since Munich would bring the dictator to the bargaining table. This belief was reinforced by a German official's conciliatory speech welcoming Ambassador Henderson back to Berlin after an absence for medical treatment in Britain. Chamberlain responded with a speech in Blackburn on 22 February hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade, and was gratified when his comments were printed in German newspapers.

500|$|The ruling Congress Party {{was divided}} on the Hindi issue. While Rajaji and his {{supporters}} stuck to their position, Sathyamurti and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan were against it. They wanted Rajaji to make Hindi optional or to provide a conscience clause for allowing parents to withhold their children from Hindi Classes. But Rajaji <b>was</b> <b>firm</b> in his stance. The police response to the agitation grew progressively brutal in 1939. During the agitation, a total of 1,198 protesters were arrested and out of them 1,179 were convicted (73 of those jailed were women and 32 children accompanied their mothers to prison). Periyar was fined 1,000 Rupees and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment for inciting [...] "women to disobey the law" [...] (he was released within six months on 22 May 1939 citing medical grounds) and Annadurai was jailed for four months. On 7 June 1939, all those arrested for participating in the agitations were released without explanation. Rajaji also organised pro-Hindustani meetings to counter the agitators. On 29 October 1939, the Congress government resigned protesting the involvement of India in the Second World War, and the Madras provincial government was placed under Governor's rule. On 31 October, Periyar suspended the agitation and asked the Governor to withdraw the compulsory Hindi order. On 21 February 1940, Governor Erskine issued a press communique withdrawing compulsory Hindi teaching and making it optional.|$|E
500|$|Mani Ratnam was not {{satisfied}} with {{his job as a}} consultant as he found it to be a mere extension of his academics. During this time his friend Ravi Shankar, son of director B. R.

Balachander, to complete the script of the film. Mani Ratnam took a sabbatical from his job in order to ensure his participation in the making of the film. Being inexperienced, the makers were largely dependent upon the American Cinematographer magazine. The principal cast included Vishnuvardhan, Srinath, Ambarish, Lakshmi, and Roja Ramani. When the filming was about to begin in Kolar, Karnataka, Mani Ratnam left his consulting job and joined the crew. The film, however, did not take off and was eventually shelved. Nevertheless, he <b>was</b> <b>firm</b> in his idea of becoming a film-maker. Although not pleased with the films made in Tamil cinema till then, he was [...] "amazed" [...] at P.

500|$|Dr R. Nagulendran, a {{consultant}} psychiatrist, testified that Tan was mentally impaired by reactive psychotic depression. [...] According to {{him she was}} depressed before she met Lim, due to her family background. [...] Physical abuse and threats from Lim deepened her depression; drug abuse led her to hallucinate and believe the medium's lies. [...] Dr Chee disagreed; he said that Tan had admitted to being quite happy with the material lifestyle Lim gave to her, enjoying fine clothes and beauty salon treatments. [...] A sufferer from reactive psychotic depression would not have paid such attention to her appearance. [...] Also, Tan had earlier confessed to knowing Lim was a fraud, but changed her stance in court to claim she was acting completely under his influence. [...] Although Dr Chee had neglected Lim's physical abuse of Tan in his judgment, he <b>was</b> <b>firm</b> in his opinion that Tan was mentally sound during the crimes. [...] Both Dr Nagulendran and Dr Chee agreed that Hoe suffered from schizophrenia long before she met Lim, and that her stay in Woodbridge Hospital had helped her recovery. [...] However, while Dr Nagulendran was convinced that Hoe suffered a relapse {{during the time of}} the child killings, Dr Chee pointed out that none of the Woodbridge doctors saw any signs of relapse during the six months of her follow-up checks (16July 1980 [...] 31January 1981). If Hoe had been as severely impaired by her condition as Dr Nagulendran described, she would have become an invalid. [...] Instead, she methodically abducted and helped kill a child on two occasions. [...] Ending his testimony, Dr Chee stated that it was incredible that three people with different mental illnesses should share a common delusion of receiving a request to kill from a god.|$|E
