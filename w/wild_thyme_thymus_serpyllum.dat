The experiment was conducted in the laboratory, in six replicates. Dry extracts were prepared at concentration of 2 %, 5 % and 10 %, while the fresh plant at concentration of 10 %, 20 % and 30 %. Feeding intensity assessment was conducted by dipping leaves of potato in respective solutions of the extracts and determining the mass of food consumed by adults and larvae, and changes of larvae body weight once daily. In addition, absolute deterrence index and palatability index were calculated. The results of the experiment showed that for an efficient limitation of the feeding adult Colorado potato beetles, an extract from dry matter of wild thyme with a concentration of at least 10 % should be used. L 4 larvae appear to be considerably more susceptible to the effect of T. serpyllum extract. In their case, an efficient limitation of the feeding, as well as body weight gain can be obtained using extracts from both dry and fresh matter, at concentrations of over 5 % for dry matter and over 20 % for fresh matter.

40|$|Summary. Objective. The aim of {{this work}} was to analyze the {{essential}} oil content and its composition in the drug (Serpylli herba) of <b>wild</b> <b>thyme</b> (<b>Thymus</b> <b>serpyllum</b> L.) originating from 20 different natural places of growth in Estonia. Material and methods. The quantitative content of essential oil was determined according to the method of European Pharmacopoeia. Gas chromatographic analysis of essential oils was carried out using a gas chromatography with flame ionization detector on two fused silica capillary columns with bonded stationary phases NB- 30 and SW- 10. The identification of the oil components was accomplished by comparing their retention indices on two columns with the retention indices values of standard compounds, with our retention indices data bank and with literature data. The results obtained were confirmed by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry. Results. The content of essential oil is between 0. 6 and 4 ml/kg and usually is not in conformity with European Pharmacopoeia standard (3 ml/kg). There were 55 components identified in the essential oil of wild thyme of Estonian origin. Differently from the data {{in the literature of}} foreign countries, thymol and carvacrol are not the main components of the essential oil of wild thyme growing in Estonia. The main components here are (E) -nerolidol, caryophyllene oxide, myrcene, (E) -b-caryophyllene and germacrene D. Conclusion.

Plant phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids, quinones, coumarins, lignans, stilbenes, and tannins), nitrogen compounds (alkaloids, amines), carotenoids and vitamins are the most important plant substances presenting antioxidant activity. 	 The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of some medicinal plants collected in the region of Malesevo Mountain was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and FRAP method. 	Infusions samples in the present research were prepared from: Mountain tea (Origanum vulgare L.), Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), <b>Wild</b> <b>thyme</b> (<b>Thymus</b> <b>serpyllum</b> L.) and Mint tea (Mentha piperita L.). 	In this study we present rapid and simple electrochemical voltammetric method for estimation the total antioxidant capacity of medicinal plants in an ethanol/water phase by measuring the rate of homogeneous redox reaction with ABTS•+ radical (2, 2 ’- azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid)) by means of cyclic voltammetry. ABTS•+ radical was electrochemically in situ generated at the surface of glassy carbon electrode by electrochemical oxidation of ABTS in ethanol electrolyte solution. The method is based on the well-known regenerative catalytic EC´ mechanism, where the ABTS•+ radical serves as a redox mediator for catalytic oxidation of antioxidants present in the plant infusion. 	The total antioxidant capacity of herb infusions was determined using photometric FRAP method (Ferric reducing antioxidant power) developed by Benzie and Strain. 	As a conclusion we can say that there were strong correlations between the results obtained with cyclic voltammetry and FRAP method and both methods can be used forevaluation of total antioxidant capacity in medicinal plants infusions. ...|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, {{pressurized}} liquid extraction (PLE) {{has been}} employed to isolate bioactive compounds from three native Romanian plants, oregano (Origanum vulgare), tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) and <b>wild</b> <b>thyme</b> (<b>Thymus</b> <b>serpyllum).</b> Different PLE conditions {{have been tested}} including extraction with water, ethanol and their mixtures {{in a wide range}} of extraction temperatures (50 – 200 °C), and the antioxidant capacity of the extracts was measured using different assays (DPPH radical scavenging, TEAC assay and Folin–Ciocalteau assay to measure total phenols). Moreover, a complete chemical characterization by using LC–MS/MS was carried out to be able to correlate the bioactivity with the particular chemical composition of each extract and plant. The use of PLE with water as a solvent at the highest temperature tested (200 °C) always provided the highest extraction yields for the three studied plants, being maximum for oregano (> 60 %). Besides, oregano's pressurized water extracts at lower temperatures (50 °C) presented the highest content on total phenols (184. 9 mg gallic acid/g extract) and the best antioxidant activities (EC 50 6. 98 μg/ml). In general, oregano extracts were the most active, followed by wild thyme extracts. The antioxidant capacity measured by DPPH assay was highly correlated with the amount of total phenols. Moreover, the use of a LC–MS/MS method allowed the identification of 30 different phenolic compounds in the different extracts, including phenolic acids, flavones, flavanones and flavonols, which have an important influence on the total antioxidant capacity of the different extracts.

40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>thyme</b> (<b>Thymus</b> <b>serpyllum</b> L.) is {{a popular}} remedy {{regarding}} both traditional and conventional medicine. It is used as the antiseptic, aromatic, expectorant, stomachic, antispasmodic, carminative and preservative substance. For {{the purpose of this}} paper, wild thyme essential oil was isolated from the dried herb T. serpyllum by hydrodistillation. Original semi-industrial distillation device SP- 130 performing distillation by water and steam was used for the hydrodistillation of T. serpyllum essential oils. The temperature during the hydrodistillation in the device SP- 130 ranged from 100 °C - 102 °C at atmospheric pressure, and the whole process lasted 5 hours. The isolated essential oil is a liquid of light yellow colour and the odour characteristic of the genus Thymus. Obtained yield of essential oil was 0. 08 %, with 65 components identified in the tested essential oil. The most represented chemical groups are sesquiturpene hydrocarbons with 35. 1 %, and oxygenated sesquiturpenes with 34. 8 %. The main components of essential oil of T. serpyllum were: trans-nerolidol (24. 2 %), germacrene D (16. 0 %), thymol (7. 3 %), δ-cadinene (3. 7 %) and β-bisabolene (3. 3 %). The essential oil showed significantly better ability to neutralize DPPH free radicals (IC 50 = 0. 503 μL / mL) compared with synthetic antioxidants BHA and BHT. Synthetic chemical compounds such as BHA and BHT are used in food industry as antioxidants due to their ability to prolong the shelf-life of foodstuffs by protecting them against deterioration caused by oxidation, such as fat rancidity, colour changes, degradation of the flavor and loss of nutrient value. In recent years, there is a considerable interest in finding natural compounds that could replace sinthetic antioxidants because of adverse toxicological reports on many synthetic compounds. Lamiaceae herbs and their essential oils or extracts application has proven to be the effective preservation agents for the extension shelf-life of foodstuffs, indicating their potential use in food industry as functional ingredients and food additives. The antioxidant activity of extracts from some Lamiaceae herbs is comparable to that of the most common synthetic antioxidants BHT and BHA. Free radicals are a major cause of many degenerative diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, skin aging, old age dementia and arthritis. Epidemiological data and randomized clinical trials provide sample indications that antioxidants play a fundamental role in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. They act as scavengers of reactive oxygen species and metal chelators that protect human cells and reduce oxidative damages. Natural antioxidants are important in the food industry because they can have a double functionality, that is, they can be useful as a food preservation agents while providing important health benefits for humans by maintaining our health and preventing disease. This investigation showed that the essential oil of T. serpyllum can be an important source for the production and application in the food industry as nutritional supplements, functional food components or natural food antioxidants...|$|E
