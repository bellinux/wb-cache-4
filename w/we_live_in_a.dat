25|$|Williams {{released}} a statement on social media branding the comments about her unborn child as racist, noting that it saddened her that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society where these comments can be made. Năstase then apologised on social media regarding the comments he made about Williams, but made comments about Konta speaking to the umpire which upset him. In a further interview with the BBC, Năstase justified his comments to Konta stating that he only abused her after being ejected from the court and did so as a fan rather than a captain. Năstase additionally added that he regretted his behaviour in the incident. Nastase was not invited to the French Open and Wimbledon following his suspension. The Madrid Open however invited Nastase {{to be part of}} the prize giving ceremony, which ironically was won by Halep (another Romanian player). This was a move that was deemed irresponsible by the WTA who had revoked Nastase's privileges while the ITF carried out its investigation.|$|E

Speaking at an RUComingOut event, Dixon stated [...] "I love everything RUComingOut stands for. Thankfully <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> much more liberal and accepting world now but until the time comes when people aren’t scared to come out there’s still work to be done". Dixon has spoken out in support of gay marriage, and has performed at multiple gay pride parades around the UK, headlining both London and Brighton Pride in 2016 alone.|$|E

[...] She told the Senate that she was personally against abortion but that she could tolerate the part of her job involving the disbursement of Medicaid funds to hospitals that performed abortions on women {{with little or no}} money.|$|E

500|$|Weingartner {{commented that}} the film is [...] "about {{economic}} revolution, about poor vs. rich." [...] He also tried to explore in the film the fact that, in his opinion, [...] "Today, <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society in which revolution is on sale." [...] However, it deals with [...] "lots of themes," [...] and [...] "the theme of revolution, of rebellion," [...] and of [...] "how a person can {{change the course of}} his life" [...] are the main ones. Similarly, Brühl commented that [...] "there are different things you can take out of it" [...] as the film also deals with generational conflict and stories of love and friendship.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{compared}} Eliot to Yeats. Yeats believed that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cyclical world, saying, [...] "If it {{be true that}} God is a circle whose centre is everywhere, the saint goes to the centre, the poet and the artist to the ring where everything comes round again." [...] Eliot believed that such a system is stuck within time. Eliot was influenced by Yeats's reading of Dante. This appears in Eliot's Ash-Wednesday by changing Yeats's [...] "desire for absolution" [...] away from a humanistic approach. When Eliot wrote about personal topics, he tended to use Dante as a reference point. He also relied on Dante's imagery: {{the idea of the}} [...] "refining fire" [...] in the Four Quartets and in The Waste Land comes from Purgatorio, and the celestial rose and fire imagery of Paradiso makes its way into the series.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} in modern society, control-related and {{prescriptive}} technologies are dominant. [...] "When work is organized as {{a sequence of}} separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," [...] she writes. [...] "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are designs for compliance." [...] For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also {{come to believe that}} there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. [...] "While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept {{that there is only one}} way of doing 'it'." ...|$|E

500|$|Her media {{appearances}} were criticised {{for their}} awkwardness. In September 2012, Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she [...] "fluffed her lines" [...] {{during an interview}} with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour's public service policy review. Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, {{in which she was}} repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as [...] "articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; she ought to be applauded for it, but the trouble is <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sound-bite age." [...] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, [...] "despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [...] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating." [...] The BBC's Marianne Taylor describes Lamont as [...] "Quietly spoken and more humorous in person than she comes across on television".|$|E
500|$|The Fountains {{theme of}} fear of death is [...] "a {{movement}} from darkness into light, from black to white" [...] that traces the journey of a man scared of death and moving toward it. The film begins with a paraphrase of Genesis 3:24, the Biblical passage that reflects The Fall of Man. Hugh Jackman {{emphasized the importance of}} the Fall in the film: [...] "The moment Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, humans started to experience life as we all experience it now, which is life and death, poor and wealthy, pain and pleasure, good and evil. <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world of duality. Husband, wife, we relate everything. And much of our lives are spent not wanting to die, be poor, experience pain. It's what the movie's about." [...] Aronofsky also interpreted the story of Genesis as the definition of mortality for humanity. He inquired of the Fall, [...] "If they had drank from the Tree of Life [...] what would have separated them from their maker? So what makes us human is actually death. It's what makes us special." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul's sixteenth CD, The Day After Everything Changed, was {{released}} on January 12, 2010. Rather than work with a record label, Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation. [...] Although Paul wasn't sure {{what to expect when}} the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian Bush that includes a duet on the track, [...] "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan support inspired him to make [...] "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: [...] "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture." [...] In her review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said that the CD is [...] "a masterwork filled with the best music and lyrics of his career." ...|$|E

500|$|While some reviewers {{regard the}} novel as a thriller, others {{see it as an}} example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the [...] "technocultural future-present". Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of {{illustrating}} society's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are [...] "he Footage and Cayce's special talents" [...] but that he [...] "never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future". Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson's point ... is that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we're all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the [...] "real world" [...] now has to answer the question, [...] "Which one?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1991, McCaskill testified for a Missouri Senate {{bill that}} would {{prohibit}} a man accused of raping his wife from using marriage as a defense. [...] "This is simply an issue of fundamental justice. It's embarrassing that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state where it's okay to rape your wife," [...] McCaskill said.|$|E
2500|$|He writes; “In {{this age}} of {{uncertainty}} we have lost the privilege of having one world view. Now every image, idea and truth (may it be ancient or modern) encompasses its opposite within itself. Thus <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of duality.

2500|$|Christian philosopher William Lane Craig {{has noted}} [...] "The idea that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> postmodern {{culture is a}} myth. In fact, a postmodern culture is an impossibility; it would be utterly unliveable. People are not {{relativistic}} {{when it comes to}} matters of science, engineering, and technology; rather, they are relativistic and pluralistic in matters of religion and ethics. But, of course, that's not postmodernism; that's modernism!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Allan C. Carlson {{says that}} <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "post-family order", in which elites no longer accept the {{centrality}} of family life.

[...] He argues {{that there is a}} permanent tension between the family and [...] "individualist, industrialized society." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, Bloomberg {{expressed}} {{the view that}} terrorism threats may require a reconsideration of civil liberties, saying [...] "the people who are worried about privacy have a legitimate worry, but <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complex world where you're {{going to have to}} have a level of security greater than you did back in the olden days, if you will... our laws and our interpretation of the Constitution, I think, have to change." ...|$|E
