5|$|In Alexandria, Virginia, sixteen-year-old Dara Kernof (Emily Perkins), a {{severely}} {{mentally and physically}} disabled girl confined to a wheelchair, somehow manages to leave her house {{in the middle of}} the night, soon after her baptism. Her father, Lance (Eric Keenleyside), finds her {{in the middle of the}} street, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> raised upward, kneeling before a Dark Figure. Suddenly, lightning flashes and the Dark Figure disappears. When Lance reaches Dara, he realizes she is dead and that her eyes are gone, as if having been burned out of their sockets.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preliminary}} study for The World Before the Flood {{now in the}} York Art Gallery, the broad structure {{is similar to that}} of the finished work, but the focus is more strongly on the central group of women. In Etty's oil sketch and in preliminary drawings the right-most of the dancing figures, wearing a green skirt, faces outward <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> behind her back, forming a closed circle together with the central group of dancers. In the finished work, she gestures outwards from the circle, creating a clear narrative flow in the positions of the figures: from the single men on the left, to the man choosing a wife, to the group of dancing women, to the couple leaving the circle of dancers to join the reclining lovers on the far right.|$|E
5|$|Juliet {{arrives at}} an airport with her sister, where Richard Alpert and Ethan Rom are there to escort her {{the rest of the}} way. Juliet says good-bye to her sister, Rachel, {{promising}} to be back before her baby is born. In the airport terminal, Alpert pours sedative into a glass of orange juice and gives it to Juliet to drink, explaining that the trip is very intense. Juliet is wary of drinking the juice, even though she is okay with the other circumstances surrounding the trip. Alpert interrupts and tells her the place she is going is very special and that she has a gift with which she is supposed to do something significant. Juliet drinks the orange juice and passes out. She wakes up in a submarine <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and waist strapped down for safety.|$|E

It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register.

25|$|In 1984, a {{judge of}} first {{instance}} prohibited a poster that advertised the film Ave Maria by Jacques Richard. The poster showed a young woman, covered {{only at the}} waist, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and feet tied to a cross. No appeal was made.|$|E
25|$|The huipil endures in many {{indigenous}} communities, if not as {{an everyday}} garment, as one for ceremonies or special occasions. When a woman puts on a huipil, especially a ceremonial or very traditional one, {{it is a kind}} of ritual. She becomes the center of a symbolic world as her head passes through the neck opening. <b>With</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> she forms a cross and is surrounded by myth as between heaven and the underworld.|$|E
60|$|She was brought, {{and stood}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{hand in her}} sister's. Louisa had {{observed}} <b>her</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> round Sissy's neck, and she felt the difference of this approach.|$|R

25|$|The {{measures}} of the bust — A liposuction mammoplasty procedure does not feature a surgical-incision plan delineated upon the woman's breasts, chest, and torso. Yet the {{measures of}} the bust are established {{in order to determine}} the required degree(s) of correction; thus, with the patient sitting erect, for each breast, the surgeon records the jugular-notch-to-nipple distances, the nipple-to-inframammary-fold distances, and any asymmetries. Afterwards, the anaesthetized patient is laid supine upon the operating table, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> laterally extended (abducted) in order to fully expose the breasts.|$|E
25|$|Competing {{at home in}} the Pan American Weightlifting Championships {{and after}} {{spending}} 24 hours without food to reach her category weight limit, 58kg, she won the gold medal in snatch setting a new Pan American record with 97kg and gold in total with 207kg. She won the clean and jerk silver with 110kg after losing by bodyweight to the Colombian Rusmeris Villar with the same lift.

25|$|Her {{focus on}} {{teaching}} left her {{little time for}} research, she did not pursue a master's degree or a doctorate. She {{was responsible for the}} laboratory training of her students, many of whom came up to College with little or no knowledge of chemistry. Amongst her students she was thought to be an inspirational teacher and a singular character. She had lost a leg in a cycling accident {{when she was a girl}} and used variously walking sticks, a prosthetic leg and a three-wheeled tricycle wheelchair worked <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> Her disability and unconventional style of dress made her a distinctive figure which was much remarked upon at the time by colleagues and contemporaries.|$|E

25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and legs completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} monuments on which the March {{siblings}} collaborated was the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers South African War Memorial; however, Vernon was still a child when it was built and erected. Another project on which the family collaborated was the Lewes War Memorial at School Hill on High Street in Lewes, East Sussex, England. Vernon was the main sculptor for the monument. There is a central obelisk of Portland stone topped by a globe. A bronze winged Victory stands {{on top of the}} globe <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> raised, a laurel wreath in one hand. Two other bronze angels sit near the base of the monument, one on each side. There are adjacent shields, also of bronze, which list the names of the fallen soldiers of World War I. The Lewes War Memorial was unveiled and dedicated on 6 September 1922. It was rededicated on 1 March 1981, to include the deceased soldiers of World War II. On 29 October 1985, the monument was listed as a Grade II structure on the National Heritage List for England. A Grade II structure is deemed to be nationally important and of special interest.|$|E
25|$|Genie (born 1957) is the {{pseudonym}} for an American feral {{child who}} {{was a victim of}} severe abuse, neglect, and social isolation. Her circumstances are prominently recorded in the annals of linguistics and abnormal child psychology. When she was a baby her father concluded that she was severely mentally retarded, a view which intensified as she got older, causing him to dislike her and withhold care and attention. At approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months he decided to keep her as socially isolated as possible {{as a result of this}} belief, so from that time until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months he kept her locked alone in a room. During this time he almost always kept her strapped to a child's toilet or bound her in a crib <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and legs completely immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished. The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970.|$|E

500|$|A public announcement, {{posted on}} July 12, 2013, {{revealed}} {{plans for an}} ArtRave event {{the night before the}} release of Artpop, unveiling projects Gaga had been working on in collaboration with the Haus of Gaga, Dutch photographer duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson, performance artist Marina Abramović, and Koons.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Rod Hardy, making it his first credit for the series. Hardy was offered the role after an unknown individual working at The X-Files saw his TBS remake of the film High Noon. The parasitic creature {{that was used in}} the episode was created using animatronics and was designed to look like a banana slug. During the scene where the creature is inserted into Scully's back, the production crew created a false fiberglass back for Gillian Anderson. To create the illusion that the creature was crawling up the body, the fiberglass was placed on top of Anderson, and then the animatronic slug was pressed against the fake back. Anderson later described the scene as [...] "fun to shoot", although she also called it [...] "exhausting" [...] because she had to struggle on the bed, all the while tied down, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> being attached to the headboard and her legs to the footboard. Paul Rabwin later noted that he had several cameramen [...] "start to lose it" [...] during the scene.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for Billboard, Beyoncé stated that despite having another concept for the album, she was ultimately influenced by her fans to name the album 4. She described the number four as being [...] "special" [...] to her, as her and Jay-Z's birthday, several other family and friends' birthdays, and her wedding anniversary fall {{on the fourth day}} of the month. The cover of the standard edition was revealed on Beyoncé's website on May 18, 2011. Shot on the rooftop of the Hôtel Meurice in Paris, Beyoncé is looking into the distance <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> raised over her head, wearing smokey eye makeup, thick gold cuffs and a fox-fur stole by cult French designer Alexandre Vauthier, embellished with Swarovski crystals by the Lesage embroidery house. The cover of the deluxe edition was shown on June 16, where Beyoncé is dressed in a tight-fitting blue-purple dress by French designer Maxime Simoens, holding her hands in her hair. For its artwork, she opted for clothing made by lesser-known designers. The promotional and interior-package images for 4 were shot at the same time.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{portrait}} of Sigmund Freud in close-up, then shows a picture of Farmer's mother. The song's lyrics are subtitled.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Silence" [...] was {{directed}} by Nzingha Stewart before the video for [...] "All Night Long" [...] was shot. The video was shot in black and white, and features Burke in different outfits and dresses, {{as well as in}} a variety of sets with props. It begins with a couple of establishing shots of Burke of her posing with a balloon wearing and in another set where she is sitting on music speakers.

During the second verse, another set is introduced of Burke posing against a stuffed animal. During the bridge, Burke sings the lyrics standing in front of the camera without any props surrounding her; prior to sustaining a long note, Burke has her back to the camera and is nude from the waist up. During the final verse, Burke's anger and desperation is shown to be heightened, as she sings to her herself in the mirror and places more emphasis on her movement. The video ends with the singer nude from the waist up and facing the camera, covering herself <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> crossed over her chest.|$|E
