5|$|If {{you talk}} to people who perform a Burrakatha, you will see a huge {{difference}} in the way the older generation performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it... This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E

If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.|$|E

[...] I have reminded our architects that I will dismiss the first one who puts a V on a public building where a U is intended."

All night long I could hear his footsteps, alternating with music played quietly.|$|E

In 2000, she launched an online portal, Cineexplore for the production company. She explained, [...] "The portal takes into account every aspect of film-making. My role {{is that of a}} supervisor.

[...] During another interview with Der Spiegel, he added, [...] "For us {{it has always been}} a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the Internet.

However, according to W. Yourgrau and S.

By specifying some but not all aspects of both the initial and final conditions (the positions but not the velocities) <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> some inferences about the initial conditions from the final conditions, and it is this [...] "backward" [...] inference that can be seen as a teleological explanation.
