5|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, {{after leading}} the United States {{through much of}} the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt had {{suffered}} from polio since 1921 and had helped found and strongly supported the March of Dimes to fight that crippling disease, so the ten-cent piece was an obvious way of honoring a president popular for his war leadership. On May 3, Louisiana Representative James Hobson Morrison introduced a bill for a Roosevelt dime. On May 17, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. announced that the Mercury dime (also known as the Winged Liberty dime) would be replaced by a new coin depicting Roosevelt, to go into circulation {{about the end of the}} year. Approximately 90 percent of the letters received by Stuart Mosher, editor of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association), were supportive of the change, but he himself was not, arguing that the Mercury design <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> that the limited space on the dime would not do justice to Roosevelt; he advocated a commemorative silver dollar instead. Others objected that despite his merits, Roosevelt had not earned a place alongside Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, the only presidents honored on the circulating coinage to that point. As the Mercury design, first coined in 1916, had been struck for at least 25 years, it could be changed under the law by the Bureau of the Mint. No congressional action was required, though the committees of each house with jurisdiction over the coinage were informed.|$|E

"At one point, I asked Ellen Page {{before we}} started shooting, ‘hat do you think Juno listens to?’ And she said [...] She went on my computer, played the songs, and I {{fell in love with}} it. Diablo and I {{discussed}} putting a Moldy Peaches song in it where the characters would sing to each other. I got in touch with Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches and she started sending me her work, which <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> <b>and</b> that became a lot of the soundtrack." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{began to}} appear in small-budget films which did well with critics, such as 1997's drama Inventing the Abbotts, set in the late 1950s, in which she played the part of Eleanor, one of three daughters of the town millionaire, Lloyd Abbott. About her performance, {{director}} Ron Howard said, [...] "She not only <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity. She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty, and I guess I stored that information {{in the back of my}} brain".|$|E

The sets were magnificent-the forest set <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> <b>and</b> I don't really have any {{complaints}} about it. Everybody really outdid themselves on it." [...] Supervising producer David Livingston praised the prop and wardrobe departments for creating the array of [...] "cool-looking" [...] extras, while Michael Piller said that the whole episode was [...] "well produced". Taylor praised the premise, calling the idea [...] "irresistible" [...] and the overall episode [...] "delightful".|$|E

Arrangements were made for the two to be married in Arras, but on the first meeting Charles felt [...] "happiness and love enter his heart, for he saw that she <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> young, and thus he greatly desired to gaze at her and possess her". She did not yet speak French and may not have reflected the idealized beauty of the period, perhaps inheriting her mother's dark Italian features, then unfashionable, but Charles most certainly approved of her because the couple were married three days later. Froissart documented the royal wedding, joking about the lascivious guests at the feast and the [...] "hot young couple".|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{revolve around}} the pursuit of love, {{functioning}} as an ode to Fantasia's husband Kendall Taylor. Throughout the single, Fantasia reveals her personal [...] "journey to happiness" [...] by singing, [...] "When I met you, I met me too." [...] She also shares memories of her past heartbreaks using lyrics such as: “Listen to me when I tell you/Without him {{there would be no}} you/So yes, I thank my ex a little still." [...] The song ends with a spoken word monologue, in which Fantasia details the first time she met Taylor. This part of the track includes lines such as: [...] "I still remember the day, it <b>was</b> <b>beautiful.</b> <b>And</b> if I hadn’t went through the things I went through before then I wouldn’t know how special you are." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{previous}} years, {{the organizers}} {{had made the}} race easier for the Italian favorites by including fewer hard climbs. With the absence of Italian Francesco Moser from this edition, the race organizers included many famous and difficult climbs, such as the Gavia Pass. Moser himself stated that the route contained many difficult climbs and was not helping Italian cycling to prosper {{at a time when}} he believed it to be ailing. When asked about the route for the 1988 edition, [...] rider Bob Roll said [...] "Those sons of bitches put every mountain they could find in the race that year." [...] Three-time winner Gino Bartali also believed the route to be very difficult and in favor of non-Italian competitors. Gino Sala also felt the route was harsher than in years past and that the team time trial could influence the overall classification greatly. La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying it <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> well crafted but contained one flaw, in that the race did not finish in any major Italian city. He also expressed his delight with the uphill time trial to Valico del Vetriolo as well as the inclusion of the Stelvio, Rombo and Gavia mountain passes.|$|E

Gonzalez gave the {{performance}} an [...] "A" [...] and commented: [...] "While {{part of me}} {{would have said that}} pairing Rachel and Quinn for a duet would vocally be like putting a pit bull in a cage match with a Maltipoo, it actually worked! There was a surprisingly balanced and incredibly lovely tone." [...] All three writers of The Atlantic review praised the mash-up: Patrick Burns said it <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> <b>and</b> noted that [...] "the arrangement was clever, the ladies sounded great, and the song was placed perfectly into the plot of two characters who were restored a bit of their depth in this episode", Brown stated that the song was lovely, and Kevin Fallon felt that it was [...] "unexpectedly gorgeous and haunting", and noted that it was [...] "yet another example of how skilled the music directors are at these mash-ups." [...] Semigran felt that it was the best performance of the night, and TV Line Michael Slezak gave the piece an [...] "A", and said that it was a [...] "vocally and visually stunning set piece for the unlikeliest of duet partners." [...] Flandez commented that the song [...] "floated like gossamer between Rachel and Quinn as they beautifully poured the sentiments of ugly ducklings", and Futterman wrote, [...] "It's a poignant moment, and the inclusion of West Side Story 'I Feel Pretty' makes for a great pop/theater mash-up that reminds us of what Glee is at its heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1953 Maksakova {{received}} the notification of her 'retirement'. This came as an unpleasant surprise for the singer {{felt she was}} in superb shape, both physically and artistically. Rumours had it, some people at the Bolshoi decided to settle some old scores this way, now that Stalin, her much-feared patron, was now dead, {{and the name of}} Vera Davydova, another famous Soviet soprano, has been mentioned in this context. Lyudmila Maksakova refused to believe this, remembering the times when Davydova, who lived in a neighbouring dacha, helped her mother in difficult times. Davydova herself remembered her great rival with warmth. [...] "Maria Petrovna paid great attention to the way she looked. She <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> had excellent figure. Yet she kept herself perfectly fit, with strict diet and regular gymnastics ...

2500|$|In 465 BCE, the playwrights {{began using}} a {{backdrop}} or scenic wall, which hung or {{stood behind the}} orchestra, which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. It {{was known as the}} skênê (from which the word [...] "scene" [...] derives). The death of a character was always heard behind the skênê, for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience. Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience. In 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to skênê in the theatres. A paraskenia was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion. The proskenion ("in front of the scene") <b>was</b> <b>beautiful,</b> <b>and</b> was similar to the modern day proscenium.|$|E

2500|$|Women {{were often}} given a {{position}} of inferiority in sexual practice. Many of the texts discuss sex from a male point of view, and avoid discussing how sex could benefit women. Men were encouraged to not limit themselves to one woman, and were advised to have sex only with the woman who <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> had not had children. While the man had to please the woman sexually, she was still just an object. At numerous points during the Ishinpō, the woman {{is referred to as}} the [...] "enemy"; this was because the woman could cause him to spill semen and lose vitality. In later sexual texts from the Ming, women had lost all semblance of being human and were referred to as the [...] "other," [...] "crucible", or [...] "stove" [...] from which to cultivate vitality. [...] The importance of pleasing the woman was also diminished in later texts. The practice was known as Caibu (...) , as a man enters many women without ejaculation.|$|E
2500|$|Moakler {{started dating}} boxer Oscar De La Hoya in October 1997 {{and they moved}} in {{together}} in early 1998. Moakler and De La Hoya became engaged prior to the 1999 birth of their daughter, Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya (born March 29, 1999). Moakler has said [...] "it wasn't a planned pregnancy, but it was understood if it happened it <b>was</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> if it didn't that was fine too." [...] In September 2000, the relationship abruptly ended when Moakler, who was at home watching the Latin Grammy Awards on television, saw De La Hoya escorting another woman to the show. In December 2000, Moakler filed a $62.5 million palimony suit against her ex-fiancé, claiming he was an alcoholic, abusive to her and to their daughter, and that he used them [...] "as props to promote his public image." [...] The case was {{settled out of court}} in 2001 for an undisclosed amount. After the time of De La Hoya's split from Moakler, he had little contact with his daughter, although he continued to provide financial support.|$|E

Hilton was involved in creating a perfume line by Parlux Fragrances. Originally planned for a small release, high demand led to increased availability by December 2004. Its introduction was followed by a 47-percent increase in Parlux sales, primarily of the Hilton-branded perfume.
