6000|$|We {{owned the}} stroke with an indulgent smile. [...] "No, not exactly that. The truth {{is we have}} been very much {{interested}} by your notion--if it <b>was</b> <b>yours,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> altogether probable--and we have been turning its light upon our own experience, in what we should not so much call self-celebration as self-exploitation. One uses one's self as the stuff for knowledge of others, or for the solution of any given problem. There is no other way of getting at the answers to the questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Wife, we will try, {{though to}} see such high visions the spirit should be calm, <b>which</b> I fear <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> not--nay, <b>be</b> <b>not</b> angry. We will try, we will try. Sit here now, and gaze, and above all be silent while I say the {{appropriate}} spells." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, se√±or; my {{ears are}} {{accustomed}} {{to the sounds of}} the forests, <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> If you <b>were</b> watching I should still have no sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{creature}} of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I {{must be careful}} of you, my treasure: nerves like <b>yours</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> made for rough handling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now look here, Captain, {{though the}} thing is but begun at present, yet there is enough to show that one idea at least of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> feasible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} need to ask it," [...] replied Master de Cressi, [...] "and if you and that lean henchman of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> to blame, then say who is?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lau. Methinks <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> very hard, for a serving-man's. But where, in {{the name}} of wonder, have you learned to talk so courtly? You are a strange valet de chambre.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{imagine that}} this Derek of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{one of our}} leading sunbeams. Well, I suppose he could hardly be, if that's his mother and there is {{anything}} in heredity." ...|$|R
5000|$|A fat man, Heton was {{supposedly}} complimented {{by the king}} James I with the comment [...] "Fat men are apt to make lean sermons; but <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> lean, but larded with good learning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have become}} an enigma again. But <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the creed of a simpleton. You are playing with me--revealing your wisdom from beneath a veil of {{infantile}} guilelessness. I have no more to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What you too are {{beginning}} to suspect.... That other things may be conceivable even if they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> possible. That this life of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> everything. That it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> taken too seriously. Because ... there are better dreams!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "great {{fortunes}} {{even like}} <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> above {{the chances of}} the money-markets. Your fortune, or {{a great part of}} it, might go. What would happen to you then? You would be a pauper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My first German prisoner," [...] said Kurt, half seriously. [...] "Now, Miss Anderson, we must {{be doing}} things. We don't want to {{meet a lot of}} I.W.W.'s out here. My car is out of commission. I hope <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> broken." ...|$|R
5000|$|We have {{no doubt}} that Christians everywhere, in cities, towns, and villages, {{wherever}} the light of the Gospel shines, and especially boys and girls, will most willingly respond to Our entreaties to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> will <b>be</b> added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here are two hearts {{concerned}} in {{the affair}} already, {{and no one}} can foresee the consequences; but," [...] turning to Paul, [...] "describe, this miniature, if you please, for there are many in the vessel, and <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the only one that has been mislaid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Feemy, {{now just}} look at the matter this way, one moment: supposing now--only just for supposition--this lover of <b>yours</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the sort of man we all take him to be, and that he was to turn out false, or inconstant; suppose now it turned out he had another wife somewhere else--" ...|$|R
6000|$|And you, dark Senate of {{the public}} pen, [...] You may not, like yon tyrant, deal in spies. [...] Yours are the public acts of public men, [...] But <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> their {{household}} privacies. [...] I grant {{you one of the}} great Powers on earth, [...] But <b>be</b> <b>not</b> you the blatant traitors of the hearth.|$|R
6000|$|Said the prince, who {{despite all}} efforts could not entirely shake off his unhappy habit of being modest, [...] "Those very {{delicate}} hands of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> fit to ply the pankha.[FN#64] Why {{do you take}} so much trouble? I am cool and refreshed {{by the sight of}} you. Do give the fan to me and sit down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear child, I do {{wish you}} would ever think to get any thing for yourself," [...] said Mrs. Ames. [...] "I cannot consent to use up all your earnings, as I have done lately, and all Ellen's too; {{you must have a}} new dress this spring, and that bonnet of <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> decent any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} should {{conclude}} that, because Mr. Shiner wants a different music, he has any ill-feeling for you. I myself, I must own, prefer organ-music to any other. I consider it most proper, and feel justified in endeavouring to introduce it; but then, although other music is better, I don't say <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is useless," [...] {{he replied}} curtly. [...] "I am sorry for you. We all {{understand}} your feelings, that <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{the principles of}} the border. If you had lived long here you could appreciate what these outlaws and renegades have done to us. This man is a hardened criminal; he is a thief, a murderer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jean and Peter Stein," [...] said Henri. [...] "Why, Jacques, <b>are</b> they <b>not</b> {{friends of}} <b>yours?</b> <b>are</b> they <b>not</b> sons of Michael Stein, the smith?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} keeping our end up," [...] he said, [...] "in the {{legitimate}} branch of our profession. You needn't grin like that," [...] he added, a little irritably. [...] "There is a legitimate side, and a very wonderful side, only a brain like <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> capable of assimilating it. You should have heard my paper to-night upon self-directed mesmeric waves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} where the joke comes in," [...] she said, and took the Hoppers away to a distance, where the Horners could not hear them. [...] "You know," [...] she then explained, [...] "those neighbors of <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> very bright, poor things, and {{what they think is}} a joke isn't a joke at all--it's true, don't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you call}} this a nosegay?' said Elizabeth, 'I call it a forest of flowers. Really, a Consecration opens people's hearts;--I do <b>not</b> mean that <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> open enough on {{ordinary}} occasions, Aunt Anne; but when the children took their walk in the alms-house court this morning, they were loaded with flowers from all quarters, beginning with old Mr. Dillon offering Winifred his best variegated dahlia, by name Dod's Mary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|A cry of [...] "Shame!" [...] {{arose from}} the entire body of spectators; when it abated Rupert said, quietly but clearly, [...] "My prayers are said, Captain Muller. If <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> say them now, for assuredly I will kill you--not as a dog, for a dog is a true and {{faithful}} animal, but as I would kill a tiger, or any other beast whose existence was a scourge to mankind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, ha, ha!" [...] Mr. Jones {{let out a}} ghostly, squeaky laugh. [...] "I've {{never been}} placed in such a ridiculous {{position}} before," [...] he went on, with a sepulchral equanimity of tone. [...] "It's you, Martin, who dragged me into it. However, it's my own fault too. I ought to--but I was really too bored to use my brain, and <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be</b> trusted. You are a hothead!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but this}} of <b>yours,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> {{supposed}} to be an attack upon him, I don't understand. Of course, if originality counts--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have that}} pleasure," [...] he said quietly. [...] "Mr. Maddison is a {{neighbor}} of <b>yours,</b> <b>is</b> he <b>not?</b> I met him, you know, on a certain very melancholy occasion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are you?' said Louis, wearily. 'I don't think I am. It becomes my duty--or <b>yours,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a relief--to {{find out}} the next stage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope {{it may be}} so," [...] said Sihamba; [...] "yet, Father of Swallow, I pray {{you send}} me not away from her who bought me at a great price, and to whom my life belongs. Look; I cost you but little to keep, and that little I can earn by {{doctoring}} your horses and cattle, in which art I have some skill, as you know well. Moreover I have many eyes and ears that can see and hear things to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> deaf and blind, and I tell you that I think a time will come when I shall {{be able to do}} service to all of you who are of the nest of the Swallow. Now, if she bids me to go I will go--for <b>am</b> I <b>not</b> her servant to obey?--yet I beseech you do not so command her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Humphreys {{shook her}} head. [...] "I have nursed them both, sir, {{and which is}} mine and <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>yours</b> I could <b>not</b> say to save my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, I {{hardly know}} which are {{my own hands}} and <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>yours,</b> they have got so mixed up together," [...] she said, {{withdrawing}} her own very suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|... ‚ÄúThus {{to lose a}} crown,‚Äù {{says the}} young prince, {{starting}} up, and speaking French in his eager way; ‚Äúto lose the loveliest woman in the world; to lose the loyalty of such hearts as <b>yours,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> this, my lords, enough of humiliation?‚ÄîMarquis, if I go on my knees will you pardon me?‚ÄîNo, I can‚Äôt do that, but I can offer you reparation, that of honour, that of gentlemen.

6000|$|... "Thus {{to lose a}} crown," [...] {{says the}} young Prince, {{starting}} up, and speaking French in his eager way; [...] "to lose the loveliest woman in the world; to lose the loyalty of such hearts as <b>yours,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> this, my lords, enough of humiliation?--Marquis, if I go on my knees will you pardon me?--No, I can't do that, but I can offer you reparation, that of honor, that of gentlemen.

5000|$|According to Malcolm, one of {{the ways}} in which the {{government}} had [...] "failed the Negro" [...] was its unwillingness to enforce the law. He pointed out that the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation, [...] "Whenever you are going after something that <b>is</b> <b>yours,</b> you <b>are</b> within your legal rights to lay claim to it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>yours,</b> <b>is</b> breaking the law is a criminal. And this was pointed out by the Supreme Court decision. It outlawed segregation. Which means a segregationist is breaking the law". But, he said, the police department and local government often sided with segregationists against the Civil Rights Movement.|$|R
