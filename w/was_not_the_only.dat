5|$|Dewey's <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> library {{classification}} available, {{although it was}} the most complete. Charles Ammi Cutter published the Expansive Classification in 1882, with initial encouragement from Melvil Dewey. Cutter's system was not adopted by many libraries, with one major exception: it was used {{as the basis for the}} Library of Congress Classification system.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{first major}} success came with Life of Savage, {{but it was}} not his first biography; Savage was the fourth in a series which also {{included}} biographies of Jean-Philippe Baratier, Robert Blake and Francis Drake. Although it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> biography that appeared immediately after Savage's death, it became the most popular, and it embodied Johnson's ideas on what a biography should be.|$|E
5|$|Life is Worth Living <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> DuMont {{program to}} achieve double-digit ratings. In 1952, Time {{magazine}} reported that popular DuMont game show Down You Go had attracted an audience estimated at 16 million viewers. Similarly, DuMont's summer 1954 replacement series, The Goldbergs, achieved audiences estimated at 10 million. Still, these series were only moderately popular compared to NBC's and CBS's highest-rated programs.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{company to}} report TV ratings, however. Companies such as Trendex, Videodex and Arbitron had also {{measured}} TV viewership. The adjacent chart comes from Videodex's August 1950 ratings breakdown, {{as reported in}} Billboard magazine.|$|E

The Saunders-Roe company of the United Kingdom, which had already built an experimental flying boat jet fighter, first flying in 1947 the SR.A/1, tendered a design for a ski-equipped fighter, but little came of it.|$|E

5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, {{in the form of}} a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but he regretted the {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. He did get a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E
5|$|Although the Poitevin <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{breed of}} horse {{used for the}} {{production}} of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide. They were in high demand in the United States from the late 19th century until the beginning of World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline. In the Deux-Sèvres region, especially in the district of Melle, near Luçon and Saint-Maixent, mule breeding began to be concentrated in ateliers (workshops), which were relatively expensive for breeders.|$|E

5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned {{so as not to}} damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|As was customary, {{the treaty}} {{would have to}} be {{approved}} by the nobles and knights of both lands. The meeting between the nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 in the town of Nakło, where they confirmed the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> decision made by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E
5|$|Babcock {{was married}} twice, first to Elsie, then to Dorothy, a woman nearly thirty {{years his junior}} whom he met when she {{was taking care of}} his first wife while she was dying. Babcock had one son (Jack Jr.) and one {{daughter}} (Sandra). One grandchild, Matt, was an army dentist in Iraq during the Iraq War. John and Dorothy resided in Spokane, Washington, where Babcock lived from 1932 until his death. Babcock <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> centenarian in his family; his younger sister Lucy died in July 2007 at the age of 102.|$|E

5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} {{their first}} album with Sire, Uncle Tupelo needed a drummer. Farrar and Tweedy interviewed twenty-four candidates and were both impressed with Ken Coomer and Bill Belzer. Belzer was chosen and Uncle Tupelo embarked on the European {{segment of the}} promotional tour for March 16–20, 1992 as the opening act for Sugar. Belzer was dismissed from the band after six months, and Coomer was hired as his permanent replacement. Coomer <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> new member added after the tour—Uncle Tupelo sought to expand beyond a trio for the Anodyne recording sessions. They recruited multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston and bassist John Stirratt—Stirratt's presence enabled Tweedy to become a full-time guitarist on the songs that he wrote.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the team {{departed}} for Australia in late March they had played 74 matches in Britain, winning 49, losing 20, and drawing 5. However, due to injury, Warbrick only appeared in 14 matches; in contrast David Gage featured in 68, and eight other members played more than 50. Warbrick <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> player to experience injury; the taxing schedule of matches took a toll, and he frequently struggled to find {{a full complement of}} 15 fit players. On top of playing relatively few matches in Britain, Warbrick scored only once there – a conversion against Devon.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Solander {{was living}} in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, {{promising}} Solander his oldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768–71. Solander <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, {{one of them to}} South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Ewbank {{learned of}} the {{television}} problems {{in the locker room}} when he received a telephone call from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact {{that the end of the}} game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.|$|E
5|$|In late November, after most of {{the initial}} talk and {{speculation}} about the video, its creator and purpose had died down, a Twitter account was opened under the name Parker Warner Wright.
