However, {{because of high}} <b>windload</b> in Hong Kong for such a super high-rise building, every increase in building height by a metre would increase the structural cost by more than HK$1 million (HK$304,800 per ft). Therefore, a comprehensive study was conducted and finally a floor height of 3.6 m was adopted. With this issue alone, an estimated construction cost saving {{for a total of}} 58 office floors, would be around HK$30 million. Yet at the same time, a maximum ceiling height of 2.6 m in office area could still be achieved with careful coordination and dedicated integration.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a probabilistic analysis approach applied in {{finite element analysis}} for modelling of 3 D transmission tower with different parameters. The {{aim of this study}} analyse the transmission tower using Probabilistic Design System (PDS) to obtain a transmission tower that is sustainable and long term life. Furthermore, the transmission tower is also conducted under Eurocode 3 checking that is steel design. In probabilistic analysis, the results of probabilistic density function, cumulative distribution function, sample history plot, histogram plot and sensitivity plot for any input and output can be obtained. The transmission tower is analysed at 45 and 10000 simulations. The scope for this study is by using ANSYS as a software modelling process based on Finite Element Analysis and the selection of a 3 D transmission tower structure based on the existing dimensions. From the Eurocode 3 checking, the structure is examined under tension, compression, bending moment resistance, shear resistance, compression buckling and lateral buckling. The green colour represents that all the members in the structure pass the checking while red colour indicates failure in the particular member. In addition, the results extracted from the simulation of 3 D transmission tower model using ANSYS software are gathered and analysed to form a conclusion. There are two sources of data which are input and output parameters. There are eight input parameters which are DEADLOAD 1, DEADLOAD 2, DENS, ELASTIC, POISSON, TEMP, <b>WINDLOAD</b> 1 and <b>WINDLOAD</b> 2. In this thesis, Monte Carlo Simulation and Response Surface simulation was used to analyse the effect of parameter on the transmission tower structure. From the corresponding graphs, the values for mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, minimum and maximum relative frequency can be obtained. In conclusion, there are some limitations in this study where the literature review that is related is difficult to be found. However, it is proved that ANSYS software is capable to get results for reaction forces, deformation, axial forces, and maximum deflection by probabilistic analysis for transmission tower structures...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaf 87. The {{available}} {{methods of}} calculating {{the effects of}} earthquakes on viaduct-type bridges with continuous decks and tall piers are examined. Particular emphasis is laid {{on the use of}} a relatively quick method of analysis using response spectra and taking account of the effects of damping. The use of this method is illustrated by applying it to a mathematical model representing a real. bridge. Manual calculations are performed and refined by the application of Rayleigh's Principle. A number of variations to the configuration of the model are analysed by the computer programme "SAP IV" under earthquake excitation in each of three mutually perpendicular directions. The computed results are compared with those obtained by manual calculation. The earthquake loading effects are compared with the effects of deadload, traffic loading and <b>windload</b> and there is a discussion on the design of suitable structural configurations to contend with seismic loading.

Pole calculated the wind loading required to overturn the lightest carriage in the train (the second-class carriage) to be less than that needed to overturn the bridge; whereas Law - taking credit for more passengers in the carriage than Pole and for the high girders partially shielding carriages from the wind - had reached the opposite conclusion.|$|R
2500|$|The {{programmatic}} {{requirements of}} this complex shaped decisions about structure and materials. Designing the structural system and cable-stayed roof was a feat for Geiger Engineers. The structural engineers developed this structural envelope {{due to the}} necessity for a clear span- limiting chlorine from damaging building materials. A clear spanned space {{proved to be the}} solution that answered the need for minimal maintenance and avoidance of damage to structural elements. The engineers chose to place the pool and rink end-to–end, so that they would serve, structurally speaking as counterweights of a seesaw. At the midpoint are the “linchpins”: the two 130-foot masts from which the roof is suspended. [...] The masts are composed of 1-¼” plates that are stacked at the junction of the pool and rink. The masts are designed so that as they soar through the roof, the diameter narrows to accommodate lateral movement. [...] In order to support the 120-foot-by-230-foot clear spans, twelve cables were extended from each mast to specific connection points on the roof. The twelve 3-inch diameter A586 strand cables are critical elements in connecting the masts to the roof. To keep the roof from lifting, the roof is decked in concrete planks that counteract <b>windloads.</b> The concrete planks sit on longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the envelope.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{wind effect}} on the Fresnel {{technology}} {{is one of the}} main design stresses for the metallic structure, primary reflectors, receivers and solar tracking system. Therefore,in order to quantify its impact and compare it to a more mature technology(the Parabolic Trough),a first study of the wind load on a Linear Fresnel Reflector(LFR) collector with an air-stable absorber tube receiver (with protective cover glass) has been undertaken. The drag, lift and momentum coefficients of the receiver and primary reflectors have been calculated using a bi-dimensional CFD model based on the COMSOL Multiphysics® software. The impact of the transversal wind speed has been studied. Moreover, the interaction between the receiver and the primary reflectors has been quantified. Finally, a comparison to Parabolic Trough collectors has been made, which confirms the much lower <b>windload</b> of LFR technology for an equal mirror aperture area, and thus the much lighter structures required for resisting these wind loads and/or the larger operation range with respect to wind speed...|$|E
