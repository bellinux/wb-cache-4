5|$|After Burebista's death, {{the empire}} {{he had created}} {{dissolved}} into smaller kingdoms. From the reign of Tiberius to Domitian, Dacian activity was reduced into a defensive state. The Romans abandoned plans of mounting an invasion against Dacia. In 86 AD, however, the king Decebalus successfully re-united the Dacian kingdom under his control. Domitian attempted a hasty invasion against the Dacians <b>which</b> <b>ended</b> in disaster. A second invasion later brought peace between Rome and Dacia for nearly a decade, until in 98 AD Trajan became emperor. Trajan also pursued two conquests of Dacia, the first in 101–102 AD which concluded in a Roman victory. Decebalus was forced to agree to harsh terms of peace, but did not honour them. This sparked a second invasion of Dacia in 106 AD <b>which</b> <b>ended</b> {{the independence of the}} Dacian kingdom, and brought about its break-up.|$|E
