5|$|Climate {{research}} on live coral species {{is limited to}} a few studied species. Studying Porites coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations that is much simpler to physically extract data in comparison to Platygyra species where the complexity of Platygyra species skeletal structure creates difficulty when physically sampled, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> {{to be one of the}} only multidecadal living coral records used for coral paleoclimate modeling.|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction. This is usually deferred until 24–48hours after admission, when the patient is stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but may need to happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (<b>which</b> <b>happens</b> in 15% of cases).|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebee is {{the name}} of a {{prominent}} character in the Transformers franchise. His name denotes his black-on-yellow vehicle paint job, directly referencing the bee genus because of its black and yellow stripes. Bumblebee is also the name of an automotive racing stripe that wraps around the grill instead of down the centre of the vehicle; it can be found mainly on Chevrolet Camaros (<b>which</b> <b>happens</b> to be the Transformers Autobot's most popular vehicle mode).|$|E
5|$|One aetosaur, Typothorax coccinarum, {{has been}} used to define the Revueltian land {{vertebrate}} faunachron. A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a tetrapod index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and Early Jurassic terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago. The Revueltian ends with the next FAD, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> to be that of the phytosaur Redondasaurus and the start of the Apachean LVF.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians have a thick, double coat. While {{grooming}} is not difficult, breeders {{recommend that}} it be done daily to maintain {{the quality of the}} coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> twice a year.|$|E

5|$|In {{the year}} 200X, robots {{developed}} to assist mankind are commonplace {{thanks to the}} efforts of renowned robot designer Dr. Light. However, one day these robots go out of control and start attacking the populace, among them six advanced humanoid robots made by Dr. Light for industrial purposes: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man. He realizes the culprit is his old rival Dr. Wily (who plots to take over the world), but is unsure of what to do. His helper robot Rock, having a strong sense of justice, offers to be converted into a fighting robot to stop Dr. Wily's plan, becoming Mega Man. In time, he defeats the six robots and recovers their central cores, then confronts Dr. Wily within his Pacific-based robot factory (<b>which</b> <b>happens</b> to be mass-producing Light's robots). After a final showdown, Wily is defeated and Mega Man returns to his family.|$|E
5|$|Rachel crashes her {{car into}} Adam's on a {{supermarket}} car park. After a brief argument Adam suggests they exchange phone numbers, under the pretence {{that it is}} for insurance purposes. She writes hers on his rear windscreen but rain washes it off. Prompted by Pete, Adam spends {{a day on the}} supermarket car park, in the hope that he and Rachel will cross paths, but they do not meet. At a dinner party held by Karen and David, Karen suggests Rachel get out more and advises her to call Adam. They go on a date but Adam is disappointed that Rachel does not want sex. Eventually, he suggests they see a play, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> to be on at a theatre near his house. The play is dismal but Rachel decides it is time they slept together. Jenny takes another pregnancy test, but it is negative. Adam arrives and recounts his dates with Rachel to her and Pete, telling them he loves Rachel.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} bicycling {{included}} a suspension ramp {{that would allow}} bicyclists to leave the Big Four Bridge without dismounting their bikes. Due {{to the length of}} time any new downtown bridge would take to be built, and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to get across the Ohio River when the George Rogers Clark Bridge is closed, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> yearly during Thunder Over Louisville, bicyclists preferred the idea of converting the Big Four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or the Clark Bridge. By mid-July 2009, work had begun to convert the bridge to a pedestrian walkway. With the approach ramps, the bridge upon completion of work was to span about 1 mile. In February 2013, pedestrians were allowed to access the completed bridge from the ramp on the Kentucky side with construction still continuing on the Indiana ramp. The Indiana ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Lighting along the bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents. Originally, the lighting was to be similar to those on the Kentucky side, which has computer-controlled lights that can show various colors. The Indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties.|$|E

5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of methane. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, <b>which</b> <b>happens</b> on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E
