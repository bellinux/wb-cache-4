5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> in 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E

30|$|The {{security}} {{challenges in}} IoT systems {{are related to}} security issues arising in the different IoT layers. Physical damage, hardware failure, and power limitations <b>are</b> <b>challenges</b> faced in the physical layer. DoS attacks, sniffing, gateway attacks, and unauthorized access <b>are</b> <b>challenges</b> relevant to the network layer. Malicious code attacks, application vulnerabilities, and software bugs <b>are</b> <b>challenges</b> faced in the application layer [33].|$|R

5|$|Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay Archipelago was {{gradually}} {{taken over by}} the European colonial powers, beginning {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese at Malacca in 1509. The early dominance of the Portuguese <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> during the 17th century by the Dutch, who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most important product. Other colonial powers, including the British, were limited to a relatively minor presence.|$|E
5|$|Britain <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> {{again by}} France under Napoleon, in a {{struggle}} that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations. It was not only Britain's position {{on the world stage}} that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E

50|$|When the Bill of Rights is {{directly}} applied in disputes governed by legislation, conduct must <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> before law. In other words, {{the implementation of}} the statute must <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> before the provisions of the statute itself.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{books have}} also <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> for attacking or disagreeing with {{religious}} truths. On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin has <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> and suppressed since its publication {{due to its}} groundbreaking theories on Evolution. In 1925, the Butler Act was enacted in Tennessee, banning the teaching of evolutionary theories statewide. Other works, such as the Harry Potter series, have also <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> thanks to themes that are perceived to promote witchcraft and the occult.|$|R
5|$|Following his graduation, Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky {{with no clear}} direction in his life. He began to amuse himself by attending various parties and other social engagements. During {{a visit to the}} state capital, he so offended one man that he <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> to a duel. Though he obtained two pistols, he never accepted the man's challenge, and was branded a coward. The dispute was later settled in the Masonic Lodge of which both Breckinridge and the other man were members.|$|E
5|$|Gerrha – {{inhabited}} by Chaldean exiles from Babylon – controlled the Incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised {{control over the}} trading of aromatics to Babylon in the 1st century BCE. The Nabateans exercised control over the routes along the Incense Route, and their hold <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> – without success – by Antigonus Cyclops, emperor of Syria. The Nabatean control over trade further increased and spread in many directions.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped {{out of the back of}} the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. Largely because of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited {{became part of the}} Cat Tien National Park in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the reintroduction of condors to the Grand Canyon <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} season, Orr <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> by the veterans, and he earned respect by {{defeating}} Montreal tough guy Ted Harris {{in his first}} NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees {{for the first time}} in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17–43–10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans.|$|E

5|$|Jost Hite, a German immigrant, {{purchased}} a large land grant {{in the northern}} Shenandoah Valley in 1731. Peter Stephens and a small party of German Protestants from Heidelberg, in the Palatinate, arrived about 1732 to buy and settle that land, including the site of what became Stephens City, named for the Stephens family. Although Hite's title to the land <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, the land baron of the area, the matter was settled amicably.|$|E
5|$|Kapeau {{served in}} the Privy Council as an advisor to the king from 1847 until 1854, the year of Kamehameha III's death. He {{also served as a}} member of the House of Nobles from 1848 to 1855. His {{appointment}} <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> by Hawaiian historian and fellow Lahainaluna classmate Samuel Kamakau who regarded his rank of Kaukaualiʻi (low-ranking chief) as too inferior for him to sit as a noble. By the 1850s, however, the House of Nobles consisted mainly of Kaukaualiʻi.|$|E
5|$|Mandela {{stepped down}} as ANC President at the party's December 1997 conference. He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed him, believing Mbeki to be too {{inflexible}} and intolerant of criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless. Mandela and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President. Zuma's candidacy <b>was</b> <b>challenged</b> by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party, although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.|$|E

After the battle, the Yugoslav naval operations were effectively limited to the southern Adriatic.|$|E
