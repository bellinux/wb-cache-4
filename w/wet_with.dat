30|$|Thirty-six rats were studied. Two {{circular}} 5 mm diameter bony defect {{were formed}} in the calvaria using a trephine bur. The bony defect were grafted with Bio-Oss® only (group 1, n[*]=[*] 9), Bio-Oss® <b>wetted</b> <b>with</b> rhBMP- 2 (group 2, n[*]=[*] 9), Bio-Oss® <b>wetted</b> <b>with</b> rhBMP- 2 and 1 mM alendronate (group 3, n[*]=[*] 9) and Bio-Oss® <b>wetted</b> <b>with</b> rhBMP- 2 and 10 mM alendronate (group 4, n[*]=[*] 9). In each group, three animals were euthanized at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after surgery, respectively. The specimens were then analyzed by histology, histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry analysis.|$|R

5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B.brownii itself. It is cool and <b>wet,</b> <b>with</b> temperatures between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in shale in gullies.|$|E
5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} <b>wet,</b> <b>with</b> foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Except for {{a central}} portion of New South Wales, August was fairly dry.

Buchanan arrived at 11:30, but could not approach due to the heavy port list.

25|$|As skirts became {{narrower}} and flatter in front, {{more emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the waist and hips. A corset was therefore used to help mold the body to the desired shape. This was achieved by making the corsets longer than before, and by constructing them from separate shaped pieces of fabric. To increase rigidity, they were reinforced with many strips of whalebone, cording, or pieces of leather. As well as making corsets more constricting, this heavy structure helped prevent them from riding up, or from wrinkling at the waist. Steam-molding also helped create a curvaceous contour. Developed by Edwin Izod in the late 1860s, the procedure involved placing a corset, <b>wet</b> <b>with</b> starch, on a steam heated copper torso form until it dried into shape. While tight lacing continued to be a hotly debated topic among moralists and physicians, most extreme descriptions came from male sexual fantasies.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{character}} of Tibullus the historical man is unclear, {{the character}} of his poetic persona is reflected in his works. He was an amiable man of generous impulses and unselfish disposition, loyal to his friends to the verge of self-sacrifice (as is shown by his leaving Delia to accompany Messalla to Asia), and apparently constant to his mistresses. His tenderness towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy which are rare among the ancients. When treated cruelly by his love, he does not invoke curses upon her head. Instead he goes to her little sister’s grave, hung so often with his garlands and <b>wet</b> <b>with</b> his tears, to bemoan his fate. His ideal is a quiet retirement {{in the country with}} the loved one at his side. He has no ambition and not even a poet's yearning for immortality. In an age of crude materialism and gross superstition, he was religious in the old Roman way. His clear, finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him, in the judgment of Quintilian, ahead of other elegiac writers. For natural grace and tenderness, for exquisiteness of feeling and expression, he stands alone. He rarely overloads his lines with Alexandrian learning. However, his range is limited. Tibullus is smoother and more musical, but liable to become monotonous; Propertius, with occasional harshnesses, is more vigorous and varied. In many of Tibullus's poems a symmetrical composition can be traced.|$|E

A midline skin incision was performed on the skull, and the periosteum with the temporalis muscle was reflected laterally. Two symmetrical round 5 mm diameter bony defects were then formed in the calvaria using 5 mm diameter trephine (Hee Sung Corp., Seoul, Korea).

Then, the muscle layer was closed with 4 – 0 Vicryl® sutures in a continuous fashion, and the skin with 3 - 0 VicrylⓇ sutures. Gentamycin at 5 mg/kg was injected for prevention of infection after surgery. The animals from each group were sacrificed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after surgery.
