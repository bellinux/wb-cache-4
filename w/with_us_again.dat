50|$|There was a {{military}} strategy behind the decision. Settlers would provide support for the fort at Penetanguishene by providing food and other local supplies, and, if the war <b>with</b> the <b>U.S.</b> <b>again</b> broke out, the trained militiamen could be armed to defend the region.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{the point}} of La Tremblade!" [...] he cried. [...] "I had not thought that we were as far as Oleron.

6000|$|... "What will {{everybody}} {{think at}} home," [...] said Mrs. Docimer, [...] "when {{they know that}} you're <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>again?</b> What chance is she to have if you follow her about in this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a bit}} of an upset," [...] he admits. Then shaking himself free of care, he adds, cheerfully, [...] "But I guess I {{taught him}} the price of chalk. He won't {{interfere}} <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>again,</b> I'm thinking." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1924, Findlay was {{selected}} to the U.S. soccer team which competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics. He played in both U.S. games, a win over Estonia followed by a second round loss to Uruguay. Findlay did not play <b>with</b> the <b>U.S.</b> <b>again</b> until the 1928 Summer Olympics. At that tournament, the U.S. lost its first game to Argentina. Following its elimination from the Olympics, the U.S. played one exhibition game, a 3-3 tie with Poland.|$|R

60|$|After Tuppy had gone, some {{extremely}} flattering {{things were}} said about his intelligence and resource, {{and there was}} a disposition to draw rather invidious comparisons between him and Bertram. Painful for me, of course, but the ordeal didn't last long, for it couldn't have been more than five minutes before he was <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Sikes, as {{he resumed}} his seat, 'if you'll give us {{something}} {{to eat and drink}} while we're waiting, you'll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events.

60|$|Henry {{was doing}} {{little or nothing}} here, and I sent him to our clerk to work his way for a trip, by {{measuring}} wood piles, counting coal boxes, and other clerkly duties, which he performed satisfactorily.

50|$|SR 19 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 1/SR 4 north of Alma.

60|$|During the {{composition}} of these papers, more messengers than one came from the Palace regarding {{the state of the}} august patient there lying. At mid-day she was somewhat better; at evening the torpor again seized her, and she wandered in her mind. At night Dr. A---- was <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>again,</b> with a report rather more favorable: no instant danger at any rate was apprehended. In {{the course of the last}} two years her Majesty had had many attacks similar, but more severe.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that {{in the course of}} earthly greatness a day of culminating triumph is often paid for by a morrow of sudden extinction. Let us hope it is so. Yet the dawn of that day of retribution may be a long time breaking above a dark horizon. War is with us now; and, whether this one ends soon or late, war will be <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>again.</b> And it is the way of true wisdom for men and States to take account of things as they are.|$|E

50|$|A three-day {{break is}} now had by Semmes, {{ample time to}} ensure that enough {{torching}} materials have been provisioned. Breaking the short lull, September 13 brings another sail sighted, and it's up <b>with</b> the <b>U.S.</b> colors <b>again</b> as the Altamaha out of New Bedford, another whaler, heaves to without chase. The now traditional blaze is made, and CSS Alabama overtakes yet another foreign ship in the evening, a Spaniard vessel.|$|R
50|$|Continuing as Flatbush Road {{into the}} Town of Ulster, NY 32 {{is for the}} first time along its route east of US 9W and closer to the river. It {{encounters}} NY 199 at an interchange immediately west of the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge. Soon after, it passes Kingston-Ulster Airport. It remains on a northerly heading until 1 mi south of Saugerties, where it veers west and merges <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 9W <b>again.</b> The two routes cross Esopus Creek and enter the village, where Partition Street gives way to Main Street. At that T intersection, US 9W turns to continue north, while NY 32 picks up the new NY 212 and heads west out of town.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of it," [...] I {{answered}} gloomily, [...] "but the thought has brought me no hope. Ramiro {{is not to be}} trusted.

Alas!" [...] I ended in despair, [...] "there is nothing to be done but to let things run their course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{other thing}} surprises us in those Old Pamphlets," [...] says my Constitutional Friend: [...] "How the phrase, 'Cause of Liberty' ever and anon turns up, with great though extinct emphasis, evidently sincere. After groping, one is {{astonished}} {{to find it}} means Support of the House of Austria; keeping of the Hapsburgs entire in their old Possessions among mankind! That, to our great-grandfathers, was the 'Cause of Liberty;'--said 'Cause' being, <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>again,</b> Electoral Suffrage and other things; a notably different definition, perhaps still wider of the mark.|$|E
6000|$|My father, white-haired, eighty-two {{years of}} age was living <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>again,</b> basking {{in the light of}} our fire and smiling at his grandchildren, who with lithe limbs and sweet young voices were singing and {{circling}} before him. I was glad to have him back in mother's room, and to him and to those who were to be his care-takers for the winter I gravely repeated, [...] "I want everything kept just as it is. I want to feel that we can come back to it at any time and find every object in place, including the fire." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the parkway}} leaves Clifton, it heads into Elmwood Park by {{crossing}} the Passaic River. Exit 156, which comes before the river, is for US 46 and Route 20. There is also access to Route 21 {{just south of}} the interchange. Cedar Lawn Cemetery is also located northbound along Route 20 from exit 156. As the parkway continues to the northeast, it connects <b>with</b> <b>US</b> 46 <b>again</b> in Garfield. Riverside Cemetery is accessible off exit 157 by going east along US 46. At exit 159, the parkway connects with I-80 in Saddle Brook. Going southbound, there is also access to CR 67 (Midland Avenue). The Bergen Toll Plaza is next, before crossing over Saddle River County Park.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, King Saud, {{the eldest son}} of King Abdulaziz, came to power after his father's death. During Saud's time the U.S.-Saudi {{relations}} had faced many obstacles concerning the anti-communism strategy. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's new anti-Soviet alliance combined most of [...] "the kingdom's regional rivals and foes", which heightened Saudi suspicions. For this reason, in October 1955, Saud had joined the pro-Soviet strategy with Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Furthermore, Saud dismissed the U.S. forces and replaced them by Egyptian forces. Thus, this act had sparked and innovated a new and a large conflict in the relationship. But in 1956, during the Suez crisis, Saud began to cooperate <b>with</b> the <b>U.S.</b> <b>again</b> after Eisenhower's opposition of the Israeli, British, and French plan to seize the canal. Eisenhower opposed the plan because of anti-Soviet purposes, but King Saud had admired the act and decided to start cooperating <b>with</b> the <b>U.S.</b> As a result, Egyptian power greatly declined while US-Saudi relations were simultaneously improving.|$|R

He {{disappeared}} several years later when, by now an old man, he made a trip to Mexico City to plead for reaffirmation of the land grant to his people which local Mexican landowners were seeking to overturn.
