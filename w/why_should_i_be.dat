25|$|Esme {{worked as}} a {{secretary}} and {{was working in the}} field of magazine publishing at the time when she started MRG. She raised her eldest son on her own without ever being married, which was an unusual thing to do at the time. In 1958 she wrote a semi-autobiographical book called <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> Dismayed under the pseudonym of Ann Bruce, which describes her life from being in the A.T.S in occupied Germany to being a single parent and living in the conservative post second world war era.|$|E
25|$|We {{abuse the}} Holocaust {{when it becomes}} a cudgel against others who have their claims of suffering. The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The Shoah has become our instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should I join a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler {{is a far cry}} from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable {{responses}} [...] "I am not frightened of dying. [...] Any time will do: I don't mind. [...] <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> frightened of dying? There's no reason for it– you've got to go sometime" [...] and closing words [...] "there is no dark side in the moon, really. [...] As {{a matter of fact}} it's all dark" [...] came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll. [...] Paul and Linda McCartney were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be [...] "trying too hard to be funny", and were not included on the album. [...] McCartney's Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line [...] "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time".|$|E

500|$|Jennifer Vineyard of MTV {{said the}} song [...] "might {{have been a}} {{stronger}} album leadoff track than 'Gimme More', [...] since [...] re-introduces herself {{at the top and}} apologizes for being gone for so long." [...] Kelefe Sanneh of The New York Times said the song was [...] "nearly as good" [...] as [...] previous singles [...] "Gimme More" [...] and [...] "Piece of Me", and described it as a [...] "rave-inspired flirtation". A reviewer from the Ottawa Citizen said that [...] "here's also a lot to like about Break The Ice, <b>Why</b> <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> <b>Be</b> Sad and Perfect Love". Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel said that [...] "Musically, songs such as 'Piece of Me,' 'Radar' and 'Break the Ice' are one-dimensional, robotic exercises." [...] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe called it [...] "numbing club filler." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be ashamed of yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

2500|$|He {{went on to}} say:The Constitution {{was handed}} down to guide us {{by a bunch of}} wise old dead white guys who invented our country! Now some flinch when I say that. Why! It's true-they were white guys! So were most of the guys that died in Lincoln's name {{opposing}} slavery in the 1860s. So <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> ashamed of white guys? Why is [...] "Hispanic Pride" [...] or [...] "Black Pride" [...] a good thing, while [...] "White Pride" [...] conjures shaven heads and white hoods? Why was the Million Man March on Washington celebrated by many as progress, while the Promise Keepers March on Washington was greeted with suspicion and ridicule?
