25|$|Australian needed 191 runs {{to win and}} did {{so without}} any great trouble. John Snow's first ball was a wide, but both he and the batsman Bill Lawry had to signal it before Umpire Brooks {{accepted}} it. His second over was hit for 12 runs by Keith Stackpole, who was caught and bowled by Ken Shuttleworth for 13. Ian Chappell made an awkward start and was out paced by Lawry, who made lots of quick singles until caught by Knott off Ray Illingworth (3/50), the only Englishman to bowl <b>with</b> <b>conviction</b> and Alan Knott took another catch and a stumping. With Snow taken off Ian Chappell 'went mad', hitting Illingworth for a six and a four and hooking and pulling Basil d'Oliveira for 26 runs in two overs, ending with 60 runs off 103 balls. Doug Walters made hay with 41 off 51 balls with 6 fours as he added 66 with Chappell for the third wicket.

500|$|Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph [...] {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, {{noting that the}} director turned a formula [...] "good defeats bad" [...] film into a modern-day neo-noir film where [...] "bad fights bad", and wrote, [...] "The new Don {{is more of a}} remix than remake with the scratchy edges smoothened out with grunge grooves and blistering beats. Farhan changes the backdrop and the background and yet manages to keep the original sequences and lines." [...] Gupta also praised the acting, [...] "eye-catching locations", cinematography, and production design, and thought that the [...] "breathtaking chase and action sequences" [...] broke new grounds on Indian screens. Bollywood Hungama's Taran Adarsh rated the film a 3 out of 5, praising the performances of the lead actors and writing [...] "Shah Rukh Khan does very well as Don. He enacts the evil character with flourish. But he fails to carry off the other role [...] <b>with</b> <b>conviction.</b> It looks made up, it doesn't come natural to him at all.

Describing the song, Jackson said, [...] "It's a different kind of song for me, it's more of like a throwback. More of a doowoop-y , which I've never done before which is quite exciting, and I enjoyed recording it in the studio." [...] John Platt, senior Vice President of Virgin Records and EMI Publishing, commented that Damita Jo [...] "is really about positive love and where she's at in her life right now. The second half of the album was very easy once me and Janet got to know each other, and found the songs that really were true to her and that she can sing <b>with</b> <b>conviction.</b> That's why there's so much passion in this [...] "I Want You" [...] record, that's where she's at in her life right now." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Got You" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Peter Robinson for The Guardian wrote that [...] "I Got You" [...] "is an impressive distant relative of Bleeding Love". Leah Greenblatt for Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "I Got You", along with [...] "Happy", as they allowed Echo to redeem {{itself from the}} [...] "soppy balladry and standard-issue dancery" [...] present {{on the rest of}} the album. Greenblatt's only criticism was that [...] "it can be difficult to connect with the woman who wields it." [...] Mayer Nissim for Digital Spy awarded the song three stars out of a possible five; Nissim was complimentary of Lewis's vocal performance, which he described as [...] "effortless" [...] in the verses and that she belts out the chorus with [...] "gusto." [...] However, Nissim was critical of the song's production, writing that although Lewis sings <b>with</b> <b>conviction,</b> it is not as memorable as other ballads. He continued to write that her voice will allow the song to chart fairly well, and that she should collaborate with other producers to make more memorable songs. Fraser McAline for the BBC awarded the song three stars out of a possible five; McAlpine noted that although Lewis is able to provide [...] "some kind of musical movement, by wandering off the path set down by the song," [...] he was critical of the songs structure, and labeled it as [...] "lazy." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Wet" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Awarding the song with {{three out of}} five stars, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a mixed review, stating that although Scherzinger purrs <b>with</b> <b>conviction,</b> the song sounds ultimately similar to Rihanna's [...] "Only Girl (In The World)". While reviewing the album, the same website reviewed [...] "Wet" [...] as a highlight of the album, and named it a possible future single. Idolator stated that Scherzinger is [...] "positively dripping with sex appeal in her ode to getting doused", later adding that the Stargate-produced [...] "dance jam is the musical equivalent of a run through the sprinkler". Idolator finished its review by stating that after an addition of a well-known rapper, the song could hit the domestic Top 40. While reviewing the album, Becky Bain of Idolator stated that [...] "Wet" [...] along with [...] "Club Banger Nation" [...] would strike a chord with clubgoers. David Griffiths of 4Music named [...] "Wet" [...] an essential addition to anybody's party playlist. In another interview by Griffiths, he named [...] "Wet" [...] a [...] "cracking pop tune", stating that the [...] "hits keep coming" [...] for Scherzinger. Kim Dawson of Daily Star complimented the song as a [...] "saucy tune". Describing the song as a [...] "surefire smash" [...] for Scherzinger, Pip Ellwood of Entertainment-Focus complimented the song as the best track on the album, stating that its beat is better than that of lead single [...] "Poison" [...] {{due to the fact}} that it is [...] "impossible not to move to." ...|$|E
500|$|In a later review, Corner {{said that}} [...] "Trouble" [...] was built around [...] "echoing beats and heart-tugging piano riff," [...] which when {{combined}} with [...] "her unmistakable falsetto" [...] was as dramatic as {{a scene from the}} film The Hunger Games. Elena Gorgon from Softpedia echoed earlier sentiments, concluding that the song [...] "was powerful, it's heartfelt and it confirms Leona {{as one of the most}} remarkable vocalists of the day." [...] However MSN's Danielle Cheeseman said that [...] "Trouble" [...] being a safe return to what Lewis has always done wasn't necessarily a good thing. In her review, Cheeseman called the song the [...] "same melodrama" [...] as past Lewis songs and that due to the song sounding familiar to Sandé's song [...] "Daddy", [...] "Lewis has yet to find her own stride". Corner featured [...] "Trouble" [...] on his weekly playlist [...] "10 Songs You Need to Hear" [...] for the week beginning 27 August 2012. There he described elaborated that the song was a welcome return for Lewis thanks to [...] "big beats, big strings and even bigger vocals". Whilst the majority of reviews praised Gambino's appearance on the song, Cheeseman described the collaboration as [...] "a saviour" [...] but that it did nothing for Lewis' [...] "credibility". Her review was subtitled [...] "Leona Lewis Tries to Convince Us She's 'Trouble' — We're not buyin' what she's sellin'" [...] and concluded that if the best that Glassheart could preview after all the delays was [...] "Trouble", [...] "it won't be worth the wait." [...] NMEs Jeremy Allen agreed, praising the production on [...] "Trouble" [...] as [...] "slick" [...] but stating that from Lewis it does not come across <b>with</b> <b>conviction</b> nor is it believable.|$|E
500|$|The {{phrase is}} likely to have {{originated}} in the Kingdom of Israel following the Law of Moses in beth din courts as a way of giving credence to the authority of God as the author of all law. It {{is likely to}} have come from Deuteronomy 16:18 where it stated: [...] "Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, tribe by tribe; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment". This gave rise to the theory that judges had been given authority from God to exercise judgment on matters of the law and would use the phrase to attribute this fact to God. The phrase continued to be used in courts, passing from Jewish to Christian context as a way to continue to affirm God as the highest authority in law. Clarence Darrow, Oliver O'Donovan and the Chicago Law Journal have stated that the phrase's continual usage may have come about as a result of judges feeling that while they could pass a sentence of death upon a person, they personally did not have the authority to destroy souls and that only God had the authority to do that. As a result, some judges would cross their fingers whenever they said the phrase as a result of concern for the criminal's soul as they said it as a prayer. While the phrase is intended to be said by judges <b>with</b> <b>conviction,</b> it is also said because of legal tradition and not necessarily due to belief in its meaning. During the 17th century in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Puritan majority of judges at the time did not believe that stating [...] "may God have mercy on your soul" [...] had any meaning unless the accused had made a confession of the crime in open court. They, and other Puritan office holders, would also regularly press the condemned up until the point of execution to make a confession of the crime they had been convicted of to ensure that the phrase satisfactorily had meaning according to their views.|$|E

40|$|Statutes in forty-eight states {{permit the}} {{exclusion}} of those <b>with</b> felony <b>convictions</b> from criminal juries; thirteen states permit {{the exclusion of}} those <b>with</b> misdemeanor <b>convictions.</b> The reasons given for these exclusions, which include the assumption that those <b>with</b> <b>convictions</b> are embittered against the state, do not justify their costs. Procedural justice theories indicate that embitterment of those <b>with</b> criminal <b>convictions</b> need not – and should not – be assumed. Rather, policymakers should {{do what they can}} to avoid such embitterment. This article therefore proposes that automatic statutory exclusions on the basis of criminal convictions should be abandoned. If a juror exhibits individual bias, he or she can be excused for cause. If the state presumes embitterment {{in the absence of any}} showing of individual bias, it can exercise peremptory challenges. These are finite in number, and thus exact a litigation cost that may incentivize reform. A rich body of recent scholarship proposes adjustments to prosecutorial incentives in other areas of the criminal justice system; this article adds a focus on jury exclusion to that literature, and to other recent policy critiques...|$|R
