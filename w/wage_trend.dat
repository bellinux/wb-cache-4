40|$|In this age-wage profile survey, we have {{modelled}} and forecasted {{the development}} of wages by age. The data of the survey consists of the wages of 18 – 60 -year-old men and women insured under the Employees' Pensions Act with the major earnings-related pension providers. The data covers the years 1996 – 2001 and represents 70 – 95 per cent of the wages insured under the Employees' Pensions Act during this period. According to the results, the trend following the recession in the early 1990 s will continue for women {{during the next few}} years. Young women under the age of 30 will lag behind to some extent from the general income level index trend. For other women, the <b>wage</b> <b>trend</b> will surpass the general income trend. For men, the general trend goes in the opposite direction. The majority of men, until the age of 49, lag behind to some extent from the general income trend. The forecasts for those aged 30 – 39 differed from each other, and even after combining the forecasts, the direction of the trend remains unclear. For men who have turned 50, the wages grow faster than does the general income trend. Women are slowly but surely catching up with the men in the <b>wage</b> <b>trend...</b>|$|E
40|$|Around 1980, {{the trend}} toward racial wage {{convergence}} essentially stopped. The author asks whether this break in the convergence trend {{can be explained by}} school quality. Department of Education surveys provide earnings data for the high school class of 1972 in 1979 and the class of 1980 in 1986, both linked to data from the respondents' high schools. By several measures, differences between schools attended by blacks and whites were already rather small in the 1970 s. Furthermore, the author finds that measurable school inputs generally have little effect on wages. Thus school quality explains little of the recent black/white <b>wage</b> <b>trend.</b> Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Net {{real wages}} in Germany have hardly risen since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s. Between 2004 and 2008 they even declined. This is a unique development in Germany-never before has a period of rather strong economic growth been accompanied by a decline in net real wages over a period of several years. The key reason for this decline is not higher taxes and social-insurance contributions, as many would hold, but rather extremely slow wage growth, both in absolute terms and from an international perspective. This finding is all the more striking in light of the fact that average employee education levels have risen, which would on its face lead one to expect higher wage levels. In contrast to the prevailing <b>wage</b> <b>trend,</b> income from self-employment and investment assets has risen sharply in recent years, such that compensation of employees makes up an ever shrinking percentage of national income. Inflation-adjusted compensation of employees as a share of national income reached a historic low of 61 % in 2007 and 2008. As in previous recessions, however, investment income has been under greater downward pressure in recent months than wages. Development of wages in Germany...|$|E

40|$|The rise of {{unemployment}} in West Germany is often attributed to an inflexibility of the wage {{structure in the}} face of a skill bias in labor demand trends. In addition, there is concern in Germany that during the 70 s and 80 s unions were pursuing a too egalitarian wage policy. In a cohort analysis, we estimate quantile regressions of wages taking account of the censoring in the data. We present a new framework to describe trends in the entire wage distribution across education and age groups in a parsimonious way. We explore whether wage trends are uniform across cohorts, thus defining a macroeconomic <b>wage</b> <b>trend.</b> Our findings are that wages of workers with intermediate education levels, among them especially those of young workers, deteriorated slightly relative to both high and low education levels. Wage inequality within age-education groups stayed fairly constant. Nevertheless, the German wage structure was fairly stable, especially in international comparison. The results appear consistent with a skill bias in labor demand trends, recognizing that union wages are only likely to be binding floors for low-wage earners. wage inequality · cohort analysis · quantile regression · censoring. ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{widespread}} belief that workers in {{temporary agency work}} (TAW) are subject to poorer working conditions, in particular pay, than comparable workers {{in the rest of}} the economy. The first aim of this analysis is to quantify the wage penalty, if any, for workers in TAW. Secondly, we analyze the wage profile of workers before and after spells of TAW. Linked employer-employee data for Portugal enable us to account for observable as well as unobservable worker quality. Our results show that workers in TAW earn lower wages than their peers and that this difference is mostly due to the workers' characteristics. We estimate that workers in TAW earn on average 9 % less than comparable workers {{in the rest of the}} economy if we control for the workers' observable attributes only; this difference is reduced to 1 % when we control for unobservable characteristics as well. However, interesting differences emerge across groups. Younger workers, both men and women, earn higher wages in TAW than their peers in other firms, as opposed to prime-age and older workers. Moreover, for young workers TAW is not associated with a stigma effect that slows wage progression after working for TAW, contrary to prime-age and older workers, in particular males. The wage trends are also different before entering TAW. Prime-age and older workers see their wages deteriorate relative to their peers before entering TAW, suggesting that adverse labor market conditions may motivate them to search for a TAW job. We do not detect any pre-TAW <b>wage</b> <b>trend</b> for young workers...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{there is}} {{widespread}} belief that workers in temporary help services (THS) are subject to poorer working conditions, in particular pay, than comparable workers {{in the rest of}} the economy, there is little evidence on whether that is driven by the sector per se or by the workers' characteristics. The first aim of this analysis is to quantify the wage penalty, if any, for workers in THS firms. Secondly, we analyze the wage profile of workers right before and after spells of THS. Linked employer-employee data for Portugal enable us to account for observable as well as unobservable worker quality. Our results show that workers in THS firms earn lower wages than their peers and that this difference is mostly due to the workers' characteristics. We estimate that workers in THS firms earn on average 9 % less than comparable workers {{in the rest of the}} economy if we control for the workers' observable attributes only. This difference is reduced to about 1 % when we control for unobservable characteristics as well. However, interesting differences emerge across groups. Younger workers, both men and women, earn higher wages in TAW than their peers in other firms, while the opposite holds for prime-age and older workers. Moreover, for young workers THS firms is not associated with a stigma effect that slows their wage progression after they work for THS, as opposed to prime-age and older workers, in particular males. Also before entering THS the wage trends are different. Prime-age and older workers, both male and female, see their wages deteriorate relative to their peers before entering THS, suggesting that adverse labor market conditions may motivate them to search for a THS job.

The empirical analysis moves from a classical standpoint, looking at the influence of labour market conditions, the degree of workers' organisation, and broader economic and institutional factors on <b>wage</b> <b>trends.</b> We find that industry is the leading sector in wage determination and that real wages in this sector have a strong negative correlation with the unemployment level.
