500|$|Before {{the switch}} from direct-to-video to feature film, the Toy Story 2 crew had been on its own, placed in a new {{building}} that was well-separated {{from the rest of}} the company by railroad tracks. [...] "We were just the small film and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> playing in our sandbox," [...] co-producer Karen Jackson said. Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout. [...] The film reused digital elements from Toy Story but, true to the company's [...] "prevailing culture of perfectionism, [...] it reused less of Toy Story than might be expected". Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements. [...] The team freely borrowed models from other productions, such as Geri from Pixar's 1997 short Geri's Game, who became the Cleaner in Toy Story 2. Supervising animator Glenn McQueen inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given, assigning different shots to suit each animators' strengths.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Los Angeles, Cartwright won {{the lead}} role in the {{television}} movie Marian Rose White. Janet Maslin, a critic for The New York Times, described Cartwright as [...] "a chubby, lumbering, slightly cross-eyed actress whose naturalness adds greatly to the film's impact". Cartwright replied by sending Maslin a letter insisting she was not cross-eyed, and included a photograph. Later, Cartwright auditioned {{for the role of}} Ethel, a girl who becomes trapped in a cartoon world in the third segment of [...] She met with director Joe Dante and later described him as [...] "a total cartoon buff, and once he took a look at my resume and noticed Daws Butler's name on it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> and running, sharing anecdotes about Daws and animation. After about twenty minutes, he said, 'considering your background, I don't see how I could cast anyone but you in this part! It was her first role in a feature film. The segment was based on The Twilight Zone television series episode [...] "It's a Good Life", which was later parodied in The Simpsons episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror II" [...] (1992).|$|E
2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
60|$|That is all. Permit us to {{wish you}} good-by. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> to Naples.|$|R
6000|$|... "A whisky soda made in real English fashion," [...] {{he proclaimed}} triumphantly. [...] "A good nightcap, is it not? Now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I shall <b>be</b> {{glad when}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off,</b> sir,” the {{midshipman}} said. “I am never comfortable, after {{beginning to get}} into commission, until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> out on blue water.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! And it {{has come}} to that, has it? What was it you said to Dr. O'Shaughnessey when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> Point de Galle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As soon as {{the first}} ray of light showed <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> again, and an hour later reached {{the edge of the}} slope down to the cove.|$|E
60|$|When I {{reached the}} porch I found Mrs. Canby bidding my sister good-by. A moment more {{and she was}} on the seat. I touched up Jerry and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If I could presume so far, Sir Gervaise. I {{can only}} say, sir, that the sooner <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off,</b> the sooner <b>we</b> shall flog the French." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then Master Linton has {{forgot the}} first {{injunction}} of his uncle,' I observed: 'he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> at once.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'See,' he said, 'the {{clouds are}} coming down the mountains. We have not a moment to lose; {{it will be on}} us now before <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> the glacier.' ...|$|R
60|$|I acquiesced, and {{got into}} a cab with my cousin. I was {{perfectly}} {{aware that he was}} almost consumed with curiosity. He scarcely waited until <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> before he began.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off.</b> It was only when the great car swung from the avenue into the country lane that Jacky, who was driving, turned toward me.|$|E
60|$|By eleven {{next morning}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> Plymouth Sound; and by midday we had landed at the Mill Bay Docks, and {{were on our}} way to a {{comfortable}} hotel in the neighbourhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> on {{a hunting}} trip," [...] {{answered}} Giant. [...] "And, by the way, <b>we</b> had better <b>be</b> {{getting back to}} the boat," [...] he added to his chums.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> {{the right}} trail," [...] {{returned}} Snap. [...] "It {{seems to me}} our camp must be in that direction," [...] and he pointed to their left.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are old campaigners, you see," [...] Vincent said, [...] "and {{accustomed}} to early movements. Now please let us waste no time, as the sooner <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> early for Villeneuve, {{in order to}} reach the boat. This was handsomely effected, and heaving-to abreast of Vévey, we succeeded in eating our breakfast at [...] "Mon Repos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, we ran till <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> the brig. The {{wind was}} freshening, and the gusts coming down strong; it was backing round rather {{to the north}} too, and the sea was getting up.|$|E
60|$|I did so, and {{a moment}} later <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off.</b> I was pretty {{confident}} that Mr. Allen Price had not witnessed my departure, and I hoped he would not find it out for some hours to come.|$|E
60|$|Now here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> at Reading. There is the {{carriage}} waiting, and away <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> home; {{and when we}} get home, and have seen everybody and everything, we will look over our section once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do capitally, and {{the sooner}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> the better," [...] Vincent said, and after heartily thanking the two women, and bestowing a present upon each of the children, they started along the shore.|$|R
60|$|Now, come along, and bundle {{into the}} boat, {{if you have}} done bidding every one good-bye; and take care you don't slip down in the ice-groovings, as you did the other day. There, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> at last.|$|R
60|$|We got our {{anchor and}} made sail on the Avenger without delay, and thus, {{in less than}} an hour from the time of making port, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> again on what proved to be a series of wild adventures.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Now, my love,’ said Kitterbell to his wife, ‘it’s time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off.</b> We’re to {{meet the}} other godfather and the godmother at the church, uncle,—Mr. and Mrs. Wilson from over the way—uncommonly nice people. My love, are you well wrapped up?’ ...|$|E
60|$|We {{touched the}} stairs lightly {{for a single}} moment, {{and he was on}} board, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas bag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it is you, Bathurst!" [...] {{he heard}} Wilson's voice exclaim. [...] "I {{thought it was}} you, {{but it is so}} dark now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> that white sand that I could not see. Where are you hit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well I <b>am</b> {{not sorry}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> again," [...] Marion Renshaw {{said as the}} men ran round with the capstan bars and the anchor came up from the shallow water. [...] "What a {{contrast}} between this and Rio!" ...|$|R
60|$|There's {{the last}} bell! Clang! clang! In two minutes comes the horn, and then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off.</b> The gipsies <b>are</b> playing the saddest of sad songs, {{it seems as}} if one's heartstrings were being {{wrenched}} out of one's body.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It is Mrs. Cox here. It was Annie when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> Gibraltar. That {{comes of}} being near home. But I {{knew that it}} would be so. I hate the very idea of home." [...] And she put her {{handkerchief}} to her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off,</b> up {{the narrow}} trail along the creek. Haught led the way. Romer {{attached}} himself to the bear-hunter, and wherever the trail was wide enough rode beside him. R.C. and I followed. The other men fell in behind the pack train.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the cloth}} was cleared, Holmes {{glanced at his}} watch, and filled up three glasses with port. [...] "One bumper," [...] said he, [...] "to {{the success of our}} little expedition. And now it is high time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>off.</b> Have you a pistol, Watson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gone. As I {{was not in}} {{travelling}} trim, and you not forthcoming, {{he could}} not wait; but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to <b>be</b> <b>off</b> to-morrow at ten o'clock.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} was, lad; {{but it will}} be five or six weeks before <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> again. Anyhow, the ship you are going in--the Madras--is a fine craft, and the captain bears as high a {{character}} as anyone in the Company's fleet.|$|R
60|$|Come along, {{boys and}} girls! <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>off</b> on our rambles. But {{please do not}} ask me where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going. It would delay us very much if I should {{postpone}} our start until I had drawn you {{a map of the}} route, with all the stopping-places set down.|$|R
