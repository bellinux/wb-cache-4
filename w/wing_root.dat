5|$|The Board also {{recommended}} frequent inspections of <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> fittings {{for the development}} of fatigue cracks, increasing the thickness of the portion of the wing attached to the fuselage, and reduction of operating speeds by 10%.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|Civil Aeronautics Board {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} the outer portion of the wing had detached {{from the rest of}} the wing. The investigation revealed a fatigue crack 7/8inch long and 3/32inch deep at the point of detachment. Similar cracks were found on the <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> fittings of another Martin 2-0-2 aircraft that flew the same flight path through the same storm shortly after Flight 421. October inspections of three other Martin 2-0-2 aircraft revealed identical fatigue cracks in similar locations.|$|E

5000|$|A chine shaped {{fuselage}} may {{be described}} as a fuselage featuring sideways extensions, or long extensions of the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> along the fuselage. Chines first appeared on the Lockheed A-12 precursor of the SR-71 Blackbird, where they formed forward extensions of the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> along the fuselage sides into which they blended.|$|R

5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each <b>wing</b> <b>root.</b>|$|E
5|$|Intrepid steamed from Ulithi {{back to the}} Philippines {{with orders}} to strike Nichols and Nielsen airfields, destroy {{shipping}} in Manila Bay and to attack concentrations of enemy aircraft encountered between Manila and Batangas. This effort began on November 19. The first strike of the day ran into token resistance {{from a handful of}} Zeros, but the enemies did not press home attacks on the bomber squadrons. Instead, VF-18 fighters initiated combat, chasing down and destroying two enemy aircraft. A solitary Zero flying at higher altitude was spotted by Harris, who led his division in pursuit. Harris put holes in the enemy fighter's starboard <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> firing from long range. The Japanese pilot bailed out, but his plane continued flying for four or five minutes with curious Hellcats following in its wake. They eventually shot down the unmanned aircraft. Intrepid went to general quarters a number of times throughout the day's strikes and into the evening as enemy planes tested the perimeter of the task group.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E

50|$|To {{address the}} {{problems}} with spanwise loading, {{a wider variety of}} techniques have been used, including dedicated slats or flaps, the use of washout or automated control of the ailerons. An unusual solution tried on the XF-91 Thunderceptor prototype fighter was to give the wingtips a wider chord than the <b>wing</b> <b>roots.</b> The idea was to increase wingtip efficiency and cause the <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> to stall first.|$|R

5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> fairing.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the <b>wing</b> <b>root,</b> first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} carry up to 20 AGM-69 SRAM nuclear {{missiles}} was added to G and H models, starting in 1971. To further improve its offensive ability, air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) were fitted. After testing of both the Air Force-backed Boeing AGM-86 and the Navy-backed General Dynamics AGM-109 Tomahawk, the AGM-86B was selected for operation by the B-52 (and ultimately by the B-1 Lancer). A total of 194 B-52Gs and Hs were modified to carry AGM-86s, carrying 12 missiles on underwing pylons, with 82 B-52Hs further modified to carry another eight missiles on a rotary launcher fitted in the bomb-bay. To conform with SALT II Treaty requirements that cruise missile-capable aircraft be readily identifiable by reconnaissance satellites, the cruise missile armed B-52Gs were modified with a distinctive <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> fairing. As all B-52Hs were assumed modified, no visual modification of these aircraft was required. In 1990, the stealthy AGM-129 ACM cruise missile entered service; although intended to replace the AGM-86, a high cost and the Cold War's end led to only 450 being produced; unlike the AGM-86, no conventional (non-nuclear) version was built. The B-52 {{was to have been}} modified to utilize Northrop Grumman's AGM-137 TSSAM weapon; however, the missile was canceled due to development costs.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of wooden}} construction, using a D-tube wing {{with a single}} strut and doped aircraft fabric covering. The wing employs a Göppingen 535 airfoil at the <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> and a NACA M-6 at the wing tip. The fuselage is plywood covered.|$|E
25|$|M.S.325 C3 No. 01 (Works no. 4120) {{was flown}} {{for the first}} time by company Chief Test Pilot Michael Détroyat early in 1933 from the factory site, Vèlizy-Villacoublay.

25|$|The Ford Trimotor was a {{development}} of previous designs by William Bushnell Stout, using structural principles copied {{from the work}} of Professor Hugo Junkers, the noted German all-metal aircraft design pioneer, and adapted to an airframe very similar to the single engine Fokker F.VII - even using the same airfoil cross section at the <b>wing</b> <b>root.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 G-1: The G-1 {{was renamed}} from A-4/U8 JaBo Rei's. Initial testing {{found that if}} all but two <b>wing</b> <b>root</b> mounted 20mm MG 151 cannons (with reduced {{ammunition}} load) were removed, the Fw 190 G-1 (as it was now called) could carry a 250kg (550lb) or 500kg (1,100lb) bomb on the centreline and up to a 250kg (550lb) bomb under each wing.|$|E

40|$|Model tests {{prove the}} {{feasibility}} of enhancing the aerodynamic qualities of wing-fuselage fillets by appropriate design of fuselage and <b>wing</b> <b>roots.</b> Abrupt changes from maximum fuselage height to wing chord must be avoided and every longitudinal section of fuselage and <b>wing</b> <b>roots</b> must be so faired and arranged as to preserve the original lift distribution of the continuous wing. Adapting the fuselage to the curvilinear circulation of the wing affords further improvement. The polars of such arrangements are almost {{the same as those}} of the "wing alone," thus voiding the superiority of the high-wing type airplane known with conventional design...|$|R
25|$|Fw 190 A-3/U4 — The A-3/U4 was a {{reconnaissance}} {{version with}} two RB 12.5 {{cameras in the}} rear fuselage and a EK 16 gun camera or a Robot II miniature camera in {{the leading edge of}} the port <b>wing</b> <b>root.</b> Armament was similar to the U3, however, and the ETC 501 was usually fitted with the standardized Luftwaffe 300 litre-capacity (80US gal) drop tank.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Fokker {{produced}} a developed version, the T-IVa, {{to supplement the}} existing T-IVs in Dutch service. Wright Cyclone radial engines replaced the Lorraine Dietriches, while the pilots were provided with an enclosed cockpit in a hump over the <b>wing</b> <b>root,</b> and enclosed nose and dorsal gun turrets were fitted. 12 were built for the Dutch Naval Aviation Service, while the remaining T-IVs were rebuilt to the T-IVa standard.|$|E
25|$|Flight 703 pancaked onto {{a hilltop}} and broke up as it slid along the ground, killing the flight {{attendant}} instantly.
