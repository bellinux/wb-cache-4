30|$|A {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} the behavior of DFT-RDM for colored Gaussian hosts has been performed. An explanation to the performance loss with respect to white Gaussian hosts has been given. We have also provided an extension of DFT-RDM for colored hosts without any additional knowledge on the attack filter; this extension consists in using a fixed <b>whitening</b> <b>filter</b> that captures the average properties of audio signals. The analysis has been validated by experimental results which confirm the performance improvement afforded by the proposed solution. Moreover W-DFT-RDM has been tested with audio signals providing a BER decrease which encourages us to continue on this research line. W-DFT-RDM for audio tracks is not able to fill the performance gap with respect to DFT-RDM for white hosts since a fixed (and nonperfectly matched) average <b>whitening</b> <b>filter</b> is used at both the embedder and the decoder. A further improvement could be obtained by using a host-adaptive <b>whitening</b> <b>filter</b> at the embedder which, assuming a blind framework, should be retrieved at the decoder side, at least with some approximation. Finally, even though encouraging BER results have been obtained for MP 3 compression, an accurate analysis of DFT-RDM-based techniques against compression is needed in order to assess the real bounds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} frame synchronization in {{code division multiple access}} systems in the presence of high multiple access interference. Already acquired user signals are regenerated using soft information from the respective decoders and subtracted from the received signal to mitigate multiple access interference. We consider partial cancellation of interference after few decoder iterations for fast acquisition of remaining weak users. Hence the effect of residual interference after cancellation is considered in the derivation of the time offset estimator. We consider both data-aided and non-data-aided scenarios. Our approach uses linear pre-processing (<b>whitening</b> <b>filter)</b> on the interference cancelled signal for further performance improvement. Analytical expressions for the missed detection probability of a given user are derived. These analytical results are verified via Monte-Carlo simulations.

We show here that non-linear `infomax', when applied to an ensemble of natural scenes, produces sets of visual filters that are localised and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximisation network of Olshausen & Field (1996). In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since the infomax network is able to perform Independent Components Analysis (ICA).

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} matching images to tell whether {{they come from the}} same scene viewed under different lighting conditions. We show that the surface characteristics determine the type of image comparison method that should be used. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of comparing the image gradient direction for surfaces with material properties that change rapidly in one direction. We show analytically that two other widely used methods, normalized correlation of small windows and comparison of multiscale oriented filters, essentially compute the same thing. Then, we show that for surfaces whose properties change more slowly, comparison of the output of <b>whitening</b> <b>filters</b> is most effective. This suggests that a combination of these strategies should be employed to compare general objects. We discuss indications that Gabor jets use such a mixed strategy effectively, and we propose a new mixed strategy. We validate our results on synthetic and real images.
