5|$|In Heian-era Japan, {{husbands and}} wives kept {{separate}} households; children were raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she {{was very close to}} one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E
5|$|The Overlords {{are eager}} to escape from their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} emptiness <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of fulfillment. The Earth evaporates in a flash of light. Karellen looks back at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to the human species.|$|E

To the older Citizens, a slave who can enter at will the massive computer which controls the Rings of Orbis makes JT very valuable and drives the Rings to the brink of war. As the central computer begins to malfunction, the Citizens connive, conspire, and even kill to own JT and his sister.|$|E

Green Goblin is later shown having gathered a new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Norman Alexander spent time in both Singapore and New Zealand, whilst Elizabeth Alexander {{returned}} to England. In 1947, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> {{were old enough to}} attend boarding school, the couple returned to Singapore, both working at Raffles College. In 1952, the couple moved to Ibadan, Nigeria, both accepting posts at University College Ibadan. Norman became the Chair of Physics, whilst Elizabeth took on the role of Lecturer in Soil Sciences. She worked in Agronomy, soil science, and administration. The university opened a department of geology in 1958 and appointed Dr. Elizabeth Alexander Senior Lecturer and Head of Department. Just three weeks into her new role, Alexander suffered a stroke and she died a week later on 15 October 1958 at the age of 49.|$|E

25|$|The First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar, or Eruhíni, began {{during the}} Years of the Trees when the Elves awoke in Cuiviénen in the middle-east of Middle-earth.

25|$|Foster care adoption: {{this is a}} type of {{domestic}} adoption where a child is initially placed in public care. Many times the foster parents take on the adoption <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> become legally free. Its importance as an avenue for adoption varies by country. Of the 127,500 adoptions in the U.S. in 2000 about 51,000 or 40% were through the foster care system.|$|E

25|$|One method Nilsson {{used for}} murdering the {{children}} {{was to put}} them into a washtub and then place heavy objects—such as a washboard and coal scuttle—on top of them. She then left the room and returned hours later <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were dead. The next step in her procedure was to burn their bodies. On occasions when she did not burn them, she dug graves and buried them.|$|E

25|$|Later, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{children}}</b> {{were told}} that they could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of severe punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.|$|E

50|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} master centration and conservation spontaneously. The crucial moment comes <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> is {{in a state}} of internal contradiction.

25|$|Current {{studies have}} shown a {{correlation}} between maternal sensitivity or insensitivity, negative discipline and childhood aggression. An experiment sampling 117 mother–child pairs showed a unique relationship between the mother's sensitivity {{and the use of}} discipline and the child's temperament level. Observations (of the mother's sensitivity to the child's needs, the child's aggression and temperament level and the relationship between the two) were made <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> on average were 26.71 months old (range of 13.58 to 41.91 months). The data were collected again a year later. Results show a year later that negative discipline is correlated with child aggression, but only when that mother is insensitive.|$|E
