5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down.

At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
