5|$|Things <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> Not Talk About: Exploring Latino/a Literature through Essays and Interviews (2014). By Daniel Olivas. Interview of Sandra Cisneros {{featured}} in book.|$|E
5|$|You {{are going}} to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You {{are going to}} build two four-lane {{highways}} through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not want to take anything away from them. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
5|$|By {{meditation}} I mean prolonged reasoning {{with the}} understanding, in this way. We begin by {{thinking of the}} favor which God bestowed upon us by giving us His only Son; and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not stop there but proceed to consider the mysteries of His whole glorious life.|$|E
50|$|<b>We</b> had to <b>do</b> a Shakespeare, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Macbeth. <b>We</b> had to <b>do</b> a pre 20th-century text, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a play, She Stoops to Conquer. <b>We</b> had to <b>do</b> {{poetry and}} <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Yevgeny Yevtushenko. But no novels.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the action}} got under way, and unanticipated events forced us off our planned course … <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not fully explain what was happening, and why <b>we</b> were <b>doing</b> what <b>we</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
500|$|In {{the closing}} shot, Rocky returns home and visits Adrian's grave again, thanking her for helping him; [...] "Yo Adrian, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> it." ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but {{if they were the}} ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E
5|$|It wasn't like Janet , {{where we}} all grew up together. Mariah had done her own thing and had been very {{involved}} with the arranging and production of her records, so we respected that and said, 'What can <b>we</b> <b>do</b> for you?' She would fly into town {{for five or six}} hours. She'd get on a plane and fly to whatever was the next thing she was doing.|$|E
5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should <b>we</b> <b>do</b> a sequel to the first one or do <b>we</b> <b>do</b> a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
6000|$|HIGGINS. How can she? She's {{incapable}} of understanding anything. Besides, {{do any of}} us understand what <b>we</b> are <b>doing?</b> If <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> would <b>we</b> ever <b>do</b> it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hang it, man, do {{give us a}} chance. Why can't you explain, {{instead of}} sitting there talking like that? Why are <b>we</b> <b>done?</b> What have <b>we</b> <b>done,</b> anyway?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should you}} imagine, Elinor, that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not go there, or that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not see the}} house? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?" ...|$|R
5|$|The philosopher Peter Singer {{considers}} that usually when we describe an action as conscientious {{in the critical}} sense <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{so in order to}} deny either that the relevant agent was motivated by selfish desires, like greed or ambition, or that he acted on whim or impulse.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing {{with any degree of}} certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097. However, it is possible to construct a general outline of his life from the little that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} cantatas Bach {{composed}} {{in his first}} years in Leipzig, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know {{the identity of the}} librettist. It is the third in a group of ten cantatas following the same structure of biblical text (in this case from the Old Testament) – recitative – aria – recitative – aria – chorale. The ten cantatas were dedicated to the 8th to 14th and 21st to 22nd Sunday after Trinity and the second Sunday after Easter.|$|E
5000|$|... "We did it very budget - <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it in Adelaide, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{it with a}} {{producer}} we knew, which meant <b>we</b> could <b>do</b> it well and not {{spend a lot of}} unnecessary money. We were a bit smart about it." [...] Ash Gale, vocals.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} do say it," [...] answered the doctor's son. [...] "All <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was to hide that boat, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that because <b>we</b> knew {{you wanted to}} hide ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What of French machine-guns in the Atlas?" [...] reason {{pressed the}} case. [...] "Of Himalayan villages burning? Of the things <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in China? Especially {{of the things}} <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in China...." ...|$|R
5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
25|$|D is true, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have F.|$|E
25|$|For by {{his death}} <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{perceive}} his guilt.|$|E
50|$|Knowledge is our sword,An' Khorlo our deeds,With lotus-like hearts,Do <b>we</b> pray, <b>do</b> <b>we</b> pray, <b>do</b> <b>we</b> pray,The TNA way, the TNA way.|$|R
6000|$|... [ * It is {{fortunate}} that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not accept Yva's offer. Had [...] <b>we</b> <b>done</b> so <b>we</b> should have found ourselves shut in, and [...] perished, as shall be told.--H. A. ] ...|$|R
5000|$|Lord Caradon also maintained, We didn't {{say there}} should be a {{withdrawal}} to the '67 line; <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not put the 'the' in, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not say all the territories, deliberately.. We all knew - that the boundaries of '67 were not drawn as permanent frontiers, they were a cease-fire line of a couple of decades earlier... <b>We</b> <b>did</b> not say that the '67 boundaries must be forever; it would be insanity.|$|R
25|$|In facts, {{this is what}} <b>we</b> <b>do</b> in {{the long}} {{division}} method.|$|E
25|$|D isn't true, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have F, {{and would}} have F even if D were true.|$|E
25|$|And {{the heavens}} We did create with Our Hands, and <b>We</b> <b>do</b> {{cause it to}} expand.|$|E
30|$|Unlike Pritchett, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{not include}} the CIF/FOB ratio as a {{regressor}} because <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not obtain data of this variable for the whole period. This variable, however, {{did not have a}} statistically significant effect in Pritchett’s regression.|$|R
5000|$|Nothing will deter us from Palestine. Which jail {{we go to}} {{is up to you}} British. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> not ask you {{to reduce}} our rations; <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not ask you to put us in Poppendorf and Am Stau.|$|R
5000|$|They had around 30 bands {{from all}} over the Midwest, {{including}} Minneapolis and Chicago. We won because <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a very different set from everybody else. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> some steps like The Raiders and wore gold sparkle shirts!" ...|$|R
25|$|This proof {{does not}} rely on Fatou's lemma. However, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> explain how that lemma might be used.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>did</b> not furnish {{the whole}} house at first, but what mattered it? We had no horse or cow, but the pasture and barn were ready for them. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> not propose to begin with {{everything}} at once.|$|R

5000|$|When Johnson picked Sargent Shriver {{to head up}} his [...] "War on Poverty" [...] in 1966, Vaughn {{was named}} Peace Corps director. [...] "It was so good, so positive," [...] Vaughn said of his appointment. [...] "As a former bureaucrat, to join the Peace Corps was pure joy.
