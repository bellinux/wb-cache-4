25|$|The Song of Dermot and the Earl and Expugnatio Hibernica {{follow the}} same pattern, portraying Derbforgaill’s {{abduction}} in 1152 and Mac Murchada’s banishment in 1166 as occurring at the same time. The Song claims that Derbforgaill {{had fallen in love}} with Diarmait, who in turn only made a pretense of loving her, in an effort to entice her away from Ua Ruairc, as a means of avenging previous wrongs inflicted by Leth Cuinn (the northern half of Ireland) upon Leth Moga (the southern half of Ireland). She subsequently arranged for a rendezvous from which he could carry her back to Laigin unchallenged. Ua Ruairc is then said to have complained to the (unnamed) king of Connacht, who convinced Mac Murchada’s allies to abandon him and force him into exile. In the events as narrated by the Song (and to a degree the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the Annals of the Four Masters) Derbforgaill is clearly a dupe, but in Gerald of Wales’s Expugnatio Hibernica she becomes more blameworthy:On an occasion when Ua Ruairc king of Meath had gone off on an expedition to far distant parts, his wife, Ua Máelechlainn's daughter, whom he had left on an island in Meath, was abducted by the aforesaid Diramait, who had long been burning with love for her and took advantage of her husband's absence. No doubt she was abducted because she wanted to be and, since 'woman is always a fickle and inconstant creature', she herself arranged that she should become the kidnapper's prize.Almost all the world's most notable catastrophes have been caused by women, <b>witness</b> <b>Mark</b> Antony and Troy. King Ua Ruairc was stirred to extreme anger on two counts, of which however the disgrace, rather than the loss of his wife, grieved him more deeply, and he vented all the venom of his fury with a view to revenge. And so he called together and mustered his own forces and those of neighbouring peoples, and roused to the same purpose Ruaidrí, prince of Connacht and at that time supreme ruler of all Ireland. The men of Leinster, seeing that their prince was now in a difficult position and surrounded on all sides by his enemies' forces, sought to pay him back, and recalled to mind injustices which they had long concealed and stored deep in their hearts.. They made common cause with his enemies, and the men of rank among this people deserted Mac Murchada along with his good fortune... he finally trusted his life to the sea in flight, and so to speak had recourse to this last hope of saving himself.In addition to the classical references to Mark Antony and Troy, the quotation used by Gerald is from Mercury's pushing Aeneis to leave Dido and fulfill his fate by sailing to Italy, in the Aeneid.|$|E

A geometric geoid model for Singapore was also computed from the geoidal heights derived from the RTK ellipsoidal heights and the adjusted reduced levels of 406 marks which comprise PLBMs, <b>witness</b> <b>marks,</b> offset marks and ISN marks. 43 independent variables dependent on the easting and northing coordinates were initially used to compute the multiple regression surface to best fit 464 benchmarks with geoid separations (GS) which are the dependent variable in the formulation. 58 benchmarks {{were found to have}} outlying GS and subsequently found to have gross errors in their RTK heights. Recommendations had been made to avoid such spurious RTK heights. Stepwise multiple regression using the method of forward selection was used to compute the polynomial equation for the geometric geoid.

40|$|Abstract]: Deregulation is {{happening}} around the world. Its {{aim is to}} promote market competition and lower compliance costs while providing a secure business environment. This dissertation examines New Zealand Government’s justifications for deregulating cadastral surveying and the commercial implications on the profession. Is anyone likely {{to benefit from the}} proposed changes? Will compliance costs decrease? Are ownership rights protected? Will land trading remain safe? Research into the background of New Zealand legislation is presented in first chapters followed by analysis of nineteen cadastral projects. These show that lack of boundary monumentation and <b>witness</b> <b>mark</b> densities will increase compliance costs. The project also analyses costs that fall outside the example projects such as social implications and costs to the profession especially with the introduction of a new certification, which will result in the increase of public liability insurance for licensed cadastral surveyors. Future studies could be done to design appropriate rules for cadastral surveying to ensure that there is a balance between maintaining the rights of property holders to have accurate surveys while ensuring that survey costs and compliance are not so stringent as to warrant huge costs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Witness</b> <b>marks</b> {{produced}} on bone {{by the use}} of saws have traditionally been examined using stereomicroscopy. The marks are typically found on the kerf wall or floor and give important information about the implement that made them. This paper describes a new approach to the analysis of <b>witness</b> <b>marks</b> left on kerf walls and floors from crimes involving dismemberment. Previously, two types of marks have been identified: deep furrows formed during the pull stroke and fine striations formed on the push stroke. These types of striation allow the class of saw to be identified, but not an individual saw. With the advent of environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), insulating materials can now be examined without the need for conductive coatings to be applied. This allows materials to be examined at higher magnifications than those available with stereomicroscopy. Here we report on a new, third type of striation that is visible at higher magnifications on ESEM images. These striations are formed from the imperfections on the cutting teeth of saws and give real possibilities of uniquely identifying whether or not a particular saw was used to cause the mark. In blind trials conducted on sawing of nylon 6. 6, different individual saws could be successfully identified even if different people used the saw. We discuss ways in which these results can be extended to bone and how this may assist in the investigation of the act of dismemberment. 1059...|$|R

40|$|Solidification during {{horizontal}} {{continuous casting}} of low carbon steel billets with cyclic withdrawal was simulated and the wavy profile of the solidifying shell characteristic of this process was reproduced. Effects of rate of withdrawal cycle, superheat and casting speed were determined. In order {{to carry out this}} simulation in a personal computer, efficient numerical techniques had to be developed for mesh refinement by coordinate transformation, interfaces with temperature discontinuities and re-entrant corners. A flexible means of mesh generation involving polynomials was also developed. From the transient heat transfer model finite difference equations peculiar to each gridpoint in the solution field were derived and solved by the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method. Graphics software were developed to view the results with 3 -D as well as contour plots. The heat transfer model was verified with published results of vertical continuous casting of Mg alloys and steel. Due to its ability to deal with interfaces, unlike previous work, the present model could solve temperature at both casting and mold simultaneously. A model for the shell growth, rupture and healing at the break-ring of {{horizontal continuous casting}} molds was incorporated into the heat transfer model. An interesting result of this simulation was the presence of transient hot spots in the hot face of the mold. Elimination of such hot spots should aid shell strength and hence the casting rate.
