Refaeli later said, [...] "I don't regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That's {{just the way it}} is: celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army." [...] She also said: [...] "Israel or Uganda, <b>what</b> <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>make?</b> It makes no difference to me. Why is it good to die for our country?

2500|$|In {{a minute}} to the Cabinet's Defence and Overseas Policy {{committee}} the following month, Lamont set out his three objectives for the negotiations: first, to ensure Britain didn't have to join the single currency; second, to ensure the opt-out was legally water-tight; and third, to ensure that during the period {{in the run-up to}} the single currency, there should be no binding obligations on Britain. [...] In meeting the third of these, Lamont had to overcome the resistance of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, who told Lamont: [...] "I can't see what you are so worked up about. We are in the ERM. <b>What</b> <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> if it is in the Treaty?" [...] Lamont decided to ignore their objections. At the next negotiating meeting on the treaty, he told his fellow European finance ministers that Britain would not accept membership of the ERM as a treaty obligation.

Lilly was courteous and even affable: but with a curious cold space between him and Aaron. Breakfast passed, and Aaron knew that he must leave. There was something in Lilly's bearing which just showed him the door. In some surprise and confusion, and in some anger, not unmingled with humorous irony, he put his things in his bag. He put on his hat and coat. Lilly was seated rather stiffly writing.|$|R

There is something about that friend of my wife--that smug, prosperous, well-behaved Englishman--which seems to plead for him (God knows how!) when my mind is least inclined in his favour.

40|$|One of {{the untold}} {{stories in the}} {{proliferation}} of independent media across Africa {{is the role of}} donor aid in this process. Overview This year, 2014, marks 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the symbolic end of the Cold War in 1989. It also marks the anniversary of the beginning of an extraordinary proliferation of media outlets in sub-Saharan Africa, which swept across the continent, freeing Africa’s press and liberating the airwaves from monopoly by the state. Economics, technology, and socio-political forces all played major roles in this boom of Africa’s media. But one of the untold stories of these changes is the role of donor aid in this process. This is the subject of the Center for International Media Assistance’s latest report, Africa’s Media Boom: The Role of International Aid, by veteran international media consultant Mary Myers. It explores these questions: 	How much of a catalyst were foreign donors in this mushrooming of Africa’s news media? 	What were the motives and mechanisms of this aid? 	<b>What</b> <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> make at the time, and subsequently? 	Was media proliferation necessarily a good thing–did it lead to pluralism and genuine freedom...|$|R

Jail, indeed, was almost preferable. You knew where you were when you were in prison. They didn't spring things on you. Whereas life on a farm was nothing but one long succession of things sprung on you. Now that Lord Dawlish had gone, he supposed that Elizabeth would make him help her with the bees again.

40|$|The {{notion of}} text {{has a long}} {{tradition}} inside the human science. A broad definition of this concept considers all man-made products as systems of signs and thereby as texts; but often not “as the physical manifestation as such, but as the abstract representation of a work” (Gunder: 2001, 86). Considering that everything – including sculpture, music, photography and film – can become a text, either a written text – like literature in a traditional sense – or a verbal text, one can at least wonder whether the concept is useful or not. The notion of document with roots back to ancient times can be considered as multifaceted as the notion of text, but today’s literary critics or art scholars would probably hesitate to use this concept on literary texts or works of art. Speaking about literature as documents, art as documents, food or cloth as documents and so on, Documentation science at the University of Tromsø provokes many humanists. But if anything can be a document as well as a text – <b>what</b> <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> really make if we are using the one or the other concept? In this paper I will investigate the notion of document in comparison to the notion of text by means of some literary examples. Focusing on different aspects of literary works, I will try to argue that both concepts can exist side by side...|$|R

The sweeter side of his {{profession}} held him. After all, <b>what</b> <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> make if he might give comfort to women in distress? The prayers of notorious sinners had been answered on the spot. Why should not he, the vilest of hypocrites, yet honest for the time, ask for the life of a dying boy? He felt for his priest's prayerbook. Fortunately he had not changed his coat since his rude awakening. The little book he always carried was still in his breast pocket, fairly touching Mrs. Doan's letter and enclosed check. He found the place and began. His knees trembled, but his voice came strong and clear. A last opportunity {{had nothing to do with}} what might follow; this one moment was between God and his own conscience. Tenderness thrilled throughout him as he went on with familiar prayers. In the hall Maggie Murphy's sobs made passionate refrain for his importunate pleading; then instinctively he felt the presence of Isabel, knew that she stood behind him. He rose from the floor and faced her. She answered his unspoken question with a smile. [...] "He is better. The doctor thinks the anti-toxin has saved him."
