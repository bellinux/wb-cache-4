5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the poor, and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for the poor. As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for the poor. In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and <b>wire</b> <b>drawing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Metallic lead beads {{dating back}} to 7000–6500 BCE {{have been found in}} Asia Minor and may {{represent}} the first example of metal smelting. At that time lead had few (if any) applications due to its softness and dull appearance. The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena (a common lead mineral). The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an application that spread to Ancient Greece and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material, as currency, and for construction. Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant, as currency, and as a contraceptive; the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in <b>wire</b> <b>drawing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bar, tube, and <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> {{all work}} upon the same principle: the {{starting}} stock drawn through a die {{to reduce the}} diameter and increase the length. Usually the die is mounted on a draw bench. The end of the workpiece is reduced or pointed to get the end through the die.

25|$|Drawing dies are {{typically}} made of tool steel, tungsten carbide, or diamond, with tungsten carbide and manufactured diamond {{being the most}} common. For drawing very fine wire a single crystal diamond die is used. For hot drawing, cast-steel dies are used. For steel <b>wire</b> <b>drawing,</b> a tungsten carbide die is used. The dies are placed in a steel casing, which backs the die and allow for easy die changes. Die angles usually range from 6–15°, and each die has at least 2 different angles: the entering angle and approach angle.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>drawing</b> is a {{metalworking}} process used {{to reduce}} the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). [...] There are many applications for <b>wire</b> <b>drawing,</b> including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. [...] Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a cold working process, {{but it may be}} performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> {{process is}} quite simple in concept. The wire is {{prepared}} by shrinking {{the beginning of}} it, by hammering, filing, rolling or swaging, {{so that it will}} fit through the die; the wire is then pulled through the die. As the wire is pulled through the die, its volume remains the same, so as the diameter decreases, the length increases. Usually the wire will require more than one draw, through successively smaller dies, to reach the desired size. The American wire gauge scale is based on this. This can be done on a small scale with a draw plate, or on a large commercial scale using automated machinery. [...] The process of <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> changes material properties due to cold working.|$|E

40|$|Research {{activities}} on micro-forming {{have shown that}} the interactions between material, lubricant and forming tools substantially differ from those of macro-forming. Aimed at the development of models suitable for bulk micro-forming processes, the authors focus the research on micro <b>wires</b> <b>drawing.</b> This process can be considered a quasi-stationary process where material flow and tribological conditions at the interface between workmaterial and die can be assumed to be constant during the whole deformation. Therefore the determination of correlations between material behaviour, die-material interface and process parameters, is more straightforward if compared with three-dimensional or non stationary forming processes. The paper presents the main results of the experimental and numerical campaign on 300 μm wires aimed at: i) performing small reduction (few tens of μm) by fine <b>wires</b> <b>drawing,</b> ii) investigating different material models for surface and bulk layers by the measurement of UTS, as well as grain structure analysis...|$|R

2500|$|In 1906, the {{tungsten}} filament was introduced. Tungsten metal was initially {{not available in}} a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires. Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile. By 1910, a process was developed by William D. Coolidge at General Electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then <b>wire</b> <b>drawing.</b> It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small [...] "doping" [...] treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the {{tungsten filament}}s.|$|E
2500|$|To {{meet the}} {{reliability}} {{requirements of the}} 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, [...] "special-quality" [...] tubes with extended life, and a long-lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of silicon, used in the tungsten alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy (and more frequent replacement of the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> dies) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant SAGE air-defense computer system. SAGE computers were dual installations, with one operating, {{and the other in}} standby. To locate potential tube failures in the standby computer, heater voltages were reduced, which caused failures of tubes which would otherwise fail in service. These computers continued in service years after other tube computers had been superseded.|$|E
2500|$|Single block <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> {{machines}} include {{means for}} holding the dies accurately in position and for drawing the wire steadily through the holes. The usual design {{consists of a}} cast-iron bench or table having a bracket standing up to hold the die, and a vertical drum which rotates and by coiling the wire around its surface pulls it through the die, the coil of wire being stored upon another drum or [...] "swift" [...] which lies behind the die and reels off the wire as fast as required. The wire drum or [...] "block" [...] is provided with means for rapidly coupling or uncoupling it to its vertical shaft, so that {{the motion of the}} wire may be stopped or started instantly. The block is also tapered, so that the coil of wire may be easily slipped off upwards when finished. Before the wire can be attached to the block, a sufficient length of it must be pulled through the die; this is effected by a pair of gripping pincers {{on the end of a}} chain which is wound around a revolving drum, so drawing the wire until enough can be coiled two or three times on the block, where the end is secured by a small screw clamp or vice. When the wire is on the block, it is set in motion and the wire is drawn steadily through the die; it is very important that the block rotates evenly and that it runs true and pulls the wire at a constant velocity, otherwise [...] "snatching" [...] occurs which will weaken or even break the wire. The speeds at which wire is drawn vary greatly, according to the material and the amount of reduction.|$|E
