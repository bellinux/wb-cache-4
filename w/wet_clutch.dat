2500|$|Dual-clutch {{transmissions}} use two {{fundamentally different}} types of clutches: either two wet multiplate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry single-plate clutches. The <b>wet</b> <b>clutch</b> design is generally used for higher torque engines that can generate [...] and more (the wet multiplate clutch DCT in the Bugatti Veyron is designed to cope with [...] ), whereas the dry-clutch design is generally suitable for smaller vehicles with lower torque outputs up to [...] However, while the dry-clutch variants may be limited in torque compared to their wet-clutch counterparts, the dry-clutch versions offer an increase in fuel efficiency, {{due to the lack}} of pumping losses of the transmission fluid in the clutch housing.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a <b>wet</b> <b>clutch,</b> this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing. [...] All gears were vanadium steel running in an oil bath.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{transmission}} {{was invented by}} Frenchman Adolphe Kégresse just before World War II, although he never developed a working model. The first development of the twin-clutch or dual-clutch transmission started {{in the early part}} of 1980 under the guidance of Harry Webster at Automotive Products (AP), Leamington Spa, with prototypes built into the Ford Fiesta Mk1, Ford Ranger, and Peugeot 205. Initially, the control systems were based on purely analogue/discrete digital circuitry with patents filed in July 1981. All of these early AP twin-clutch installations featured a single dry clutch and multiplate <b>wet</b> <b>clutch.</b> Following discussions with VW/Porsche, DCT work continued from Porsche in-house development, for Audi and Porsche racing cars later in the 1980s, when computers to control the transmission became compact enough: the Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (...) (PDK) used in [...] the Porsche 956 and 962 Le Mans race cars from 1983, and the Audi Sport Quattro S1.|$|E
50|$|While {{most other}} {{manufacturers}} use <b>wet</b> <b>clutches</b> (with the spinning parts bathed in oil) Ducati previously used multiplate dry clutches {{in many of}} their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement {{may not be as}} smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the clutch plates can wear more rapidly. Ducati has converted to <b>wet</b> <b>clutches</b> across their current product lines.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} Iterative Learning Control (ilc) algorithms for the engagement of <b>wet</b> <b>clutches.</b> A two-level control scheme is presented, consisting of a high level ilc-type algorithm which iteratively updates parameterized reference trajectories which are tracked by the low level tracking control. At this low level, two standard ilc controllers are used to first track a pressure reference in the filling phase and afterwards a slip reference in the slip phase of the clutch engagement. The performance and robustness of the presented approach are validated on an experimental test setup. It is shown that both levels are crucial to achieve good engagement quality during normal machine operation.

50|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{immersed}} in a cooling lubricating fluid that also keeps surfaces clean and provides smoother performance and longer life. Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of a <b>wet</b> <b>clutch</b> can be slippery (as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil), stacking multiple clutch discs can compensate for the lower coefficient of friction and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.The Hele-Shaw clutch was a <b>wet</b> <b>clutch</b> that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.|$|E

40|$|A new control {{strategy}} of the filling phase for <b>wet</b> dual <b>clutch</b> transmission Hongtao Hao 1, 2, Tongli Lu 1, Jianwu Zhang 1 and Bin Zhou 1 The traditional filling {{control strategy}} mainly relies on {{a large number of}} calibrations and is an open loop control. In order to avoid cumbersome calibrations and improve the control precision, a systematic approach of the filling control for <b>wet</b> dual <b>clutch</b> transmission is established in this paper. First, a model of the electro-hydraulic actuator for the <b>wet</b> dual <b>clutch</b> transmissions is presented and validated by the experiments. Then, an analytic solution method is devel-oped for the filling control. To obtain the analytic solution of the filling pressure trajectory in the filling phase, the nonlinear mathematic model for <b>wet</b> <b>clutches</b> is transformed into a model in linear space by the feedback linearization, and then the optimal filling pressure trajectory is obtained based on Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle. Furthermore, to improve the control accuracy of a variable force solenoid, a closed loop control based on adaptive generalized predictive control algorithm is applied to the developed model of the electro-hydraulic actuator to track the optimal filling pressure trajectory. The simulation results indicate that the control strategy is effective for solving the filling control problem...|$|R
40|$|The Technology Division within Volvo CE is responsible, {{among other}} things, {{for the design}} and {{specifications}} of components for the transmissions and axles that {{form the basis of}} the construction machinery including wheel-loaders and articulated haulers. Within the transmissions, the clutch systems and transmission fluids are extremely vital components and especially <b>wet</b> <b>clutches</b> have very high demands placed on them in comparison to similar equipment in trucks, busses and passenger cars. To assess the viability of <b>wet</b> <b>clutches,</b> {{there are a number of}} factors to be investigated such as torque transfer capacity, friction levels in conjunction with specific lubricants and limits for wear of the material after a given number of engagement cycles. However current tests are both time-consuming and require relatively large amounts of fluid and material. In this thesis, the aim was to design and manufacture a test-rig adapter in such a way so as to allow easy, quick and online measurements of friction values throughout a test run including break-away friction values if possible. The information from the tests is also useful when writing control algorithms for the clutch control software. The rig adapter was designed by considering the industrial application. The standard operating conditions such as pressure, outer to inner diameter ratio of the friction material, power and energy values that are commonly used in automotive industry are taken into account. The trial test results have shown that the frictional results obtained from the test rig are realistic although it is unstable. It was also observed that due to the torque limit of the test-rig, the maximum load that can be applied is 2 kN. In conclusion, a test assembly has been developed for quick and cost efficient tests of <b>wet</b> <b>clutches</b> and lubricants. Further testing and development is, however, required to optimise the performance of the test rig. Validerat; 20110429 (anonymous...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new iterative learning strategy to control <b>wet</b> <b>clutches.</b> These are complex hydraulic {{systems that are}} commonly used in automatic transmissions of heavy duty vehicles, and their control aims at performing fast and smooth engagements. Learning is used to overcome the need for complex models and to ensure performance is maintained despite large variations in the system behavior. Classical iterative learning control techniques can however not be employed directly since reference trajectories corresponding to the performance requirements are unavailable. Instead, the presented iterative learning strategy translates the performance requirements directly into an objective function and constraints, hence constituting a numerical optimization problem. After each engagement, this problem is solved {{in order to find}} the control signal for the next engagement, using a piecewise linear model for the clutch. Learning is included by using the measured response data to update the models and constraints used by the optimization problem. The presented strategy is successfully validated on an experimental test bench containing <b>wet</b> <b>clutches.</b> The learning process is shown to converge towards the desired engagement quality, and a demonstration is given of the robustness with respect to changes in the operating conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|As the {{friction}} material degradation progresses, the normal contact stiffness of <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches,</b> {{measured in the}} pre-sliding (stiction) regime that corresponds to the post-lockup phase, changes as revealed in our previous study. Consequently, change of the contact stiffness can affect the normal-mode dynamic behavior. If this hypothesis holds, condition of <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches</b> can also be monitored based on the change of the normal-mode dynamic behavior. In order to verify the hypothesis, in this study, accelerated lifetime tests (ALTs) were carried out on two paper-based <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches</b> under different operations using an SAE# 2 test setup. The normal-mode vibration signal is measured every 200 duty cycles by using an accelerometer axially mounted on the bearing housing of the clutch. Three parameters that implicitly quantify the overall dynamic behavior, i. e., frequency centre (FC), root mean square frequency (RMSF), and root variance frequency (RVF), are extracted from the vibration signal measured in the post-lockup phase. The plots of these three parameters in function of the duty cycles exhibit clear trends which indicate {{the progress of the}} clutch degradation. These three parameters can therefore be seen as the important ones that may allow us to assess the condition of <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wet</b> {{friction}} <b>clutches</b> are {{machine elements}} enabling the power transmission from {{an input shaft}} to an output shaft during the operation, based on the friction occurring in lubricated contacting surfaces. These components {{play a critical role}} in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions, power shift transmissions and limited slip differentials. An unexpected failure occurring in clutches can lead to an unexpected total breakdown of the vehicle. This undesirable situation can put human safety at risk, possibly cause long-term vehicle down times, and eventually result in high maintenance costs. In order to minimize the negative impacts, an optimal maintenance strategy, i. e. a condition based maintenance (CBM), driven by an accurate condition monitoring and prognostics therefore needs to be developed and implemented for <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches.</b> A literature study has been carried out during this work in order to establish the state-of-the-art development of clutch monitoring and prognostics systems. Despite the fact that the performance demands for clutches increase, research in this direction is apparently very limited. Several methods related to this aspect have been reported in literature, but, they are not sufficiently pragmatic and flexible to implement for real-life applications. To fill this substantial gap, development of a clutch monitoring and prognostics method that can be easily implemented on real-life applications is the main objective of this thesis. There are two main failure modes that can interrupt the functionality of <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches</b> as reported in the literature, namely (i) lubricant and (ii) friction material degradations. This thesis mainly focuses on the failure of <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches</b> caused by the friction material degradation, which is a valid assumption for heavy-duty applications. In this scope, a better understanding of how friction material degradation affects the clutch dynamic behavior during its operation is of paramount importance for developing an effective clutch monitoring and prognostics system. In the first place, this thesis contributes to the contact modeling of nominally flat rough surfaces with asymmetric asperity heights distribution, which is relevant for clutch contact problems. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art of the clutch friction characteristics is established that leads to the derivation of a friction model appropriate for clutches, wherein some considerably important friction phenomena are taken into account. Subsequently, the effects of two major friction material degradation mechanisms, namely (i) adhesive wear and (ii) thermal degradation, on the clutch contact and friction characteristics are theoretically and experimentally investigated, which is the second contribution of this thesis. A novel experimental procedure, which is the third contribution, is proposed in order to systematically evaluate how the sliding friction characteristics of a clutch evolve during the lifetime. This way, the evolution of the frictionmodel parameters can be observed and quantified. A knowledge gained from the aforementioned evolution motivates to model and simulate the dynamic responses of a degrading clutch system. Based on the simulation results, some measurable ``features'' representing the progression of the clutch friction material degradation are derived, which is the fourth contribution. A feasibility study on the derived features recommends to develop two clutch monitoring methods: i. e. (a) post-lockup-features-based method and (b) pre-lockup-features-based method. In the first monitoring method, which is the fifth contribution, the torsional natural frequency and the corresponding damping extracted from the post-lockup torsional vibration signals are proposed as relevant features. The second monitoring method, which is the sixth contribution, utilizes the relative velocity signals of interest for extracting the relevant features, i. e. (i) the normalized engagement duration, (ii) normalized Euclidean distance and (iii) Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance. In order to evaluate and verify the developed monitoring methods, accelerated life tests (ALTs) were carried out on some commercial <b>wet</b> <b>clutches</b> using a fully instrumented SAE # 2 test setup which is designed by an industrial partner, Dana-Spicer Off Highway Belgium. The experimental results confirm that the developed monitoring methods are feasible to be used for practical applications. As the last contribution, a data-driven health assessment and prognostics method which can be used to assess the condition and to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches</b> is developed. This strategy has been successfully evaluated and verified on some commercially available <b>wet</b> <b>clutches.</b> The evaluation and verification show that the developed strategy is prospective for aiding a condition based maintenance for <b>wet</b> friction <b>clutches.</b> nrpages: 284 status: publishe...|$|R
