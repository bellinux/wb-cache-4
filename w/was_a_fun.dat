5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|With Thalapathi, Mani {{ended his}} {{long-term}} association with music director Ilaiyaraaja, bringing in debutant music director A. R. Rahman to score his Tamil classic Roja (1992). The venture was successful, earning Mani various awards. Roja, a romantic film, was about {{terrorism in the}} Kashmir region. Starring Arvind Swamy and Madhoo, it was nominated for the Golden St. George Award at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. It became highly popular, gaining an iconic status in Indian cinema and was dubbed into other languages and met similar success in other regions. Mani took a more light-hearted approach with his next film—Thiruda Thiruda (1993). Scripted by Ram Gopal Varma, the film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> filled caper, which was a departure from Mani's previous style and fared moderately well at the box office. Thiruda Thiruda was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1994.|$|E
500|$|... <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> song to do. Mariah {{brought me}} 'Genius of Love' and I laid some strings {{on it and}} put it into a groove I felt really fit and {{highlighted}} her voice. And that song didn't take us but a minute to do, because she really busted that out within two days. We did a rough copy and let Tommy Mottola hear it and he loved it, so all we had to do was bring it back in and mix it.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} of [...] "Chitty Chitty Death Bang" [...] the TV Critic called the writing in the episode wittier than in {{previous}} ones. He found the Stewie storyline very enjoyable, and also commented positively on {{the moral of the}} story. He criticized the Meg storyline as he did not find mass suicide funny; he also commented that Peter felt a lot like Homer from The Simpsons. In his final comments he said it had some odd moments but it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> story.|$|E
500|$|Keith {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song on his website in 2000. [...] "Initially, I said, 'Here's my title: [...] "You Never Loved Me Before, So How Do You Like Me Now?'" [...] It's one of my catch-phrases. A lot of people become successful after they've been told they won't ever be, so people can relate to this. It can be about an old flame or a boss or a teacher -whatever it means to each individual. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> song to write." ...|$|E

[...] Her character, she explained, [...] "is stuck between [...] the Captain and Peter Parker and Spider-Man, who have different ways about going about finding justice in their lives" [...] which she felt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> thing to explore.

500|$|Muransky is also {{remembered for}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the 1983 film The Big Chill: [...] "I was in the theater watching it, not knowing {{what was going to}} happen. It was kind of interesting with all of (the characters) watching (the 1980 Michigan-Michigan State game). It was pretty cool. Watching [...] John Wangler go back was pretty cool. For a split-second as they're going back, I'm thinking to myself, 'Oh my God, I pray to God I'm not holding or I missed a block for a sack or something on the big screen pass.' But it was a good block, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> moment. Any time I hear 'The Big Chill,' it's good memories." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{plot was}} {{similarly}} criticized, with Welsh calling it [...] "endearing, largely unpronounceable rubbish", while Hattfield termed it [...] "not Gyromancers strong point" [...] and [...] "a bit hard to follow". Miller dismissed it as [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "lackluster", while the GameTrailers reviewer {{said that it}} was [...] "somewhat thrown together". All the reviews, however, noted that the plot was largely irrelevant to the game next to the gameplay elements. Todd criticized the tutorial system as very inadequate, as well as the [...] "beyond cheesy" [...] music, a criticism that Hattfield left only to the [...] "Japanese videogame metal during boss battles", rather than the rest of Sekito's [...] "rousing orchestral tunes". Overall, however, the reviewers felt that Gyromancer <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun,</b> casual game.|$|E
500|$|School {{was never}} a concern for Babcock, {{and he did not}} earn his high school diploma until the age of 95. On growing up in the area, Babcock claims that he [...] "didn't do very much," [...] {{although}} he admits that [...] "t <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> place to grow up." [...] Babcock partook in fishing, hunting, and swimming—especially around the local Sydenham Lake—in order to pass the time with the other kids his age. He would return to the area in 1919, after his wartime experiences, but soon after left for the United States. Nevertheless, Babcock's relatives continue to work at the Crater Dairy farm (named after the Holleford crater, a remnant of a meteor strike) and the community grew to greatly respect John.|$|E

500|$|For the episode, McCreary {{composed}} a {{theme for the}} character of Akela Amador, a musical representation of her name with the notes arranged [...] "so that the syllables in her name land with the right emphasis. The melody basically suggests that you sing along with her name ... I also put two of the A’s and the D in Akela Amador’s name on those exact notes ... Starting with this association with her name <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> way to kickstart my creative process, and it also produced a malleable melody that could be adapted to my needs throughout the episode." [...] The theme is initially used with low strings or brass to sound ominous, or even evil, but when she [...] "reunites with Coulson for an emotional conversation, the strings repeat her theme in twisting, circular statements, adding angst and heartbreak." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] is a reggae pop song, with a dancehall groove, air horns, {{military}} drum {{beats and}} dub sirens in its instrumentation. The song {{is reminiscent of}} Diplo's original sound, having dancehall elements. Lyrically, the song talks about overcoming a bad breakup and rediscovering one's inner strength. The song received generally positive response from critics, who agreed it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun,</b> refreshing track, while noting it resembles the work of other artists produced by Diplo, such as M.I.A., Santigold, {{as well as his}} own group, Major Lazer. It charted in some European territories, {{as well as on the}} Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart. The song was part of Madonna's Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16), with the singer inviting a member of the audience to participate during the performance, rewarding them with a banana as a gift afterwards.|$|E
500|$|The {{film is a}} shot-for-shot {{adaptation}} of the comic book, similar to the film {{adaptation of}} Sin City. Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book, from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> process for me… to have a frame as a goal to get to," [...] he said. Like the comic book, the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal [...] "Frank Miller world" [...] of 300 was told from a subjective perspective. By using Dilios' gift of storytelling, {{he was able to}} introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that [...] "Dilios is a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth." [...] Snyder also added the subplot in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband.|$|E

500|$|In July 2013, Dennings {{told reporters}} that the film was about to head into reshoots. In August, Taylor said he shot extra scenes with Hiddleston {{and was about to}} shoot more with Hopkins. Taylor {{explained}} that it was all a part of the [...] "Marvel process" [...] saying, [...] "We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and we wanted to do more with him. So {{it was that kind of}} thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff." [...] Also in August, IMAX Corporation and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the IMAX 3D format and released into IMAX 3D theatres internationally beginning October 30, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Uprising has {{garnered}} {{a positive}} reception since release. On aggregate site Metacritic, the game scored 83/100 based on 75 critic reviews. Famitsu gave the game a perfect score of 40 points. In its review, the magazine praised {{the attention to}} detail, flexibility, and general gameplay balance. It also positively noted the game's dialogue. Marty Silva, writing for 1UP.com, {{said that there was}} [...] "a never-ending litany of things to love" [...] about Uprising. IGN's Richard George called Uprising [...] "a fantastic game" [...] despite its flaws. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer said that [...] "Kid Icarus: Uprising is a strong, pretty game turned into an essential one by way of its surrounding infrastructure." [...] GameSpot's Ashton Raze said that Uprising <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> game when it hit its stride, calling it [...] "a deep and satisfying shooter" [...] despite its issues with control and character movement. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report, while commenting on control issues, called Uprising an [...] "amazing game" [...] packed with content.|$|E
500|$|The game went gold on August 5, 2002, and was {{released}} on August 27. After the release of Icewind Dale II, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the Icewind Dale series, saying that, [...] "I wasn't particularly thrilled with how my work on [...] came out..." [...] and, [...] "... managed to actually be worse than my Icewind Dale stuff." [...] In regards to Icewind Dale II he said, [...] " [...] came out better than I expected, but still, not exactly awe-inspiring." [...] Chris Avellone later said, [...] "Icewind Dale <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> series, but it didn't try to set the bar for {{anything other than a}} fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls." [...] A Collector's Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. Icewind Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E

500|$|Walt Disney first {{attempted}} to adapt [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into an animated film {{soon after the}} studio released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, but the project was ultimately abandoned when the story {{turned out to be}} [...] "a really hard nut to crack". According to Keane, this was mainly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the fairy tale takes place within a tower. To overcome this, Tangleds writers were forced to develop a way of [...] "bringing Rapunzel out of the tower". Originally, the film was conceived under the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun,</b> wonderful, witty version and we had a couple of great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we set it aside and went back to the roots of the original fairy tale." ...|$|E
500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "I have {{a strong}} memory from my {{childhood}} of just how dark and gruesome their tale was and I wondered {{what would have happened}} to the two of them when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Declan Whitebloom in London on 28 November 2011.

[...] In regard to its concept, Whiteboom characterised the clip as [...] "kind of Monkees or Beatles-esque", elaborating that it revolves around [...] "five lads go crazy in London, it's like a big day out in London." [...] In a December interview with Capital FM, member Harry Styles reflected that the shoot <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun,</b> careless romp. Premiering on YouTube on 13 January 2012, the music video depicts the band performing in and around London. As of October 2017, the music video has garnered more than 550 million YouTube views. One Direction surged 35-10 from the previous week on Billboards Social 50 chart.
