25|$|The {{irony in}} his {{appearance}} in the above-mentioned episodes, is that 20 years before, LeBlanc left the role of Kirk McColl, the youngest son of Lisa's fifth husband, Whit McColl (played by Wagon Train star Robert Horton, who was killed off shortly before Fulton's return to the show). So, to many long-time fans of both As The World Turns and The Young and the Restless, seeing LeBlanc as the character from the latter show <b>was</b> <b>weird.</b> History was also made during LeBlanc's appearance on As the World Turns, since both shows are made by different production companies (Bell Dramatic Serial Company for The Young and the Restless; Procter and Gamble for As the World Turns), although {{they are on the}} same network.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "This Love" [...] also {{features}} Levine and his then-girlfriend, model Kelly McKee, {{in a few}} intimate scenes. The video used creative camera angles, thereby avoiding possible FCC action. A version of the video where a stream of computer-generated flowers cover up more was created for more conservative markets. When asked about the video, Levine said: [...] "It was surprisingly not weird and surprisingly not sexual. It was totally comfortable. I didn't get horny or anything, which <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> since I shot it with my girlfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{entered the}} Ocean Way Recording studio in Hollywood in February 1989 to record Mother's Milk. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> when I first joined the band because we {{recorded}} the album after I'd {{been in the}} band {{for just a few}} months and Chad had actually been in for just two weeks", Frusciante recalled. [...] "I was still a little bit confused about my position and we were just like four individuals. Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we've been doing we're now like an eight armed cosmic octopus!" [...] Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record's thirteen tracks with the intent of the band obtaining a hit record.|$|E

Chase says Park <b>is</b> <b>weird.</b> Adams {{counters}} that Park is a good doctor, but Chase says good doctors can <b>be</b> <b>weird,</b> like House. He admits Adams <b>is</b> <b>weird</b> too, but it's easier to put up with her because she's hot. He backs up and says she's normal and a pleasure to be with. She calls him weird. They start talking about guns. He thinks she likes shooting sport weapons for fun. Chase makes up a story about shooting kangaroos, but Adams realizes he's screwing with her.|$|R

[...] "I {{was the only}} one doing them and they <b>were</b> <b>weird.</b> It <b>was</b> the mid-70s and it was a bizarre {{combination}} of long hair with bell bottoms, {{the tail end of the}} hippie movement at its schlumpiest. With this, I sort of infused a 1930s idiotic grace that didn't go with the post-Watergate mentality that was prevalent at the time. They <b>were</b> <b>weird</b> films, but they got me into AFI." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{the band}} ended its brief tour {{in support of}} Tweez, most of its members {{attended}} college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> while I was doing [...] because I remember sitting there, and I just knew there was something about it. I've never heard anything like this. I'm really digging this but it's really fucking weird." ...|$|E
500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> on the set because he would keep going with the character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E
500|$|The first {{magazine}} to be primarily associated with fantasy and science fiction <b>was</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales, {{which appeared in}} March 1923. It was edited by Edwin Baird and published by Rural Publications, a company owned by Jacob Clark Henneberger and J.M. Lansinger. [...] Rural also launched a companion magazine, Real Detective and Mystery Stories. [...] Weird Tales was intended to provide a market for fantasy and weird fiction, and Henneberger was keen to obtain material unusual enough {{that it could not}} be sold to the existing pulp magazines. The authors Henneberger had hoped to publish, such as Ben Hecht and Emerson Hough, did not respond, and the planned monthly schedule soon began to slip, missing August and December, and several issues in mid-1924. [...] After thirteen undistinguished and unprofitable issues, Henneberger and Lansinger split the company, each taking one of the magazines; Henneberger kept control of Weird Tales and installed Farnsworth Wright as editor. [...] The magazine quickly began to improve, both in appearance and quality, as Wright nurtured talented fantasy writers such as Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft.|$|E

500|$|The {{video for}} the song was {{nominated}} in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Jon Wiederhorn from MTV News, the shots of the video are [...] "evocative and artistic, resembling {{a cross between a}} foreign film and a Chanel advertisement." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News said that Lee's disconnection in the video shows a [...] "distressed and emotionally wrought heroine." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised the video saying that Lee looked like a [...] "teen-misery titan" [...] and that she [...] "tiptoed through a marble castle of pain". He also concluded that she could have borrowed the dress from Stevie Nicks. During an interview with Spin in 2011 Lee said that it <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> for her to watch the old videos of the band including the one for [...] "My Immortal". She explained, [...] "Just watching our oldest videos, it's weird. I definitely remember watching 'My Immortal,' like, 'That was not some dream where it was really somebody else.' I've totally had a couple of those moments. It's cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Unknown (also {{known as}} Unknown Worlds) was an American pulp fantasy fiction magazine, {{published}} from 1939 to 1943 by Street & Smith, and edited by John W. Campbell. [...] Unknown was {{a companion to}} Street & Smith's science fiction pulp, Astounding Science Fiction, which was also edited by Campbell at the time; many authors and illustrators contributed to both magazines. [...] The leading fantasy magazine in the 1930s <b>was</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales, which focused on shock and horror. Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy magazine with more finesse and humor than Weird Tales, and put his plans into action when Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel Sinister Barrier, about aliens who own the human race. Unknowns first issue appeared in March 1939; in addition to Sinister Barrier, it included H. L. Gold's [...] "Trouble With Water", a humorous fantasy about a New Yorker who meets a water gnome. [...] Gold's story {{was the first of}} many in Unknown to combine commonplace reality with the fantastic.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{wrote that the}} live episode [...] "proved {{once and for all}} that Will & Grace should have been buried before now," [...] and Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk pointed out that its underlying storyline [...] "is a little too over-the-top." [...] Jessica Banov of The Fayetteville Observer wrote, [...] "The first live show... was so-so. The lighting <b>was</b> <b>weird,</b> and I'm not sure what was up with Debra Messing's hair. But it was funny to see Messing and Sean Hayes break from their scripts to giggle." [...] Cinquemani commented that Baldwin's [...] "absurd" [...] role as Malcolm [...] "is proving to be one of Will & Graces most enduring guest stars." [...] David Blum of The New York Sun reported that the producers of Will & Grace wasted Baldwin's [...] "prodigious talents on a supporting role this past season, when it's clear he could effortlessly carry his own network series." [...] Kauffman concluded that Grace's joke about George Bush being brain dead [...] "just falls amazingly flat".|$|E

500|$|Quinn <b>was</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales most {{prolific}} author, with a long-running sequence {{of stories about}} a detective, Jules de Grandin, who investigated supernatural events, {{and for a while}} he was the most popular writer in the magazine. [...] Other regular contributors included Paul Ernst, David H. Keller, Greye La Spina, Hugh B. Cave, and Frank Owen, who wrote fantasies set in an imaginary version of the Far East. [...] C.L. Moore's [...] story [...] "Shambleau", her first sale, appeared in Weird Tales in November 1933; Price visited the Weird Tales offices shortly after Wright read the manuscript for it, and recalls that Wright was so enthusiastic about the story that he closed the office, declaring it [...] "C.L. Moore day". [...] The story was very well received by readers, and Moore's work, including her stories about Jirel of Joiry and Northwest Smith, appeared almost exclusively in Weird Tales over the next three years.As well as fiction, Wright printed a substantial amount of poetry, with at least one poem included in most issues. [...] Originally this often included reprints of poems such as Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "El Dorado", but soon most of the poetry was original, with contributions coming from Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith, among many others. [...] Lovecraft's contributions included ten of his [...] "Fungi from Yuggoth" [...] poems, a series of sonnets on weird themes that he wrote in 1930.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Burton spoke with Jack Nicholson, Spielberg's initial choice for the role. Burton had {{previously}} worked with Nicholson on Batman (1989) and Mars Attacks! (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to {{use a combination of}} computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question. Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with Ewan McGregor on Down with Love (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague Johnny Depp. Viewing Finney's performance in Tom Jones (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a People magazine article comparing the two. McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a Southern American English accent. [...] "It's a much easier accent to do than a standard American accent because you can really hear it. You can get your teeth into it. Standard American is much harder because it's more lyrical." [...] The same dual casting applied to {{the role of}} Bloom's wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Burton commented that he was impressed with Lohman's performance in White Oleander (2002). Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was also cast in two roles. Her prosthetic makeup for The Witch took five hours to apply. [...] "I was pregnant throughout filming, so it <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> being a pregnant witch," [...] the actress reflected. [...] "I had morning sickness, so all those fumes and the make-up and the rubber...it was hideous." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy {{magazines}} {{began to be}} published in the US in the 1920s. Stories with science fiction themes had been appearing for decades in pulp magazines such as Argosy, but there were no magazines that specialized in a single genre until 1915, when Street & Smith, one of the major pulp publishers, brought out Detective Story Magazine. [...] The first magazine to focus solely on fantasy and horror <b>was</b> <b>Weird</b> Tales, which was launched in 1923, and established itself as the leading weird fiction magazine over the next two decades; writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and Robert E. Howard became regular contributors. [...] In 1926 Weird Tales was joined by Amazing Stories, published by Hugo Gernsback; Amazing printed only science fiction, and no fantasy. [...] Gernsback included a letter column in Amazing Stories, and this {{led to the creation of}} organized science fiction fandom, as fans contacted each other using the addresses published with the letters. [...] Gernsback wanted the fiction he printed to be scientifically accurate, and educational, as well as entertaining, but found it difficult to obtain stories that met his goals; he printed [...] "The Moon Pool" [...] by Abraham Merritt in 1927, despite it being completely unscientific. [...] Gernsback lost control of Amazing Stories in 1929, but quickly started several new magazines. [...] Wonder Stories, one of Gernsback's titles, was edited by David Lasser, who worked to improve the qualify of the fiction he received. [...] Another early competitor was Astounding Stories of Super-Science, which appeared in 1930, edited by Harry Bates, but Bates printed only the most basic adventure stories with minimal scientific content, and little of the material from his era is now remembered.|$|E
500|$|After Rachel and Ross drunkenly {{get married}} while on {{vacation}} in Las Vegas during season five, Schwimmer had initially objected {{to the idea of}} having his character Ross divorce her– his third divorce– because he felt that it was taking it [...] "too far." [...] The actor explained that [...] "The whole arc of the relationship <b>was</b> <b>weird</b> then ... because for [...] {{to be able to move}} on enough to marry someone else and then go back to being in love with Rachel later just went a bit too far." [...] Rachel and Joey's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel's reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten [...] "was for the greater good" [...] because [...] "It was inappropriate." [...] However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey, and Ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either [...] "resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them." [...] Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel's pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends [...] "to become a show about a baby" [...] while [...] "On the other hand, we don't want to pretend that there isn't one." [...] According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, the critical success and popularity of Rachel's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for [...] "propel the show to the top of the ratings". When it finally came time to write the series finale, [...] "The only thing [...] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together," [...] deciding, [...] "We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their 'will they or won’t they,' and we didn’t see any advantage in frustrating them" [...] any longer. However, at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with Ross and Rachel in [...] "a gray area of where they aren’t together, but we hint there’s a sense that they might be down the road." [...] Ultimately, Crane and Kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they want.|$|E
