25|$|While the Rams <b>were</b> <b>unmatched</b> offensively, the Browns' defense gave up half as {{many points}} during the regular season. Brown {{announced}} before the game that he would employ an umbrella defense against the Rams, {{similar to the one}} the Giants had used effectively against the Browns. His plan was to show Los Angeles the umbrella formation at first but switch back to the team's usual formation soon after.

While the scale, complexity, and violence of government <b>were</b> <b>unmatched,</b> the emperors lost control over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly to be wielded by anyone who paid for it. Meanwhile, the richest senatorial families, immune from most taxation, engrossed {{more and more of}} the available wealth and income, while also becoming divorced from any tradition of military excellence. At least one late Roman writer complains of [...] One scholar identifies a great increase in the purchasing power of gold, two and a half fold from 274 to the later fourth century, which may be an index of growing economic inequality between a gold-rich elite and a cash-poor peasantry.|$|E
2500|$|When the Congress party under Nehru {{chose to}} contest {{elections}} and accept power under the Federation scheme, Gandhi resigned from party membership. Gandhi did not disagree with Nehru's move, but {{felt that if}} he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership. When the elections following the introduction of provincial autonomy (under the government of India act 1935) brought the Congress party to power in {{a majority of the}} provinces, Nehru's popularity and power <b>were</b> <b>unmatched.</b> The Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah (who was to become the creator of Pakistan) had fared badly at the polls. Nehru declared that the only two parties that mattered in India were the British Raj and Congress. Jinnah's statements that the Muslim League was the third and [...] "equal partner" [...] within Indian politics was widely rejected. Nehru had hoped to elevate Maulana Azad as the pre-eminent leader of Indian Muslims, but in this, he was undermined by Gandhi, who continued to treat Jinnah as the voice of Indian Muslims.|$|E

50|$|The {{game was}} praised for its water effects, weather effects, and physics. The weather {{effects in the}} game, most people agreed, were outstanding. They caused wave height to vary and often came on slowly, or would let up {{surprisingly}} {{in the middle of}} a race. The weather also affected course layout, adding to the games variety. Physics in the game <b>were</b> <b>unmatched</b> by any other water-based game at the time. Waves that varied in height and intensity, wakes from other riders and more all attributed to the overall feel of the game and was usually mentioned as one of the games positives.|$|E
5000|$|If Flaccus governed both Spains {{and both}} Gauls, or any {{combination}} of the four provinces, the armed forces at his disposal <b>were</b> <b>unmatched</b> in the western empire.

[...] Until 85 BC or later, Flaccus either supported or acted in no way contrary {{to the interests of}} the Marian and Cinnan faction, which held the consulship from 87 to 82 BC. He appears to have been attempting to preserve legitimate authority while remaining neutral in the factional conflict, though the Valerii Flacci were generally popularist in their politics and had strong ties to Gaius Marius.|$|E
50|$|By {{the age of}} 17, Julián {{had become}} the highest-paid bullfighter in history. Not only did his good looks and {{affluent}} background add to his popularity, but his skills in the ring <b>were</b> <b>unmatched.</b> Julián often placed his own banderillas (spiked banners), which is typically {{the job of the}} banderillero. This requires the same amount of training as becoming a matador, and can be accomplished only by highly talented matadors. Additionally, in three out of his 134 performances in 1999, he was the lone matador. This meant killing all six bulls during the fight, rather than the usual two, by himself. This feat requires great skill and stamina, which further enhanced his reputation.|$|E
