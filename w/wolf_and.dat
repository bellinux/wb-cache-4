5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray <b>wolf</b> <b>and</b> Himalayan <b>wolf,</b> <b>and</b> the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E

Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red {{down the mountain}} in a cable car loaded with explosives and Granny goes after her, with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit. Red manages to free herself, and escapes with Granny, while the police, who have been located by the Wolf's assistant Twitchy, are waiting {{at the bottom of}} the mountain to arrest Boingo and his henchmen. Some time later, Kirk finds success as part of a yodeling troupe, and Red, Granny, the <b>Wolf,</b> <b>and</b> Twitchy are enlisted by Nicky Flippers to join a crime solving organization called Happily Ever After Agency.|$|E

5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does {{not pose a}} significant threat. Also, as <b>wolf</b> <b>and</b> dog mating seasons do not fully coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes were {{occasionally}} {{eaten by}} trappers and mountain men during the western expansion.

25|$|No {{agreement}} using modern DNA: In 2016, a whole-genome {{study of}} <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> dogs concluded that admixture had confounded {{the ability to}} make inferences about the place of dog domestication.

5|$|The {{ancestor}} {{of the golden}} jackal {{is believed to be}} the extinct Arno river dog that lived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9million years ago. It is described as being a small, jackal-like canine. Genetic studies indicate that the golden jackal expanded from India at the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The oldest golden jackal fossil is 20,000 years old and was found at the Ksar Akil rock shelter near Beirut, Lebanon. The oldest golden jackal fossils in Europe were found in Greece and are 7,000 years old. There are seven subspecies of the golden jackal. The golden jackal is not closely related to the African black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead more closely related to the gray wolf, coyote, African golden <b>wolf,</b> <b>and</b> Ethiopian wolf. It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both the gray <b>wolf</b> <b>and</b> the African golden wolf. Dog-jackal hybrids called Sulimov dogs are in service at the Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow where they are deployed by the Russian airline Aeroflot for scent-detection.|$|E

40|$|Wolves {{have the}} ability to live in {{different}} habitats. However, in recent years, in many areas wolf populations have drastically declined and some of them have disappeared. A major concern in the management of wolf populations is the hybridization between <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> dogs. In some regions, in order to generate strong breeds of guard dogs, <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> dogs are intentionally hybridized. In this study, gene flow between <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> dogs in Iran was examined, using a combination of uniparental markers: the mitochondrial DNA control region and four Y chromosome microsatellites. The species of origin of each haplotype was attributed by phylogenetic analyses. A very limited number of haplotypes was shared, suggesting limited gene flow between <b>wolves</b> <b>and</b> dogs in Iran. However, possible factors promoting hybridization are still present in the country and should not be neglected in the future management of the wild species...|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger {{than those of the}} gray <b>wolf,</b> <b>and</b> the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the gray <b>wolf,</b> <b>and</b> with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E
