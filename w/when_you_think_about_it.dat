And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman.

500|$|As with {{previous}} ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened {{the show with}} the theme [...] "Togetherness of Moviegoing" [...] commenting, [...] "The thing that's kind of wonderful about movies is that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you do that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> are religion and sports." [...] He concluded by noting that the movie theater is [...] "a wonderful place where you come together to laugh, to cry." [...] In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from Matinee, Casablanca, and A Streetcar Named Desire depicting audiences inside a movie theater.|$|E
500|$|Clocking in at {{over two}} hours in length and {{containing}} 34 tracks, The Astonishing was planned as an immersive experience that would be best enjoyed as a full album {{as opposed to a}} collection of singles. The album plays out similarly to a film, with Loudwire observing, [...] "It’s an enormous amount of music to absorb in one sitting, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> most movies are around {{two hours in}} length, and The Astonishing is very much like a movie in the way it delivers the storyline." [...] Certain songs, such as [...] "A Savior in the Square" [...] and [...] "Our New World", have reoccurring themes, while others stand more on their own in order to move the plot along.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the show}} were often favorable, noting it was fun {{entertainment}} for the family. After Double Dare premiered, Kenneth R. Clark, media writer for the Chicago Tribune, observed that when contestants [...] "squeal and make faces, it is somehow natural, wholesome and infectious," [...] and said, [...] "Double Dare is so refreshing." [...] Noel Holston of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune wrote that [...] "kids and game shows, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> go together like hot fudge and ice cream". The Orange County Registers Ellen T. Klein said Double Dare is [...] "such fast-paced, furious and messy fun" [...] and rated the show as [...] "good". In 1988, television critic Ken Tucker cited the interaction between, and the performances of host Marc Summers and announcer Harvey as [...] "the not-so-secret ingredients in the show's success in drawing adult, as well as youthful, viewers".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} cast for their hamming and {{effective}} delivery of what Bennion called the [...] "stilted, stagy dialogue"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting [...] "stellar". The {{attention to detail}} by {{the cast and crew}} was widely praised; the [...] "dated styling" [...] was, for Jackson, [...] "spot on". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that [...] "from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole". For her, [...] "the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own—these days {{you have to be very}} good to make TV that bad". White, similarly, argued that [...] "it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it [...] "relatively gripping". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, [...] "both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown".|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, after both Forster and McLennan {{had each}} {{recorded}} four solo albums, The Go-Betweens reformed with Pickvance, {{to create a}} new studio album, The Friends of Rachel Worth, they were assisted by Janet Weiss (Sleater-Kinney, Quasi) on drums and backing vocals and Sam Coomes (Quasi) on keyboards. It was issued in September with Bäumler credited for string arrangements, and production duties shared by Coomes, Forster, McLennan and Weiss. Allmusic's Hal Horowitz praised their [...] "oetic, languid, spoken/sung vocals similar to Lou Reed weave between lovely melodies whose appeal unfolds with repeated listens"; however it [...] "sounds more like a combination of two solo albums rather than one from a cohesive unit". The Village Voices critic, Robert Christgau, described them as [...] "rather than lyric poets, as I once thought, Forster and McLennan are better conceived as short-story writers, with the concreteness and forward motion of voices and music compensating for imagistic technique and low word count". He declared that Foster's tracks [...] "are the catchiest and most fetching tracks on the album, taking up surfing dreams, a fond and funny envoi to Patti Smith, and a life-swapping fable that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> may be a love song after all".|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} Jerome Valeska's {{return in the}} season, Stephens stated, [...] "What I will say about Jerome is that Jerome is in Arkham right now, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Arkham's record of keeping people locked up, we will {{probably}} see him again {{before the end of}} the year." ...|$|R

2500|$|Also {{once again}} turning {{out for this}} tour was John Robb who again ecstatically {{reviewed}} the Manchester date of the tour (14 December 2011 at the HMV Ritz) for his Louder Than War website. [...] Robb singled out for particular praise new album track Vince Taylor (about the 1960s musician of that name) which was premiered on the tour. [...] "Vince Taylor is primetime Adam Ant. It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam... People keep talking about the best new band of the year. In a weird way here it is {{right in front of}} you. Decades in and Adam Ant sounds fresher than ever, reinvigorated he sounds like he has just started ... As Adam strips down to semi nakedness during the filthy Physical- the long, slow f—k of the set has reached its climax. It seems astonishing <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> but Adam Ant is currently fronting one of the best rock n roll shows in the UK right now." ...|$|E

[...] "A June steelhead, fresh from the sea, is pretty good, but a salmon that has pushed through to head waters in the fall is another thing. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the salmons' journey inland is remarkable. They bore against the autumn floods when the melted snow comes down; they force {{tremendous}} rapids, whirlpools, and roaring falls. Where the water's calm in the valleys, eagles and fish-hawks harry them, and the mink hunts them in the shallows. But they can't be stopped; they follow Nature's urge and shove on across all obstacles for the distant gravel banks. Then they spawn, where they were hatched, and the bears eat their spent carcasses. The trouble is, I'm not a bear, but I've got to eat salmon." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{title of}} this album is a play on words of the classic Chinese saying, [...] "日有所思，夜有所夢", which {{literally}} translates to [...] "thoughts during the day, dreams in the night".

5000|$|In {{a review}} for the song, Music Week stated: [...] "Self-deprecating and {{completely}} infectious, {{this will be}} all over the radio", while Scotland's Daily Record made it Single of the Week.

5000|$|However, Cook {{did more}} than just {{enlighten}} people about plants.

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Goya, {{who painted}} the most horrendous {{pictures}} {{of violence and}} torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look– look at this.'
