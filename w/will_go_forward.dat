25|$|When not urinating into a toilet, {{squatting}} is {{the easiest}} way for a female to direct the urine stream (although many women find {{that they can do}} so standing up). If done this way, the urine <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> Some females use one or both hands to focus the direction of the urine stream, which is more easily achieved while in the squatting position.|$|E
2500|$|As a simulation, the biomorphs are {{not much}} closer to the actual genetic {{behavior}} of biological organisms. Like the Weasel program, their development is shaped by an external factor, in this case the decisions of the experimenter who chooses which of many possible shapes <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> into the following generation. They do however serve to illustrate the concept of [...] "genetic space," [...] where each possible gene is treated as a dimension, and the actual genomes of living organisms make up a tiny fraction of all possible gene combinations, most of which will not produce a viable organism. As Dawkins puts it, [...] "however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I cannot {{return to}} the house," [...] I thought; [...] "I cannot sit by the fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs than strain my heart; I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> and meet him." ...|$|E
6000|$|But to {{come down}} from great men and higher matters to my [...] little {{children}} and poor school-house again; I will, God [...] <b>willing,</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> orderly, as I purposed, to instruct children [...] and young men both for learning and manners.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Will</b> <b>went</b> <b>forward</b> {{to do her}} the honour. She ran to me, saying, [...] "Get away, you fat foolâ€”keep on {{your own}} preserves. Now Georgie dear, come and kiss me, 'cause you haven't got nobody else but me, no y' ave n't. Do {{you want to run}} away, like Georgy-Porgy apple-pie? Shan't cry, sure I shan't, if you are ugly." ...|$|R
5000|$|If a {{contestant}} {{fails to}} make any successful kick at a particular distance they <b>will</b> not <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> to the next round.|$|R
6000|$|... "Northmour," [...] I said (we still {{continued}} {{to talk in}} whispers), [...] "it {{is not possible to}} endure this suspense. I prefer death fifty times over. Stay you here to watch the pavilion; I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> and make sure, if I have to walk right into their camp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doubtless {{he feels}} sure, {{as we could}} not find you, that you are dead, Sidi. I have no doubt the sight of you will do him {{a great deal of}} good. I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> and let him know that you are here. Do not show {{yourself}} until I call you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{nothing will}} move {{you to go}} back," [...] I continued, [...] "there are still some decencies to be observed. Wait here with your baggage, and I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> and prepare your family. Your father is an old man; and ..." [...] I {{stumbled}} ... "there are decencies to be observed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay {{where you}} are, Hugh, with the horses. I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> quietly <b>forward.</b> If {{the place is}} occupied, we <b>will</b> <b>go</b> back. We can't expect {{hospitality}} in Bavaria." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is a comfort, certainly, to {{find that}} after all one did learn {{something}} useful in Alexandria! So I <b>will</b> even <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> at once, and employ my artistic skill.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because none of {{you have}} {{signified}} your desire to be relieved from the enlistment, we will suppose all are <b>willing</b> to <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> and from now out {{there can be no}} excuse for insubordination or hesitation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like to fire," [...] Will said. [...] "The alarm would spread, and {{the whole}} camp get under arms. There is {{something}} moving, I am convinced; {{but it may be}} only a stray bullock. I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> and see if I can make it out; and do you stand ready to fire, if I am attacked.|$|E
6000|$|... "If--as {{is likely}} enough--we stumble {{against some of}} them, we will say we are wounded, and are making {{our way to the}} rear. They cannot see us in the dark, and my Afghan will pass muster; and Yossouf will {{certainly}} not be suspected. If I am discovered and killed, he <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> and deliver the message." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} nearer than it was," [...] Captain Peel said to Mr. Hethcote. [...] "No orders have come, but I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> myself {{and see what}} is doing. Even our help, small as it is, may be useful at some critical point. I will take two of the midshipmen with me, and will send you back news of what is doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>will</b> we <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> together, {{my young}} Masters Birkenholt. I {{am not going}} to part with my doughty champions!"--patting Stephen's shoulder. [...] "Ye'd not think that these light-heeled knaves belonged to the brave craft of armourers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Even so?' {{said the}} lady, {{in a tone}} of reproach, yet mingled with respect and apprehension. 'And thus you <b>will</b> still <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> like a stag upon the hunter's snares, with undoubting confidence, after all that has happened?' ...|$|R
25|$|Centre-backs <b>will</b> usually <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> for set piece {{corners and}} free-kicks, where their height and jumping ability {{give them an}} aerial goal threat, while {{defensive}} duties are covered by the full-backs. Once the set piece is complete, they will retreat to their own half.|$|R
60|$|I {{think it}} is not untrue {{to say that in}} these years we are passing through a decisive period {{in the history of our}} country. The {{wonderful}} century which followed the Battle of Waterloo and the downfall of the Napoleonic domination, which secured to this small island so long and so resplendent a reign, has come to an end. We have arrived at a new time. Let us realise it. And with that new time strange methods, huge forces, larger combinations--a Titanic world--have sprung up around us. The foundations of our power are changing. To stand still would be to fall; to fall would be to perish. We must go forward. We <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b> We <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> into a way of life more earnestly viewed, more scientifically organised, more consciously national than any we have known. Thus alone shall we be able to sustain and to renew through the generations which are to come, the fame and the power of the British race.|$|E
60|$|Yeo.--The Lord's {{people were}} always a reviled people and a persecuted people: but I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward,</b> sir; for Heaven forbid but that I should declare what God has done for me. For till lately, from my youth up, I was given over to all wretchlessness and unclean living, and was by nature {{a child of the}} devil, and to every good work reprobate, even as others.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we do not}} do so," [...] he said, [...] "they will assuredly {{think that}} it is the corsair fleet {{advancing}} to attack and burn the vessels in port, and you may be saluted as you approach by a shower of cannonballs. If you will permit me, Sir Gervaise, I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> in one of the prizes and explain matters, and will return here in a short time." ...|$|E
50|$|On May 6, 2014, the Dart SRT was {{confirmed}} by the FIAT Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) group. Originally based on the 5-year plan {{it looked like the}} unveiling of the Dart SRT was set for December 2016, but due to Fiat Chrysler's decision to end production on the Dart, the SRT trim <b>will</b> not <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> as planned.|$|R
50|$|Sky News Radio was a {{proposed}} 24-hour news station. The proposal was {{a joint venture}} between Sky, which runs a television news channel, and Chrysalis Radio, which owned LBC 97.3 FM and LBC News 1152 AM in London. However LBC's new owners Global Radio pulled out of the deal. It is unknown whether the channel <b>will</b> still <b>go</b> <b>forwards,</b> or what <b>will</b> replace it.|$|R
50|$|The elder Hays {{was indicted}} for inciting {{the murder and}} tried some years later. His case ended in a mistrial when he {{collapsed}} in court. Judge Zoghby said {{that because of the}} illness of the elder Hays, then 71, {{he had no choice but}} to declare a mistrial. Hays' lawyer was <b>willing</b> to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with proceedings. Hays died of a heart attack before he could be retried.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Tristram, [...] "those {{are indeed}} two very good, worthy knights. Now {{if you will}} sit here for a while, I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> and have speech with them." [...] "Messire," [...] said Gouvernail, [...] "I would counsel you {{not to have to}} do with those knights, for there are hardly any knights more famous at arms than they, so it is not likely that you can have success of them if you should assay them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of no use," [...] he said; [...] "they {{have the}} best dogs in our village. As well might a rabbit pursue a deer. No; there is but one course. The land-ice is impassable, but the floes out on the sea seem still to be fast. If they break up while we are on them we shall be lost. Will Ridroonee agree to take old Kannoa back to her friends, and I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with the sledge alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The wide prospect, so {{beautiful}} in its stillness {{but a few}} minutes ago, almost carried despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all round her, seeing no help. 'Rachael, we must lose not a moment. We must go in different directions, seeking aid. You shall go by {{the way we have}} come, and I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> by the path. Tell any one you see, and every one what has happened. Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!' ...|$|E
50|$|Unfortnately {{management}} at Channel M decided {{that due to}} the Superleague rights held by Sky Sports, they were not <b>willing</b> to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with another series that did not contain game action, and that the asking price for buying in the footage {{was more than the}} Guardian Media Group could afford. It was for this reason that the programme was not recommisioned by Channel M for the 2009 season.|$|R

60|$|SNOW. [Rather sardonically.] I might point out, sir, that to {{withdraw}} the charge of stealing would not make much difference, because the facts must come out [he looks significantly at JACK] {{in reference to the}} assault; and as I said that charge <b>will</b> have to <b>go</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But Nigel {{pushed the}} old man back. [...] "There {{is no time for}} this," [...] he said. [...] "Now hark you, priest--if priest indeed you be--your gown and tonsure will not save you if you play us false, for we are here of a set purpose and we <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with it, come what may.

6000|$|That she {{was more}} vital to him than any other {{woman in the world}} he now knew, but he {{acknowledged}} nothing base in this confession. He was not seeking ways to possess her of his love--on the contrary, he was resolved to conduct himself so nobly that she would again trust and respect him. [...] "My love is honorable," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> as in the beginning--why should I not?--enjoying her companionship as any honest man may do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nod took a {{long breath}} and shut his eyes. [...] "I was thinking," [...] he said, [...] "what stupid fellows must be these dogs of yours, seeing that {{each and every one}} keeps whimpering, 'The head--the head for me!' But they must wait in {{patience}} yet a little longer, if even a knucklebone is to be a share. I <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> and choose out all that I and the Mulla-mulgars, my brothers, want of the Oomgar's house-treasures before the Jaccatrays tear everything to pieces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Row easy, men," [...] {{the mate}} commanded. [...] "We cannot {{be far from}} shore now, and we must begin to look out sharp for rocks. Row light and aisy, and do not make more noise with your oars than you can help. The natives may be {{listening}} for us; {{and we do not}} want a shower of spears in the boat.

2500|$|Coordination {{of design}} bureaus {{developing}} {{life support systems}} for manned spaceflight: [...] spacesuits, parachutes, air regeneration etc. Kamanin's diaries present hims as a risk-taker, <b>willing</b> to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> with incomplete systems to beat the Americans to orbit. Later, when the space programs focused on fully automatic controls, Kamanin asserted his viewpoint in favor of human controls. At the same time, during 1962 discussions on flight duration, he {{was always on the}} conservative side, voting for no more than two day spaceflights.|$|R
40|$|I {{have chosen}} Sona Cervena, because I had the {{opportunity}} to get to know her and even stand with her on one stage and understand that she is and Artist with big A. She has sacrificed her whole life to theatre, {{but it was not a}} sacrifice for her, because she took theatre as her family.
