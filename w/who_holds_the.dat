5|$|Following {{in a long}} {{tradition}} of all-American teenager Archie Andrews meeting unusual celebrities and pop culture icons, this comic book shows him meeting the galaxy's deadliest hunter, the Predator. The idea was first suggested in the Archie office and then proposed to Dark Horse, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> license to comics featuring the Predator character owned by 20th Century Fox. The companies paired de Campi, a horror writer at Dark Horse, with Ruiz, a regular Archie artist. When the comic book was announced, many media outlets noted in their headlines that the new title was not a joke.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, one of Luton's {{greatest}} sides emerged under manager Dally Duncan. The team included Gordon Turner, {{who went on}} to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, Bob Morton, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> record for the most club appearances, and Syd Owen, an England international. During this period, Luton sides also featured two England international goalkeepers, Ron Baynham and Bernard Streten, as well as Irish internationals Seamus Dunne, Tom Aherne and George Cummins. This team reached the top flight {{for the first time in}} 1955–56, after finishing the season in second place behind Birmingham City on goal average. A few years of success followed, including an FA Cup Final appearance against Nottingham Forest in 1958–59; at the end of the season, Owen was voted FWA Footballer of the Year. However, the club was relegated the following season and, by 1964–65, was playing in the fourth tier.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VII is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Square for the PlayStation console. Released in 1997, {{it is the}} seventh main installment in the Final Fantasy series. Published in Japan by Square, it was released in the West by Sony Computer Entertainment, becoming {{the first in the}} main series to be released in Europe. The game's story follows Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins an eco-terrorist organization to stop the world-controlling megacorporation, Shinra, from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of Sephiroth, a superhuman intent on destroying their planet. During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including Aerith Gainsborough, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> secret to saving their world.|$|E
5|$|Other notable honours {{bestowed}} upon West Brom players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which {{was presented to}} Cyrille Regis in 1979. In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles. Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager. In 1919–20, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown. Brown, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007.|$|E

Tassadar is voiced by Michael Gough in StarCraft, with Michael Dorn playing the part in later appearances. Described as being fascinated with, if somewhat wary of, the dark templar, Tassadar is {{the commander of the}} fleet that made first contact with the Terrans by destroying their colony of Chau Sara to contain Zerg infestation. However, Tassadar eventually disregards his orders to continue destroying worlds with no concern for the Terrans, and instead engages the Zerg by conventional means. After tracking the Zerg to their homeworld of Char, he encounters the dark templar Zeratul and Jim Raynor, forging a friendship with the two and learning how to use his psionic powers in conjunction with the powers of the dark templar.|$|E
5|$|The Warren Spahn Award is {{presented}} each season by the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame {{to the best}} left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). The award is named after Warren Spahn, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> MLB record in wins for a left-handed pitcher with 363.

5|$|Baroš {{was banned}} indefinitely from playing for his {{national}} side in April 2009 after {{a breach of}} discipline, having attended a bar late at night. However, he was recalled to the national side after the appointment of Ivan Hašek as head coach. On 12 August 2009, he marked his return to international duty with a goal from the penalty spot in the 3–1 home win against Belgium in a friendly match. The following month, Baroš scored a career high of four goals against San Marino, in a World Cup qualifier which the Czech Republic won 7–0. In doing so, he became only the second player from the Czech Republic to score four goals in an international match. He was selected {{as part of the}} squad for Euro 2012. After the tournament, during which he failed to score, Baroš announced his retirement from international football, having scored a total of 41 international goals in 93 matches. His total of 41 international goals for his country is second only to strike partner Jan Koller, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> record with 55.|$|E

5|$|In Deathmatch, {{all players}} compete {{against each other}} and the strongest player wins. Team Deathmatch is similar, but players form two teams. In Capture the Flag, a player must {{retrieve}} the flag from his enemy's base, and bring it to his own team's base. In Sabotage, one team must place a bomb in three different locations, while the opposite team must protect these areas; the protectors win if the time limit is exceeded (except if the time is set to infinite). The bomb is always found {{at the beginning of the}} team base, and the player <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> bomb must wait 12 seconds until he may drop it and take shelter from the ensuing detonation. In The Hunt, players must shoot ghosts, which become gradually smaller after receiving hits. The player only has one weapon, the hunting gun, with which he can also shoot human opponents. Power Up is a deathmatch game, in which boxes containing special, temporary abilities, such as invisibility and higher speed, are found throughout the map.|$|E
5|$|Sharing {{agreements}} {{may also}} be used as a loophole to control television stations in situations where it is legally impossible to own them outright. For instance, FCC regulations only allow a single company to own more than one full-powered television station in a given market if there are at least eight distinct station owners, and also prohibits the ownership of two or more of the four highest-rated stations (based on total day viewership) in a market. An LMA or similar agreement does not affect the ownership of the station's license, meaning that they do not require the approval of the FCC to establish, and the two stations are still legally considered separate operations from a licensing standpoint. Both Tribune Media and the Gannett Company were required to use shared services agreements as a similar loophole to take control of certain stations in their respective 2013 purchases of Local TV and Belo, as they did not have exemptions to the FCC's newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in the affected markets. Both companies have since spun out their publishing arms as independent companies; the Tribune Publishing Company and Gannett Company. Tegna, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> former Gannett's broadcasting and digital media properties, re-acquired the licenses for most of the affected stations following the split.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{entered the}} draft with needs at {{positions}} including offensive lineman, linebacker, defensive lineman and cornerback. In the first round, with the twentieth pick, the Bears selected Oregon offensive tackle Kyle Long. Long, {{the son of}} Pro Football Hall of Famer Howie Long and younger brother of St. Louis Rams' defensive end Chris Long, played in only 21 games while starting 15 with Oregon. In the second round, with the fiftieth pick, the Bears selected Jon Bostic, a linebacker from Florida, who recorded 68 tackles with the nation's fifth-ranked defense in 2012. Two rounds later, the Bears used their 117th overall pick on Rutgers linebacker Khaseem Greene, <b>who</b> <b>holds</b> <b>the</b> NCAA record for career forced fumbles with 15. In the fifth round, the Bears traded down ten spots with the Atlanta Falcons to draft Louisiana Tech offensive tackle Jordan Mills, marking {{the first time the}} team selected two offensive linemen in the same draft since 2002. In the sixth round, Chicago selected Georgia Bulldogs defensive end Cornelius Washington, who led linebackers in the bench press at the NFL Combine with 36 repetitions at 225 pounds. Using a seventh-rounder acquired in the trade with Atlanta, the Bears drafted wide receiver Marquess Wilson, who left the Washington State football team, citing abuse from head coach Mike Leach despite setting team records with 82 receptions for 1,388 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2011, followed by 52 receptions for 813 yards and five touchdowns in 2012.|$|E
