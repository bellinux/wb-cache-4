5|$|For males, {{selection}} of the best breeders is more complex. The first step is <b>weaning,</b> when the morphology of calves and the known qualities of their parents are used to make an initial {{selection of}} animals that receive the qualification Reproductive Hope (in French Reproducteur Espoir, abbreviated to Espoir). Annually in excess of about 700 bull calves are then selected to enter the national evaluation station at , close {{to the city of}} Limoges in central France, just after <b>weaning,</b> when they are about seven months old. At Lanaud the animals are grouped together to compare their performance under identical feeding and environmental conditions to the age of 13–14 months. The differences observed between the animals are then related principally to their genetics, which is of interest to breeders because this is what is transmitted to a bull's progeny.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are unusual among {{primates}} {{for their}} rapid dental development, {{particularly among the}} largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption. By contrast, anthropoid primates exhibit slower dental development with increased size and slower morphological development. Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, and have their full permanent dentition at <b>weaning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{time their}} mating and birth seasons {{so that all}} <b>weaning</b> periods are {{synchronized}} to match the time of highest food availability. <b>Weaning</b> occurs either before or shortly after the eruption of the first permanent molars in lemurs. Mouse lemurs are able to fit their entire breeding cycle into the wet season, whereas larger lemurs, such as sifakas, must lactate for two months during the dry season. Infant survival in some species, such as Milne-Edwards' sifaka, {{has been shown to}} be directly impacted by both environmental conditions and the rank, age, and health of the mother. The breeding season is also affected by geographical location. For example, mouse lemurs give birth between September and October in their native habitat in the Southern Hemisphere, but from May through June in the captive settings in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|A common snack in Africa is Koki or Moyin-Moyin, {{where the}} cowpeas are mashed into a paste and then wrapped in banana leaves.

Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which {{typically}} form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after <b>weaning</b> and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The {{black-tailed prairie dog}} forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists of an adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although {{generally}} similar to adults, newborn calves have false eyelashes, a long dorsal mane and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and {{give way to}} the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in {{the first few months of}} birth, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and <b>weaning</b> takes place at six months. Horn development in males takes one year after birth. The okapi's average lifespan is 20 to 30 years.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examined {{differences in}} dietary patterns and adequacy of moth­ers and their <b>weaned</b> {{children between the}} less modernized Pwo animist and the more modernized Sgaw Christian highland Karen of northwest Thailand. 24 -hour dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires revealed that Pwo moth­ers and their <b>weaned</b> children consumed overall fewer food items and had less dietary diversity than Sgaw mothers and their <b>weaned</b> children in all three sea­sons {post-harvest, pre-harvest and harvest). There were particular differences in the consumption of fruits, vegetables, marine foods and eggs in all seasons between the two groups. Dietary adequacy was lower among both Pwo mothers and their <b>weaned</b> children than among Sgaw mothers and their <b>weaned</b> chil­dren.

Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, <b>weaning</b> customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas. The Zion Cinema closed in 1972 and was demolished. In its place, a high-rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel (on the upper floors) and a branch of Bank Hapoalim (on the lower floors) was erected.|$|E
5|$|High {{mortality}} {{rates have been}} recorded in the Serengeti. In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till <b>weaning</b> was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E

After the operation, her surgeons had trouble <b>weaning</b> her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
40|$|This {{demonstration}} project studied {{the differences in}} farrowing crate designs and the survival of piglets. Three basic crate designs were studied: crates with hydraulic side rails, crates with solid rod finger side rails, and freestall crates. Crates with hydraulic sides in this study had more pigs born alive, had fewer pigs born dead, <b>weaned</b> more pigs, and had higher <b>weaned</b> litter weights than any other crate studied. The freestall crates had the least number of pigs born alive, <b>weaned</b> fewest pigs, and had the lightest litter <b>weaned</b> weights. Freestall crates fell {{in the middle of}} hydraulic and solid rod crates for pigs born dead. The solid rod crates fell in the middle of hydraulic and freestall crates for pigs born alive and <b>weaned</b> litter weight. Solid rod crates <b>weaned</b> slightly more pigs than freestalls.

5000|$|The {{birthing}} {{season for}} the Kashmir gray langur runs from January through June, although {{almost half of all}} infants are born in March. The infants are <b>weaned</b> at a higher age than most Asian colobines. While most Asian colobines <b>wean</b> their young within the first year, Kashmir gray langurs <b>wean</b> their young on average at 25 months. This is apparently due to nutritional constraints, since monkeys in poorer sites <b>wean</b> their young at an older age. The interbirth interval for females is about 2.4 years. Alloparental care occurs in Kashmir's gray langur for up to 5 months. Males are usually protective of infants, but infanticide occasionally occurs.|$|R
5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after <b>weaning,</b> and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E

5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} {{protective}} {{of their young}} and may keep others at a distance. However, calves are occasionally left in nurseries which are guarded by {{one or a few}} adults. Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. <b>Weaning</b> starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant every couple of years (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E

5|$|Okapis are {{primarily}} diurnal {{but may be}} active {{for a few hours}} in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and <b>weaning</b> takes place at six months.|$|E
5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce baby food capable of being consumed by the child during the <b>weaning</b> process. The chewed food {{in the form of a}} bolus is transferred from the mouth of one individual to another, either directly mouth-to-mouth, via utensils, hands, or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding.|$|E
5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, <b>weaning</b> at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} riluzole (RIL) - and flufenamic acid (FFA) -sensitive mechanisms in respiratory rhythmogenesis in rats and hamsters using the in situ arterially perfused preparation. Based on the hypothesis that respiratory networks in animals capable of autoresuscitation would have a greater prevalence of membrane mechanisms that promote endogenous bursting, we predicted that older (<b>weaned)</b> hamsters (a hibernating species) would {{be more sensitive to}} the blockade of RIL- and FFA-sensitive mechanisms than age-matched rats and that younger (preweaned) rats would behave more like hamsters. Consistent with this, we found that respiratory motor output in <b>weaned</b> hamsters [> 21 days postnatal (P 21) ] was highly sensitive to RIL (0. 2 – 20 μM), while in young rats (P 12 – 14) it was less so (only affected at higher concentrations of RIL), and <b>weaned</b> rats were not affected at all. On the other hand, respiratory motor output was equally reduced by FFA (0. 25 – 25 μM) in both young and <b>weaned</b> rats but was unaffected in <b>weaned</b> hamsters. Coapplication of RIL and FFA (RIL + FFA) produced greater inhibition of respiration in both young and <b>weaned</b> rats compared with either drug alone. In contrast, in <b>weaned</b> hamsters, FFA coapplication offset the inhibitory effect of RIL alone. Increasing respiratory drive with hypercapnia/acidosis ameliorated the respiratory inhibition produced by RIL + FFA in <b>weaned</b> rats but had no effect in young rats. Data from the present study indicate that respiratory rhythmogenesis in young rats is more dependent on excitatory RIL-sensitive and FFA-sensitive mechanisms than older rats and that fundamental differences exist in the respiratory rhythmogenic mechanisms between rats and hamsters. 12 page(s...|$|R
