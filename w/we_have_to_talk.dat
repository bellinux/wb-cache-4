"since the Six-Day War, Israeli {{politicians}} have repeatedly established {{a connection between}} European anti-Semitism {{and the fact that}} the Palestinians don't accept the founding of the State of Israel. But that's absurd! The Palestinians weren't primarily anti-Semitic. They just didn't accept their expulsion. But European anti-Semitism goes much further back than to the partition of Palestine and the establishment of Israel in 1948." [...] In response to a question from the interviewer, he said he conducted Wagner with the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra because, [...] "The musicians wanted it. I said: Sure, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it. It's a tricky decision." [...] When the interviewer asked if the initiative came from Arab musicians in the orchestra, he replied, [...] "On the contrary. It was the Israelis. The Israeli brass players." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lars Ulrich {{reflected}} on the production, saying: “We were at a crossroads. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> been really good at being able to compartmentalize {{a lot of this}} stuff. Suppress it with drinking or other extravagances. This was the first time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other, {{get to know each other}} and work stuff out. The cameras were there catching all of it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{answered}} warily that it {{depended upon}} {{what she meant}} by love, to which she replied that she would explain afterwards when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> leisure <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> adding, ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{just makes}} me feel {{separated}} from society, when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>talking</b> about it. It’s like — am I even human?...I mean, I know I’m not normal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very odd, indeed," [...] {{repeated}} Mr Shirley. [...] "By the way, {{that reminds}} me that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about that farm of which I spoke {{to you on the}} day of your arrival." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the surf}} gets it keeps," [...] he said. [...] "If {{there is a}} secret, I reckon the secret's safe! However, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about {{something}} else. You can get us some native boys?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dorriforth. Produced--partly. A play isn't fully {{produced}} {{until it}} is in a form in which you can refer to it. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> in the air. I can refer to my Congreve, but I can't to my Pinero. {*} ...|$|E
6000|$|We'll to our {{chairs for}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> much <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of, [...] And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Ullad and Muirthemne, and here [...] Is Conall Muirthemne {{in the nick}} of time.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> met <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about," [...] {{returned}} Nehow. [...] "I {{would hear}} what my brothers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say. When they have spoken I will open my mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, indeed. You may imagine his {{surprise}} and joy, when I told him who I was. Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over the best plan of getting him out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may {{be those}} are {{good things for}} us. No! This is just a lark as yet, Marjorie. It's still fresh and full of distractions. The discomforts are amusing. Presently we'll get used to it. Then we'll talk out--what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> out.... I say, wouldn't it keep and improve this goose of ours if we put in a little brandy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He flushed, {{and looked}} both foolish and angry, for {{of course it}} was not very {{difficult}} to see my point. But he was--in a very clumsy manner of his own--trying to cultivate a good conscience, and he was getting no credit for it. [...] "I suppose I may be allowed to look at her! It's a matter <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over. One does n't drop such a friend in half an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{they tell}} me. What should <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about here if {{somebody}} didn't quarrel sometimes? She and I {{ought to get}} up a quarrel {{for the good of}} the public;--only they know that I never can quarrel with anybody. I never see anybody interesting enough to quarrel with." [...] But Mrs. MacHugh said nothing about Miss Stanbury, except that she sent over a message with reference to a rubber of whist for the next night but one.|$|E
60|$|However {{that may}} be, when the lovely {{moonlight}} tempted {{us into the}} garden, there was an end <b>to</b> our jokes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> something <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about which still dwells disagreeably on my mind.|$|R
5000|$|... “Of course sunrise; {{people tend}} to be romantic during sunrise, {{something}} that symbolizes a new day and a new life. However, it’s not about sunrise or sunset but about the environment and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>talking,</b> start acting.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} {{satisfied}} your very natural curiosity {{on the subject}} which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> occasion <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of more than once, but I refrained for your own sake. I knew by sad experience how unsettling and unnerving {{it is to be}} for ever waiting for a catastrophe which you are convinced must befall, and which you can neither avert nor accelerate.|$|R
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Drainage!! She'd tried three {{systems in}} her castle; {{and she was}} going to do away with them all and try another. I didnt know which way to look when she began talking about it: I thought theyd all have got up and gone out of the room. But not a bit of it, if you please. They were all just as bad as she. They all had systems; and each of them swore by her own system. I sat there with my cheeks burning until one of the duchesses, {{thinking}} I looked out of it, I suppose, asked me what system I had. I said I was sure I knew nothing about such things, and hadnt we better change the subject. Then the fat was in the fire, I can tell you. There was a regular terror of a countess with an anaerobic system; and she told me, downright brutally, that I'd better learn something about them before my children died of diphtheria. That was just two months after I'd buried poor little Bobby; and that was the very thing he died of, poor little lamb! I burst out crying: I couldnt help it. It was as good as telling me I'd killed my own child. I had to go away; but before I was out of the door one of the duchesses--quite a young woman--began talking about what sour milk did in her inside and how she expected to live to be over a hundred if she took it regularly. And me listening to her, that had never dared to think that a duchess could have anything so common as an inside! I shouldnt have minded if it had been children's insides: <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about them. But grown-up people! I was glad to get away that time.|$|E
5000|$|Foreign policy chief Javier Solana said [...] "Karadžić's arrest {{would now}} help unblock a key EU-Serbia accord. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the {{prosecutor}} of the international tribunal, but I am almost certain {{he is going to}} say there is full cooperation".|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{was smoking}} a {{cigarette}} {{and he asked me}} for a cigarette. He said to me, 'Freddy, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Barcelona.' I said, 'I think so too.' And then we spoke about it for three hours and we shook hands and everything was over.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{came back}} Detroit, made a trailer, {{and started to}} show it around. We raised the money very quickly -- turned out {{there were other people}} also very {{interested}} in Detroit. PBS came on board, and Ford Foundation, and next thing you knew, we were moving to Detroit. We rented two apartments in downtown Detroit, got two cars, and basically stayed for a year. We didn't know what we were going <b>to</b> do. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> chosen a city to make a movie about -- not a school in a city, or a dude in a city -- so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a city, ask a city questions. It became a very organic, long, many-rabbit-holes, never-stop-casting sort of film. There are certain things we captured just because we were living there. <b>We</b> knew film <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a chorus, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a poem, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a butterfly, going from place to place. You can't just hang a city on one person, or one family, I don't think. So it was a totally different kind of filmmaking -- it felt experimental, kind of artsy, kind of crazy." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> as <b>we</b> walked. We {{could not}} {{break up the}} dialogues for our {{convenience}} as that would slow down the tempo of the shot. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> such a degree of understanding that we enacted the scene with immaculate timing and with the required expressions in one continuous shot. It came out very well and is enjoyed by people even today. - Sivaji Ganesan on his experience while filming with Nagesh, as quoted in the English edition of Autobiography of an Actor: Sivaji Ganesan, October 1928-July 2001. The first film where Sivaji Ganesan and A. P. Nagarajan collaborated was Naan Petra Selvam (1956). The scene where the Tamil poet Nakkeerar confronts Shiva over an error in his poem, effectively exaggerating his sensitivity to right and wrong, {{laid the foundation for}} Thiruvilaiyadal.|$|R
5000|$|Mustafa H. Kuko became imam of the Center in 1998. At that time, {{only about}} 2% of those {{attending}} the Center were American-born; by 2012, about 15% were. In June 2014, Kuko told The Press-Enterprise that the Center <b>has</b> worked hard <b>to</b> prevent {{young people from}} connecting with terrorist propaganda. He said that the press [...] "overlooked what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been doing in our communities for many years... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> our communities. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> our families." ...|$|R
5000|$|When David Attenborough {{began his}} career, in 1950, Earth's human {{population}} was measured at just 2.5 billion people ... in 2012 he said:“We cannot continue {{to deny the}} problem. People have pushed aside the question of population sustainability and not considered {{it because it is}} too awkward, embarrassing and difficult.

5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} Free Theatre's first production, Sarah Kane's 4.48 Psychosis, its founder Nikolai Khalezin observes that Kane's play [...] "'is about a woman's {{psychological}} decay, homosexuality and suicide," [...] and that, while [...] "There's no {{politics in the}} play," [...] in it [...] "there {{is something that is}} threatening to a dictatorship -- open conversation. The dictatorship says: [...] "We have no suicide, no alcoholism, no drug abuse." [...] And we say: <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> if we want to solve problems.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Trump {{said in a}} December 2015 rally, [...] "We have to see Bill Gates {{and a lot of}} {{different}} people that really understand what's happening. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that Internet up in some ways. Somebody will say, 'Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people." [...] In a Republican debate in December 2015, Trump said that the Internet should be shut off to countries that have a majority of their territory controlled by terrorist organizations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I think <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{all better}} {{separate}} and go quietly to bed early. <b>We</b> may <b>have</b> much <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about tomorrow; and tonight I want to think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{been very}} remiss," [...] apologized Nasmyth, when they joined her. [...] "Still, we didn't know, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> some {{business}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I do {{with all}} my heart. What are old women like us to do? We haven't eyes to read at night, even if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> minds fit for it. We can't always be saying our prayers. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about except scandal. It's better than drinking; and we should come to that if we hadn't cards." ...|$|R
5000|$|He also said, that [...] "since the Six-Day War, Israeli {{politicians}} have repeatedly established {{a connection between}} European anti-Semitism {{and the fact that}} the Palestinians don't accept the founding of the State of Israel.

5000|$|Nancy Pelosi (2007-2011): In 2003 Pelosi, {{then the}} Minority Leader under Speaker Hastert, decried the Hastert Rule as a {{partisan}} attempt to marginalize elected {{members of the}} Democratic Party in Congress. In May 2007 Pelosi said, [...] "I'm the Speaker of the House...I {{have to take into}} consideration something broader than the majority of the majority in the Democratic Caucus." [...] She also said at that time, [...] "I would encourage my colleagues not to be proposing resolutions that say 'the majority of the majority does this or that.' <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> it out, see what is possible to get a job done. And as I say, we do that together." [...] Pelosi's former Chief of Staff, George Crawford expanded upon this saying, [...] "On the larger issue of the 'majority of the majority,' she has talked about that for a quite a while. She does want the minority party to engage in the legislative process...That's the kind of Speakership she wants. She violated the majority-of-the-majority rule seven times during her four-year speakership.|$|E
5000|$|In {{discussing}} the 2004 American presidential elections, Wallis said [...] "Jesus didn’t speak {{at all about}} homosexuality. There are about 12 verses in the Bible that touch on that question. Most {{of them are very}} contextual. There are thousands of verses on poverty. I don’t hear a lot of that conversation." [...] Some time between 2008 and 2013, Wallis changed his mind and began to support same-sex marriage. In 2008 he made the following remarks: [...] "I don't think the sacrament of marriage should be changed. Some people say that Jesus didn't talk about homosexuality, and that's technically true. But marriage is all through the Bible, and it's not gender-neutral. I have never done a blessing for a same-sex couple. I've never been asked to do one. I'm not sure that I would." [...] However, in an interview in 2013, Wallis declared his support for same-sex marriage, and said [...] "Marriage needs some strengthening. Let's start with marriage, and then I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, now, how to include same-sex couples in that deeper understanding of marriage." [...] In both statements, Wallis advocated respectful biblical and theological conversations between Christians who disagree on this issue, as well as focusing on other important issues such as poverty.|$|E
6000|$|... "The very hares grow brave. I suppose {{because it}} IS the chief thing in life." [...] He stopped and said earnestly: [...] "It {{is the chief}} thing in life, and {{everything}} else goes down before it. Everything, my dear, everything!... But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> upon indifferent themes until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done with this blond young gentleman from Bavaria...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mistress," [...] said Wilding suddenly, [...] "you {{have not}} yet told me in what you seek my service. Indeed, <b>we</b> seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> little purpose. My time is very short." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`But I {{believe in}} 'em,' {{said the boy}} Jeff, who was seated {{on the other side}} of the table, and looked at us so earnestly that we could scarce help smiling--though we didn't feel in a smiling humour at the time, for it was getting dark, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> in low tones and looking anxiously over our shoulders, you know-- ...|$|R
