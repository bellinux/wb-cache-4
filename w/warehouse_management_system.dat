40|$|This {{book was}} written {{to give the}} reader an {{overview}} over possible <b>warehouse</b> <b>management</b> solutions and help {{him to make the}} right choice. It presents background information, exeamines not only the potential, but also the risks and strategies, and thus sets the basis for comparisons for those who are responsible for the choice and specification of <b>warehouse</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> Modern <b>warehouse</b> and distribution systems constitute highly complex nodes within the value-added supply chain and have to meet a variety of requirements with regard to time, costs and quality. The efficient operation of such systems is a continuous challenge for anyone in charge. Recent developments of advanced computer-based control technologies have contributed to development of the necessary control and <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> called <b>Warehouse</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Systems</b> (WMS). Nevertheless, due to the high complexity, users often find it hard to handle WMS. The design, choice and operation of a WMS requires extensive know-how and experience because of the large variety of solutions and system requirements. This book gives an overview of possible solutions which help readers to make the right choice. It presents the background and potential, but also the risks and strategies to handle them. It sets the basis for comparisons for all those readers who are responsible for the evaluation and specification of <b>warehouse</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore, it is meant as basic support for students and interested beginners. This book is based on practical knowledge without neglecting the basic context or assuming special technical knowledge. Some basic processes and technologies that are required for a better understanding are described in detail. System-developerswill find some new ideas when problems and limits of current developments are discussed. New approaches with regard to the structure and design of WMS are presented. Readers can expect a simple and well-documented explantion of WMS based on the open-source initiative myWMS. The software can be operated on a common PC independent of the platform and without any obligatory user login data. Thus, the operation, function and benefits of a WMS can be visualized...|$|R
