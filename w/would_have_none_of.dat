5|$|Elizabeth {{remained}} {{close to}} Dudley and he, with her blessing {{and on her}} prompting, pursued his suit for her hand {{in an atmosphere of}} diplomatic intrigue. His wife's and his father's shadows haunted his prospects. His efforts leading nowhere, in the spring of 1561 Dudley offered to leave England to seek military adventures abroad; Elizabeth <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> that and everything remained as it was.|$|E
5|$|Always a loner, {{he spent}} hours playing with toy trains, preferring {{to cross the}} street rather than speak to anyone. He {{attended}} Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
6000|$|... "Joanna Van Voorden!" [...] Albert exclaimed, indignantly, while Edgar {{burst into}} laughter; [...] "why, she is well-nigh {{as big as}} her mother already, and {{promises}} to be far bigger.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E
25|$|A UN {{plebiscite}} voted 46 to 10 to have Eritrea be federated with Ethiopia, {{which was}} later stipulated on 2 December 1950 in resolution 390 (V). Eritrea would {{have its own}} parliament and administration and would be represented in {{what had been the}} Ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament. Haile Selassie <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> European attempts to draft a separate Constitution under which Eritrea would be governed, and wanted his own 1955 Constitution protecting families to apply in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 1961 the 30-year Eritrean Struggle for Independence began, followed by Haile Selassie's dissolution of the federation and shutting down of Eritrea's parliament.|$|E

6000|$|The {{young man}} {{walked up the}} avenue of marble to the palace, {{surrounded}} by the armed attendants in their dresses of jewels and gold, and preceded by dancing-girls as beautiful as houris, who danced and sung before him. He was dizzy with joy. [...] "All--all this," [...] he exulted, [...] "belongs to me. And {{to think that if}} I had listened to the Talisman of Solomon I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
25|$|Sacken <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it. Against {{the advice}} of his own staff who urged him to move closer to Yorck, the Russian {{commander}} deployed his army corps with its main weight to the south. Strictly following his orders, Sacken determined to smash his way east through Montmirail. At the start of the battle Napoleon was significantly outnumbered and could only defend with 5,000 Old Guard infantry, 4,500 cavalry, Ricard's division and 36 guns. Because of the bad condition of the roads and the exhaustion of the soldiers, it was not clear whether French reinforcements or Yorck's Prussians would first arrive on the field. Napoleon was taking a huge risk.|$|E
25|$|The English {{saw that}} if the revolt prospered it would inevitably attract disaffected {{supporters}} of the deposed King Richard, rumours of whose survival were widely circulating. They {{were concerned about the}} potential for disaffection in Cheshire and were increasingly worried about the news from North Wales. Hotspur complained that he was not receiving sufficient support from the King and that the repressive policy of Henry was only encouraging revolt. He argued that negotiation and compromise could persuade Owain to end his revolt. In fact, as early as 1401, Hotspur may have been in secret negotiations with Owain and other leaders of the revolt to attempt to negotiate a settlement. The core Lancastrian supporters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> this. They struck back with anti-Welsh legislation designed to establish English dominance in Wales. The laws included prohibiting any Welshman from buying land in England, from holding any senior public office in Wales, from bearing arms, from holding any castle or defending any house, no Welsh child was to be educated or apprenticed to any trade, no Englishman could be convicted in any suit brought by a Welshman, Welshmen were to be severely penalised when marrying an Englishwoman, any Englishman marrying a Welshwoman was disenfranchised and all public assembly was forbidden. These laws sent a message to any of those who were wavering that the English viewed all the Welsh with equal suspicion. Many Welshmen who had tried to further their careers in English service now felt pushed into the rebellion as the middle ground between Owain and Henry disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Baxter <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it; {{he wanted}} a [...] "real reactor, not a {{low-power}} toy". He prevailed; the government authorised a High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR). Based on the DIDO reactor at Harwell, HIFAR was cooled and moderated by heavy water, and fuelled with enriched uranium. Construction began at Lucas Heights in October 1955, and HIFAR went critical on 26 January 1958. By the time he became full-time chairman in 1969, the AAEC had grown to an organisation {{with a staff of}} over 1,000 and a budget of $8.5 million. The AAEC explored the country looking for uranium deposits, developed technology for uranium enrichment, and produced designs for nuclear reactors.|$|E

[...] "Another {{quarter of an hour}} and they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to begin the battle afresh, for there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>none</b> <b>of</b> our fellows left. Hurrah! hurrah!" [...] he cried, as, with a {{tremendous}} volley and a ringing shout, the French fell upon the flank of the Russians.|$|R

"If the Incas {{had been}} {{contented}} with this glorious plateau, which for centuries constituted their kingdom, and had {{passed a law}} against the gathering of gold and the mining for silver, they might still have been lords here," [...] Harry said one day. [...] "There <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been nothing to tempt the avarice of the Spaniards, for owing to {{the distance of the}} mines from the coast, the cost of carriage <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been immense, and the long sea journey <b>would</b> <b>have</b> rendered the exportation of the natural products of the country impossible. Some of the more sober-minded of the Dons might have settled down here and taken wives from among the daughters of the nobles, and, bringing with them the civilization of Spain, become valuable colonists. The Incas, before they extended their conquest over the whole of the west of South America, must have been a comparatively simple people, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the habits of luxury and magnificence that tempted the Spaniards. The gold of South America was the ruin of the Incas, as it was afterwards the chief cause of the ruin of Spain." ...|$|R
500|$|Prior to the Dreamcast's release, Sega {{was dealt}} a blow when EA—the largest {{third-party}} video game publisher—announced {{it would not}} develop games for the system. EA executive Bing Gordon claimed [...] " [...] couldn't afford to give us [...] {{the same kind of}} license that EA has had over the last five years", but Stolar recounted that EA president Larry Probst wanted [...] "exclusive rights to be the only sports brand on Dreamcast", which Stolar could not accept due to Sega's recent $10 million purchase of sports game developer Visual Concepts. While the Dreamcast <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> EA's popular sports games, [...] "Sega Sports" [...] titles developed mainly by Visual Concepts helped to fill that void.|$|E
500|$|While Madero {{was ready}} to {{negotiate}} with Díaz and hold off from attacking, Villa and Orozco <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it. On May 8 the two generals launched {{an assault on the}} city without consulting Madero and blamed it on a [...] "spontaneous" [...] outbreak in fighting. The incident that served as an excuse for the offensive occurred when a federal officer insulted a female rebel on a bridge between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. Madero attempted to halt the violence but Orozco and Villa pressed on. Both of them {{went to great lengths to}} avoid Madero so they wouldn't have to disobey a direct order. Even when Villa was eventually confronted by Castulo Herrera with explicit instructions to stop fighting, he simply ignored him. Likewise, when Madero finally managed to see Orozco in person, he was simply told that the battle was already raging and it was too late to stop it.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{had been}} {{expected}} to adhere to Whig Party policies and to defer to party congressional leaders, particularly Clay. When Tyler succeeded him, he initially concurred with the new Whig Congress, signing into law the preemption bill granting [...] "squatters' sovereignty" [...] to settlers on public land, a Distribution Act (discussed below), a new bankruptcy law, and {{the repeal of the}} Independent Treasury. But {{when it came to the}} great banking question, Tyler was soon at odds with the Congressional Whigs, and twice vetoed Clay's legislation for a national banking act. Although the second bill was originally tailored to meet his objections in the first veto, its final version did not. This practice, designed to protect Clay from having a successful incumbent president as a rival for the Whig nomination in 1844, became known as [...] "heading Captain Tyler", a term coined by Whig Representative John Minor Botts of Virginia. Tyler proposed an alternative fiscal plan known as the [...] "Exchequer", but Clay's friends who controlled the Congress <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E

500|$|Devers {{conceded that}} he would {{only be able to}} supply Patton with [...] per day from 15 November, which only {{increased}} Eisenhower's resolve to give priority to opening the port of Antwerp in the north. Devers was ordered to clear the Germans from {{the west bank of the}} Rhine in his sector. His offensive went well; the French 1st Armored Division reached the Rhine on 19 November, and Leclerc captured Strasbourg on 23 November. Devers inflicted a crushing defeat on General Friedrich Wiese's Nineteenth Army, nearly destroying six of its eight divisions. A large German presence remained west of the Rhine, which came to be called the Colmar Pocket. When Eisenhower and Bradley visited 6th Army Group on 24 November, they were astonished to find Devers, Patch and Haislip energetically planning a crossing of the Rhine in early December. Bradley drew attention to the formidable defenses on the far bank, and Devers told him that he had spoken to patrols that had found them empty. Eisenhower <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it. His strategy remained to destroy the German forces on the west bank before attempting a crossing. The official historians described this decision as [...] "difficult to understand".|$|E
500|$|Cleveland's term {{as mayor}} was spent {{fighting}} the entrenched {{interests of the}} party machines. Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the Common Council. The street-cleaning contract was open for bids, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest of $100,000 less, because of the political connections of the bidder. While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it. His veto message said, [...] "I regard it as {{the culmination of a}} most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money." [...] The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder. Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted. For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland's reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond Erie County.|$|E
500|$|Brunner was {{disappointed}} at {{the condition of}} the land {{along the banks of the}} Buller River as it neared the coast. [...] He had briefly scouted the area on his previous journey and believed it had potential for pastoral farming. He now found it too damp and mossy to be cultivated. The party reached the mouth of the Buller on 1 June and made their way to the pā that Brunner and Heaphy had stayed at on their last journey but on arrival, found that it had been abandoned. They continued on down to the Arahura River and reached the Taramakau Pā where they stayed for three months over the worst of the winter months. On 12 October, Brunner continued south with some local Māori. He went as far south as Tititira Head, near Paringa where in December he severely sprained his ankle. After recovering, he decided to make his way back to Taramakau Pā. From here he along with his companions, journeyed up the Arahura River and in late January 1848, discovered the coalfield and lake which now bears his name. He wanted to continue on this route to Canterbury but Kehu and Pitewate <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it. The party began to make their way back to Nelson.|$|E
40|$|My work {{is concern}} about ancient Egyptian temple and its development, symbolism, offerings and priesthood. The main {{idea of this}} work is that Egyptian temple functioned in both statial and {{temporal}} dimensions. Spatially, that the temple stood at a crucial point- the focal point or fulcrum between different worlds or spheres- between heaven and earth, human and di vine, chaos and order. For the Egyptians most of these concepts were spatially related, just as the desert signified chaos and the fertile land of Egypt harmony and order. The temple' s location, design, decoration and functions all mediated between these polarities and established harmony, security and balance where there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these things in its absence...|$|R

500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version.

While nobody knew the whereabouts of Rommel (he had advanced so quickly that he was out of range for radio contact, earning his 7th Panzer Division the nickname Gespenster-Division, [...] "Ghost Division"), an enraged von Kleist flew to Guderian on the morning of the 17 and after a heated argument relieved him of all duties.

40|$|Although proponents have {{recently}} been attempting to strengthen droit de suite, or artists 2 ̆ 7 resale royalty rights, throughout the world, all laws based on the right are flawed — {{so much so that}} further implementation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> almost <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the positive effects that its sponsors hope for. This is to say that droit de suite, which is meant to protect young artists, actually discourages the creation of art by young artists, and reduces the amount of money an artist can make from a sale. Furthermore, droit de suite conflicts with basic common law notions of copyright and property and is incompatible with standard theories of intellectual property law. This paper discusses how droit de suite works in practice, providing a detailed analysis of its failures and an explanation of why attempts to further promulgate the right in common law nations should be quashed...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{prevailing}} discussion between neoclassical economics and the institutionalists, {{which was one}} of the conflicts that prevailed within the field of economics in the 1920s and early 1930s, Parsons attempted to walk a very fine line. He was very critical about neoclassical theory, an attitude that prevailed all the way through his life and is reflected in his critique of Milton Friedman and Gary Becker. He was opposed to the utilitarian bias within the neoclassical approach and do could not embrace them fully. However, he agreed partly on their theoretical and methodological style of approach, which should be discriminated from its substance. He was thus unable to accept the institutionalist solution. In an interview in 1975, Parsons would recall a conversation with Schumpeter on the institutionalist methodological position: [...] "An economist like Schumpeter, by contrast, <b>would</b> absolutely <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> that. I remember talking to him about the problem and [...]. I think Schumpeter was right. If economics had gone that way the institutionalists it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to become a primarily empirical discipline, largely descriptive, and without theoretical focus. That's the way the 'institutionalists' went, and of course Mitchell was affiliated with that movement." ...|$|R
