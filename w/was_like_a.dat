5|$|Caudillos like Facundo Quiroga are seen, at the {{beginning}} of the book, as the antithesis of education, high culture, and civil stability; barbarism <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> never ending litany of social ills. They are the agents of instability and chaos, destroying societies through their blatant disregard for humanity and social progress.|$|E
5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> page torn from some story book... One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E

5|$|Mieza <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{boarding}} school for Alexander {{and the children}} of Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The teaser {{poster of}} Kaminey was {{received}} positively by critics. The trailer, which introduces four characters; one lisping, one stuttering, a woman yelling about having raped {{a man and}} one jeering at the lisper, received positive reviews. Critics kept their expectations high due to Bhardwaj's previous films, and said the trailer <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> comic book which introduces the characters of Kapoor and Chopra differently. The theatrical trailers and the music generated interest for the film. The film's marketing also involved public appearances by Chopra and Kapoor.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E

5|$|She and Charles had six {{children}} together. Before {{her first child}} Charles's birth, Lucinda had a premonition that her son would not live very long. She told her mother that the dress she sewed for him <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> funeral shroud, and after baby Charles's death at age two, she buried him in it. Lucinda's second child, a daughter named Rosette, also died in infancy. Dalton often references these lost child infants in her poetry. Her third child, Clifford, was born on February 18, 1875. Charles was a joint owner of a store in Beaver and also hauled freight to surrounding areas. However, his income was not sufficient to support his four wives and many children.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

25|$|A {{large group}} of people fled or were chased into the car park of Rossville Flats. This area <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> courtyard, {{surrounded}} on three sides by high-rise flats.

Well, because it can't <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lion's mane without too much trouble,--and {{inconvenience}} after that, and poor success, after all. Too much trouble, in cutting the die into fine fringes and jags; inconvenience after that,--because, though you can easily stamp cheeks and foreheads smooth at a blow, you can't stamp projecting tresses fine at a blow, whatever pains you take with your die.|$|R

25|$|As the 1860s progressed, Rossetti {{would become}} the grand prince of bohemianism as his {{deviations}} from normal standards became more audacious.
