50|$|Engineered by BMR of Halifax, {{the casino}} has been {{described}} {{as one of the most}} complicated in the company's history. The size of the site meant that part of the building was built over water 70 feet deep (at its deepest point). Most of the land that the casino occupies had been created years earlier when that part of Halifax Harbour was infilled with loose rock and excavation material from other construction sites — reclaimed land was too soft to serve as a stable building foundation. BMR overcame the problem by engineering a design which incorporated driving caissons through the fill material and into the bedrock below. Then, using a specially designed doughnut-shaped pile cap as a support system, the engineers worked with the form <b>work</b> <b>contractor</b> to hang the casino’s floor structure on the supporting caissons like a huge wharf.|$|E
40|$|Ground {{work like}} blasting, piling and {{excavation}} {{has always had}} a great influence during the planning phase of a construction project since it can cause damages on adjacent buildings and have severe economic consequences. This thesis deals with how vibrations caused by ground work influence near-by buildings and what methods geotechnicians and construction entrepreneurs use to handle these risks. The purpose of this thesis is to explain risk management in relation to ground work. In order to achieve this I have used a qualitative method by interviewing a geotechnician and a ground <b>work</b> <b>contractor</b> who possess knowledge and experience useful to this thesis. The result shows that vibrations from ground work spread through the ground as seismic waves that cause displacements and packing in the ground visible in adjacent buildings as cracks and subsidence damages. Geotechnicians study ground work vibrations by means of ground investigations and experience from previous projects in order to produce a risk analysis that entrepreneurs can use to reduce damages. If entrepreneurs use experienced consultants {{to a greater extent than}} presently, substantial economic savings are possible.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} how {{the subject matter of}} performance under a contract for work is defined and issues related to formulating the rights and obligations ensuing therefrom. At the same time, it seeks common legal sources existing across national laws which provide definitions thereof. It attempts to find a common definition of contracts for work and how they differ from other similar contracts. It further defines some common basic features and problems related to contracts for work which apply in international trade or in cases where parties decide to formulate their contract by reference to international contract conditions. In that context, it primarily refers to construction contracts as {{the most common type of}} contract for work in international trade. At the same time, it focuses on the possible consequences of a breach of contract and emphasizes some parties' claims ensuing therefrom. Moreover, this work examines the definition of work defects and conditions for asserting claims as a specific topic, which relates to the definition of the subject matter of a contract for work and its basic features.

40|$|Construction {{estimates}} {{are an important}} part of the construction industry. Both owners and contractors require accurate estimates. Owners of both public and private institutional campuses require accurate estimates to plan resources and efficiently allocate funds. Contractors require accurate estimates to win projects and generate profits. Markup is a factor that estimators apply to certain items, systems, or to the total cost of a bid to cover overhead, profit, and other indirect costs. To understand why contractors markup prices, a two-part questionnaire was established to first explore the price difference on renovation projects and then explore the factors that affect construction markup. A comparison was sought between two location, one a public institutional campus and the other a private institutional campus. This research identifies the benefits of how this pricing and the established factors can help owners, contractors, and consultants alike. Similarly, the research looks at the barriers of the study and how the study can be improved and implemented by others. The results found in this research established two new factors and ranked 19 factors that affect markup. The top five factors established from this research affecting markup on the public institutional campus is: profitability, risk, subcontractor market conditions, market conditions, and need for work. The top five factors established from this research affecting markup on the private institutional campus is: profitability, market conditions, need for <b>work,</b> <b>contractor</b> markup, and complexity of project...|$|E
