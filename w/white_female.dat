40|$|This {{discussion}} {{focuses on}} the degree of occupational differentiation when <b>white</b> <b>females</b> are compared with white males and nonwhite females. The index of dissimilarity provides a measure of occupational differentiation applied to data from 66 SMSAs for 1960. The results show major variations among SMSAs in the degree of occupational differentiation. Differences between <b>white</b> <b>females</b> and nonwhite females (presumably reflecting racial discrimination) and differences between <b>white</b> <b>females</b> and <b>white</b> males (presumably reflecting sexual discrimination) show roughly the same maximum and minimum values but are only loosely correlated. It is speculated that physiological factors will be more important in reducing the degree of occupational differentiation in the latter case than in the former. In all societies, members of different age, sex, and racial groups tend to end up doing differ-ent kinds of work. Occupational composition is dissimilar for males and females just as it is for whites and blacks, and for the young, middle-aged, and elderly. This paper examines some concrete data regarding the extent to which <b>white</b> <b>females</b> in Standard Metropolitan Statis-tical Areas (SMSAs) in the United States in 1960 differed in occupational composition from <b>white</b> males, nonwhite <b>females,</b> and nonwhite males.

25|$|In 1944, George Stinney, a 14-year-old black youth, {{was accused}} of murdering two girls, aged 11 and 8, near Alcolu at Clarendon County. Alcolu was a small working-class mill town, where residences of whites and blacks were {{separated}} by railroad tracks. Stinney was interrogated by police in a locked room with several white officers and no other witnesses, and it was claimed that he had confessed to the killing within an hour. Stinney's father was fired from his job at local lumber mill, {{and his family had}} to either leave the city or risk getting lynched. Given the two <b>white</b> <b>female</b> victims, and an all-white male jury, Stinney was rapidly convicted. Stinney's court-appointed attorney Charles Plowden was a tax commissioner with political aspirations, and scholars have considered him ineffective. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed at South Carolina State Penitentiary in Columbia. Seventy years later, historians question whether he was guilty and doubt that he received a fair trial. On December 17, 2014, Stinney's conviction was vacated on the grounds that his constitutional rights had been violated, and his confession had most likely been coerced.|$|E

Most of the Tiny Toons characters were designed to resemble younger versions of Warner Bros.' most popular Looney Tunes animal characters by exhibiting similar traits and looks. The two main characters are both rabbits: Buster Bunny, a blue male rabbit, and Babs Bunny, a pink female rabbit not related to Buster, Plucky Duck, a green male duck, Hamton J. Pig, a pink male pig. Other major characters in the cast are generally nonhuman as well. These include Fifi La Fume, a purple-and-white female skunk; Shirley the Loon, a <b>white</b> <b>female</b> loon; Dizzy Devil, a purple tasmanian devil; Furrball, a blue cat; Sweetie Pie, a pink canary; Calamity Coyote, a bluish-gray coyote; Little Beeper, a red-orange roadrunner; and Gogo Dodo, a zany green dodo. Two human characters, Montana Max and Elmyra Duff, are regarded as the main villains of the series and also are students of Acme Looniversity. As villains, Elmyra is seen as an extreme pet lover while Montana Max is a spoiled rich brat who either owns lots of toys or polluting factories. Supporting characters included Li'l Sneezer, a gray mouse with powerful sneezes; Concord Condor, a purple condor; Byron Basset, a usually sleeping basset hound; Bookworm, a green worm with glasses; Arnold the Pit Bull, a muscular white pit bull; Fowlmouth, a white rooster with horrid language; Barky Marky, a brown dog, and Mary Melody, a young African American human girl.|$|E

The results from this study identify some of the changes that will require immediate attention from health care providers. Results revealed that regardless of ethnicity, age, education, and language preference, non-Hispanic <b>White</b> <b>females</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} participate in preventive screening practices than were Mexican American females.
