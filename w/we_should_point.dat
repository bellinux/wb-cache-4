It is true, assuredly, that all the three races above named could be connected with Browning's personality. If we believed, for instance, that he really came of a race of mediæval barons, we should say at once that from them he got his pre-eminent spirit of battle: we should be right, for every line in his stubborn soul and his erect body did really express the fighter; he was always contending, whether it was with a German theory about the Gnostics, or with a stranger who elbowed his wife in a crowd.

6000|$|Much {{attention}} has been excited {{this year by the}} alleged fulfilment of a prophecy that the Papal power was to receive its death-blow--in temporal matters, at least--during the past year 1848. For ourselves, we have no more faith in Mr. Fleming, the obsolete author, who has so suddenly revived in the public esteem, than we have in many other interpreters of prophecy. Their shallow and bigoted views of past history are enough to damp our faith in their discernment of the future. It does seem that people ought to understand what has been, before they predict what will be. History is [...] "the track of God's footsteps through time;" [...] it is in His dealings with our forefathers that we may expect to find the laws by which He will deal with us. Not that Mr. Fleming's conjecture must be false; among a thousand guesses there ought surely to be one right one. And it is almost impossible for earnest men to bend their whole minds, however clumsily, to one branch of study without arriving at some truth or other. The interpreters of prophecy therefore, like all other interpreters, have our best wishes, though not our sanguine hopes. But, in the meantime, there are surely signs of the approaching ruin of Popery, more certain than any speculations on the mystic numbers of the Revelation. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> to recent books--not to books which merely expose Rome, that has been done long ago, usque ad nauseam--but to books which do her justice: to Mr. Maitland's [...] "Dark Ages;" [...] Lord Lindsay's [...] "Christian Art;" [...] and last, but not least, to the very charming work of Mrs. Jameson, whose title heads this review. In them, and in a host of similar works in Germany, which Dr. Wiseman's party hail as signs of coming triumph, we fancy we see the death-warrant of Romanism; because they prove that Rome has nearly done her work--that the Protestants are learning the lesson for the sake of which Providence has so long borne with that monstrous system. When Popery has no more truth to teach us, but not till then, will it vanish away into its native night.|$|E

5000|$|Sign {{language}} was first documented in ancient Greece. In one of Plato's dialogues he {{describes how the}} deaf used gestures to mimic moving objects through similar motions. Plato quotes his teacher Socrates in the Cratylus as follows: [...] "if we had neither voice nor tongue, and yet wished to manifest things to one another, should we not, like those which are at present mute, endeavor to signify our meaning by the hands, head, {{and other parts of}} the body?....I think, therefore that if we wished to signify that which is upwards and light, we should raise our hands towards the heaven, imitating the nature of the thing itself; but that if we wished to indicate things downwards and heavy, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> with our hands to the earth..." [...] Unlike ancient Egypt, the Greeks felt it was better to kill anyone with a disability. The deaf were especially considered a burden in Athens, where it was believed that anyone who would be a [...] "burden to society" [...] should be put to death. The city of Athens felt that ending the lives of those impaired was in the best interests of the state. This was because war and conflict occurred continuously and certain abilities were considered important to have. Everyone was meant to serve the state. Philosopher Aristotle along with Greek physician Galen concluded that the deaf could never speak, believing that the ability to speak and hear were linked; being derived from the same area in the brain. Galen, feeling that if one capability was impaired the other would be impaired also, was considered to be correct. Additionally Aristotle's views, which were similarly related to Galen's, were also viewed as accurate and this idea went unchallenged until the sixteenth century A.D.|$|E

40|$|Star {{networks}} were proposed recently as an attractive {{alternative to the}} well-known hypercube models for interconnection networks. Extensive research has been performed that shows that star networks are as versatile as hypercubes. This paper is an effort in the same direction. Based on the well-known paradigms, we study the one-to-many parallel routing problem on star networks and develop an improved routing algorithm that finds n, 1 node-disjoint paths between one node {{and a set of}} other n, 1 nodes in the n-star network. These parallel paths are proven of minimum length within a small additive constant, and our algorithm has an optimal time complexity. This result significantly improves the previous known algorithms for the problem. Moreover, the algorithm well illustrates an application of the orthogonal partition of star networks, which was observed by the original inventors of the star networks but seems generally overlooked in the subsequent study. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>point</b> out that similar problems are already studied for hypercubes and have proven useful in designing efficient and fault tolerant routing algorithms on hypercube networks. 1...|$|R

30|$|In {{this section}} we will reflect further on the deeper {{roots of the}} {{difficulty}} of “responsible” innovation in the biofuels field. Besides the widely recognized uncertainty of innovation processes in general and the limited predictability of their effects, <b>we</b> think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> also <b>point</b> to the terrestrial reach of biofuel innovations, which are played out, so to say, in the global theatre of an economically and ecologically interconnected world. We will build on an article written by the American bioethicist Paul Thompson to elaborate on the economic aspect of this interconnected world and on an article by the Danish sociologist Janus Hansen to elaborate on the ecological aspect. These two aspects will then have to be combined. Proponents of biofuels generally hold that the dilemma of “food versus fuel” which still afflicts the first generation of biofuels will be overcome when the progress of technology allows us to switch to the more advanced second en third generations in the near and foreseeable future. Even the more comprehensive “food-energy-environment trilemma” will then likely be overcome thanks to gains in efficiency. Both Thompson and Hansen, however, offer arguments to the effect that the expected technological progress is actually unable to resolve the underlying ethical dilemmas.|$|R
40|$|In this poster, {{we present}} a novel {{statistical}} rule discovery for understanding behaviours of swarm robots. Swarm robots [Parker 08] are autonomous agents each of whom interacts with their environment locally based on a relatively simple program but as a system they exhibit complex collective behaviours. It {{has been shown that}} learning a model of the control program of a robot helps the designer to better understand the program, especially when the program is highly complex [Fox 06]. One of the essentials of statistical rule discovery is its ability to focus on the interesting aspects of the given data, which seems to fit the nature of the control programs of swarm robots. <b>We</b> <b>should,</b> however, <b>point</b> out that traditional statistical rule discovery which extracts a set of rules from data has several limitations for this new application. Firstly, it allows different discovered rules to cover an identical example, which makes it difficult for the designer to understand the controller.

Thirdly, it is typically evaluated based on a single trial, which prohibits us to discuss its robustness against misunderstanding and noise quantitatively.
