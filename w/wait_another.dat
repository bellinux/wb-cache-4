5|$|The play, set in Verona, Italy, {{begins with}} a street brawl between Montague and Capulet {{servants}} who, like their masters, are sworn enemies. Prince Escalus of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death. Later, Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet, but Capulet asks Paris to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball. Lady Capulet and Juliet's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris's courtship.|$|E
5|$|Michael Mann was {{contracted}} to direct James Dean in September 1993, and filming {{was scheduled to}} start in May 1994. Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt were under serious consideration for the lead role, while both actors were also attached to the part. Mann approached Leonardo DiCaprio {{for the role of}} James Dean, feeling that DiCaprio was the best candidate. Gary Oldman was also discussed for a supporting role. In March 1994, Mann decided not to direct James Dean due to scheduling conflicts with Heat (1995). Mann also thought that DiCaprio was too young and wanted to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> year.|$|E
5|$|Chicago's win {{clinched}} the team's 15th postseason berth in franchise history, their first in 9 years since losing in the 1989 National League Championship Series. The Cubs' {{presence in the}} postseason, playing for {{a spot in the}} World Series, led several sportswriters to reference the Curse of the Billy Goat and the difficulties the Cubs' had faced since 1945. The Billy Goat story suggests that Billy Sianis cursed the Cubs after he and his goat were asked to leave game four of the 1945 World Series. The playoff berth matched the Cubs with the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS, where the Cubs were swept 3 games to 0. The Cubs would have to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> 18 years to win the National League pennant and World Series in 2016, their first NL pennant since 1945, and their first title since 1908.|$|E

5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> month before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit {{had to be taken}} out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing the replacement of the bearings on all units within days.|$|E
5|$|Boulding {{started the}} first game of his second season with Bradford City, which ended with City losing 5–0 to Notts County, but he soon lost his place to new signings Gareth Evans and James Hanson and so had to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> seven weeks for his second start which came against Northampton Town because Evans was suspended. He scored his first goal of the season in the game to give City a 2–0 lead, but his side conceded twice for the game to finish in a 2–2 draw. He scored in the club's {{following}} two games, but was then kept out of the side for two weeks by a virus. Upon his return, he scored his 100thcareer goal and his fourth goal in five games as a late consolation in an FA Cup defeat to Notts County. However, Boulding continued to struggle to maintain a first-team place and was released early from his contract in March 2010, along with his brother under mutual consent, after failing to make a single start under new manager Peter Taylor. He had played 71 games at City, although nearly one-third were as substitute, and scored 19 goals.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved to}} Cardiff City in August 1924, where his friend George Latham {{was working on}} the {{training}} staff. Signed as cover Joe Clennell, Beadles was forced to wait until 27 September 1924 to make his debut for the club, covering for the injured Clennell in a 1–1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. He was forced to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> month to make his second appearance for the club, playing in place of Jimmy Gill during a 2–1 victory over Everton on 18 October 1924. With Gill injured, Beadles was handed a run of games in the first-team and responded by scoring five goals in four matches during November 1924, including a brace during a 4–1 victory over Bury. His prolific form saw Clennell unable to regain his place in the side as Beadles scored four more goals for the club in December, including scoring in consecutive matches against West Ham United on Christmas Day and Boxing Day 1924. However, he was unable to maintain his form and a goal drought, failing to score in ten matches in January and early February 1925, led to manager Fred Stewart dropping Beadles from the side. He appeared sporadically for the side during the remainder of the 1924–25 season, eventually breaking his goal drought during a second 2–1 victory over Everton, as Stewart offered chances to other players, including Clennell, Alfie Hagan and Paddy McIlvenny.|$|E

5|$|No {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Adams or its glaciers existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams {{to be the source}} of some of the Columbia River basalt flows. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous caldera that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the anticline ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley. Modern geology has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the Mazamas in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896. Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted geologist/glaciologist Harry Fielding Reid to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers, Pinnacle, Adams, Lava, Lyman, and Rusk with suggestions from Rusk. He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte. Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the Little Ice Age. The geologic history of Adams would have to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> 80 years before it was fully explored.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this, Morris started {{the new season}} consistently, scoring four fifties in his first five innings, {{including}} 55 and 39 in his state's victory over the touring South Africans ahead of the Tests. The on-field action against the South Africans brought no immediate upturn in Morris' Test fortunes. He made only one half-century {{and a total of}} 149 runs in the first three Tests as Australia took the series lead 2–1. In the Second Test, he had progressed to 42 when he drove Hugh Tayfield into a close fielder. The ball ballooned to mid-off and Tayfield ran back and dived parallel to the ball's trajectory and caught it. By the standards of the era, the catch was regarded as miraculous. He ended the series strongly, with 77 in the second innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, before making his best performances of 99 and 44 in Melbourne in the Fifth Test, which Australia lost by six wickets. Morris' 99 occurred when he was involved in a mix-up while batting with debutant Ian Craig, Australia's youngest ever Test cricketer. Morris decided to sacrifice his wicket for Craig's in a run out. His action meant that he had not scored a Test century for two years, and would have to <b>wait</b> <b>another</b> two years to reach the milestone again. Morris was widely praised for his unselfishness and his sacrifice for his new teammate. He ended the series with 370 runs at 41.11 and took his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide, that of John Watkins. The series ended 2–2, the first Test series in Morris' career that Australia had not won. Morris ended the season with 105 in a warm-up match before the tour of England and totalled 913 runs at 45.65 for the summer.|$|E
