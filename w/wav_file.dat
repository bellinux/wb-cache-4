25|$|Also {{under the}} Piapro brand is Crypton's Piapro Studio, a Vocaloid vocal editor {{implemented}} as a VST/AU plugin bundled {{with all of}} their full V3 Vocaloid products (Miku V3, Miku V3 English, Miku V3 Bundle, Meiko V3, Kaito V3). This allows for full vocal editing functionality nearly identical in feature support to Yamaha's full Vocaloid 3 Editor software, which is available as either a standalone application or a plugin for Cubase. All Vocaloid 3 voice libraries include the Tiny Vocaloid 3 Editor for free, however this is quite severely limited in functionality compared to the full V3 editor, being limited to just 17 bars of output, along with some other limitations - serving mainly as a beginner's taste of Vocaloid editing or a way to easily test out a new vocal library. Piapro Studio was created to allow owners of Crypton's V3 products to have a fully featured vocal editor with a modernized and streamlined interface bundled free of charge. It also allows for the loading of 3rd-party, non-Crypton Vocaloid 3 voicebanks - as well as V2's that have been imported into the full V3 editor beforehand. Being a VST plugin, it allows the user to operate entirely within their DAW of choice, {{in contrast to the}} tiny or full V3 editors which are standalone applications and the user must export a wav to import into their DAW each time a change or update is needed - or export an updated <b>wav</b> <b>file</b> from their DAW as the background music to import into the V3 editor. This integration of the vocal editing within the DAW as a VST instrument plugin allows for convenient editing and a smoother workflow. Currently Piapro Studio is lacking some features of the full V3 editor, but most of these are not needed to work with the vocal composition and tuning of the Vocaloid, instead currently some convenience and expansion features such as WAV import and Vocaloid 3's Job Plugins (a scripting system), are absent from Piapro Studio. Crypton has however has mentioned they would like to implement something similar to Job Plugins {{at some point in the}} future. Piapro Studio is also regularly updated every few months with new features and bug fixes. Vocaloid 3 Editor updates appear much less frequently, generally only around the time of release of a new Vocaloid. Piapro Studio also features some Piapro social designed singer icons and vocal preview samples, added in an update in the Summer of 2014.|$|E

500|$|With [...] "Flicker", one of Porter Robinson's {{favorite}} songs of his debut studio album Worlds (2014), {{he wanted to}} experiment with samples of soul music, which he became a fan of ever since he listened to his favorite album, Daft Punk's second studio record Discovery (2001). The result was a hip-hop-style instrumental that he felt was [...] "incomplete" [...] with only drums and the phased samples. He didn't initially plan [...] "Flicker" [...] to be a track on Worlds until some time later when he was using a translation website to translate [...] "song titles that would never be seen" [...] incorrectly into Japanese, and then put the Japanese text into a text-to-speech program {{for it to be}} converted into a <b>WAV</b> <b>file</b> for him to [...] "cut it into a rap" [...] which he called a [...] "charming little thing".

50|$|Uncompressed <b>WAV</b> <b>files</b> are large, so <b>file</b> {{sharing of}} <b>WAV</b> <b>files</b> over the Internet is uncommon. However, it is a {{commonly}} used file type, suitable for retaining first generation archived files of high quality, {{for use on}} a system where disk space is not a constraint, or in applications such as audio editing, where the time involved in compressing and uncompressing data is a concern.|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{official}} standard for how audio files on a compressed audio optical CD are stored on discs. As such, the format expected by different players varies. This sometimes leads to incompatibilities and difficulty in playing discs, often because of filename length limits, sub-directory limits, number of files limits, and special character bugs. Sometimes, pressed CDs containing MP3s can be used, since some CD-ROM video games {{can act as}} an [...] "MP3 CD" [...] for some users. Some older classic CD-ROM games tend to use <b>WAV</b> <b>files</b> since <b>WAV</b> <b>files</b> were the biggest audio format throughout the 90s, in which <b>WAV</b> <b>files</b> on optical discs are also compatible with CD players which have Yellow Book CD-ROM support.|$|R
