25|$|In {{the debates}} {{on the need}} for an {{increased}} effort to rearm British forces, Amery tended to focus on army affairs, with Churchill speaking more about air defence and Roger Keyes talking about naval affairs. Austen Chamberlain was, until his death, a member of the group as well. While there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Churchill was the most prominent and effective, Amery's work was still significant. He was a driving force behind the creation of the Army League, a pressure group designed to keep the needs of the British Army before the public.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the engines were different from one another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E
500|$|In Part II, {{she accused}} her colleagues of redefining {{predisposition}} {{so that it}} had to include an awareness that the action to be undertaken was illegal, {{despite the fact that the}} CPA did not include specific intent to receive child pornography as an element of the crime. [...] "The elements of predisposition," [...] she said, [...] "should track the elements of the crime". The Bare Boys purchases were not, she argued, as dispositive of that as the majority claimed. Her last sentences responded to White's, saying that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the jury had been properly instructed on entrapment law and thus, their decision that Jacobson could not claim entrapment should be allowed to stand.|$|E

2500|$|Although the NHL's {{numbers were}} disputed, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> several franchises were losing money, as several had {{declared}} bankruptcy. Other franchises had held [...] "fire sales" [...] of franchise players, {{such as the}} Washington Capitals. Some small-market teams, such as the Pittsburgh Penguins and the remaining small-market Canadian teams, were actually hoping for a lockout, since those teams would make more money by losing a season, with the Edmonton Oilers even publicly announcing that they would fold outright if there wasn't a lockout. The league did not have large TV revenues in the US, so the NHL was reliant on attendance revenues more than other leagues. After the lockout of the 2004–2005 season, NHL teams made on average only 3million dollars from television revenues. In addition in May of the 2004–2005 lockout, ESPN formally denied the option to show NHL games on the network due to low ratings in previous seasons. [...] Many NHL teams had low attendance totals in preceding seasons.|$|E
2500|$|Wild's team now {{needed a}} site for a new, better {{engineered}} and more powerful radiospectrograph and a large swept-frequency interferometer with which to observe the radio source. In September 1950, he and three colleagues borrowed a decrepit ex-military ambulance and with a spectrum analyser assessed potential sites {{on the outskirts of}} Sydney and down the New South Wales south coast that would be least affected by interference from radio transmissions. They chose a grazing property outside Dapto, 15 kilometres south of Wollongong, shielded by a 1500-foot mountain. Here the Radiophysics Solar Group went from strength to strength, to the extent that Wild later said [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> we were the world champions". Professor Marcel Minnaert, the eminent Belgian astronomer, wrote in 1963:The history of solar radio-spectroscopy is mainly the history of Australian work on this subject. ... At each meeting of the International Astronomical Union, highly competent specialists such as Wild [...] … were able to announce spectacular progress.|$|E
2500|$|Tensions {{along the}} Condor range {{had been running}} high {{following}} a crisis that arose in July 1991 over {{the location of a}} Peruvian outpost called [...] "Pachacútec" [...] (Pachacútec Incident) inside a zone that, while 60km north of the delimited and undemarcated area, had its own problems regarding the location of a single border marker (see map). Ecuador had protested over the location of [...] "Pachacútec" [...] since it was, according to Ecuador, inside Ecuadorian territory, and went on to set up an outpost of its own ("Etza") right in front of it. For Peru, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> both [...] "Pachacútec" [...] and [...] "Etza" [...] were inside Peruvian territory. Although the crisis was defused the following month with the signing of a Pacto de Caballeros (gentlemen's agreement), by which both sides committed themselves to abandon these posts and separate their forces, the aftermath of the incident saw both countries accusing each other of violating the accord and reinforcing their military presence in the delimited and undemarcated area.|$|E

60|$|On {{rounding}} the point they saw two vessels lying side by side, {{a mile and}} a half distant, and about a mile from shore. One was a barque, evidently a large merchantman; the other a brigantine. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the latter was a pirate, and the other her prize. The sailors, after a glance at them, turned their eyes anxiously towards Nat for orders. The latter stood quietly examining the ships through his glass.|$|E

60|$|The return {{through the}} woods was made {{in a very short}} time, the boys walking on at full speed until they were near the hut, when the utmost caution was used.

60|$|The {{place was}} in wild disorder, {{for when the}} major leaped from the bed he had dragged the {{coverings}} with him and they lay scattered upon the floor.

60|$|Gervaise, on {{reaching}} the palace, heard that D'Aubusson was at present engaged in examining {{no less a}} person than Maitre Georges, the right hand of Paleologus, who had soon after daybreak presented himself before the wall {{on the other side}} of the town, declaring that he had left the Turkish service, and craving to be admitted. News had been sent at once to D'Aubusson, who despatched two of the senior knights, with orders to admit him and receive him with all honour. This had been done, and the grand master, with some of his council, were now closeted with the newcomer. Several of the knights were gathered in the courtyard, discussing the event. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> if the renegade came in good faith, his defection would be a serious blow to the assailants, and that his well known skill and experience would greatly benefit the defenders.|$|E

Fortunately for him there were plenty of eatables there, and he lived there in concealment for a fortnight. After that he crawled out, and found the mutineers had marched for Delhi. He went through a lot, but at last joined us before that city. We often talked over our dreams together, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> we owed our lives to them. Even then we did not talk much to other people about them, for {{there would have been a}} lot of talk, and inquiry, and questions, and you know fellows hate that sort of thing.

His fear was that the cockleshell of a boat should fill and founder; he tried to bale out the water with his hat, and to make her assist, but she seemed incapable, and he could only devise laying her down {{in the bottom of the}} boat with his coat over her, hiding her face in terror. Her hat had long ago been blown away, and her hair was flapping about. Ejaculations were in his heart, if not on his lips, and once or twice she cried out something like, [...] "Save me!"
