25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, McCartney {{said the}} initial {{idea for the}} song began with Bobby Rydell's hit [...] "Forget Him" [...] with its call and {{response}} pattern, and that [...] "as often happens, you think of one song when you write another ... I'd planned an 'answering song' where a couple of us would sing 'she loves you' and the other ones would answer 'yeah yeah'. We decided that was a crummy idea {{but at least we}} then had the idea of a song called 'She Loves You'. So <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the hotel bedroom for a few hours and wrote it—John and I, sitting on twin beds with guitars." [...] It was completed the following day at McCartney's family home in Forthlin Road, Liverpool.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Troutman {{developed}} [...] "I Want to Be Your Man" [...] {{around the}} theme of romantic commitment. [...] "Guys have trouble committing and women want us to commit," [...] he explained to authors Adam White and Fred Bronson. [...] "Women want us to admit that we don't want to commit." [...] Troutman took the idea and began working on a track similar in style to [...] "Computer Love," [...] a 1986 hit for his band Zapp. [...] "I was playing in Dallas and [...] flew out. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the hotel room one day and wrote the song. I {{talked to him about}} what I was trying to say and one thing led to another. We came back and recorded a vocal." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{unobtrusive}} stranger ceased, and <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> gazing <b>in</b> silence at the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|Embracing {{each other}} fervently, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> the rocks {{to rest and}} collect our thoughts.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> all <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{silence for}} some minutes while those fateful eyes still {{strained}} to pierce the veil.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{silence for}} some moments, during which I thought intently to little purpose.|$|E
60|$|The blaze died out, {{leaving the}} room almost in darkness, and for awhile <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{silence for}} some minutes, Holmes more {{depressed}} and shaken than I {{had ever seen}} him.|$|E
60|$|There <b>we</b> <b>sat,</b> hand <b>in</b> hand, {{for many}} minutes more, saying never another word, but sympathising silently, till Elsie {{returned}} from Palmyra.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> all <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{silence for}} some little time after {{listening}} to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock looked across at his brother.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} not. Here! one stew; and be quick, please,' cried John, as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> a warm {{corner of the}} confectioner's opposite.|$|R
60|$|Then as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> silence {{there came}} a low tapping at the door. Ray looked at me keenly.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know how}} long <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> amazed silence. Then as in a dream, I heard Challenger's voice once more.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{silence for}} a while, and then she put into words the thought which was in both our minds.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> the window-seat; I {{assured her}} I would not scold, {{whatever}} her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced-- ...|$|R
60|$|It was one {{day after}} dinner, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>in</b> his magnificently furnished dining-room. We had lighted our cigars at the silver lamp. The butler had withdrawn.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} back again to your own country, Ivanka," [...] said I, gently {{stroking}} the child's head, as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> together <b>in</b> the same room, some hours later.|$|R
60|$|There <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> that tarry old den, {{the only}} {{inhabitants}} of the deserted old ship, but the mate and the rats.|$|E
6000|$|Again <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{expectant}} silence until {{several of}} the group became restless. [...] "What is she about now?" [...] asked Cameron, wearily.|$|E
60|$|Then {{day after}} day <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> moody silence, gnawed with hunger, with nothing to read, nothing to smoke, and {{practically}} nothing to talk about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Watson," [...] said Holmes as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>in</b> {{the gathering}} darkness, [...] "I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There {{is a distinct}} element of danger." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> the candle-lit {{twilight}} to supper. It {{was to me}} {{like the}} supper of a child, taken at peace in the clear beams, ere he descend into the shadow of sleep.|$|R
60|$|We then {{wandered into}} the House of Diomed, which seemed to me a dismal abode, affording no {{possibility}} of comfort. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> one of the rooms, on an iron bench, very cold.|$|R
60|$|This {{question}} (of {{almost the}} dull insolence of legal phraseology) was put while <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> Rousselin's little red-tiled café near Congo Square in New Orleans.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{the room}} that was called her private dining-room, but which, in fact, was all things to her save the chamber in which she slept.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a minute}} <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> silence, so {{compelling}} were her gestures and her tone. At last I asked, [...] "Has any one here lost a little child?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> {{and smoked}} <b>in</b> silence. I {{felt that the}} consolations of a {{stranger}} would sound weak.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> on <b>in</b> {{silence for}} about half an hour, the dog keeping a reproachful eye upon us from the nearest chair, and {{displaying}} elephantine delight whenever we made any movement suggestive of climbing down.|$|R
5000|$|When {{our country}} was celebrating Diwali, {{they were playing}} Holi(with their blood).While <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> safely <b>in</b> our homes, they were braving bullets.Blessed were those young men, blessed was their youth!Remember the sacrifice, of those who became martyrs! ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ravenor {{stretched}} {{out his hand to}} the bell and rang it violently. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> silence, dreading almost to look at one another until it was answered.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And when, Trot,' said my aunt, {{patting the}} back of my hand, as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> our old way before the fire, 'when are you going over to Canterbury?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{silence for}} a little while--for longer, perhaps, than it seemed to us--Dan in the chair {{opposite}} to me, each of us occupied with his own thoughts.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> both <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> {{silence for}} some little time after {{listening}} to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.|$|R
60|$|A short {{month ago}} {{we would have}} repudiated Bones; today <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> there <b>in</b> {{slightly}} supercilious attitudes, as if to indicate that any affront offered to Bones would be an insult to ourselves, and followed by our instantaneous withdrawal in a body.|$|R
60|$|The names {{seemed to}} convey nothing to my companion, who merely nodded. We had now {{arrived at the}} other hotel, and the {{prospects}} of breakfast were already claiming our attention. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> the coffee-room and attacked our bacon and eggs and coffee with zest.|$|R
