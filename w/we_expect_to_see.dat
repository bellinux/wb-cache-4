The area along the Intracoastal from 5th Avenue South to 15th Avenue South still bears the name Addition 1. [...] "In the new addition, the Lake front has been divided into large lots covered with palm and tropical growth, where <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> charming villas and winter homes spring up as by enchantment. It will be the fashionable part of town, where the wealthy of the earth can display their artistic taste and make ideal homes. These lots are selling so fast that but very few are left." [...] Included in the new addition were South Palm Park, a boat dock and P Street (now South Palmway) with its vibrant, green median and collection of 31 species of palm trees.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{when it was}} {{announced}} that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as [...] "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show". Other media sources branded them two of [...] "the most popular characters on the soap" [...] and an [...] "iconic couple". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?). All very well thought through and positive. This sounds like a soap getting back in touch with its roots.".|$|E

60|$|The {{study of}} Expression is difficult, {{owing to the}} {{movements}} being often extremely slight, and of a fleeting nature. A difference may be clearly perceived, and yet it may be impossible, at least I have found it so, to state in what the difference consists. When we witness any deep emotion, our sympathy is so strongly excited, that close observation is forgotten or rendered almost impossible; of which fact I have had many curious proofs. Our imagination is another and still more serious source of error; for if from {{the nature of the}} circumstances <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any expression, we readily imagine its presence. Notwithstanding Dr. Duchenne's great experience, he for a long time fancied, as he states, that several muscles contracted under certain emotions, whereas he ultimately convinced himself that the movement was confined to a single muscle.|$|E

60|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--I {{wrote to}} you not many days ago, but I {{must tell you}} that our voyagers are safe in Sandgate break in 'an ugly hulk' (as poor Stormie says despondingly), {{suffering}} three or four days of quarantine agony, and that <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them on Monday or Tuesday in the full bloom of their ill humour. I am happy to think, according to the present symptoms, that the mania for sea voyages is considerably abated. 'Nothing could be more miserable,' exclaims Storm; 'the only comfort of the whole four months is the safety of the beans, tell papa'--and the safety of the beans is rather a Pythagoraean[133] equivalent for four months' vexation, though not a bean of them all should have lost in freshness and value! He could scarcely write, he said, for the chilblains on his hands, and was in utter destitution of shirts and sheets. Oh! I have very good hopes that for the future Wimpole Street may be found endurable.|$|E

The Darkness and Light, which this room and garden represent, are very still, but we should feel that it is only the pause in which old enemies regard each other before they come to the grip. The moonshine {{stealing}} about among the flowers, to give them their last instructions, has left a smile upon them, but it is a smile with a menace in it for the dwellers in darkness. What <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> next is the moonshine slowly pushing the windows open, so that it may whisper to a confederate in the house, whose name is Lob. But though we may be sure that this was about to happen it does not happen; a stir among the dwellers in darkness prevents it.|$|E

60|$|Such establishments and {{calculations}} {{may appear}} very promising upon paper, but {{when applied to}} real life they will be found to be absolutely nugatory. Mr Condorcet allows that a class of people which maintains itself entirely by industry is necessary to every state. Why does he allow this? No other reason can well be assigned than that he conceives that the labour necessary to procure subsistence for an extended population will not be performed without the goad of necessity. If by establishments {{of this kind of}} spur to industry be removed, if the idle and the negligent are placed upon the same footing with regard to their credit, and the future support of their wives and families, as the active and industrious, can <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> men exert that animated activity in bettering their condition which now forms the master spring of public prosperity? If an inquisition were to be established to examine the claims of each individual and to determine whether he had or had not exerted himself to the utmost, and to grant or refuse assistance accordingly, this would be little else than a repetition upon a larger scale of the English poor laws and would be completely destructive of the true principles of liberty and equality.|$|E

Half a bedroom unfortunately is [...] cut off from bad management, and the Frattina rooms are much too [...] small. Besides three rooms which we occupy there is another which [...] we do not. We are boarded too, which saves much trouble, and we [...] have the Stanleys here. We go quietly about our work of seeing [...] Rome. The Vatican has been much enriched since I was here. The [...] sculpture gallery is really wonderful in its superiority to all [...] others. I think if I were allowed to choose two pieces I should [...] perhaps take the Demosthenes and the Torso.
