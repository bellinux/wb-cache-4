2500|$|There's {{no doubt}} Iraq hasn't fully {{complied}} with its disarmament obligations {{as set forth}} by the Security Council in its resolution. But on the other hand, since 1998 Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capacity has been verifiably eliminated... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that this missing 5-10% doesn't necessarily constitute a threat... It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn't amount to much, but which is still prohibited... We can't give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can't close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously, we can't reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war. (page 28) ...|$|E

Ocean was the UK's lead amphibious landing ship, providing sea-based logistics to the Royal Marine's 3 Commando Brigade and {{acting as a}} launch pad for their attack on the Al-Faw Peninsula. Her helicopters {{also played a role}} in securing the city of Basra. When interviewed about the experience Clayton said; [...] "There's [...] a sense of pride in a job really well done. [...] {{played a major role in}} the operations out there. But also <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that we're the lucky ones coming back. Not everyone has. There are many we have to think about, including one of our ship's company who was killed in action, Marine Chris Maddison. Our thoughts will be about him and with his family." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is no job for German men and {{soldiers}} to shoot defenseless people, but the Führer has ordered these shootings {{because he is}} convinced that these men otherwise would shoot at us as partisans or would shoot at our comrades, and our {{women and children were}} also to be protected if we undertake these executions. This <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> when <b>we</b> carried out this order.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{one thing}} we were resolved: we would not cross the Line west of 130 degrees west longitude. For here was the problem. To cross the Line {{to the west of}} that point, if the {{southeast}} trades were well around to the southeast, would throw us so far to leeward of the Marquesas that a head-beat would be maddeningly impossible. Also, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the equatorial current, which moves west at a rate of anywhere from twelve to seventy-five miles a day. A pretty pickle, indeed, to be to leeward of our destination with such a current in our teeth. No; not a minute, nor a second, west of 130 degrees west longitude would we cross the Line. But since the southeast trades were to be expected five or six degrees north of the Line (which, if they were well around to the southeast or south- southeast, would necessitate our sliding off toward south- southwest), <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hold to the eastward, north of the Line, and north of the southeast trades, until we gained at least 128 degrees west longitude.|$|R

60|$|There is {{probably}} nothing very profitable {{to be said}} about all this domestic disorder.

60|$|One is apt {{to write}} and talk of strong and weak as though some were always strong, some always weak. But that is quite a {{misleading}} version of life.

30|$|Here {{we return}} to the {{research}} questions: How can the idea of GI be applied to meet the specific requirements of mining regions and post-mining landscapes? And what are the strengths of the GI concept in relation to landscape restoration in coal mining areas? In formulating answers, <b>we</b> first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that it was not the explicit goal of actors in the investigated cases in Germany and China to create what we call here ‘green infrastructure’. First and foremost, the motivation of local actors was to overcome the negative environmental impacts of coal-mining, to raise the living conditions of inhabitants, and to remove obstacles to urban development. The realized measures were based on concepts that combined clean-up activities, greening and improved wellbeing. Hence, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> consider the effects of the tested strategies and determine how they are related to the planning concept of GI.|$|R

60|$|The {{mistake was}} due to a very clever woman making a blunder and not {{retrieving}} it.

Yet, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that six consecutive days of rehearsing the leading part of The Fallen Age, at the New Gaiety Theatre where the plaster is not yet properly dry, might have brought about an unhingement of spirits which, again, might have led to eccentricities.|$|E
500|$|Sweden – On 8 August 2008, Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt {{said that}} the crisis was due to provocations from the South Ossetian side and that Georgian forces were trying to restore the {{constitutional}} order. On 9 August, Bildt compared Russia's reason {{for going to war}} with Georgia to Adolf Hitler's actions, [...] "No state <b>has</b> the right <b>to</b> intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state. Attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged Europe into war in the past...

6000|$|Walter Russell's bravery {{may seem}} overdrawn, but such {{is far from}} being a fact. That our sailors were heroes in those days <b>we</b> <b>have</b> but <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the sinking of the Merrimac, the Winslow affair, and a score of deeds of equal daring. [...] "The hour makes the man," [...] and the {{opportunity}} likewise makes the hero. Walter was brave, but he was no more so than hundreds of others who stood ready to lay down their lives in the cause of humanity and for the honor of Old Glory. Like his two brothers, his religious belief was of the practical kind, and he went into battle convinced that so long as he did his duty according to the dictates of his conscience, an all-wise and all-powerful Providence would guide him and watch over him.|$|R
5000|$|Poovey {{conducted}} a public re-evaluation in 1999 at the British Women Writers Conference as a theoretical exercise of a writers work. Poovey re-read {{the works of}} Ellen Pickering and decided {{that they were not}} worth reviving. This novelist's works had been popular in the 19th century but she considered the books to be over-complicated and lacking in innovation. She concluded that the only reason to re-read works like this was to confirm that the books that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> chosen <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> like Jane Eyre and Mary Barton, are the best of their type. Poovey used her re-reading of Pickering's novels to argue that not all writers need to be revived into the literary canon. Tamara Wagner went on to argue that this shows that we need to debunk our [...] "history of reading these texts back from reality"? ...|$|R
60|$|And {{there is}} this real moral in the matter; that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that civilization as it goes on ought not perhaps to grow more fighting--but ought to grow more ready to fight. The more {{valuable}} and reposeful is the order we have to guard, the more vivid should be our ultimate sense of vigilance and potential violence. And when I walk round a summer garden, I can understand how those high mad lords {{at the end of}} the Middle Ages, just before their swords clashed, caught at roses for their instinctive emblems of empire and rivalry. For to me any such garden is full of the wars of the roses.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{that human}} races can all interbreed freely {{and that they}} separate, mingle and reunite as clouds do. Human races do not branch out like trees with {{branches}} that never come together again. It is a {{thing we need to}} bear constantly in mind, this remingling of races at any opportunity. It will save us from many cruel delusions and prejudices if we do so. People will use such a word as race in the loosest manner, and base the most preposterous generalizations upon it. They will speak of a [...] "British" [...] {73} race or of a [...] "European" [...] race. But nearly all the European nations are confused mixtures of brownish, dark-white, white and Mongolian elements.|$|E
60|$|As to the {{reference}} with which Voltaire impatiently concludes, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{that the work}} was being printed at Geneva as {{it came out in}} Paris. It was afterwards reprinted as a whole both at Geneva (1777) and at Lausanne (1778). An edition appeared at Leghorn in 1770, and another at Lucca in 1771. Immediately after the completion of the Encyclopædia there began to appear volumes of selections from it. The compilers of these anthologies (for instance of an Esprit de l'Encydopédie published at Geneva in 1768) were free from all intention of proselytising. They meant only to turn a more or less honest penny by serving up in neat duodecimos the liveliest, most curious, and most amusing pieces {{to be found in the}} immense mass of the folios of the original.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 August 2008, Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt {{said that}} the crisis was due to provocations from the South Ossetian side and that Georgian forces were trying to restore [...] "the {{constitutional}} order". On 9 August, Bildt evoked the memory of Adolf Hitler in condemning Russia's attack on Georgia, saying the protection of Russian citizens does not justify the invasion. [...] "No state <b>has</b> the right <b>to</b> intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state," [...] he also said. [...] "Attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged Europe into war in the past...

60|$|I {{began to}} grow poetical. (I wrote verses in my youth before I went to South Africa.) We threw {{ourselves}} on the grass, near a small mountain stream that descended among moss-clad boulders from the steep woods above us. The Kentuckian flung himself at full length on the sward, {{just in front of}} Charles. He had a strange head of hair, very thick and shaggy. I don't know why, but, of a sudden, it reminded me of the Mexican Seer, whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> learned <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> as Colonel Clay's first embodiment. At the same moment the same thought seemed to run through Charles's head; for, strange to say, with a quick impulse he leant forward and examined it. I saw Mrs. Quackenboss draw back in wonder. The hair looked too thick and close for nature. It ended abruptly, I now remembered, with a sharp line on the forehead. Could this, too, be a wig? It seemed very probable.|$|R
6000|$|Such was Boon's {{plan for}} the second chapter of [...] "The Mind of the Race." [...] But that chapter he never {{completely}} planned. At various times Boon gave us a number of colloquies, never joining them together in any regular order. The project of taking up {{the discussion of the}} Mind of the Race at the exact point Mr. Mallock had laid it down, and taking the villa by the sea for the meeting-place, was at once opposed by Hallery and his American friend with an evidently preconcerted readiness. They pointed out the entire democratization of thought and literature that {{had been going on for}} the past four decades. It was no longer possible to deal with such matters in the old aristocratic country-house style; it was no longer possible to take them up from that sort of beginning; the centre of mental gravity among the English-speaking community had shifted socially and geographically; what was needed now was something wider and ampler, something more in the nature of such a conference as the annual meeting of the British Association. Science left the gentleman's mansion long ago; literature must follow it--had followed it. To come back to Mr. Lankester's Villa by the sea was to come back to a beaten covert. The Hearst representative took up a strongly supporting position, and suggested that if indeed we wished to move with the times the thing to do was to strike out boldly for a special annex of the Panama Exhibition at San Francisco and for organization upon sound American lines. It was a case, he said, even for [...] "exhibits." [...] Sir Henry Lunn, however, objected that in America the Anglo-Saxon note was almost certain to be too exclusively sounded; that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> there were vigorous cultures growing up and growing up more and more detachedly upon the continent of Europe; we wanted, at least, their reflected lights ... some more central position.... In fact, Switzerland ... where also numerous convenient hotels ... patronized, he gathered from the illustrated papers, by Lord Lytton, Mrs. Asquith, Mr. F. R. Benson ... and all sorts of helpful leading people.|$|R
