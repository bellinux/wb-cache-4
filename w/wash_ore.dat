5000|$|Everything {{about the}} old lead industry, from the mining of ore to its sale, stemmed from the ancient claim of the monarch to all mineral rights. The whole {{structure}} was designed to enable the Duchy of Lancaster, a royal possession, to collect the king's royalties and, since these were farmed out, the miners paid them to the king's farmer. By the 17th century the local holder of the mineral rights was also the barmaster, who ran the industry, helped by deputies responsible for the liberties, and by the miners' juries of the Barmote Court. The lead industry is long gone, but its traditions are still maintained and the barmaster and the jury still meet in the Barmote Hall in Wirksworth.It was the royal possession of the mineral rights and the royal wish to encourage lead mining, that dictated the two characteristic features of so-called [...] "free mining".

The results {{are supported by}} the projection factor, which clearly show the relationships between different elements and mineralogical composition of the effluents and <b>washed</b> <b>ore.</b> The results are {{a high concentration of}} 26 - 35 % P 2 O 5 (fluorapatite), but it remains carbonates (calcite anddolomite) in low quantity. The apatite show significant REE contents that can be by-product of phosphoric acid. Silicates and carbonates are the major part of effluents. The sulphate and fluoride contents are of the order of 3 %, and the Na 2 O content varies between 1 and 1. 5 %, we observed a good correlation between F-P 2 O 5 -Na 2 O-P 2 O 5 and P 2 O 5 -SO 3. The levels of Cd, Zn, Cr, V, Ni, Sc, Nb and Cu are from the laundry reject. The maximum values of these elements are in the effluent from the M'DHILLA laundry. The Cd and Zn are found in high concentrations in the solid effluent. The high Cr content is linked with hydrocyclones in chromed steel. The <b>washed</b> phosphate <b>ore</b> was strongly depleted in heavy metals, which were concentrated in the fine fraction released into the hydric network and are thus the main cause of pollution in the region...|$|R

5000|$|The {{technique}} {{appears to}} have been neglected through the medieval period, because Georgius Agricola, writing in the 15th century in his De re Metallica, does not mention hushing at all, although he does describe many other uses of water power, especially for <b>washing</b> <b>ore</b> and driving watermills. However, the technique was used on a large scale in the lead mines of northern Britain from at least Elizabethan times onwards. The method was described in some detail by Westgarth Forster in his book A Treatise on a Section of the Strata from Newcastle upon Tyne to the Mountain of Cross Fell in Cumberland (1809) and also in the 1842 Royal Commission on Children in Mines in relation to children being used in the lead mines of the Pennines.|$|R

25|$|The {{wood was}} likely much larger originally, as extracting iron from its ore {{required}} great quantities of charcoal.

The ore also needed to be crushed, and that was done in appropriate mills. Lastly, extracting iron required air to activate the bloomeries and the site is at the top of a hill, well exposed to winds.|$|R

60|$|Our path {{had been}} {{gradually}} rising {{all the way}} from St. Clare's Well; and, when we left Trevethey Stone, we still continued to ascend, proceeding along the tram-way leading to the Caraton Mine. Soon the scene presented another abrupt and extraordinary change. We had been walking hitherto amid almost invariable silence and solitude; but now, with each succeeding minute, strange, mingled, unintermitting noises began to grow louder and louder around us. We followed a sharp curve in the tram-way, and immediately found ourselves saluted by an entirely new prospect, and surrounded by an utterly bewildering noise. All about us monstrous wheels were turning slowly; machinery was clanking and groaning in the hoarsest discords; invisible waters were pouring onward with a rushing sound; high above our heads, on skeleton platforms, iron chains clattered fast and fiercely over iron pulleys, and huge steam pumps puffed and gasped, and slowly raised and depressed their heavy black beams of wood. Far beneath the embankment on which we stood, men, women, and children were breaking and <b>washing</b> <b>ore</b> in a perfect marsh of copper-coloured mud and copper-coloured water. We had penetrated to the very centre of the noise, the bustle, and the population on the surface of a great mine.|$|R
25|$|The exact {{function}} of the cascade {{is related to the}} methods of extracting the final traces of gold from the crushed ore.

Many such deep mines {{have been found in}} the mountains around Las MÃ©dulas. Mining would start with the building of aqueducts and tanks above the mineral veins, and a method called hushing used to expose the veins under the overburden.|$|R

50|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{aluminium}} (Al) {{are present in}} many ores including iron ore, sand and some limestones. The former can be removed by <b>washing</b> the <b>ore</b> prior to smelting.

However, when brick began to be used for hearths and the interior of blast furnaces, the amount of aluminium contamination increased dramatically. This was due to the erosion of the furnace lining by the liquid slag.|$|R
50|$|Alluvial gold {{deposits}} {{could be}} worked {{and the gold}} extracted without needing to crush the <b>ore.</b> <b>Washing</b> tables were fitted below the tanks to collect the gold-dust and any nuggets present.

2500|$|The {{existing}} ponds {{above and}} below the minor road from Pumsaint to Caeo, were probably part of a cascade for <b>washing</b> <b>ore,</b> the upper tank having yielded large quantities of Roman pottery from ca 78 to at least 300 AD (Lewis, 1977; Burnham 2004). The upper pool is known as Melin-y-Milwyr, or the soldiers' mill, an intriguing name that implies that watermills may have been used here during the Roman period. Alternatively, {{it may have been a}} sequence of washing tables for the crushed gold ore. A large-scale mill complex is known from Barbegal in southern France, where no less than 16 mills (in two lines of 8 each) were built into the side of a hill and supplied with water from a single aqueduct. There were two lines of parallel overshot mills, the outflow from one feeding the next below. The mill supplied flour to the region. Moreover, Roman engineers used sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels to dewater mines, and the deep workings at Dolaucothi produced a fragment of such a wheel during the 1930s when deep mining operations were resumed. Sequences of such wheels increased the lift, and one extensive sequence of 16 wheels was found in old Roman mine workings on the Rio Tinto river in the 1920s. The wheels were arranged in pairs and could lift water about [...] from the bottom of the mine there.|$|R

50|$|Leats {{were also}} used {{extensively}} by the Romans, and can still be seen at many sites, such as the Dolaucothi goldmines. They used the aqueducts to prospect for ores by sluicing away the overburden of soil to reveal the bedrock in a method known as hushing. They could then attack the ore veins by fire-setting, quench with water from a tank above the workings, and remove the debris with waves of water, a method still used in hydraulic mining. The water supply could then be used for <b>washing</b> the <b>ore</b> after crushing by simple machines also driven by water.|$|R

40|$|Mining residues, in general, {{and metal}} ores, in particular, contain heavy metals within the rock. These heavy metals are very harmful to humans and, as such, are {{a serious problem}} for the environment. They can be {{considered}} as contaminated rocks. One of the heavy metals with increasing demand around the world is copper (Cu) {{that is the subject of}} this study. To extract copper from the residue with 8, 950 mg copper per kg rock, a biosurfactant, rhamnolipid was used. To optimize the conditions for maximum extraction, several batch tests were performed on <b>washed</b> <b>ore</b> samples in 25 CÌ•. The best size of particle sizes was determined to be between 0. 15 and 0. 3 mm while the pH was set at 6. A minimum volume of 10 mL rhamnolipid of 2 % concentration for 1 g of ore was required to extract about 28 % of copper from the ore. Although better results are also possible with higher concentrations of rhamnolipid, the solution becomes very viscous as well. Adding 1 % NaOH to the solution dramatically improved the extraction up to 42 % in 6 days. Unwashed samples of mixed size particles were tested under the optimized conditions and 24 % of copper was extracted. A sequential extraction procedure was performed to determine the fractions of different forms of copper in the ore. The oxide and hydroxide, residual part, and carbonates are the main fractions and the extracted ore was extracted mainly from the oxide and hydroxide part...|$|R

More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround the lip of the very large opencast and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the opencast below, but must have been modified later to feed a washing table built to the left-hand side (near the figure in the picture), probably to <b>wash</b> the crushed <b>ore</b> from the same opencast working. It is labelled Tank C in the schematic diagram. Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main opencast. Most of the opencast workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|R
