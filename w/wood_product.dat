5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E
25|$|When {{solid biomass}} {{is already in}} a {{suitable}} form (such as firewood), it can burn directly in a stove or furnace to provide heat or raise steam. When solid biomass is in an inconvenient form (such as sawdust, wood chips, grass, urban waste wood, agricultural residues), the typical process is to densify the biomass. This process includes grinding the raw biomass to an appropriate particulate size (known as hogfuel), which, depending on the densification type, can be from , which is then concentrated into a fuel product. The current processes produce wood pellets, cubes, or pucks. The pellet process is most common in Europe, and is typically a pure <b>wood</b> <b>product.</b> The other types of densification are larger in size compared to a pellet and are compatible with {{a broad range of}} input feedstocks. The resulting densified fuel is easier to transport and feed into thermal generation systems, such as boilers.|$|E

2500|$|But {{beyond these}} public {{buildings}} {{designed in the}} Nordic Classicism style, this same style was also used in timber constructed workers' housing, most famously in the Puu-Käpylä ("Wooden Käpylä") district of Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas. The around 165 houses of Puu-Käpylä, modelled on farmhouses, were built from traditional square log construction clad in vertical boarding, but the construction technique was rationalised with an on-site [...] "factory" [...] with a partly building element technique. The principle of standardization for housing generally would take off during this time. In 1922 the National Board of Social Welfare (Sosiaalihalitus) commissioned architect Elias Paalanen to design different options of farmhouses, which were then published as a brochure, Pienasuntojen tyyppipiirustuksia (Standard drawings for small houses) republished several times. In 1934 Paalanen was commissioned to design an equivalent urban type-house, and {{he came up with}} twelve different options. Alvar Aalto, too, became involved, from 1936, in standard small houses, designing for the Ahlström timber and <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> company, with three types of the so-called AA system: 40 m² (Type A), 50 m² (Type B) and 60 m² (Type C). Though based on traditional farmhouses, there are also clear stylistic elements from Nordic Classicism but also modernism. However, it was with the repercussions of the Second World War that the standard system for house design took on even greater potency, {{with the advent of the}} so-called Rintamamiestalo house (literally: War-front soldier's house). These were built throughout the country; a particularly well-preserved example is the district of Karjasilta in Oulu. But this same house type also took on a different role in the aftermath of World War Two as part of the Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union; among the [...] "goods" [...] delivered from Finland to the Soviet Union were over 500 wooden houses based on the standard Rintamamiestalo house, deliveries taking place between 1944 and 1948. A number of these houses ended up being exported from the Soviet Union to various places in Poland, where small [...] "Finnish villages" [...] were established; for example, the district of Szombierki in Bytom, as well as in Katowice and Sosnowiec.|$|E

30|$|The lower {{environmental}} impacts of <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> compared to other materials are also related {{to the fact that}} the carbon dioxide released in the combustion phase at the end of the product life equals the carbon dioxide absorbed during the growth of a same amount of biomass in forest (carbon neutrality assumption) [26, 27]. Moreover, long-lasting <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> e.g., <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> for buildings, have an additional benefit on climate change, since during their entire lifetime they act like temporary CO 2 storages, storing carbon in their biomass that would have otherwise been emitted to the atmosphere [2, 28]. Lastly, using <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> at their end of life as a substitute energy source, the emissions from other sources, such as fossil fuels, could be reduced [29].
