50|$|Through {{several studies}} Marilyn Kozak {{was the first}} to {{recognize}} the main role of scanning during initiation of translation in mammalian cells. The AUG codon in mammals is optimally recognized by the context GCCRCCAUGG, also known as a “Kozak Consensus Sequence.” Purine (R) and each of the nucleotides within this sequence are highly conserved and provide an important function in recognition and initiation of translation for many 40s ribosomal subunits. With an optimal context at an AUG start codon ribosomes will begin initiation at that point. A weak context occurs when the sequences adjacent to the AUG start codon has deviated from the consensus sequence. A few ribosomes will still initiate translation in the <b>weak</b> <b>location</b> but the majority will perform leaky scanning and initiation downstream. As a consequence different proteins are likely to be produced (e.g. viral proteins).|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase in}} the demand of active and reactive power in the power system network has limits as scope for network expansion many a times poses serious problems. The power system {{must be able to}} maintain acceptable voltage at all nodes in the system at a normal operating condition as well as post disturbance periods. Voltage instability is a serious issue in the system due to progressive and uncontrollable fall in voltage level. The research presented in this thesis is concerned with several facets of the voltage stability problem. The focus of this thesis is to improve the voltage stability of the system. The sensitivity analysis plays an important role as it monitors the nearness of the system towards the voltage collapse situation. The conventional offline data as well as the online data are processed to determine the weak areas are determined. As the system is having nonlinearities it is governed by differential and algebraic equations which are in turn solved by nonlinear techniques. In this work the system is analysed with steady state model. Once the system is represented in the form of differential equations and standard form is achieved advanced control techniques can be easily applied for its solution. The main focus of this thesis is aimed at placing FACTS device known as the Static compensator (STATCOM) at <b>weak</b> <b>location</b> of the system network {{to address the problem of}} voltage instability. With its unique capability to control reactive power flow in a transmission line as well as voltage at the bus where it is connected, this device significantly contribute to improve the power system. These features turn out to be even more prominent because STATCOM can allow loading of the transmission lines close to their thermal limits, forcing the power to flow through the desired paths. This opens up new avenues for the much needed flexibility in order to satisfy the demands. The voltage instability is improved with reactive power supports of optimal values at optimal locations. Also renewable energy sources offer better option than the conventional types and hence attempt has been made to include the wind energy for this study the wind generator is considered delivering constant output and is assumed as a substitute to the conventional power generators. Finally the system voltage stability is studied with design of a controller based on probabilistic neural network. The developed controller has provided much better performance under wide variations in the system loads and contingencies and shown a significant improvement in the static performance of the system. The proposed controller is tested under different scenarios of line outages and the load increase and found to be more effective than the existing ones. The research has revealed a veritable cornucopia of research opportunities, some of which are discussed in the thesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{of the degree of}} criticality of crack nucleation, initiation and propagation in the vicinity of bimaterial notches and the reliability of the junctions is a demanding problem, since bimaterial wedge or notch configurations are identified as potential <b>weak</b> <b>locations.</b> The singular character of the stress field at cracks or notches can be investigated analytically or numerically, the angle of the direction of potential crack initiation may also be determined, but the decisive question is whether crack initiation and subsequent crack arrest will really occur or not. An essential requirement in this context is a dependable criterion for crack nucleation. For that aim, the hypothesis of Leguillon is modified. Herein, the crack is assumed to be initiated and to grow if and only if both the released energy and the local stress reach critical values. Thus, simulating virtual crack growth along an interface, the integrity of the joint is revisable and finite charac teristic crack lengths can be determined and assessed. This concept is transferred to a bimaterial interface configuration of a thin layer on a substrate under high thermal loading, as required for modern high temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Stacks. Within the fuel cell stack, multilayered ceramic components have to be embedded in metallic interconnect frames. Due to the mismatch of the individual layers and the interconnect in the mechanical and thermal properties, the joints, as regions of material and geometrical discontinuities, are highly demanded and are potential <b>weak</b> <b>locations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Adhesive {{connections}} are potentially <b>weak</b> <b>locations</b> in {{many kinds of}} engineering structures. Since adhesive joints can be regarded locally as bimaterial notches, {{the assessment of the}} hazard of crack nucleation, initiation and propagation in the vicinity of bimaterial notches and the reliability of the junctions is an important problem. An essential requirement in this context is a sufficient criterion for crack nucleation. The present contribution proposes a modified approach based on Leguillon's hypothesis in order to provide a feasible criterion. A crack at a notch is assumed to be initiated and to grow if and only if both the released energy and the local stresses exceed critical values. Thus, simulating virtual crack growth along an interface of two dissimilar bonded materials, the integrity of the bond is revisable. The approach enables the determination of characteristic lengths for freshly nucleated cracks forming the base for any further integrity assessment. As an example, the concept is applied to the analysis of an adhesive bond of metallic and ceramic materials under severe thermal loading conditions as they occur, among other examples, in high temperature fuel cell technology. It is shown that the failure hazard of the adhesive joint can be reduced significantly by an appropriate local design. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Global analysis in explicit dynamic modulus was adopted to simulate the loading process of the two wing boxes. Meanwhile, detailed finite element models created in Patran/Nastran were used to evaluate the stability. Comparing experimental results with numerical counterparts, it is shown that the failure of the wing boxes is induced by local buckling occurring around the butt joint. In addition, the wing box that uses butt joints with lap jointed sheets is more rigid than that without lap jointed sheets, and the stress distribution is more uniform.

By comparing tooth geometry and Lewis factor with that given by AGMA, by graphical construction, and by Broghamer and Dolan for involute spur gear teeth, it is shown that FIGS.

40|$|Summary The Transantarctic Mountains are a non-compressional {{mountain}} belt {{located on}} the tectonic boundary between cratonic East Antarctica and non-cratonic West Antarctica. Formation of this mountain belt and a possible relation with the West Antarctic Rift system are still debated. Here we suggest a new explanation for uplift of the mountains, formation of a small crustal root, depression of the hinterland Wilkes Basin and formation of the West Antarctic Rift system. Using thermo-mechanical models to study deformation of the tectonic boundary, we find that convergence of crustal material at the craton edge during extension results in formation of a small crustal root and uplift of the surface. Crustal material accumulates at the craton edge during extension because the cratonic lithosphere is too strong to deform. This explains {{the location of the}} mountains. We further suggest that the West Antarctic Rift system formed {{at the side of the}} craton because this is the <b>weakest</b> <b>location</b> in the region. The hinterland Wilkes Subglacial Basin is a flexural depression; thermo-mechanical models show that rifting does not occur in the hinterland as the craton is simply too strong. Our models thus suggest that uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains is related to formation of the West Antarctic Rift system and flexural depression of the Wilkes Basin. Citation: J. F. Lawrence, J.

This study newly proposes a developed methodology to manufacture a glass-fiber/epoxy resin composite blade of a small 1 kW wind generator system. The improved mechanical properties of the composite blade are verified in a series of systematic experiments. The study focuses on the responses of applying a torsional loading to a long straight member such as the root of the composite blade. The core aluminum shaft was wrapped in glass-fiber/epoxy to form the root of the composite blade and a composite shaft. The composite shaft is a sandwich structure combining glass-fiber/epoxy and an aluminum shaft. The composite shaft was placed in a torsional testing machine and a strain gage monitored the strain on the composite shaft. We considered the composite blade to have a circular cross section and determined both stress distribution within the member and the angle of twist. Finally, mechanical properties were obtained in torsional testing, including the relationship between applied torque and the angle of twist on the composite shaft. The torsional loading and failure locations of the blade root were measured experimentally. The experiments showed that the <b>weakest</b> <b>location</b> of the blade root is at the interface of the aluminum shaft and glass-fiber/epoxy lay-ups in the composite blade root. It is found that the quality of the aluminum shaft, the glass-fiber/epoxy layers around the shaft and the bonding at the interface between the shaft and the layers should be increased to improve the torsional strength of the composite blade. These results can provide a reference for analysts and designers of small wind turbine systems...|$|R

Our objectives were to: determine the efficacy of a HTEF to control deer movements and evaluate its influence on deer spatial dynamics. We conducted our study on the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Wildlife Unit located in Oklahoma, USA. An electric 15 -strand, 2. 5 m high fence was erected around the study area in 1992. We captured and ear-tagged 419 deer from 1993 - 2005 and fitted 35 of these deer (19 females, 16 males) with GPS collars during winter 1998 - 2004. Eight of 35 radio-collared deer (23 %) crossed through the fence a total of 15 times and returned 13 times. Most fence crossings were at or near a hole or water gap (75 %; n = 21) while 21. 4 % (n = 6) crossed through the electric strands. Twenty four of 419 (6 %) ear-tagged deer were reported dead or harvested off of the property over 13 years. We found ≥ 13 deer core areas and ≥ 29 of home ranges bordered the fence. Core area and home range sizes of males and females were larger for deer associated with the fence compared to deer not associated with the fence.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{downturn}} {{in demand for}} air travel, major airlines are revising and rationalizing their networks {{in an attempt to}} improve financial performance and strengthen their defences against both new entrants and traditional rivals. Expansion of commercial agreements or alliances with other airlines has become a key reaction to the increasingly competitive marketplace. In the absence, for regulatory reasons, of cross-border mergers these are the principal means by which the industry can consolidate internationally. This paper analyzes the developments which have been taking place and attempts to itentify the implications for airline network structures and the function of different hub airports. The range of services available to passengers in long-haul markets to/from Europe is evaluated before and after recent industry reorganization. Hubs are crucial to interlink the route networks of parmers in an alliance. However, duplication between nearby hub airports that find themselves within the same airline alliance can lead to loss of service at the <b>weaker</b> <b>locations.</b> The extent to which the alliance hubs in Europe duplicate or complement each other in terms of network coverage is assessed and this methodology also enables the optimal partnerships for "unattached" airlines to be identified. The future role of the various European hubs is considered under different scenarios of global alliance development. The paper concludes by considering possible longer-term developments. In an environment where the low-cost carriers will provide a major element of customer choice, it is suggested that the traditional airlines will retrench around their hubs, surrendering many secondary cities to the low-cost sector. Further {{reduction in the number of}} alliances could threaten more of the European hubs.

40|$|The {{processing}} of high-level radioactive wastes now stored at Hanford and Savannah River Laboratories will continue {{over many years}} {{and it will be}} necessary for some of the liquids to remain in the tanks until well into the next century. Continued tank integrity is therefore an issue of prime importance and {{it will be necessary to}} understand any processes which could lead to tank failure. Hydrogen embrittlement resulting from absorption of radiolytic hydrogen could alter tank fracture behavior and be an issue in evaluating the effect of stresses on the tanks from rapid chemical oxidation-reduction reactions. The intense radiation fields in some of the tanks could be a factor in increasing the hydrogen permeation rates through protective oxide films on the alloy surface and be an additional factor in contributing to embrittlement. The project was initiated in October 1992 for a two year period to evaluate hydrogen uptake in low carbon steels that are representative of storage tanks. Steel specimens were exposed to high gamma radiation fields to generate radiolytic hydrogen and to potentially alter the protective surface films to increase hydrogen uptake. Direct measurements of hydrogen uptake were made using tritium as a tracer and fracture studies were undertaken to determine any alloy embrittlement. The rates of hydrogen uptake were noted to be extremely low in the experimental steels. Gamma radiation did not reveal any significant changes in the mechanical and fracture characteristics following exposures as long as a month. It is highly desirable to investigate further the tritium diffusion under stress in a cracked body where stress-assisted diffusion is expected to enhance these rates. More importantly, since welds are the <b>weakest</b> <b>locations</b> in the steel structures, the mechanical and fracture tests should be performed on welds exposed to tritium with and without stressed crack-fronts...|$|R
