5|$|Poets {{and artists}} {{were among the}} early {{visitors}} to Helvellyn {{at the beginning of}} the nineteenth century. Samuel Taylor Coleridge did a lot of fellwalking during the years when he lived near Keswick. In August 1800, barely a month after moving there, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> his friends William and Dorothy Wordsworth in Grasmere, taking a route over Helvellyn and arriving at ten in the evening.|$|E

5|$|The Anglians were {{replaced}} by a detachment of 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment, formed around C Company. On 25 August, a patrol from the Royal Irish <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a militia group known as the West Side Boys (WSB). At the village of Magbeni, where the WSB were based, the Royal Irish were overpowered and taken captive.

5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy Pascal suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who {{had often}} spoken to Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E
5|$|Gray and Joseph Dalton Hooker <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Richard Owen at London's Hunterian Museum in January 1839. Gray met Charles Darwin {{during lunch}} {{that day at}} Kew Gardens, {{apparently}} introduced by Hooker. Darwin found a kindred spirit in Gray, as they both had an empirical approach to science, and first wrote to him in April 1855. During 1855–1881 they exchanged about 300 letters. Darwin then wrote to Gray requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was helpful {{for the development of}} Darwin's theory. This was the beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 217, Caracalla was in the eastern provinces {{preparing}} a campaign against the Parthian Empire. Macrinus was among his staff, as were {{other members of the}} Praetorian Guard. In April, Caracalla <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a temple of Luna near the site of the battle of Carrhae and was accompanied only by his personal guard, which included Macrinus. On April 8, while traveling to the temple, Caracalla was stabbed to death by Justin Martialis, a soldier whom Macrinus had recruited to commit the murder. In the aftermath, Martialis was killed by one of Caracalla's men.|$|E

5|$|On the {{way back}} from the north, Pembroke stopped in the village of Deddington in the Midlands, putting Gaveston under guard there while he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> his wife. The Earl of Warwick took this {{opportunity}} to seize Gaveston, taking him to Warwick Castle, where Lancaster {{and the rest of his}} faction assembled on 18 June. At a brief trial, Gaveston was declared guilty of being a traitor under the terms of the Ordinances; he was executed on Blacklow Hill the following day, under the authority of the Earl of Lancaster. Gaveston's body was not buried until 1315, when his funeral was held in King's Langley Priory.|$|E
5|$|Wörth and {{the rest}} of the fleet {{operated}} under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897. The ship represented Germany during the Fleet Review for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in June 1897. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the Russian imperial court at Kronstadt; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser. They returned to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. In early December, the I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, though they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Clairmont {{became a}} lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate. Godwin's debts {{continued}} to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with {{the tension in the}} Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E

5|$|Another local {{man called}} Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He {{inherited}} a farm {{with an annual}} income of £80 and then married {{the daughter of a}} neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle who dropped in to visit him on his way home knocked Tom Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hung at Exeter Jail.|$|E
5|$|Brandenburg and {{the rest}} of the fleet {{operated}} under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897. Early in the year, the naval command considered deploying the I Division to another naval demonstration off Morocco to protest the murder of two German nationals there, but a smaller squadron of sailing frigates was sent instead. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Kaiserin (Empress) Augusta <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the Russian imperial court; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to Kronstadt to accompany the Kaiser, who proceeded to the capital at Saint Petersburg. They had returned to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. These exercises reflected the tactical thinking of the new State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—Imperial Navy Office), Konteradmiral Alfred von Tirpitz, and the new commander of the I Squadron, Vizeadmiral August von Thomsen. These new tactics stressed accurate gunnery, especially at longer ranges, though the necessities of the line-ahead formation led to a great deal of rigidity in the tactics. Thomsen's emphasis on shooting created the basis for the excellent German gunnery during World War I. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
