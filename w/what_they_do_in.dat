500|$|Duvall was {{the only}} American actor {{nominated}} for the Best Actor Oscar; his competition were Britons Michael Caine (who had co-starred with Duvall in the 1976 The Eagle Has Landed), Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about [...] "the Limey syndrome," [...] claiming [...] "the attitude {{with a lot of}} people in Hollywood is that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> England is somehow better than what we do here." [...] Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, [...] "It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite." [...] In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that despite four previous Academy Award nominations, [...] "it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona." [...] Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film.|$|E
2500|$|Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of The Chicagoist wrote, [...] "There is {{a moment}} in each {{installment}} of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in your chest. It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed {{to make me feel}} this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> literal terms is borderline demeaning." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{group is}} known for its caustic attacks on people it opposes and former members. In the past it has {{justified}} what it refers to as [...] "psywar techniques" [...] as necessary to shake people up; Johnson in 1983 quoted a LaRouche associate: [...] "We're not very nice, so we're hated. Why be nice? It's a cruel world. We're in a war and the human race is up for grabs." [...] Charles Tate, a former long-term LaRouche associate, told The Washington Post in 1987 that members see themselves as not subject to the ordinary laws of society: [...] "They feel that the continued existence of the human race is totally dependent on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the organization, that nobody would be here without LaRouche. They feel justified in a peculiar way doing anything whatsoever." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{system of}} cantillation signs used {{throughout}} the Tanakh {{is replaced by a}} very different system for these three poetic books. [...] Many of the signs may appear the same or similar at first glance, but most of them serve entirely different functions in these three books. [...] (Only a few signs have functions similar to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the rest of the Tanakh.) [...] The short narratives {{at the beginning and end}} of Job use the [...] "regular" [...] system, but the bulk of the book (the poetry) uses the special system. [...] For this reason, these three books are referred to as sifrei emet (Books of Truth), the word emet meaning [...] "truth", but also being an acronym for the first letters of the three books (Iyov, Mishle, Tehillim).|$|E
2500|$|I Love You, Man is {{the third}} {{collaboration}} between Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, following the Judd Apatow projects Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, while writer/director John Hamburg previously worked with Segel on Apatow's Undeclared television series. [...] It only took one lunch to get Segel and Rudd {{to sign on to}} do the film and this set the stage for other actors to sign on. [...] On February 13, 2008 it was announced that Rashida Jones would be in the female lead opposite Rudd. [...] Later, in an interview with firstshowing.net, Jones revealed that because Segel and Rudd were already attached to the project she [...] "knew immediately that it was gonna be even funnier than I would think." [...] At the beginning of the March 31, 2008 week, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Jaime Pressly had joined the film's cast, playing the best friend of Rashida Jones' character. [...] Hamburg comically stated that he was lucky in casting J.K. Simmons because his contract states [...] "he has to be in {{one out of every four}} movies made." [...] Jon Favreau started working on the film the same week Iron Man came out, a film which he directed. He said he [...] "probably wouldn't have agreed to have done it had I known my life was going to be that shape", but Iron Man star Robert Downey, Jr. told him that [...] "It is the best thing you could do" [...] he said 'chop wood, carry water,' which is <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the Kung Fu movies to keep you humble." ...|$|E

Definitions are still in flux, but an encore career typically aims to provide a dose of personal satisfaction by 'giving back.'" [...] Writes Kristof: [...] "If more people take on encore careers… the boomers who arrived on the scene by igniting a sexual revolution could leave by staging a give-back revolution. Boomers may just be remembered more for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> their 60s than for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the Sixties."
