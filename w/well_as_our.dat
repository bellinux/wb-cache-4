25|$|The Romanesque period saw the {{construction}} of major Marian churches, such as Speyer Cathedral (also known as the Mariendom) in Speyer, Germany, and Our Lady of Flanders Cathedral in Tournai, Belgium. From the year 1000 onward more and more churches, including many of Europe's greatest cathedrals were dedicated to Mary. Gothic cathedrals, such as Notre Dame de Paris as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Chartres near Paris, were major masterworks of the time. Construction of Santa Maria Assunta Cathedral in Siena, Italy and Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg {{increased the number of}} churches devoted to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|Feeling or affective {{reaction}} (vedana) {{is also at}} {{the source}} of the emotions and it is categorized in various ways; as physical or mental, as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral; and as rooted in the different senses. The Buddha also makes a distinction between worldly and unworldly or spiritual feelings, seeing spiritual feelings as superior. Out of these basic immediate reactions as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> situational context, conceptualization and personal history arise more complex emotions, such as fear, hatred, hope or despair. The Buddhist theory of emotions also highlights the ethical and spiritual importance of positive emotions such as compassion and friendliness as antidotes for negative emotions and as vehicles for self development.|$|E
25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E

Kieckhefer later played that early report down, when he told the Tahoe Daily Tribune that Nevada did not intend to demand an involuntary payment from Fossett's widow, but that such a payment would be voluntary: [...] "We are going to request that they help offset some of these expenses, considering the scope of the search, the overall cost as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> ongoing budget difficulties."

2500|$|On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell claimed [...] "it is {{difficult}} to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken".

I do not think that we need be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that.

[...] It was also a time in Buechner's life marked by intellectual, spiritual and emotional growth and exploration. [...] Bermuda is therefore central to Buechner's theology as he came to view his deliverance in that enchanting isle [...] "as a gift that implies a giver," [...] an example of that [...] "crazy, holy grace" [...] that sends us experiences not by mere accident of chance but to [...] "open our hearts as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>our</b> eyes." [...] It was in Bermuda that Buechner [...] "caught some bright foreshadowing" [...] of [...] "the secret place of the Most High" [...] that he believed [...] "dwells in all of us as the image of God and in which [...] [...] [...] some part of all of us dwells." [...] This is why, when Buechner's character Rooney in The Final Beast is asked to pick one word to describe the power of Bermuda, she says [...] "life [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] It had the smell of life to me."
