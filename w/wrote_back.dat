5|$|During high school, Barbera {{worked as}} a tailor's {{delivery}} boy. During the Great Depression, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for a magazine called The NY Hits Magazine. He supported himself with {{a job at a}} bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's—the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry. Disney <b>wrote</b> <b>back,</b> saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.|$|E
5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and <b>wrote</b> <b>back,</b> or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} well {{organized}} for defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about capturing it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Goodall, from North Baddesley in Hampshire, {{had been}} a devoted fan of Doctor Who {{since the age of}} two and wrote a letter to Peter Capaldi saying he hoped the actor found success in his new role portraying the Doctor. The Goodall family were all fans of Doctor Who, {{describing}} themselves as Whovians. Thomas decorated his home with objects related to the television series. Capaldi <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> to Thomas thanking him, and sent a note to the child's father saying that he intended to send a video message. Capaldi enclosed guidance to Ross Goodall on how to organise a tour of the production studios for Doctor Who.|$|E
5|$|Thomas's early poetry {{was noted}} for its verbal density, alliteration, sprung rhythm and {{internal}} rhyme, and he was described by some critics as having {{been influenced by the}} English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. This is attributed to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic metre into his work. When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> denying any such influence. One poet Thomas greatly admired, and who is regarded as an influence, was Thomas Hardy. When Thomas travelled in America, he recited Hardy's work in his readings.|$|E
5|$|Between Kimberley and Mafeking, Maund {{learned from}} Shippard that Grobler {{had been killed}} by a group of Ngwato warriors while {{returning}} to the Transvaal, and that the Boers were threatening to attack the British-protected Ngwato chief, Khama III, in response. Maund volunteered to help defend Khama, writing a letter to his employers explaining that doing so might lay the foundations for a concession from Khama covering territory that the Matabele and Ngwato disputed. Cawston tersely <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> with orders to make for Bulawayo without delay, but over a month had passed in the time this written exchange required, and Maund had squandered his head start on Rudd. After ignoring a notice Lobengula had posted at Tati, barring entry to white big-game hunters and concession-seekers, the Rudd party arrived at the king's kraal on 21 September 1888, three weeks ahead of Maund.|$|E

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the impact}} of write {{policies}} and allocation policies on the cache performance. Adding <b>write</b> <b>back</b> to a cache design increases hardware cost, since additional storage for dirty bits is required. Furthermore, <b>write</b> <b>back</b> is not always faster. This paper derives a criterion which allows to check easily whether <b>write</b> <b>back</b> improves {{the performance of a}} given memory system. This is done with the help of extensive cache simulations on a MIPS RISC architecture with SPEC 92 benchmarks as workload...|$|R
5|$|When the war ended, Herring {{wished to}} return to Australia and see Mary before {{resuming}} his studies at the University of Oxford in October 1919. Mary <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> pointing out the impracticality of this idea; while she would be disappointed not to see him, he should remain in England and complete his course at Oxford first. The university had awarded him a wartime Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1915; the Rhodes Scholarship Trust allowed him to resume his scholarship, and he studied for a Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) degree. Since it had been five years since he had been awarded his BA, he was entitled to a MA as well, and graduated with both degrees in July 1920. After a holiday in Britain and France with his sister Kathleen, he arrived back in Melbourne on 26 November 1920.|$|E
25|$|After Stalin's death, Churchill, {{the last}} of the wartime Big Three, wrote to Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had just assumed office as US President, on 11 March proposing a summit meeting with the Soviets; Eisenhower <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> pouring cold water on the {{suggestions}} as the Soviets might use it for propaganda.|$|E
25|$|Gutter Ballet was an {{unpublished}} Broadway project Paul O'Neill <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> in 1979. In 1989, Savatage {{already used}} this title for their previous album {{but decided to}} focus their next release, , on it. Trans-Siberian Orchestra reprised, in recent years, the idea to release a Gutter Ballet musical close to O'Neill original script featuring Savatage's music as well.|$|E
50|$|In case of Firefly, cache-to-cache {{transfers}} of modified blocks are also <b>written</b> <b>back</b> to main memory {{at the same}} time. But since accesses made to the main memory are slower by orders of magnitude when compared to caches, it requires added complexity of performing a <b>write</b> <b>back</b> as a separate bus operation. In any case, it results in lower performance. This problem is avoided altogether in case of Dragon protocol, since the shared blocks are not <b>written</b> <b>back</b> to memory at all. However, this comes {{at the cost of}} one added state (Shared-Dirty).|$|R

25|$|In 1924, Erika Mitterer {{began writing}} poems to Rilke, who <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> with {{approximately}} fifty poems {{of his own}} and called her verse a Herzlandschaft (landscape of the heart). This was the only time Rilke had a productive poetic collaboration throughout all his work. Mitterer also visited Rilke. In 1950, her “Correspondence in Verse” with Rilke was published, and received much praise.|$|E
25|$|While {{in custody}} Arklöv {{received}} several letters from another Neo-Nazi, Tony Olsson, who was {{starting a new}} neonazi organisation and, impressed by Arklöv's war experience, wanted him to join. Arklöv <b>wrote</b> <b>back,</b> and the two became friends. After being released, Arklöv and Olsson met with {{the other members of}} the newly started NRA (Nationalistiska Republikanska Armén, the Nationalistic Republican Army), among them Andreas Axelsson and Mats Nilsson.|$|E

Her coverage of future matches led her becoming an avid fan of the sport.|$|E

Gissendaner developed a relationship with Jurgen Moltmann {{while she was in}} prison. Gissendaner sent Moltmann a paper that she had written on Bonhoeffer. He was impressed with her paper, and he <b>wrote</b> <b>back.</b> After that, the two became penpals exchanging letters about theology and faith. Gissendaner completed a theological degree program through Emory University.|$|E
25|$|At age 19, Bell wrote {{a report}} on his work {{and sent it to}} philologist Alexander Ellis, a {{colleague}} of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in Pygmalion). Ellis immediately <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of Hermann von Helmholtz's work, The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of 1950, Shastriji Maharaj wrote several letters to 28-year-old Shastri Narayanswarupdas expressing his wish to appoint him the {{president}} of the organization. Twice Shastri Narayanswarupdas <b>wrote</b> <b>back</b> respectfully declining, citing his young age and inexperience, and the presence of many senior sadhus who would be more suited to the responsibility. Shastriji Maharaj continued to insist, sending several senior devotees to convince Shastri Narayanswarupdas. Perceiving it to be his guru’s inner wish, Shastri Narayanswarupdas ultimately acquiesced.|$|E

Hall finished in 2 hours and 58 minutes, paving the way for the wheelchair division.|$|E
25|$|It was Thomas' {{position}} as a conscientious objector which drew him to the Socialist Party of America (SPA), a staunchly antimilitarist organization. When SPA leader Morris Hillquit made his campaign for Mayor of New York in 1917 on an anti-war platform, Thomas wrote to him expressing his good wishes. To his surprise, Hillquit <b>wrote</b> <b>back,</b> encouraging the young minister to work for his campaign, which Thomas energetically did. Soon thereafter he himself joined the Socialist Party. Thomas was a Christian socialist.|$|E
