50|$|Once these {{posts and}} bracing have been erected, the wire is wrapped around one corner post, held with a hitch (a timber hitch {{works well for}} this) often using a staple to hold the height and then reeled out along the span of the fence {{replacing}} the role every 400 m. It is then wrapped around the opposite corner post, pulled tightly with <b>wire</b> <b>stretchers,</b> and sometimes nailed with more fence staples, although this may make readjustment of tension or replacement of the wire more difficult. Then it is attached {{to all of the}} line posts with fencing staples driven in partially to allow stretching of the wire.|$|R
50|$|The farm proved {{difficult}} for the family to manage. In 1857, William Wallace Marsh began to expierment with grain bundling methods. Marsh discovered he could bind grain while another was being cut if the cutting apparatus could move. His brother, Charles W., joined the effort the next day. For the next few years, the brothers worked together to perfect their harvester. In 1859, the Marsh brothers unveiled the completed product during a reaping contest north of DeKalb. The success of the Marsh's design was owed {{to the fact that}} anyone could use the implementâ€”during demonstration, the Marshes had young girls and hoboes operate the machine with ease. The Marsh design was deemed the most effective reaper, and the brothers set to manufacture the product.Marsh Brothers was founded in 1858. William Marsh was the inventor of the company while his brother Charles handled the financial aspects. Marsh's inventions were responsible for thirty-five approved patents, expanding the company line with products such as corn huskers, <b>wire</b> <b>stretchers,</b> and plows. The first company factory was opened in Plano, where they met prominent settler Lewis Steward, who invested in the company. Oringially capable of producing 100 harvesters in a year, Steward's capital allowed the company to expand to 10,000 per year. The produced their goods essentially unrivaled until 1871. Marsh married M. J. Smith on January 8, 1871. Marsh, Steward & Company moved to Sycamore in 1873. Marsh was elected alderman of Sycamore that year, a position he held for decades. Two years later, William Deering purchased the company and moved most of its operations to North Chicago. It merged with the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in 1902 to form International Harvester.|$|R
