40|$|Optical {{detection}} of wear and defects in an electro-supply network shows promise for railways and other electrically powered vehicles. One of many important railroadmaintenance tasks is the inspec-tion {{of the condition}} of the contact wire that supplies electricity to a train. Over long periods of operation the <b>wire</b> <b>deteriorates,</b> and these changes in its shape must be monitored. But measure-ment is tricky because the wire is always live, carrying up to several tens of kilovolts. A suitable system must permit evalua-tion of the height of the wire with a margin of error no greater than 0. 2 mm, and while the train is moving. Optical methods have proven useful for many industrial chores, and among the most promising is so-called shadow analysis. 1 However, this approach has the disadvantage that ge-ometric information is lost in obtaining shadows from opaque concave objects. Here we describe a method using structure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFuji Photo Film Co Ltd and Fuji Xerox Co Ltd have co-developed a {{high-speed}} optical transmission Lumistar system, capable of transmission {{at more than}} 1 Gbps without deterioration in output signal quality due to the graded-index distribution of refractive-index within the fibre. Combining optical transceiver module with VCSEL, high-speed transmitter and receiver developed by Fuji Xerox Co Ltd with the optical lens module developed by Fuji Photo Optical Co Ltd, the system realises some 100, 000 h of network build. The system links large flat panel displays such as plasma TV, large-size LC TVt, and projectors with tuners. Conventional electric <b>wires</b> <b>deteriorate</b> the quality of an electric signal along their distance, {{making it difficult to}} establish a link of 10 m or longer. Lumistar enables an optical link of 30 m and is suitable for application fields such as event sites, amusement facilities, commercial establishments, security facilities, hotels, and service areas.

40|$|New {{services}} like Video on demand/Internet Protocol Television, Voice over IP and high speed Internet access demand very high bandwidth to provide Triple Play {{services to the}} customers. The ADSL/ADLS 2 + and the VDSL/VDSL 2 copper- <b>wire</b> technologies <b>deteriorate</b> quickly with the distance and will be soon obsolete for supporting the ultra-high bandwidth requirements of the next future. One suitable long term solution for such a high bandwidth demand is employing optical fibers to customers premises (FTTH). In particular, two optical distribution network architectu res, GPON (gigabit passive optical network) and EP 2 P (E thernet point-to-point), are competing for the network access segment. This paper surveys the two technologies and evalua tes them from a quantitative techno-economic point of view, tr ying to identify which market scenarios are best served by EP 2 P and which are best served by GPON architectures for supporting the requirement of Triple Play applications.

40|$|A {{description}} of lifetime shock tests on tantalum and tungsten is given and of modelling studies {{as part of}} the research into solid targets for a Neutrino Factory. A fast high current pulse is applied to a thin wire of the sample material and the number of pulses measured before the <b>wire</b> visibly <b>deteriorates.</b> These measurements are made at temperatures up to ∼ 2000 K. The stress on the wire is calculated and compared to the stress expected in the target using the computer code LS-DYNA. It has been found that tantalum is too weak to sustain prolonged stress at these temperatures but a tungsten wire has reached over 13 million pulses (equivalent to 10 years of operation) at the stress expected in the target. Further work is in progress to study graphite and other materials. Measurement of the surface acceleration of the wire using a VISAR are to be made, which, combined with LS-DYNA modelling, will allow the evaluation of the constitutive equations of state of the materials at high temperature and provide a more accurate model of the stresses in a number of target geometries...|$|R

30|$|With the {{increasing}} railway vehicle speed, pantograph–catenary (PAC) system {{has become an}} important part as its incidents still stand among the principal causes of railway traffic interruption. Indeed, when a rail vehicle moves, the pantograph should constantly press against {{the underside of the}} catenary. Nonetheless, it is difficult to get around the complexity of the physical interaction between the pantograph and the contact <b>wire,</b> which could <b>deteriorate</b> the quality of the electricity transfer. Thus, PAC system performances could dramatically be reduced because of bad current collection. Therefore, in this paper, we present an output feedback solution in order to design an active control of PAC system. The proposed solution is based on the backstepping control and an adaptive observer that estimates both the (unknown) catenary parameters and the system state. All synthesis steps are given and the closed-loop analysis shows asymptotic tracking behavior regardless of the time-varying catenary stiffness. Furthermore, a numerical example shows that the PAC contact can be regulated with desired effect.|$|R

The paper describes the satisfactory results achieved with the system, showing that the isolation and energization of shield <b>wires</b> does not <b>deteriorate</b> the lightning performance of transmission lines and that the use of the ground as a phase conductor of the three-phase medium voltage system does not introduce touch and step voltages greater than the tolerable values. Comparisons between the operational performances of the SWL technology, 34. 5 kV lines and thermal power plants found in the same region are also presented. The results demonstrate the technical and economical viability of the SWL technology and show that with its application investments can be postponed. ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Safety {{concerns}} about wiring systems in airplanes {{were brought to}} the forefront of public attention by a midair explosion in 1996 involving a 747 airplane. Ignition of flammable vapors in the fuel tank was the probable cause of that fatal accident, and the most likely source was a wiring failure that allowed a spark to enter the fuel tank. All 230 people aboard the airplane were killed. Two years later, an MD-11 airplane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 229 people aboard. Although an exact cause could not be determined, the presence of re-solidified copper on a portion of a wire of the in-flight entertainment system cable indicated that wire arcing had occurred in the area where the fire most likely originated.Investigations of those accidents and later examinations of other airplanes showed a collection of common problems. <b>Deteriorated</b> <b>wiring,</b> corrosion, improper wire installation and repairs, and contamination of wire bundles with metal shavings, dust, and fluids (which would provide fuel for fire) were common conditions in representative examples of the ‘‘aging fleet of transport airplanes.’’ [...] " ...|$|R
40|$|Electroformation of cell-sized lipid {{membrane}} vesicles (giant vesicles, GVs), from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, was examined varying {{the shape of}} the counter electrode. Instead of a planar ITO (indium tin oxide) electrode commonly used, platinum wire mesh was employed as a counter electrode facing lipid deposit on a planar formation electrode. The modification did not significantly alter GV formation, and many GVs of 30 – 50 µm, some as large as 100 µm, formed as with the standard setup, indicating that a counter electrode {{does not have to be}} a complete plane. When the counter electrode was reduced to a set of two parallel platinum <b>wires,</b> GV formation <b>deteriorated.</b> Some GVs formed, but only in close proximity to the counter electrode. Lower electric voltage with this setup no longer yielded GVs. Instead, a large onion-like multilamellar structure was observed. The deteriorated GV formation and the formation of a multilamellar structure seemed to indicate the weakened effect of the electric field on lipid deposit due to insufficient coverage with a small counter electrode. Irregular membranous objects formed by spontaneous swelling of lipid without electric voltage gradually turned into multilamellar structure upon following application of voltage. No particular enhancement of GV formation was observed when lipid deposit on a wire formation electrode was used in combination with a large planar counter electrode...|$|R
40|$|The Navy is {{experiencing}} a severe aircraft electrical wiring maintenance problem {{as a result of}} the extensive use of an aromatic polyimide insulation that is deteriorating at a rate that was unexpected when this wire was initially selected. This problem has significantly affected readiness, reliability, and safety and has greatly increased the cost of ownership of Naval aircraft. Failures in wire harnesses have exhibited arcing and burning that will propagate drastically, to the interruption of many electrical circuits from a fault initiated by the failure of <b>deteriorating</b> <b>wires.</b> There is an urgent need for a capability to schedule aircraft rewiring in an orderly manner with a logically derived determination of which aircraft have aged to the point of absolute necessity. Excessive maintenance was demonstrated to result from the accelerated aging due to the parameters of moisture, temperature, and strain that exist in the Naval Aircraft environment. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that MIL-W- 81381 wire insulation when aged at high humidities followed the classical Arrhenius thermal aging relationship. In an extension of the project a multifactor formula was developed that is now capable of predicting life under varying conditions of these service parameters. An automated test system has also been developed to analyze the degree of deterioration that has occurred in wires taken from an aircraft in order to obtain an assessment of remaining life. Since it is both physically and financially impossible to replace the wiring in all the Navy's aircraft at once, this system will permit expedient scheduling so that those aircraft that are most probable to have wiring failure problems can be overhauled first...|$|R
