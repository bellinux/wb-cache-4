5|$|Monarch {{remained}} at Cattaro {{for the rest}} of the war to deter any further attacks. The ship's crew joined in the Cattaro Mutiny in early February 1918. Six weeks later she became an accommodation ship for the submarine crews based at nearby Gjenovic. Monarch was handed over to Great Britain as <b>war</b> <b>reparations</b> in January 1920 and broken up for scrap in Italy in 1921.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Nürnberg {{was seized}} by the Royal Navy and {{ultimately}} awarded to the Soviet Union as <b>war</b> <b>reparations.</b> In December 1945, a Soviet crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to Tallinn, where she was renamed Admiral Makarov. She served in the Soviet Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. By 1960, she had been broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy as <b>war</b> <b>reparations,</b> and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I in November 1918, {{the members}} of the Erzherzog Karl class were first taken over by Yugoslavia in 1919, but Erzherzog Karl and Erzherzog Friedrich were then ceded as <b>war</b> <b>reparations</b> to France. The {{remaining}} battleship, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, was ceded to the United Kingdom. However, Erzherzog Karl ran aground at Bizerte on her voyage to Toulon and was eventually broken up in situ.

5|$|Napoleon's campaigns {{acquired}} Italian {{pieces by}} treaties, as <b>war</b> <b>reparations,</b> and Northern European pieces as spoils {{as well as}} some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though {{the vast majority of the}} latter were seized as <b>war</b> <b>reparations</b> by the British army and are now part of collections of the British Museum. On the other hand, the Dendera zodiac is, like the Rosetta stone, claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return. The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via UNESCO's Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin. The museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes (30cm x 15cm each) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008, eight to five years after their good-faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect of the procedure of déclassement from French public collections before the Commission scientifique nationale des collections des musées de France.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} boats, only U-16 was sunk during the war, shortly after sinking Nembo. The only other {{casualty}} among the class involved U-10, which hit a mine near Caorle and was beached with heavy damage. Although she was looted by Austro-Hungarian Army troops, she was later towed to Trieste for repairs which remained incomplete at the war's end. After {{the end of}} fighting in November 1918, the four surviving class members—U-10, U-11, U-15, and U-17—were all turned over to Italy as <b>war</b> <b>reparations</b> and scrapped at Pola by 1920.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{formally}} transferred {{ownership of}} the vessel to the Turkish government on 2 November. According {{to the terms of}} the Treaty of Sèvres between the Ottoman Empire and the Western Allies, Yavuz was to have been handed over to the Royal Navy as <b>war</b> <b>reparations.</b> After the Turkish War of Independence, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the Treaty of Sèvres was discarded, and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in its place in 1923. Under this treaty, the new Turkish republic regained possession of much its fleet, including Yavuz.|$|E

She served in the Soviet Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. Her ultimate fate is unclear, but by 1960, she had been broken up for scrap. Nürnberg was the second-largest warship of the Kriegsmarine to survive the war intact, after the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, and she was the only vessel to see service after the war, albeit in a foreign navy.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the {{decision}} of Potawatomi leaders to aid the U.S. during the war, American officials did not seize tribal land as <b>war</b> <b>reparations.</b> Instead, only three individuals accused of leading the Indian Creek massacre were tried in court; they were acquitted. Nevertheless, the drive to purchase Potawatomi land west of the Mississippi began in October 1832, when commissioners in Indiana bought {{a large amount of}} Potawatomi land, even though not all Potawatomi bands were represented at the treaty. The tribe was compelled to sell their remaining land west of the Mississippi in a treaty held in Chicago in September 1833.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{deterioration}} of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and Paul von Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees. He appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor. Goebbels {{took charge of the}} NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required <b>war</b> <b>reparations</b> that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{served as}} a unit in the I Division, I Battle Squadron {{alongside}} the Nassau-class ships in the II Division of the I Battle Squadron. They saw combat during World War I, including the Battle of Jutland in the North Sea and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic. All four survived the war, but were not taken {{as part of the}} German fleet that was interned at Scapa Flow. After the German fleet at Scapa Flow were scuttled, the four Helgolands were ceded as <b>war</b> <b>reparations</b> to the victorious Allied powers in the sunken ships' stead. Ostfriesland was taken by the US Navy and expended as a target during Billy Mitchell's air power demonstration in July 1921. Helgoland and Oldenburg were allotted to Britain and Japan respectively, and broken up in 1921. Thüringen was delivered to France in 1920, and was used as a target ship for the French navy. The ship was eventually broken up between 1923 and 1933.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} refit in Germany, she {{returned}} to France in early 1941 where she escorted returning warships, commerce raiders, and supply ships through the Bay of Biscay for several months. After her refit was completed, Steinbrinck was transferred to Northern Norway in 1942 where she participated in several minor operations before she was damaged running aground and forced to return to Germany for repairs. The ship returned to Norway in mid-1943 where she escorted German capital ships as they moved between Norway and Germany and participated in the German attack (Operation Zitronella) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle. Steinbrinck was ordered home in November to begin a lengthy refit, during which she was badly damaged by Allied bombs, and was unserviceable {{for the rest of}} the war. She was turned over to the Soviet Union after the war as <b>war</b> <b>reparations</b> and only served a few years before she was converted into a training ship and then a barracks ship before being sold for scrap in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grunwald, First Battle of Tannenberg or Battle of Žalgiris, {{was fought}} on 15 July 1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The {{alliance}} of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila) and Grand Duke Vytautas, decisively defeated the German–Prussian Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Knights' leadership {{were killed or}} taken prisoner. Although defeated, the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege of their fortress in Marienburg (Malbork) and suffered minimal territorial losses at the Peace of Thorn (1411) (Toruń), with other territorial disputes continuing until the Peace of Melno in 1422. The knights, however, would never recover their former power, and the financial burden of <b>war</b> <b>reparations</b> caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands under their control. The battle shifted {{the balance of power}} in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish–Lithuanian union as the dominant political and military force in the region.|$|E

5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} Mekong Delta landowner, Thơ rose through the ranks as a {{low-profile}} provincial chief under French colonial rule, and he was briefly imprisoned by Imperial Japan when they invaded and deposed the French during World War II. During this time he met Minh {{for the first time}} as they shared a cell. Following World War II, he became the Interior Minister in the French-backed State of Vietnam, an associated state in the French Union. After the establishment of the Republic of Vietnam following the partition, Thơ was sent to Japan as ambassador and secured <b>war</b> <b>reparations.</b> Recalled to Vietnam within a year, he helped to dismantle the private armies of the Hòa Hảo religious sect in the mid-1950s. Tho led the political efforts to weaken the Hòa Hảo leadership. While Minh led the military effort, Thơ tried to buy off Hòa Hảo leaders. One commander, Ba Cụt, was personally hostile to Thơ, whose father had confiscated the land of Ba Cụt's family decades earlier. The stand-off could not be ended peacefully in this case, and Ba Cụt was captured and executed.|$|E
