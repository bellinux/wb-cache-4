The limb deformities were discovered from the mediolateral and craniocaulal images of the preoperative radiographs.

After fixation of the wires to the ring radial osteotomy was performed. Deformations were corrected immediately in two case and progressively in eight cases.

The thesis presents the research work associated with the quest for practical solutions to a generic problem: the correct operation of a fallible system. The work covers three distinct areas: modelling of the demonstrator, design and construction of a physical system, and evoiution of algorithms for control of the demonstrator in practice in the presence of sensor faults, using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). The third area forms the core of the thesis. The key challenges in creating the virtual environment to train for generic sensor fault tolerant algorithms are considered and addressed. The evolved algorithms are analysed and then verified using the demonstrator in practice. The practical results showed that sensor fault tolerant control was successfully achieved. ...|$|E

Fault tolerance in general requires redundancy, so we start with a redundant structure which is a superset of the entire family of prefix adders with fanout-of- 2 and then prune the redundant structure accordingly for the defect-free initial state or for when defects occur. In addition to the traditional prefix adders (Kogge-Stone, Han-Carlson, Brent-Kung) our taxonomy proposes several new variations that are equivalent in performance and complexity to the traditional structures, yet can mask different sets of faults.

40|$|As {{chip size}} and design density increase, {{coupling}} effects (crosstalk) between signal wires become increasingly critical to on–chip timing and even functionality. A method {{is presented to}} analyze crosstalk while taking into account timing relationship and timing criticality between coupling wires. The method {{is based upon the}} geometrical layout of the wires (adjacency), the signal slopes on the wires (circuit driving capability) and timing considerations. Based on these wire characteristics, a pattern driven routing tool imbeds the crosstalk critical nets in non-adjacent <b>wiring</b> <b>tracks</b> for crosstalk avoidance. The pattern driven routing capability may also be used for rerouting crosstalk critical nets of an already existing routing for crosstalk reduction. The crosstalk analysis and the routing tool described in this paper were used in three generations of VLSI processor chip designs for IBM’s S/ 390 computers, always resulting in crosstalk-resistant hard-ware. ...|$|R

The <b>wire's</b> <b>track</b> will refill as soon as pressure is relieved, so the ice block will remain solid even after wire passes completely through.

A long-standing open question for both FPGAs and channelled gate arrays {{is whether or not}} some uneven distribution of routing tracks across the chip would lead to an area benefit.

In this paper we determine the relative area-efficiency of several different routing track distributions. We first investigate FPGAs in which horizontal and vertical channels contain different numbers of tracks in order to determine if such a directional bias provides a density advantage.
