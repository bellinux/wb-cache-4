5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a consensus that the region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World <b>wine</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the <b>wine</b> <b>market.</b> In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the <b>wine</b> <b>market.</b> The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine. It {{can be in the}} eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 15th century, several factors came into play that had a major impact on the global <b>wine</b> <b>market.</b> The Venetian traders were losing their supply of sweet wine from the lands of Cyprus, Greece, Romania and Hungary to the {{emerging}} dominance of the Ottoman Empire. War with France had lost the English their access to the wines of Bordeaux. Seeing an opportunity to capitalize on this, the Spanish Duke of Medina Sidonia made several moves to put Sherry into the forefront of the world's <b>wine</b> <b>market.</b> In 1491, the export tax on wine was abolished for both Spanish and foreign vessels coming into Sanlúcar. In 1517, English merchants were given preferential merchant status-including {{the right to bear arms}} in the region.|$|E

25|$|Investment in {{fine wine}} has {{attracted}} {{those who take}} advantage of their victims' relative ignorance of this <b>wine</b> <b>market</b> sector.

25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, the Amarone wines of Valpolicella {{experienced}} {{a spike in}} popularity on the world's <b>wine</b> <b>market.</b> Production of Amarone jumped from 522,320 US gallons (19,772 hectoliters) in 1972 to 1.2 million gallons (46,500 hl) by 1990. By 2000 Amarone production grew to over 3.9 million (148,000 hl). By this point, the price for grapes destined for Amarone production was nearly three times higher than what a comparable quantity of grapes would fetch for basic Valpolicella production. This sparked renewed interest in planting vineyards in the high altitude hillside locations that produced lower yields of grapes better suited for Amarone production. In the 21st century, the reputation of Valpolicella wines continued to expand on the world's <b>wine</b> <b>market,</b> as ambitious winemakers began to invest more in advanced viticultural and winemaking techniques that produce higher quality wines. In 2003, the DOC regulations were adjusted to eliminate mandatory blending requirements for sub-quality grapes such as Molinara. At the end of 2009, the production of both Amarone and recioto dessert wines in the Valpolicella zone received Italy's highest quality wine designation as a DOCG zones.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{the region}} {{experienced}} a renaissance highlighted with a substantial jump in quality wine production. With {{the price of}} Burgundy wine steadily escalating, the Côte Chalonnaise developed a reputation for consistent quality for lower cost {{than some of the}} more well known villages of Burgundy. This led to a sharp increase in the price of wines from the Côte Chalonnaise which brought an influx of investment and money to the region. By the early 21st century, the prices on the <b>wine</b> <b>market</b> were beginning to experience some market correction.|$|E
25|$|The first Valpolicella {{producer}} to commercially {{market a}} ripasso wine was Masi {{in the early}} 1980s. When the style first became popular in the late 20th century, it was rarely noted on the wine label. There was also debate about whether it was even permitted to be included under DOC regulations. If it was mentioned at all it was relegated to the back label wine description notes. Today the term ripasso is freely permitted to be used, with several examples on the <b>wine</b> <b>market</b> labeled as being made in the ripasso style. In late 2009, Ripasso della Valpolicella received its own DOC designation.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Portuguese wine has been {{influenced}} by Portugal's relative isolationism in the world's <b>wine</b> <b>market,</b> with the one notable exception of {{its relationship with the}} British. Wine has been made in Portugal since at least 2000 BC when the Tartessians planted vines in the Sado and Tagus valleys. By the 10th century BC, the Phoenicians had arrived and introduced new grape varieties and winemaking techniques to the area. Up until this point, viticulture was mostly centered on the southern coastal areas of Portugal. In later centuries, the Ancient Greeks, Celts and Romans would do much to spread viticulture and winemaking further north.|$|E
25|$|By the 20th century, Muscadet {{began to}} fall out of favor in the global <b>wine</b> <b>market</b> and earned a {{reputation}} for being homogenous and simple. The late 20th century saw a revival in the Muscadet region as ambitious wine producers experimented with new winemaking techniques aimed at bringing out more flavor and complexity in the wine. The 1980s saw a rise in use of oak barrel fermentation and lees stirring while the 1990s introduced the widespread use of extended skin-contact (maceration) prior to fermentation. By the 20th century, the use of these techniques created a wide range of styles and quality of Muscadet wine.|$|E
25|$|The company {{banned the}} use of {{elderberry}} juice and other adulterants, {{going so far as}} to mandate that all elderberry trees in the Douro be ripped out. The use of manure as fertilizer was prohibited, which served the benefit of limiting yields that would not only flood the market with over supply but also produce lower quality grapes. The Douro Wine Company further demarcated and classified the production of Port vineyards into two broad categories. The highest rated vineyards were designated as feitoria and were destined for the important British <b>wine</b> <b>market</b> and northern Europe. The remaining vineyards were designated as ramo and used for domestic consumption as well as export to the Portuguese colony of Brazil.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the end of}} Apartheid and {{the opening}} of export markets, the South African wine {{industry}} had a substantial learning curve to overcome in order to be competitive on the world's <b>wine</b> <b>market.</b> The Vine Improvement Programme (VIP) was established to bring modern viticultural understanding to the industry. The first phase launched in the late 20th century focused on virus-free and yield controlling rootstock as well as clonal research. The second phase, which is ongoing, focuses on matching up various combinations of grape varieties, clones and rootstock to specific terroir that can produce quality wine. Over the last 20+ years, the work of the VIP has brought the South African wine industry to the forefront of viticultural advances.|$|E
25|$|For centuries afterwards, Portuguese wines {{came to be}} {{associated}} with Port (and to some extent Madeira which was a popular drink of British colonies around the globe, such as the American colonies.) In the mid-to-late 20th century, sweet, slightly sparkling rosé brands from Portugal (Mateus and Lancers being the most notable) became immensely popular around the globe-with the British <b>wine</b> <b>market</b> again leading the way. In the mid-1980s, Portugal's introduction to the European Union brought a flood of financing and grants to the stagnant Portuguese wine industry. These new investments paved the way for upgrades in winemaking technology and facilities. Renewed interest in the abundance of unique Portuguese wine grape varieties shifted focus to more premium wine production with a portfolio of unique dry red and white wines being marketed on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Rioja wine {{reflects}} {{a long and}} varied winemaking tradition in the Spanish region of La Rioja, starting with the first Phoenician settlers in 11th century BC. As with many of Europe's most well known wine regions, the Ancient Romans founded many of the Rioja vineyards. Throughout the Middle Ages, pilgrims to the shrine of St. James at Santiago de Compostela passed through the region and carried back with them the reputation of wines from the area. The phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century was a major catalyst in the expansion and modernization of the Rioja wine industry, with the devastation the French wine industry both opening up the French <b>wine</b> <b>market</b> and bringing an influx of French investment into the region. Today, together with Sherry, Rioja is the most internationally recognized of all Spanish wines.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{conceptual}} model that examines wine channels typified by differing levels of service orientation, and resulting branding implications based on consumer involvement and value co‐creation properties. Examples of channels characterised by relatively low levels of organisational service provision include supermarket retailing, while higher levels of service orientation are found in channels such as restaurants and wine tourism. The model thus provides a framework for analysis of wine branding across distribution channels characterised by differing levels of service orientation. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review addressing service provision in <b>wine</b> <b>marketing,</b> consumer involvement and needs, value co‐creation and branding is proposed in the paper. Findings – An integrative conceptual model and associated research issues are derived from a review of relevant literature. Research implications – The paper provides a research agenda for involvement‐based wine branding across more traditional, external marketing‐oriented channels (e. g. supermarket retailing) and emerging, more interactive/relational <b>wine</b> <b>marketing</b> service sectors (e. g. restaurateurs, tourism).
