5|$|Risks to {{internal}} security: According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main {{danger of the}} proposal rested in massive transfer of now legal firearms into illegality, with up {{to hundreds of thousands}} of legal firearms entering black market. While the original Commission proposal <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E

The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica. The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony's population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of the film adaptation from Nichols, Ben Stiller joined the project and signed a two-picture directing deal with Savoy. He spent nine months working on the script with Smith. During preproduction, however, Stiller had a falling out with Savoy over budget disputes—among them was how the studio's reported $4 million offer to Nicolas Cage <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the film’s budget. Unable to secure financing from another studio, Stiller left the production.|$|E

50|$|CBP anticipates opening new preclearance {{stations}} {{over the}} next several years and can do so under current law, so we estimate that implementing the bill <b>would</b> not significantly <b>affect</b> agency spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also expects that implementing the bill’s requirements related to aviation security <b>would</b> not significantly <b>affect</b> federal costs. Enacting the legislation <b>would</b> not <b>affect</b> direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south. General Văn Tiến Dũng, PAVN chief of staff, and Defence Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp strongly urged the resumption of conventional military operations, warning that increasing passivity <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> {{the morale of the}} army. Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital resources needed for reconstruction in the north.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the century, the {{political}} climate in Europe was feverish: the War of the League of Cambrai had begun. The French, under Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, had sacked Brescia in 1512, the town now in ruins and the myth of Brixia magnipotens shattered. A lively era of humanism and trade was ended, a phenomenon that <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the rest of the peninsula in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E

The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway.

5|$|A 2004 study {{into the}} effect of The Daily Show on viewers' attitudes found that {{participants}} had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media. Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state {{that it is not}} clear how such cynicism <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.|$|E
