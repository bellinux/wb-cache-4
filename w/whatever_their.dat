5|$|Since the {{collapse}} of Eastern European communist regimes in 1989–1990 and {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union in 1991, the CPC has emphasized its party-to-party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining socialist states. While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling communist parties around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of one-party states (<b>whatever</b> <b>their</b> ideology), dominant parties in democratic systems (<b>whatever</b> <b>their</b> ideology), and social democratic parties.|$|E

Experiments have yielded mixed results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human clinical trials. <b>Whatever</b> <b>their</b> future therapeutic potential, stem cells are already a valuable tool for studying Huntington's disease in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 1901, George {{was created}} Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester. King Edward wished to prepare his son for his future role as king. In {{contrast}} to Edward himself, whom Queen Victoria had deliberately excluded from state affairs, George was given wide access to state documents by his father. George in turn allowed his wife {{access to his}} papers, as he valued her counsel and she often helped write her husband's speeches. As Prince of Wales, George supported reforms in naval training, including cadets being enrolled at the ages of twelve and thirteen, and receiving the same education, <b>whatever</b> <b>their</b> class and eventual assignments. The reforms were implemented by the then Second (later First) Sea Lord, Jacky Fisher.|$|E

5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. <b>Whatever</b> <b>their</b> mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} hoplites is {{accepted}} as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 hoplites at the Battle of Marathon. Some historians {{have accepted the}} number of light troops and used them as a population census of Greece at the time. Certainly these numbers are theoretically possible. Athens, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at Salamis, manned by approximately 36,000 rowers and fighters. Thus 69,500 light troops {{could easily have been}} sent to Plataea. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, especially in view of the ratio of seven helots to one Spartiate. For instance, Lazenby accepts that hoplites from other Greek cities might have been accompanied by one lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of seven helots per Spartiate. He further speculates that each Spartiate was accompanied by one armed helot, and that the remaining helots were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army. Both Lazenby and Holland deem the lightly armed troops, <b>whatever</b> <b>their</b> number, as essentially irrelevant to the outcome of battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Namib Desert Horse is unclear, though several {{theories}} have been put forward. Genetic tests have been performed, although none to date have completely verified their origin. The most likely ancestors of the horses are a mix of riding horses and cavalry horses, many from German breeding programs, released from various farms and camps in the early 20th century, especially during World War I. <b>Whatever</b> <b>their</b> origin, the horses eventually congregated in the Garub Plains, near Aus, Namibia, {{the location of a}} man-made water source. They were generally ignored by humans, except for the periodic threat of eradication due to the possibility that they were destroying native herbivore habitat, until the 1980s. In 1984, the first aerial survey of the population was made, and in 1986, their traditional grazing land was incorporated into the Namib-Naukluft Park. At several points, some horses have been removed from the herd, including the removal and sale of over one-third of the population in 1992. Since the early 1990s, close records of the population have been kept, and studies have been performed to determine the horses' effect on their environment. Despite being considered an exotic species within the park, they are allowed to remain due to their ties to the country's history and draw as a tourist attraction.|$|E

25|$|The lobster-pot traps of Genlisea are {{difficult}} to interpret.
