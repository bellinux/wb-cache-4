500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> was writing that book." ...|$|E
500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had something in reserve.|$|E
60|$|Yet what {{followed}} enchained my attention so deeply that I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> remained.|$|E
60|$|MARION. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> like her. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> that <b>I</b> {{have met}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{is a good}} {{all-around}} fellow," [...] {{answered the}} ranch owner. [...] "I <b>am</b> mighty <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> have him,--and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> got rid of that Hank Snogger," [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|She went on, [...] "I {{kissed his}} horse's nose, {{and he said}} I did that because it was his horse. How could he know? When I {{asked him how he}} knew, he kissed me, and I pretended to be angry and ran away. But I was not angry, and I said to myself, 'I <b>am</b> <b>glad,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad!' ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had {{not been}} too impetuous. My reply evidently pleased her. She chuckled all over.|$|E
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{had sent}} that cable to his mother. I {{was going to}} need her. The thing had got beyond me.|$|E
60|$|He {{was indeed}} an {{exceptionally}} inefficient captain. On the whole I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had come {{even at the}} eleventh hour to see to things.|$|E
60|$|THE FEMALE FIGURE [collapsing] I <b>am</b> dying. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{afraid to}} live.|$|R
60|$|HARRY. <b>I</b> thought you'd <b>be</b> <b>glad.</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{want to say}} {{anything}} till it was settled.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will? Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad.</b> <b>I</b> thought—you—you <b>were</b> too fond—. But you're not—of {{yourself}} I meant. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so <b>glad.</b> Yes—do marry!" ...|$|R
60|$|They {{left and}} I <b>was</b> <b>glad.</b> <b>I</b> {{did not care}} whither they went, so they went. I was willing they should visit Welch, and the sooner the better.|$|E
60|$|Anyway, I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> was not dead, for {{now that}} all was over I trembled and felt afraid, which I had never done during the fighting, even when my hour seemed very near.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm {{sorry to}} say I haven't," [...] he replied, simply. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> didn't have to leave a {{sweetheart}} behind, when I went to France. But it wouldn't be so bad to have one {{to go back to}} now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> have come,' said Mr Pecksniff, 'if I {{can be of}} service. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> have come. What is the matter, Mrs Lupin?' ...|$|R
60|$|Sir John. O ho, then {{it seems}} the cudgelling and turning away were pure invention; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> fell in with you," [...] was the Englishman's reply. [...] "'Twould {{have been}} mighty lonely without you, don't you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. When you {{are dead}} you're not there, you know. Our bodies are but {{senseless}} clay." [...] I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> remembered that line. I {{tried to think}} of the next one, which was about food for worms; but it evaded me.|$|E
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{was not his}} lawyer. I re-read the correspondence, {{notably the}} letter which {{recommended}} him--almost tenderly, I fancied--to build a fourteen-foot brick wall {{at the end of}} his garden, and half-way through it a thought struck me which filled me with pure joy.|$|E
60|$|Down {{went the}} bright gold head upon dimpled, clasped {{hands on the}} table. Such a {{beautiful}} April storm! Unrestrainedly she sobbed. I wished I could have comforted her. But I was not George. And I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> was not Hiram--and yet I was sorry, too.|$|E
60|$|CHR. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{have with}} me a merciful brother; but we must not stand thus: let us try to go back again.|$|R
6000|$|His emotion moved Andre-Louis. He took Leandre's arm. [...] "You're a good fellow, Leandre. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> intervened to {{save you}} from your fate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> didn't forget them, anyway," [...] said Sam bravely. But he {{wondered}} how it was Grace could treat him so shabbily.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{paddling}} off, {{all in a}} {{sweat to}} tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> started or whether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says: ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had {{not gone}} on a visit that day. Had I done so Mr. Stillwell would have {{received}} my letter, and I do not doubt but {{that he would have}} opened it. As it was, he knew nothing of the communication, and I did not intend that he should until I was ready to disclose it to him.|$|E
6000|$|They come in {{and shut}} the door; {{and the first thing}} the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> hadn't found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to {{anything}} private. They sets down then, and the king says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Robert,' she said, {{when she}} {{understood}} that he had organized Phoebe's mission; 'I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> told him to give no answer for a week.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mill. That's well; for though I begin not to {{love this}} fool, yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> rid of him. [...] [Exeunt MILL. and ROSE.|$|R
6000|$|... "Euphemia," [...] said I, in as {{composed}} a tone as possible, although my whole frame was trembling with emotion, [...] "Euphemia, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> married you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Halt!" [...] cried a voice I recognized; {{and there}} was a jingle of steel as two skin-wrapped troopers of the Northwest Police wheeled their horses on either side of me, while another, who spoke with authority, grasped my bridle. Even in that {{darkness}} I could see the ready carbines, and, knowing what manner of men these riders were, I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> could meet them peaceably.|$|E
60|$|His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he <b>was</b> <b>glad,</b> <b>I</b> think, to see me. With {{hardly a}} word spoken, {{but with a}} kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and {{indicated}} a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{did think}} of one thing--rather odd--of a girl at Cambridge that I might have--you know; I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> hadn't got her on my mind. Anyhow, old chap, I owe it to you that I'm here; I {{should have been in}} the big dark by now. No more bed, or baccy; no more anything. I say, what d'you suppose happens to us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Luna {{sank into}} the nearest chair, with a groan, {{covering}} {{her face with her}} hands. [...] "Heaven help me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to Europe!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{many of the}} O'Mores {{have made}} game of it?' asked Sophy, bitterly. 'No, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> know of it, I shall not be deceived any more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> of service,” said Harding, with a smile. “In the {{meanwhile}} I haven’t {{the slightest}} doubt {{that you and}} Appleby will excuse me.” ...|$|R
