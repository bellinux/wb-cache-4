In June 2013, Pusha T had been set to turn in the album to Def Jam for mastering, however, Kanye West presented Pusha with some additional beats. This resulted in Pusha going back to the studio to continue the recording. In early stages in the recording process, he began working on the album with Kanye West, Symbolyc One, The Neptunes, Bangladesh, and Ryan Leslie. Since then, he has confirmed that he was working with The-Dream, Just Blaze, No I.D., Nottz, Don Cannon, Nashiem Myrick, Carlos Brody (of The Hitmen), DJ Mano, Swizz Beatz, Rico Beats, Travi$ Scott, Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Sham, amongst others on the album's production.

25|$|During {{the first}} season, 16-year-old Peyton Sawyer is girlfriend to popular jock/star {{basketball}} player Nathan, but they soon break up when Peyton reasons that their relationship {{is more about}} sexual benefits than love, and that she is tired of his cruelty. In addition, she realizes that she no longer <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> star basketball player's girlfriend. She has a romantic interest in her ex's brooding half brother, Lucas. Through various interactions with Lucas, she finds that he is kind and thoughtful towards her. However, when he confesses {{the depths of his}} need and want for her, she becomes scared and runs from him; Lucas is left heartbroken and desperate. Peyton later goes to visit Lucas and professes that she wants what he wants, but it is too late; Brooke, her best friend, has now become romantically involved with Lucas. Lucas and Peyton eventually cannot resist each other, romantic-wise, and become secret lovers (though no sex is involved). On the night that they decide to tell Brooke, Lucas gets into a car accident and subsequently goes into a coma, which brings back painful memories for Peyton because her mother died in a car crash. When Lucas finally comes home from the hospital, he breaks up with Brooke in order to be with Peyton. Peyton soon ends their affair, however, after it is clear that Brooke has found out about the romance and she wants to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton continues to avoid Lucas while Brooke continues to avoid Peyton. Brooke declares her friendship with Peyton to be over. Peyton begins spending more time with Luke's best friend, Haley James, and with Jake Jagielski, along with Jake's daughter, Jenny. Eventually, her friendship with Lucas is slowly reformed, and the two attend a party together at Nathan's apartment. However, at the party, Peyton and Nicki, Jake's ex and Jenny's mother, fight. Peyton realizes Nicki is the girl Lucas hooked up with at a bar, shortly after she dumped him to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton is furious and feels betrayed, along with Brooke. This draws a wedge between Lucas and Peyton, but reconciles the friendship between Peyton and Brooke. The season ends with Peyton spending more time with Jake, and helping him escape from Nicki, who tries to take their daughter from Jake's grasp. Peyton's relationship with Lucas remains broken.|$|E

Some critics, including Canning and Hankinson, praised it, while others had reservations, such as Brown, who characterized it as [...] "heavy-handed", and Fallon, who considered it [...] "well-acted" [...] but [...] "far too stagnant". The Sam and Quinn storyline was panned by VanDerWerff, who wrote [...] "the series has wasted whatever chemistry {{the two had}} in 'Duets' on scenes where Sam talks about how he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most popular kid in school", and by Kubicek, who criticized the lack of consistency in Sam's characterization.|$|E

500|$|Karthi's next {{release was}} Rajesh M's All in All Azhagu Raja, which {{featured}} him opposite Kajal Aggarwal and Santhanam. The film {{was released on}} Diwali 2013, and received mostly negative reviews from critics, with Behindwoods saying [...] "Though the laughs are spread across a few moments, when [...] is pitted against Rajesh's other wholesome 'laughathons' such as OKOK and Boss , it falls way short" [...] and Sify saying [...] "The trouble with [...] is that it lacks basic storyline and took the audiences for granted. The film has no real script to speak of, at best a skeletal plot." [...] His next film was Venkat Prabhu's Biriyani, which was released in December 2013, opening to positive reviews and became a box office success. He also sang the song [...] "Mississippi" [...] under Yuvan Shankar Raja's direction for both the Tamil and Telugu versions of the film. In 2014, Karthi appeared in Pa. Ranjith's Madras, a critical and commercial success. His next release was the 2015 action drama Komban. His first release in 2016 was the Tamil-Telugu bilingual film Oopiri. The film received positive reviews. Karthi's performance was also praised, with Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu stating (in his review of the Tamil version Thozha), [...] "At a time every leading man (including Karthi) seems to be participating in a game-show titled Who <b>Wants</b> <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>The</b> Next Rajinikanth?, here’s a simple “buddy movie” (in the Hollywoodian sense), with no punch dialogues, no action sequences, with just one duet (with Tamannaah, who plays Vikram’s secretary; her romance with Seenu is strangely unresolved). We see, all the time, character actors striving to become larger-than-life heroes. For a change, here’s a hero scaling himself down to play a life-sized character." [...] Later that year, Karthi appeared in director Gokul's Kaashmora. Though the film received mixed reviews, his performance was praised.|$|E

500|$|The finale {{introduces}} parallel-universe {{versions of}} familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress Anna Torv. One {{topic of conversation}} among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using [...] "Fauxlivia", [...] "Bolivia", and/or [...] "Altlivia". The writers chose Fauxlivia because {{a character in a}} season three episode referred to her as such. Torv and Akiva Goldsman discussed various ways to differentiate the two depictions of Olivia; ultimately two different physical demeanors were created. Torv wanted to make the new character [...] "completely different", but she and Goldsman recognized that the two share some major similarities, as they both are in the same profession and are [...] "fundamentally, genetically really the same person." [...] According to Torv, Fauxlivia holds herself differently and has [...] "a different silhouette. She's got a little firefighter, a little military in her." [...] Torv further explained, [...] "Olivia <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best, but [...] just wants to win;" [...] "There's just a front-footedness I think to , simply because she just doesn't carry {{the weight of the world}} on her shoulders like Olivia does. Olivia's mum died when she was really little, and 's mum is still around. There's lots of little, subtle differences." [...] The producers discussed cutting her hair, but ultimately decided on the auburn hair color to differentiate her. They also made her [...] "a little bit more playful". Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD audio commentary: [...] "When [...] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a very playful and sexy way. She turned a lot of heads." [...] Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia. The producers were so pleased with her Fauxlivia depiction that they thought [...] "it really opened up a bunch of possibilities... it went from 'let's see if this experiment works' to 'how can we get more of this? ...|$|E

Talking to We Love Telly, asked whether it's {{important}} for Kat to see Charlie again, Wallace replied: [...] "Yes, definitely. With what happened the night they thought Tommy died, things were still unresolved for them. Although they cleared the air before he left, things weren't right between them, so to have him back with her now {{makes it all the}} more special. It's also Charlie that makes Kat realise that she needs to bond with Tommy. He makes her see that she can do this." [...] Discussing what type of mother Kat will be, Wallace added: [...] "I think she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best mum possible.

Liz gets the chance to be on camera as host of Dealbreakers, but the pilot is a failure.

Contractual difficulties with their labels forced the group to record side projects until 1980 when they signed with Columbia Records.

[...] In a 2011 Guardian article about his critical Melody Maker review, Beaumont wrote: [...] "Kid A status as a cultural cornerstone has proved me, if not wrong, then {{very much in the}} minority...

[...] Grantland credited Kid A for ushering the modern age of internet music streaming and promotion, writing: [...] "For many music fans of a certain age and persuasion, Kid A was the first album experienced primarily via the internet– it's where you went to hear it, read the reviews, and argue about whether it was a masterpiece... Listen early, form an opinion quickly, state it publicly, and {{move on to the next}} big record by the official release date. In that way, Kid A invented modern music culture as we know it." [...] In 2015, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Nobody admits now they hated Kid A at the time, the same way folkies never admit they booed Dylan for going electric. Nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> clod who didn't get it." ...|$|E

They also recorded Ashford & Simpson's [...] "Didn't You Know (You'd Have To Cry Sometime)" [...] in 1969. They scored their second million-selling Motown single with the ballad [...] "If I Were Your Woman" [...] in 1970.
