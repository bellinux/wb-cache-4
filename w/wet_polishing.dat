Additionally, different specimen preparation methods were applied: either dry polishing before sintering or <b>wet</b> <b>polishing</b> after sintering. Each subgroup included 40 specimens. The surface roughness was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a profilometer whereas monoclinic phase transformation was investigated with X-ray diffraction. The {{data were analyzed using}} a three-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with respect to the three factors: zirconia, specimen preparation, and test method.

40|$|Novel {{processes}} {{were developed}} {{that resulted in}} a self-packaged device during the system integration, along with a transparent lid for inspection or optical probing. A new process was developed for improving the verticality in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) structures using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE). A self-pattered, mask-less photolithography technique was developed to metallize these vertical structures while maintaining a transparent window, for packaging of various MEMS devices. The verticality and metallization coverage were evaluated by incorporating the MEMS structures into an optical Corner Cube Retroreflector (CCR). A low temperature, hermetic sealing technique was also developed using In-Au thermo-compression bonding at 160 °C. Cross-shaped 550 um deep vertical mirrors, with sidewall angles of 90. 08 ° were etched with this new DRIE technique. This is the best reported sidewall angle for such deep structures. The typical scalloped DRIE sidewall roughness was reduced to 40 nm using <b>wet</b> <b>polishing.</b> A bonded Pyrex wafer was used as the handle wafer during DRIE; it eventually forms the package window after DRIE. The metallized, vertical mirrors were bonded to a MEMS device chip to assemble and package the CCR. The MEMS device chip consisted of an array of torsion mirrors. The mirrors were designed to modulate at 6 Vp-p - 20 Vp-p, with the resonant frequencies ranging from 25 KHz - 50 KHz. The design and simulation results are presented. To test the hermetic seal, helium leak tests were performed on the packaged device. Leak rates of as low as 2. 8 x 10 - 8 atm cc/s air were detected, which is better than the MIL-STD- 883 G of 5 x 10 - 8 atm cc/s air for a package volume of 7. 8 x 10 - 3 CC. A microprocessor and temperature/humidity sensor was then integrated with the CCR to assemble a passive optical digital data communicator. A flexible circuit design and a folded packaging scheme were utilized to minimize the overall form factor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercially pure titanium plates (1 mm x 25 mm x 50 mm) were <b>wet</b> <b>polished</b> down to 1200 -grit silicone carbide abrasive and ultrasonically cleaned. They were then embedded in auto-polymerizing acrylic with the bonding surfaces exposed. Specimens {{were randomly assigned}} to one of the following particle deposition protocols (N = 60, n = 10 per group) : group 1 : particle deposition with aluminum trioxide (50 µm Al 2 O 3) (AL) + air blasting + silane (ESPE-Sil); group 2 : particle deposition with 30 µm SiO 2 (CoJet) (CSC) + air blasting + silane; group 3 : particle deposition with Rocatec Pre 110 µm Al 2 O 3 +Rocatec Plus 110 µm SiO 2 (LSC) + air blasting + silane. In groups 4 (AL-W), 5 (CSC-W) and 6 (LSC-W), the same protocols were used, but instead of air blasting only, particle-deposited specimen surfaces were rinsed with water and air blasted. Adhesive resin (VisioBond) was applied and resin composite (Quadrant Posterior, Cavex) was bonded using polyethylene molds and photopolymerized. The specimens were then submitted to thermocycling (6000 cycles, 5 °C- 55 °C, dwell time: 30 s, transfer time: 5 s). Pre-test failures during thermocycling were assigned a value of 0 MPa. Failure modes were identified using an optical microscope. SEM images of particles were obtained. Bond strength data (MPa) were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests (a = 0. 05). RESULTS: Particle type significantly affected the bond results (p 0. 05). While AL groups showed exclusively adhesive failure between the resin composite and the substrate, the incidence of cohesive failures in the composite was more frequent in groups CSC and LSC after either air blasting or rinsing. SEM images of particles showed sharp morphology of the particles in AL compared to CSC and LSC. Conclusion: Rinsing and air blasting following particle deposition methods did not impair adhesion of resin composite to titanium.

By optimizing the polishing process, we are able to limit the increase of the emitter sheet resistance below 5 Ω/sq. However, the <b>wet</b> cleaning post <b>polishing</b> contributes an additional 20 Ω/sq emitter sheet resistance increase which is subject to further optimization.

Design/methodology/approach: Metallographic samples were selected from tensile specimens (after testing) and prepared by standard metallographic procedures (<b>wet</b> ground, <b>polished</b> with diamond pastes, finally polished with commercial fine silica slurry (STRUERS OP-U) and etched by Dix-Keller, HNO 3 or H 2 SO 4 (standard etching) or HCl (deep etching in order to reveal the three-dimensional morphology of phases). The microstructure was studied using an optical microscope Neophot 32 and SEM observation with EDX analysis using scanning electron microscope VEGA LMU II linked to the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX analyser Brucker Quantax). Hardness measurement was performed by a Brinell hardness tester with a load of 62. 5 kp (1 kp = 9. 807 N), 2. 5 mm diameter ball and a dwell time of 15 s. Findings: The results indicate that increasing solution treatment temperature results in spheroidization of eutectic Si, gradual disintegration of iron rich intermetallic phases on base Al 15 (FeMn) 3 Si 2, dissolution but also melting of intermetallic phases on base Al-Al 2 Cu-Si. Optimal solution treatment (515 °C/ 4 hours) most improves mechanical properties. Further increases of solution time, leads to alloy elongations, while both, the tensile strength continuously drop.

40|$|Chemical systems {{containing}} oxidants {{are widely}} used at various stages in semiconductor processing, particularly for <b>wet</b> cleaning and <b>polishing</b> applications. This dissertation presents {{a series of studies}} related to oxidative removal of materials in the Front-End-Of-Line (FEOL) and Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) processes during IC fabrication. In {{the first part of this}} study, stripping of photoresists exposed to high dose of ions (1 E 16 As/cm²) was investigated in activated hydrogen peroxide systems. Stripping of photoresists (PR) exposed to high dose (> 1 E 15 /cm²) ion beams is one of the most challenging steps in FEOL processing. This is due to unreactive crust layer that forms on the resist surface during ion implantation. The use of hydrogen peroxide systems activated by metal ion or UV light, for disrupting crust formed on deep UV resist to enable complete removal of crust as well as underlying photoresist was investigated. A systematic evaluation of variables such as hydrogen peroxide and metal ion concentration, UV intensity, temperature and time was conducted and an optimal formulation capable of attacking the crust was developed. A two step process involving pretreatment with activated hydrogen peroxide solution, followed by treatment with sulfuric acid-hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM) was developed for complete removal of crusted resist films. In the second part of this study, electrochemically enhanced abrasive removal of Ta/TaN films was investigated in solutions containing 2, 5 dihydroxy benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and potassium iodate (KIO₃). This method known as Electrically-assisted Chemical Mechanical Planarization (ECMP) is generating a lot of interest in IC manufacturing. Ta/TaN films were abraded at low pressures (< 0. 5 psi) on a polyurethane pad under galvanostatic conditions. The effect of variables including pH, KIO 3 concentration, and current density has been explored. In the optimized formulation, tantalum and tantalum nitride removal rates of ~ 170 A⁰/min and ~ 200 A⁰/min, respectively have been obtained at a current density of 1 mA/cm².

40|$|Microscopic thermal-contact pads {{that include}} carpet-like arrays of carbon {{nanotubes}} have been invented for dissipating heat generated in integrated circuits and similarly sized single electronic components. The need for these or other innovative thermal-contact pads arises because the requisite high thermal conductances cannot be realized by scaling conventional macroscopic thermal-contact pads down to microscopic sizes. Overcoming limitations of conventional thermal-contact materials and components, the carbon-nanotube thermal-contact pads offer the high thermal conductivities needed {{to accommodate the}} high local thermal power densities of modern electronic circuits, without need for large clamping pressures, extreme smoothness of surfaces in contact, or gap-filling materials (e. g., thermally conductive greases) to ensure adequate thermal contact. Moreover, unlike some conventional thermal-contact components, these pads are reusable. The figure depicts a typical pad according to the invention, in contact with a rough surface on an electronic component {{that is to be}} cooled. Through reversible bending and buckling of carbon nanotubes at asperities on the rough surface, the pad yields sufficiently, under relatively low contact pressure, that thermal contact is distributed to many locations on the surface to be cooled, including valleys where contact would not ordinarily occur in conventional clamping of rigid surfaces. Hence, the effective thermal-contact area is greater than that achievable through scaling down of a macroscopic thermal-contact pad. The extremely high longitudinal thermal conductivities of the carbon nanotubes are utilized to conduct heat away from potential hot spots on the surface to be cooled. The fibers protrude from a layer of a filler material (Cu, Ag, Au, or metal-particle- filled gels), which provides both mechanical support to maintain the carbon nanotubes in alignment and thermal conductivity to enhance the diffusion of concentrated heat from the nanotubes into the larger adjacent volume of a heat sink. The array of carbon nanotubes, the filler material, and the heat sink are parts of a unitary composite structure that is fabricated as follows: 1. Using techniques that have been reported previously, the array of substantially perpendicularly oriented carbon nanotubes is grown on a metal, silicon, or other suitable thermally conductive substrate that is intended to become the heat sink. 2. By means of chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, plasma deposition, ion sputtering, electrochemical deposition, or casting from a liquid phase, {{some or all of the}} interstitial volume between carbon nanotubes is filled with the aforementioned layer of mechanically supporting, thermally conductive material. 3. To cause the carbon nanotubes to protrude the desired length from the filler material, an outer layer of filler is removed by mechanical polishing, chemical mechanical <b>polishing,</b> <b>wet</b> chemical etching, electrochemical etching, or dry plasma etching...|$|R

Biomass pyrolysis is a promising thermochemical method for producing fuels and chemicals from renewable sources. Development of a fundamental understanding of biomass pyrolysis chemistry is difficult {{due to the}} multi-scale and multi-phase nature of the process; biomass length scales span 11 orders of magnitude and pyrolysis phenomena include solid, liquid, and gas phase chemistry in addition to heat and mass transfer. These complexities {{have a significant effect}} on chemical product distributions and lead to variability between reactor technologies. A major challenge in the study of biomass pyrolysis is the development of kinetic models capable of describing hundreds of millisecond-scale reactions of biomass into lower molecular weight products. In this work, a novel technique for studying biomass pyrolysis provides the first- ever experimental determination of kinetics and rates of formation of the primary products from cellulose pyrolysis, providing insight into the millisecond-scale chemical reaction mechanisms. These findings highlight the importance of heat and mass transport limitations for cellulose pyrolysis chemistry and are used to identify the length scales at which transport limitations become relevant during pyrolysis. Through this technique, a transition is identified, known as the reactive melting point, between low and high temperature depolymerization. The transition between two mechanisms of cellulose decompositions unifies the mechanisms that govern low temperature char formation, intermediate pyrolysis conditions, and high temperature gas formation. The conditions under which biomass undergoes pyrolysis, including modes of heat transfer, have been shown to significantly affect the distribution of biorenewable chemical and fuel products. High-speed photography is used to observe the liftoff of initially crystalline cellulose particles when impinged on a heated surface, known as the Leidenfrost effect for room-temperature liquids. Order-of-magnitude changes in the lifetime of cellulose particles are observed as a result of changing modes in heat transfer as cellulose intermediate liquid droplets <b>wet</b> and de-wet <b>polished</b> ceramic surfaces. Introduction of surface macroporosity is shown to completely inhibit the cellulose Leidenfrost effect, providing avenues for surface modification and reactor design to control particle heat transfer in industrial pyrolysis applications. Cellulosic particles on surfaces consisting of microstructured, asymmetric ratchets were observed to spontaneously move orthogonal to ratchet wells above the cellulose reactive Leidenfrost temperature (> 750 °C). Evaluation of the accelerating particles supported the mechanism of propelling viscous forces (50 - 200 nN) from rectified pyrolysis vapors, thus providing the first example of biomass conveyors with no moving parts driven by high temperature for biofuel reactors. Combined knowledge of pyrolysis chemistry, kinetics, and heat and mass transport effects direct the design of the next generation pyrolysis reactors for tuning bio- oil quality and design of improved catalytic upgrading technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{alkaline}} texturing {{process of}} Cz-Silicon (Si) wafers {{leads to a}} surface full of randomly distributed pyramids. These pyramids are typically removed on the later rear side of the solar cell by a single side <b>wet</b> chemical <b>polishing</b> process. A variation of the removed amount of Si during this process leads to a certain surface roughness. This work investigates in detail {{the impact of the}} remaining surface roughness on surface recombination of thermal oxide passivated lifetime samples and on the device performance of thermal oxide passivated solar cells. On solar cell level the differences between a solar cell with a fully textured rear side and a solar cell with an almost completely plane rear surface adds up to 2 %abs. The reason is basically an increased surface recombination velocity for rough or textured surfaces. This work presents two up to now unknown mechanisms for the particular increase in SRV with increasing surface roughness of thermal oxide passivated Si surfaces. Shunt or leakage currents through the induced inversion layer as well as recombination in the space charge region near the Si/SiO 2 -interface are increased by a rough surface and increase the total surface recombination. The optical properties of the differently rough surfaces are investigated by different simulation approaches. The optical simulations show relatively small impact of the different surfaces on the generated photo current density (0. 2 mA/cm²). Instead, the actual measured difference in short circuit current density of solar cells with a textured and a plane rear surface is 0. 9 mA/cm². Thus, the impact of the surface roughness on the optical properties of a solar cell is small compared to the impact on the electrical properties of the device. PERC solar cells from different Si material are produced. The used Si materials are boron doped Cz-Si, boron doped magnetically casted Cz-Si and Ga-doped Cz-Si as well as three different cast mono Si materials from three different material suppliers. High conversion efficiencies of up to 19. 9 % on Cz-Si and 19. 8 % on cast mono Si are reached. The amount of dislocations in the cast-mono-Si was identified as critical parameter for the device performance. Especially after light induced degradation the cast-mono-Si solar cells still reach high conversion efficiencies due to the lower oxygen concentration in this material. A parameterization of the SRV at the local contacts in dependence of the acceptor concentration of the base material is given in this work. This is the first time such a parameterization is given for locally laser alloyed contacts (so called laser fired contacts, LFC) on screen printed Al. This parameterization is implemented in an existing analytical model, which now allows for extensive analytical modelling of the produced solar cells. The analytical calculations of the IV-parameters in dependence of the base resistivity are in good correlation with the experimentally measured values of PERC solar cells with base resistivity in the range of 0. 9 to 2. 8 Ohmcm. The analytical simulations allow for the extraction of certain relevant parameters, such as the Shockley-Read-Hall-lifetime of the use bulk material. The SRH-lifetime of one of the cast-mono-Si materials is determined to 90 – 170 µs, which is in good correlation with the actual value, measured on a test sample produced from the same material. The simulations also lead to the conclusion that low base resistivity is essential, especially for materials with low material quality (low SRH-lifetime). Furthermore the analytical model allows for the identification of future ways to improve the conversion efficiency of these devices. For example, it is shown that for high base resistivity it is more urgent to decrease the base saturation current density than the emitter saturation current density whereas for low base resistivity it is the other way around. The boron-oxygen-complex related degradation of PERC solar cells is also simulated. One important result is that for high conversion efficiency after light induced degradation {{it is more important to}} decrease the oxygen concentration in the material than to increase the SRH-lifetime. The last section of this work deals with different requirements on the screen printed soldering pastes used for PERC devices. The bonding of the soldering paste on the passivation and wafer, the damage of the passivation induced by the soldering paste and the contact resistance between Al-paste and soldering paste are investigated in detail. Two suitable soldering pastes were identified and test modules with PERC solar cells are produced. After a temperature cycling test of 102 cycles the loss in module power is less than 5 % and demonstrates the suitability of the produced PERC devices for module interconnection...|$|R

Foram utilizados 176 dentes humanos constituídos por grupos dos pré-molares e molares, cujas raízes foram seccionadas e as coroas dentárias remanescentes incluídas com resina acrílica ativada quimicamente em tubos de PVc. A face vestibular foi desgastada com lixas d'água de granulação número 180 e 400, respectivamente, até conseguir uma área plana de 5 mm de diâmetro na superfície do esmalte ou dentina. Após a preparação das superfícies dentárias, uma fita adesiva circular com um orifício central de 4 mm de diâmetro foi aderida sobre a superfície do esmalte ou dentina, com a finalidade de delimitar a área onde se efetuaria a união adesivo-material restaurador. A área delimitada para a união (esmalte ou dentina) foi tratada com um dos seguintes sistemas adesivos: Scotchbond Multi-Purpose e Scotchbond 2 (3 M Dental), Optibond e XR Bonding (Kerr), All Bond 2 (Bisco), Denthesive II (Kulzer), Syntac (Vivadent), Multi Bond Alpha (DFL), Heliobond (Vivadent), Pro-bond e Prisma Universal Bond 3 (Caulk / Dentsply). Durante a utilização de cada sistema adesivo, as instruções dos respectivos fabricantes foram rigorosamente seguidas. O compósito restaurador utilizado foi aquele indicado por cada fabricante para cada sistema adesivo, excessão feita aos materiais Multi Bond Alpha e All Bond 2, que utilizaram o compósito restaurador Z 100 (3 M Dental). Em seguida, cada compósito restaurador, foi inserido com o auxílio de uma matriz de aço inoxidável (4 mm de diâmetro or 5 mm de altura), em três camadas, cada uma polimerizada durante 40 segundos. Os corpos de prova foram armazenados a 37 ´GRAUS´C e 100 % de umidade relativa durante 24 horas e submetidos ao ensaio de resistência ao cisalhamento em máquina de ensaio universal Otto Wolpert Werke, a uma velocidade de 6 mm/min. Após a fratura, as superfícies das amostras em esmalte ou dentina de cada grupo de material, foram revestidas com ouro-paládio sob alto vácuo para observação em microscopia eletrônica de varredura. A análise de variância e o teste de Tukey, ao nível de 5 % de significância, mostraram que a média de resistência ao cisalhamento na superfície do esmalte para o produto Optibond (14, 21 MPa) foi significativamente superior do que os demais produtos testados. Em seguida, vieram os produtos Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (10, 49 MPa), All Bond 2 (10, 44 MPa) e Syntac (10, 42 MPa) que foram estatisticamente iguais entre si, 8 inferiores ao produto Optibond e superiores aos demais produtos. Logo após, vieram os produtos Pró-Bond (8, 11 MPa), Multi Bond Alpha (8, 00 MPa), Denthesive II (7, 89 MPa) e XR Bonding (7, 37 MPa) que foram estatisticamente iguais entre si e superiores aos produtos Scotchbond 2 (6, 25 MPa), Prisma Universal Bond 3 (6, 23 MPa) e Heliobond (5, 12 MPa) que foram iguais entre si. Os produtos XR Bonding, Scotchbond 2 e Prisma Universal Bond 3, foram estatisticamente iguais entre si. Em dentina, a análise de variância e o teste de Tukey, ao nível de 5 % de significância, mostraram que os produtos Optibond (6, 17 MPa), Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (6, 06 MPa) e All Bond 2 (5, 39 MPa) foram estatisticamente iguais entre si e superiores aos demais produtos, excessão para o produto All Bond 2 em relação aos produtos Denthesive II, Syntac e Pro-Bond, cujas médias foram estatisticamente iguais entre si.

One hundred seventy-six extracted human permanent molar and premolar teeth were mounted in phenolic rings with cold-cure acrylic resin and the facial surfaces were ground <b>wet</b> in a <b>polishing</b> block on a polishing machine on 180 - followed by 400 - grit silicon carbide paper. Adhesive tape with a circular hole, 4 mm in diameter, was placed on the ground enamel and dentin surfaces to delineate the bonding areas.
