5|$|Moore's first {{deployment}} as {{an artist}} was with the RAAF in Papua New Guinea in early 1944. His earlier watercolour paintings, made in Milne Bay and Goodenough Island, were destroyed by <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> and humidity; he subsequently changed to working with oils, which were more suitable for the tropical environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Nadzab was delayed {{by the need}} to upgrade the Markham Valley Road. After strenuous efforts in the face of <b>wet</b> <b>weather,</b> the road was opened on 15 December. Nadzab then became the major Allied air base in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of <b>wet</b> <b>weather,</b> the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E

25|$|Like other Noongar peoples, the Whadjuk seem to {{have moved}} more inland in the <b>wetter</b> <b>weather</b> of winter, {{returning}} to the coast as interior seasonal lakes dried up.|$|R
5|$|As a team, the Australians {{were greeted}} by record crowds and gate {{receipts}} across the country, even when <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> curtailed the matches. The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times, in the Second Test at Lord's, the Third Test at Old Trafford, and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{safety in}} Brazil {{had been under}} {{increased}} scrutiny following the mid-air collision in September 2006 over the Amazon of Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 and an Embraer Legacy 600 (see Brazil's 2006-2007 aviation crisis). Congonhas was singled out for having safety issues relating to operations in <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> due to its location and runway characteristics for the traffic it serves.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States Grand Prix on 24 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at various racing circuits across Europe between 26–29 September {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren's test driver Olivier Panis flew to the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours to undertake preparations for Suzuka and development work on their 2001 car. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent two days at the Fiorano Circuit testing mechanical components and ran on an artificially wet track for testing of Bridgestone's <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> tyre compounds. Williams, with rookie competitor Jenson Button, went to the Autódromo do Estoril for two days and tried <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> tyres and different aerodynamic configurations. Prost travelled to Magny-Cours and their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin collected three days of chassis design data for the upcoming AP04 chassis. Benetton opted to miss testing prior to the event but their test driver Mark Webber tried developments at the Circuit de Catalunya that were incorporated into their 2001 car.|$|E
50|$|The inaugural {{event was}} held between 19-21 November 2009 during {{some of the}} <b>wettest</b> <b>weather</b> seen in the UK. The event was won by Guy Wilks in a Škoda Fabia S2000.|$|R
50|$|Princetown, {{like the}} rest of Dartmoor, {{experiences}} colder and <b>wetter</b> <b>weather</b> than most of Devon, especially because of its high altitude. Snow is uncommon but is usually heavy when it does fall.|$|R
5000|$|Like other Noongar peoples, the Whadjuk seem to {{have moved}} more inland in the <b>wetter</b> <b>weather</b> of winter, {{returning}} to the coast as interior seasonal lakes dried up. [...] The Whadjuk, like many Noongar people divided the year into six seasons.|$|R
5|$|Lysurus periphragmoides has a pantropical distribution. The fungus {{has been}} {{reported}} from Africa (Mauritius, Tanzania), Asia (Jilin Province, China, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia), Australasia (New Guinea), North America (Bahamas, Dominica, Mexico) and South America (Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela). The distribution extends north to the Ryukyu Islands in Asia. It is fairly common in South America, but is usually restricts its appearance to periods of <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> in southern North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{first session}} on Thursday began in heavy rain. Although some cars {{attempted}} {{to carry out}} <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> testing, the conditions forced all the teams back to their garages. Once the rain began to slacken off cars returned to the track, but the rain continued throughout the entire session. No one was able to improve on their qualifying times from the previous day.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculptured}} puffball grows solitarily or {{in small}} groups in forest duff. It is typically associated with coniferous forests at high elevations, greater than about , on western mountains like the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. The United States distribution includes the states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. An uncommon species, it fruits throughout spring, summer, and fall during <b>wet</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some growers {{also use}} bumble bees {{alongside}} of the honey bees {{in hopes of}} maximum pollination. Bumble bees will fly in colder and <b>wetter</b> <b>weather</b> conditions than the honey bee will, they also pollinate {{in a different way}} then the honey bee.|$|R

2500|$|Puerto Plata has a {{tropical}} climate, more specifically {{a tropical}} monsoon climate, with hot, somewhat wet summers and warm, very wet winters (Köppen climate classification Am), {{due to its}} tropical location and the cold fronts that reach the region during the [...] "winter" [...] which typically brings the area humid, <b>wetter</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|R
5|$|Having {{just nine}} turns, the fewest on the Formula One calendar, the circuit offers very few {{low-speed}} sections and gave teams {{an opportunity to}} push their power units to their potential. As in the previous year's event, and {{for the third straight}} event overall, the yellow-banded soft compound tyre were the prime dry selection while the red-banded supersoft compound were the option dry selection. Pirelli also supplied two <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> compounds: the green-banded intermediate compound and the blue-banded full wet compound.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved {{around the edge of the}} hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E
5|$|Richard Nixon {{was buried}} beside his wife Pat {{on the grounds}} of the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren. In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service. Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> to pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E
50|$|Though {{often thought}} of as a long drought, until the record dry year of 1902 the period was {{actually}} {{one of a number of}} very dry spells interspersed with <b>wetter</b> <b>weather.</b> Dry conditions gradually became established during the late 1890s and several dry areas joined together to create the end result of a drought covering over half the continent.|$|R
5000|$|April 8 - April 9: Heavy {{rain on the}} 8th and 9th (mainly on the 8th) over {{parts of}} Ontario knocks out power to 4,000 {{customers}} in Muskoka. Among the wettest places were Windsor with 31 mm and Hamilton with 22 mm rain; here it was the <b>wettest</b> <b>weather</b> since January 31. Meanwhile, in Wiarton, conditions were much wetter and 41 mm rain fell.|$|R

5|$|Somerset's quarter-final, against Lancashire, was {{scheduled}} for Tuesday 28 July 2009. Bad weather meant that no play was possible on either the Tuesday or Wednesday, {{as a result of}} which the teams requested special dispensation from the ECB for an additional reserve day on the Thursday, which was granted. The <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> continued, forcing the teams to play a bowl-out. Each team had to select five bowlers, each of whom had two deliveries at a set of unguarded stumps. Somerset won the bowl-out 5–1, with Ben Phillips, Peter Trego and Willoughby each hitting the stumps once, and Thomas hitting them twice.|$|E
5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} {{protection}} from the hazards of open land. The prairie could be dangerous in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. <b>Wet</b> <b>weather</b> turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} ear, which has large numbers of auditory neurons, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using this sense {{alone in the dark}} of a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops makes it difficult to detect faint sounds, and prolonged <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.|$|E
50|$|Dodurga {{sits in a}} plain {{surrounded}} {{on three}} sides by mountains, the eastern edge is formed by a 17 km long valley of the River Kızılırmak. 64% of the land area is the plain, 23% the valley and the remaining 12% being the mountains. Dodurga has a dry climate typical of Central Anatolia, the summers are hot and dry (July average 24 degrees C) and winters are cold (Jan. ave. 1.5) although the nearby Black Sea brings <b>wetter</b> <b>weather</b> in winter.|$|R
40|$|The 2009 {{growing season}} {{resulted}} in mean monthly temperatures that varied from - 8 o F to + 7 o F from the 30 -year average (Table 1). This {{year there were}} {{a total of four}} days above 90 o F, down from 10 days in 2007 and up from 2 in 2008. Overall, 2009 was a cooler year than normal. In western Iowa, this growing season will be remembered for the combination of cooler and <b>wetter</b> <b>weather</b> conditions during the growing season...|$|R
50|$|Rainfall averages around 1027 mm (40.5 in) per annum, {{with the}} <b>wettest</b> <b>weather</b> usually {{occurring}} between October and January. The driest year ever recorded was in 1975 when 583.7 mm fell, while the wettest was in 2009 with 1433.4 mm. In {{common with the}} rest of Ireland, rainfall in Cloyne has increased over the past 10 years or so, with the sharpest rises in average being in the summer months. Winter rainfall has actually decreased slightly in the same period.|$|R
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in <b>wet</b> <b>weather.</b> Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce {{began his}} final race weekend, the 1977 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, by setting the fastest {{time in the}} Wednesday {{practice}} session, held in <b>wet</b> <b>weather.</b> Pryce posted a time of 1 minute 31.57 seconds with the next best, the eventual 1977 World Champion Niki Lauda, a full second slower. The weather dried up prior to the Thursday session, and he slipped back down the grid to fifteenth place, almost two seconds slower than James Hunt's pole position time.|$|E
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 23 April, all teams {{conducted}} in-season {{testing at}} the Circuit de Catalunya on 25–28 April {{to prepare for}} the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix. Jos Verstappen was fastest {{on the first day of}} testing despite spinning into the gravel early in the session, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Michael Schumacher was quickest on the second day. Michael Schumacher remained the fastest driver on the third day of testing. The session was disrupted because several drivers stopped on the circuit with problems with their cars. On the final day, (which was held in <b>wet</b> <b>weather</b> conditions in the morning and during the end of the session) Michael Schumacher stayed the quickest driver on the final day.|$|E
40|$|Efforts {{to obtain}} data {{affecting}} {{the behavior of}} Grinnell Glacier, Glacier National Park, are described. Some of the data so far observed, which include precipitation, temperature, runoff from the glacier basin, and actual surveys of the ice body, are tabulated. The possibility that observations to date point toward a renewal of glacier activity in the Northwest is developed. Recent trends toward cooler weather in the northwestern parts of Europe and North America, and <b>wetter</b> <b>weather</b> {{as well in the}} case of northwestern North America, are discussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|Winter (mid November - mid March) {{is mostly}} cool but non-prevailing cold easterly winds {{can affect the}} area from the continent, these can bring heavy {{snowfall}} if the winds interact with a low pressure system over the Atlantic or France. Northerly winds can also be cold but are not usually as cold as easterly winds. Westerly winds bring milder and, typically, <b>wetter</b> <b>weather.</b> Southerly winds usually bring mild air (if from the Atlantic or North Africa) but chill if coming from further east than Spain.|$|R
