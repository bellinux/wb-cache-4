40|$|AbstractUsing high {{resolution}} capacitance measurements, we have characterized an ultrafast component of transmitter release in ribbon-type synaptic terminals of retinal bipolar neurons. During depolarization, capacitance increases to a plateau of ∼ 30 fF <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> constant <b>of</b> ∼ 1. 5 ms. When not limited by activation kinetics of calcium current, the small pool is depleted even faster, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> constant <b>of</b> 0. 5 ms. After the ultrafast pool is depleted, capacitance rises <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slower <b>time</b> constant <b>of</b> ∼ 300 ms. EGTA (5 mM) depresses the slower capacitance rise but leaves the ultrafast phase intact. BAPTA (5 mM) depresses both components of exocytosis. With paired-pulse stimulation, the ultrafast pool recovers from depletion <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> constant <b>of</b> ∼ 4 s. The ultrafast component may represent fusion of docked vesicles {{at the base}} of the synaptic ribbon, while the slower component represents more distal vesicles on the ribbon...|$|R
