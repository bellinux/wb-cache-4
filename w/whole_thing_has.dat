500|$|... "I {{think this}} <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been {{manufactured}} by David Falk", Gattison told The Charlotte Observer Friday night. [...] "The guys {{he used to}} initiate the decertification drive aren't concerned with the union and the everyday little guy. These guys {{have been in the}} league 10 or 11 years and have yet to voice an opinion about what's going on. Then all of a sudden David Falk doesn't like what's going on." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from 'Osoblog.tv' {{was less}} {{critical of the}} video, instead calling it an advert for the Summer. [...] "The band walked around on a beach and danced in a rock pool (with artful splashing) while dressed {{in a variety of}} beachwear. It makes us want to go on a holiday." [...] The reviewer from OK! magazine agreed saying [...] "quite frankly the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> us aching for a summer holiday" [...] and then compared it a holiday the group might go on. [...] "All in all it's a pretty standard summer for the girls who show off super toned physiques, plenty of midriff and a collection of maxi-dresses we can't help, but covet." ...|$|E
500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|However, the Wii and PlayStation 2 {{versions}} received mostly mixed {{to negative}} reviews. IGN commented the Wii version [...] "is {{not a bad}} game" [...] but {{went on to say}} [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been oversimplified and dumbed down. The Wii puzzles are a joke, the combat is almost nonexistent, and the game is pretty short." [...] GameSpot added [...] "Tomb Raider Underworld can be an enjoyable adventure, but it’s marred by bugs, camera issues, and ill-conceived Wii extras." [...] While the PlayStation 2 version was called [...] "an embarrassment to the franchise" [...] by IGN. They {{went on to say that}} the version was such a poor conversion that it shouldn't have even been released, saying [...] "Full of bugs, linear play that discourages exploration and non-existent combat, Tomb Raider Underworld feels as though it's part of the series in name and main character only." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're {{trying to figure out}} how to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers are still trying to figure out the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been barely addressed, and this week we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E

60|$|Philip laughed. He was exhilarated by the scene, {{the funny}} little {{man in his}} odd clothes, the {{panelled}} room and the Spanish furniture, the English fare: the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> an exquisite incongruity.|$|R
2500|$|He {{then added}} that, [...] "This <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> {{gotten out of}} hand. I {{want to talk to}} the FBI or someone. Half the people look at me as a {{combination}} of Einstein, Flash Gordon and screwball. I wonder what my wife back in Idaho thinks." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to JohnMcCain.com: [...] "There is {{disturbing}} evidence Russia is already {{laying the groundwork}} to apply the same arguments used to justify its intervention in Georgia {{to other parts of}} its near abroad – most ominously in Crimea. This strategically important peninsula is part of Ukraine, but with a large ethnic Russian population and the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol." [...] "Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support – we, the United States – will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO""And watch Ukraine. This <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> got {{a lot to do with}} Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol," [...] said McCain during the first presidential debate of 2008 on September 26.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 February 2009, Chris Murphy, INXS {{creative}} director and global business strategist and former manager, {{in an interview}} with The Daily Telegraph, said J.D. was not sacked and, in fact, [...] "the band made it known to him that they had not ruled out seeing a return by Fortune." [...] He also stated JD was next on his list to call regarding a major recording contract he was negotiating for the band. In an interview with Confidential on 1 March 2009, Murphy stated [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been bizarre – he was basically a contractor and his contract had ended." [...] Speaking with Billboard, Murphy stated that he would rather part ways with the band than work with Fortune. [...] "If the band said to me tomorrow, 'We'd still like you to make that call and talk to him about working on a project,' I'd have to say 'Sorry, I have to go.'" [...] However, JD Fortune toured with INXS as frontman in February 2011.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} a sound as of {{something}} smashing was heard upstairs, and a woman's shriek. Mrs. Blakeston, {{in an effort}} to tear herself away from her husband, had knocked up against the wash-hand stand, and the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> crashed down.|$|R
60|$|To Lilly, {{rigid and}} {{physically}} preoccupied, there sounded {{a sort of}} self-consciousness in Jim's voice, as if the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> been semi-deliberate. He detected the sort of maudlin deliberateness which goes with hysterics, and he was colder, more icy than ever.|$|R
60|$|The Flambards stood, {{a picture}} of astonishment. The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> passed so instantaneously that they could {{scarcely}} realize what had happened. When they did so, Madame Flambard, who had hitherto preserved her calmness, burst into tears; while her husband embraced Leigh with passionate gratitude.|$|R

6000|$|... "The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> {{been too}} much for her," [...] said Mrs. Carbuncle severely, ringing the bell {{at the same time}} for further aid.|$|E
5000|$|Leah Rabin {{stated that}} a {{security}} guard told her immediately after the incident that the bullets shot at her husband were [...] "blanks".

60|$|I came {{round with}} {{that to the}} problem of just how the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> seemed to him.

50|$|On a Sky News panel {{discussion}} of the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape in October 2016, Cameron said the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> made him even more pro-Trump and theatrically demonstrated his support by donning an official Trump slogan cap and removing his shirt to reveal an official Trump Pence campaign t-shirt.|$|R

6000|$|... 'So if the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> broken down, sir,' {{concluded}} Pancks, 'at {{the very}} last, say {{the day before}} the other day when I showed you our papers in the Prison yard, or say that very day, nobody but ourselves would have been cruelly disappointed, or a penny the worse.' ...|$|R
5000|$|From then on, nothing went right. My carpet {{designs were}} {{rejected}} and my textiles were not required. The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> taken {{me about a}} year.....

60|$|It was {{the thought}} of that little act of simple chivalry, {{witnessed}} the day before, which caused Juliette to provoke the scene which, but for Déroulède's timely interference, might have ended so fatally.

6000|$|... "It won't be any use, father," [...] Crystal {{said with}} a sigh. [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been organised, I feel sure, and the head that planned this abominable robbery will know how to place his booty in safety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been a fiasco," [...] {{the sheriff}} was heard saying, [...] "owing to our failing {{to take them}} by surprise.

60|$|At length, a cold hand is laid upon my shoulder, and I awake. The wild faces have {{vanished}} and all is silent now, and I {{wonder if the}} <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been a dream. My father lifts me into the dog-cart, and we drive home through the chill dawn.|$|E
60|$|James {{certainly}} had an irritating {{way of speaking}} of a book. He talked of incidents, and effects, and suggestions, as if the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> just been a sensational-æsthetic attribute to himself. Not a grain of human feeling in the man, said Miss Frost, flushing pink with exasperation. She herself invariably took the human line.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Terence himself, {{scarcely}} realising {{what had}} taken place, for the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> happened within {{the time of}} a couple of heart-beats, stood quite still, amazed and awed, in a half-crouching attitude, looking down at the body of the fallen man.
