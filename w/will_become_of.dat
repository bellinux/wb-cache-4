This leaves the stadium's future clouded in uncertainty. Recent occurrences have indicated that Malmö Stadion might continue to be used as an athletics arena, as MAI intends to revive the MAI Gala. In November 2012, MAI lobbied to attract 100 metres Olympic champion Usain Bolt to the stadium for the proposed MAI Gala in August 2014. MAI are also working towards hosting the European Athletics Junior Championships in 2015, and have written to the European Athletic Association to express their interest.

As of February 2015 it is still unknown when the demolition process will start and what <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> the area.|$|E

Chemical exergy {{is defined as the}} maximum work that can be obtained when the considered system is brought into reaction with reference substances present in the environment.

500|$|Shepherd's death {{came as a}} {{shock to}} the {{audience}} and was a major topic of discussion among critics, who gave polarising views on the character's exit. Janalen Samson, a contributing Writer for BuddyTV noted the episodes generation of shock in the times of the omnipresent media saying, [...] "Genuine surprise is a rare occurrence in television viewing these days", and added, [...] "Imagine my amazement, then, when I sat down to watch [...] "How to Save a Life"". Calling the death a [...] "lightning bolt" [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News wrote, [...] "In one of the most stunning moments from a high-mortality television season, [...] "Grey's Anatomy" [...] killed off Patrick Dempsey's Dr. Derek Shepherd". Also talking about the shock value Shepherd's death in her New York Post review Lindsay Putnam wrote, [...] "“Grey’s Anatomy” did the unthinkable, killing off {{one of the few remaining}} original cast members", additionally putting up the question of the future of the series asking, [...] "with Derek out of the picture, what <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital family? Is there still a future for “Grey’s Anatomy”?" [...] The sentiment was echoed by Slate writer Aisha Harris who weighed heavily upon importance of the death and its impact saying that despite the show’s ensemble cast, [...] "Meredith has always remained the central figure of Grey’s, so this death marks a very important turning point in the show".

500|$|Döblin {{wrote the}} novel between fall 1921 and summer 1923. According to the author, the novel {{set out to}} explore the question: [...] "What <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> the human being if he keeps living like he lives now?" [...] Döblin would later write that the {{original}} inspiration for the novel was the sight of pebbles rolling in the surf on the Baltic Sea coast during a family vacation {{in the summer of}} 1921; this epiphanic vision provoked a sudden and uncharacteristic interest in nature for Döblin, who began taking extensive notes in various Berlin museums and libraries on natural history and science, geology, geography, climatology, ethnography, and other fields. If he had originally conceived of the novel as a [...] "hymn to the city" [...] and to technology, as he got into the project it increasingly became an encomium to nature. In early 1922 he closed his medical practice for a month to further his research for the novel. The section on Iceland and Greenland, which occurs {{towards the end of the}} published novel, was one of the first sections Döblin envisioned and drafted, and an advance publication of this section appeared in the Vossische Zeitung on New Year's Day 1922 with the title Die Enteisung Grönlands im Jahre 2500. Das Zauberschiff (The Melting of Greenland's Ice in the Year 2500: The Magical Ship). In May 1922 Döblin rented a villa in Zehlendorf to complete the draft of the novel, a setting explicitly referenced in the novel's unusual [...] "Dedication". The exertions of drafting the novel provoked a sort of nervous breakdown: as he would later write, [...] "the fantasy was too wild and my brain would not release me." [...] In a 2011 biography, Wilfried Schoeller has suggested that there was an additional reason for Döblin's breakdown—namely, that the temporary move to Zehlendorf was also his unsuccessful attempt to leave his wife in favor of his lover Charlotte Niclas. According to Schoeller, this personal dimension left its mark on the novel, especially on the novel's dedication.|$|E
