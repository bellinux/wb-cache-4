500|$|Symantec, in {{compliance}} with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), <b>whitelisted</b> Magic Lantern, a keylogger actively developed by the FBI. The purpose of Magic Lantern is to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on [...] November 20, 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press. Magic Lantern is deployed as an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, a trojan horse is installed on the suspect's computer. The Trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have <b>whitelisted</b> Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting it. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can also}} be used in reverse, with a <b>whitelisted</b> flash drive in the USB port {{attached}} to the user's wrist via a lanyard serving as a key. In this instance, if the flash drive is forcibly removed, the program will initiate the desired routines. [...] " [...] is designed to do one thing," [...] wrote Aaron Grothe in a short article on USBKill in , [...] "and it does it pretty well." [...] As a further precaution, he suggests users rename it to something innocuous once they have loaded it on their computers in case someone might be looking for it on a seized computer in order to disable it.|$|E

3000|$|Independent Thread Independent thread is {{a thread}} which is {{inserted}} by our customized compiler at {{the entry of}} DSSR binary. The thread will allocate the dynamic <b>whitelist</b> and update the <b>whitelist</b> periodically. The thread calls the UCB-D function, which we will present shortly in “UCB-D algorithm” section, to “know" [...] exactly how to update the <b>whitelist.</b> Once the <b>whitelist</b> is updated, the thread will de-randomize the data structures in the previous <b>whitelist,</b> and randomize the data structures in current <b>whitelist.</b> In addition, the thread contains the canary detection (in “Canary detection” section).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Whitelist</b> (known goods): A <b>Whitelist</b> {{is a list}} of [...] "known good data". A <b>Whitelist</b> is {{basically}} a list which says [...] "A, B and C is good (and everything else is bad)".|$|R
30|$|Dynamic <b>WhiteList</b> To {{solve the}} first challenge, DSSR binary {{maintains}} a dynamic <b>whitelist.</b> A dynamic <b>whitelist</b> is a buffer which is allocated in the heap and inserted by our customized compiler. It {{consists of the}} indices of the data structures. If a data structure is in the <b>whitelist,</b> DSSR binary will randomize it in a defense cycle. Otherwise, the data structure will keep its pre-known layout. The only code of DSSR binary that can access the dynamic <b>whitelist</b> is an independent thread illustrated as follows.|$|R

5000|$|On December 5, 2011, Wladimir Palant {{announced}} that certain [...] "acceptable" [...] ads would be <b>whitelisted</b> in upcoming builds of the Adblock Plus software, with {{the option to}} remove <b>whitelisted</b> ads via a custom setting in the software. According to Palant, only static advertisements with a maximum of one script will be permitted as [...] "acceptable", with a preference towards text-only content. The announcement created some controversy both at Adblock Plus's website and at social media sites like Reddit.|$|E
50|$|An {{automated}} <b>whitelist</b> is a <b>whitelist</b> {{which is}} created or maintained {{by a system}} that monitors incoming and/or outgoing email, and based on preset criteria, will add or remove entries from the <b>whitelist</b> without a need for human intervention.|$|R

25|$|The Domain White List (DWL) was {{released}} in October 2010 and is a <b>whitelist</b> of domain names. The DWL enables automatic certification of domains with DKIM signatures. Only verified legitimate senders with clean reputations are approved for <b>whitelisting</b> and there are strict terms to keeping a <b>whitelist</b> account.|$|R
50|$|The Computrace client {{exhibits}} trojan and rootkit-like behaviour, {{but some}} of its modules were <b>whitelisted</b> by several antivirus vendors. Earlier it was detected as TR/Hijack.Explor.1245 or W32/Agent.SW!tr.|$|E
50|$|A listing {{indicates}} that the source is believed to send no spam {{and should not be}} subjected to blacklist testing, but is not quite as trusted as a <b>whitelisted</b> source.|$|E
50|$|Challenge-response systems {{only need}} to send {{challenges}} to unknown senders. Senders that have previously performed the challenging action, or who have previously been sent e-mail(s) to, would be automatically <b>whitelisted.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{functionality}} is an enhancement {{to creating}} a <b>whitelist</b> manually, such as exporting customer, vendor, friends, or other contact lists from various sources, to then tediously assemble them into a <b>whitelist.</b> Additionally, {{the use of such}} a system removes the difficult task of maintaining a <b>whitelist</b> as new email relationships are formed.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{application}} level <b>whitelisting</b> is still {{vulnerable to a}} variety of attacks including those that make use of PowerShell or cross site scripting to launch scripts or inject malicious [...]DLLs onto an endpoint. Lower level <b>whitelisting</b> approaches that can monitor the specific processes and API calls are the deepest and strongest <b>whitelist</b> based cybersecurity solutions available today.|$|R
50|$|Security {{professionals}} tend {{to prefer}} <b>Whitelists,</b> because Blacklists may accidentally treat bad data as safe. However, {{in some cases}} a <b>whitelist</b> solution may not be easily implemented.|$|R
50|$|Amazon.com uses whitelists {{to limit}} {{access to its}} Kindle {{e-reader}} devices. Besides Amazon itself, only e-mail addresses <b>whitelisted</b> by the device's registered owner can send content ("personal documents") to that device.|$|E

50|$|Optionally, some {{automated}} <b>whitelisting</b> {{systems can}} review records of past email communications which were previously stored within an email server's (or email client's) archives {{for inclusion in}} the <b>whitelist.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Spamhaus White List (SWL) was {{released}} in October 2010 and is a <b>whitelist</b> of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The SWL is intended to allow mail servers to separate incoming email traffic into 3 categories: Good, Bad and Unknown. Only verified legitimate senders with clean reputations are approved for <b>whitelisting</b> and there are strict terms to keeping a Spamhaus <b>Whitelist</b> account.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>whitelist</b> is exclusive, only {{email from}} {{entities}} on the <b>whitelist</b> will get through. If {{it is not}} exclusive, it prevents email from being deleted or sent to the junk mail folder by the spam filter. Usually, only end-users would set a spam filter to delete all emails from sources not on the <b>whitelist,</b> not Internet service providers or email services.|$|R
50|$|Typically, a user has to {{manually}} add {{the sender}} or the sender’s address {{to a list}} of “approved” or “safe senders” within his or her email client for an address to be <b>whitelisted,</b> which is a different process in various email clients.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2012 {{several sources}} {{reported}} that Google had removed bisexual {{from the list}} of blacklisted terms for Instant Search. [...] the word bisexual still did not autocomplete, and LGBT activists renewed efforts to have it <b>whitelisted.</b> [...] "bisexuality" [...] (but not [...] "bisexual") and [...] "myleak" [...] were found.|$|E
50|$|Power Eraser is very {{aggressive}} against unknown threats {{which are not}} <b>whitelisted</b> and are instead marked for removal or sent for analysis. The tool also features rootkit scanning, which requires a system restart. Threat removal is also performed after restart, on the next boot, to avoid the self-protection of viruses and trojans.|$|E

50|$|In June 2005, Trend Micro, Inc. {{acquired}} Kelkea, {{which brought}} substantial improvement to the subscription mechanism, including a fully automated method for getting temporary subscriptions. In addition, subscribers {{were provided with}} personalised web pages where they can view reports, and also set up <b>whitelisting</b> and blacklisting options (<b>whitelisting</b> is particularly convenient, as it allows to <b>whitelist</b> thousands of IP addresses with a few clicks).|$|R
5000|$|The CSA <b>whitelist</b> is a {{positive}} list for email bulk senders. With ISPs and email-providers participating in the <b>whitelist,</b> solicited email {{does not need to}} enter the ISPs' spamfilter any longer - the chances of false positives (legitimate email erroneously tagged as spam) are supposedly reduced. Bulk email senders can apply for certification for the <b>whitelist.</b> They have to comply with the admission criteria, which assure that legal norms are fulfilled. A control committee monitors that participants adhere to the admission criteria. ISPs sign a licensing agreement setting the rules for the implementation of the <b>whitelist.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Spam {{filtering}} integrates with Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, and The Bat!. E-mail {{content is}} analysed and scored, and e-mail with scores above two specified thresholds are either marked as [...] "!!spam" [...] or [...] "??probably spam". The Mail Dispatcher feature shows subject and sender information for messages, and {{allows users to}} avoid downloading blatant spam by selecting which messages to download. The filter self-trains by analyzing incoming and outgoing e-mail not marked as spam, or by analyzing folders only containing spam or valid e-mail. Senders of verified valid e-mail are <b>whitelisted.</b> E-mail can also be <b>whitelisted</b> or blacklisted based on phrases present in the text. E-mail with non-ASCII characters or invisible text can also be blocked. However, version 7.0 had a relatively poor showing, misidentifying 30 percent of valid messages in PC Magazine testing. 30 percent of spam also made to the inbox.|$|E
50|$|Disseminating an {{ordinary}} email address that {{is protected by}} a C/R system will result in those who send mail to that address having their messages challenged. Some C/R critics consider it rude to give people your email address, then require them (unless previously <b>whitelisted,</b> which might not always be possible) to answer the challenge before they can send you mail.|$|E
50|$|AOL {{asserts that}} free email on AOL's service will {{continue}} to work as it always has, and a user {{will continue to}} receive all messages from a sender whom he has <b>whitelisted.</b> AOL subscribers will not be charged for sending or receiving email, and senders who do not prepay AOL will have their messages subject to the same spam filters as before.|$|E
5000|$|Google, a major {{provider}} of services on the Internet, experiments with using a type of DNS <b>whitelisting</b> on a per-ISP basis to prevent this until the World IPv6 Launch. In the DNS <b>whitelisting</b> approach, ISPs are determined from DNS lookup source IP addresses by correlating them with network prefixes derived from routing tables. There is an IETF draft entitled [...] "IPv6 AAAA DNS <b>Whitelisting</b> Implications" [...] that describes the issues around <b>whitelisting.</b> AAAA records are only sent to ISPs that can demonstrate that they are providing reliable IPv6 to their customers. Other ISPs are sent only A records, thus preventing users from attempting to connect over IPv6.|$|R
40|$|Big data {{requires}} {{new ways}} and technologies of how data is harnessed, managed {{and applied to}} create values that offer insights for better decision making. An exploration of MapReduce model which reliably accommodates big data processing requirements reveals that data traversing through nodes inside clusters during processing are exposed to security and privacy breaches. Further examination identifies elements in security task that impact MapReduce challenges. This paper concerns with the experimentation on how <b>Whitelist</b> access control element can enhance security within MapReduce environment using Hadoop platform. Datasets are executed through series of <b>Whitelist</b> coding/scripts. The enhancement is measured on a basis of <b>Whitelist</b> capability and effectiveness of reducing False Positive Rate error in different scenarios, comparing different sizes of applied <b>Whitelists,</b> key strengths used for filtering and the execution time. The results yield reduced False Positive Rate for <b>Whitelist,</b> supporting claim of an enhanced security but the execution time have increased, indicating lower overall performance...|$|R
50|$|Spam filters {{that come}} with email clients have both <b>whitelists</b> and blacklists of senders and {{keywords}} {{to look for in}} emails. If a spam filter keeps a <b>whitelist,</b> mail from the listed email addresses, domains, and/or IP address will always be allowed.|$|R
