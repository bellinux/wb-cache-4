25|$|A ribbon {{either side}} of the route from Spalding to Sutton Bridge was {{populated}} in Roman times, and was again evident in the Domesday Book. Enclosing and reclamation of the salt marsh to the north of this area took place from the seventeenth century, and drainage was overseen by the Court of Sewers. In 1793, the South Holland Drainage District was set up by Act of Parliament, and carried out extensive drainage work, but the schemes were hampered by the state of the River Nene outfall. This was replaced in 1832, and allowed the district to lower their own sluice in 1852, to provide better gravity discharge. The need to grow more food during and after the Second World War resulted in large areas of grassland being ploughed up for agriculture, and the drains were made deeper and wider to improve the soil conditions. The main outfall sluice was again rebuilt in 1937, and its construction involved the first use of <b>well</b> <b>point</b> dewatering equipment in England.|$|E

50|$|Wellpoints are small-diameter (about 50 mm) tubes with slots {{near the}} bottom that are {{inserted}} into the ground from which water is drawn by a vacuum generated by a dewatering pump. Wellpoints are typically installed at close centers in a line along or {{around the edge of}} an excavation. As a vacuum is limited to 0 bar, the height to which water can be drawn is limited to about 6 meters (in practice). Wellpoints can be installed in stages, with the first reducing the water level by up to five meters, and a second stage, installed at a lower level, lowering it further.The water trickling between the deep wells may be collected by a single row of <b>well</b> <b>point</b> at the toe.

50|$|According to Dr. Karlwerner Kaiser, {{formerly}} of Speyer Archaeological Monument Care (Archäologische Denkmalpﬂege Speyer), knowledge and archaeological ﬁnds thus far {{gathered for the}} area within Herschweiler-Pettersheim’s limits give no clue to any time before the 3rd or 4th century BC. The oldest ﬁnd witnessed to date has been a bronze disk neckring. The still unknown recovery site is presumably a worn-down barrow from the 4th century BC. The ﬁnd may <b>well</b> <b>point</b> to a Celtic estate, perhaps a “knightly estate”, in the Ohmbach valley. Somewhat more than 200 years less old is a ﬁnd consisting of a Celtic coin, which came from an unknown spot within municipal limits. It could bear witness, as a buried artifact from a settlement in the “later, pre-Christian Bronze Age” of the 1st or 2nd century BC, to a source in the ﬂoor of the dale or on the Ohmbach valley’s slopes. It could somehow be linked to an ancient road that ran through the dale. Eventually, the digs at the Roman-era villa rustica on Seitersstraße in 1961 led to the unearthing of ceramics from a settlement of the “later, pre-Christian Iron Age” right near the Roman site. This points to a yet-to-be-unearthed Celtic estate at this spot dating from the 1st century BC, a forerunner to the already known Roman estate, which was built of stone. A Celtic settlement in the Ohmbach valley around today’s Herschweiler-Pettersheim from the 3rd or 4th century BC melding into Roman times in the Palatinate is the picture that emerges from this. Even the name “Hühnerkopf”, borne by the peak that looms over the village to the east, {{can be traced to}} the description Hünenkopf (or in Middle High German, Hunnenkopf - that is, “Hun’s Head”, whereas the modern form means “Chicken’s Head”) and is therefore a linguistic clue as to an ancient population and its particular connection with the mountain. The building of the villa rustica from Roman times after the beginning of the Christian Era on a graded layer of débris, unearthed in the years 1959-1961, in which building remnants and potsherds were found, proves that in the 2nd century AD, a great wooden building with clay-ﬁlled timber framing once stood at the spot, but later burnt down before being replaced by the Roman complex. The ceramics unearthed 30 m behind the villa rustica show that there was a Celtic settlement tradition from the “later, pre-Christian Iron Age” into what was locally Roman times, lasting into the latter half of the 3rd century AD. After the Germanic invasions and the villa’s destruction in the late 3rd century, it is believed that the local area was not settled, and that virgin forest once again sprouted up on the site.|$|E
