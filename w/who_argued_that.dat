5|$|A 1977 BBC {{television}} debate discussed {{arguments for}} and against Myra Hindley's release, with Lord Longford on the side <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Hindley should be released and Ann West (the mother of Lesley Ann Downey) on the side arguing against any suggestion of Hindley being released and threatening to kill her if she ever got out of prison.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river pilots <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E
40|$|In “Image, Evidence, Argument,” Ian Dove defends an {{intriguing}} ‘middle ground’ between those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> there are “visual arguments” (notably Groarke) and skeptics <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> {{there are not}} (notably Johnson). I discuss one of Dove’s key examples, proposing a different analysis of it, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> {{there are problems with}} the “verbal repackaging” of the argument he suggests...|$|R
50|$|The {{arguments}} against {{the legality of}} the NSA fall into two broad categories: those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> FISA raises no Constitutional issues and therefore the NSA program is illegal on its face, and those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> FISA (perhaps purposefully) raises a Constitutional conflict which should be resolved in Congress' favor.|$|R
2500|$|The {{cause of}} {{economic}} malaise in the Maritimes {{is an issue}} of great debate and controversy among historians, economists, and geographers. The differing opinions can approximately be divided into the [...] "structuralists," [...] <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> poor policy decisions are to blame, and the others, <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> unavoidable technological and geographical factors caused the decline.|$|R
5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice. In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey. The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a test ban could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a test ban.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentary}} proved controversial. Mainstream media reception was mixed, and it provoked particular {{criticism from}} figures within the United Kingdom's Islamic community, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Holland ignored evidence supporting the orthodox account of early Islamic history. Government-approved regulatory authority Ofcom and the broadcaster Channel4 received an estimated 1200complaints regarding the program. Channel4 eventually cancelled a public {{screening of the}} documentary at their London headquarters after numerous threats of violence.|$|E
50|$|Criticism of ELF {{generally}} {{fall into}} three camps: Those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the language studied consists of learner errors rather than authentic variation; those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> ELF scholars are perpetuating {{the idea that}} ELF is a reified variety of English; and those who feel it is upholding notions of neutrality {{in the face of}} global domination through languages and discourse.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the understandings canvassed so far, justice may {{be understood as a}} human creation, rather than a discovery of harmony, divine command, or natural law. This claim can be understood in a number of ways, with the fundamental division being between those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> justice is the creation of some humans, and those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it is the creation of all humans.|$|R

5|$|Under fire, {{the beach}} groups {{collected}} the wounded and dead, located and marked minefields, attempted to maintain organisation, and directed vehicles and troops inland. The two battalions operated with the beach groups {{for a further}} six weeks. While the depleted Liverpool Irish disbanded in August, much of its strength having been transferred to other units as reinforcements, the 5th King's survived as a reduced cadre. Disbandment had only been avoided through the determination of Lieutenant Colonel G.D. Wreford-Brown, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the 5th Battalion was nearly the most senior unit active in the Territorial Army.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E

40|$|An age-old {{conflict}} {{around a}} seemingly simple question has resurfaced: {{why do we}} conserve nature? Contention around this issue {{has come and gone}} many times, but {{in the past several years}} we believe that it has reappeared as an increasingly acrimonious debate between, in essence, those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> nature should be protected for its own sake (intrinsic value) and those <b>who</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> we must also save nature to help ourselves (instrumental value) ...|$|R

5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|Cole Street and the Cole Street Conservation Precinct at Point Cook Base, RAAF Williams, {{are named}} for Adrian Cole. His decorations were {{held by the}} Naval and Military Club, Melbourne, {{where he had been}} a long-standing member. In July 2009, {{following}} the club's dissolution, the medals were to be auctioned along with other memorabilia. This action was challenged by Cole's family, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> his decorations were only on loan to the club, and should be donated to the Australian War Memorial (AWM). As the Supreme Court of Victoria deliberated on the case, the parties involved negotiated a settlement whereby Cole's medals would be transferred to the AWM.|$|E
5|$|If the Saxbe fix is a {{solution}} for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to {{the president in the}} form of an across-the-board cost of living adjustment by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Thulborn {{suggested}} that the large tusks of heterodontosaurids represented a secondary sex characteristic. According to this theory, only adult male individuals would have possessed fully developed tusks; the holotype specimen of the related Abrictosaurus, which lacked tusks altogether, would have represented a female. This hypothesis was questioned by palaeontologist Richard Butler and colleagues in 2006, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487 possessed tusks despite its early developmental state. At this state, secondary sex characteristics are not expected. Furthermore, tusks are present in almost all known Heterodontosaurus skulls; the presence of sexual dimorphism however would suggest a 50:50 ratio between individuals bearing tusks and those lacking tusks. The only exception is the holotype specimen of Abrictosaurus; the lack of tusks in this individual is interpreted as a specialisation of this particular genus.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Henderson {{graduated}} from Oakland Technical High School, {{where he played}} baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back {{with a pair of}} 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball. Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> football players had shorter careers. In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They have three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 McNallen {{was invited}} to the International Asatru Summer Camp, but this was opposed {{by many of the}} groups attending, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> he should not be invited because of what they {{perceived}} as his racist views; a number of European Heathen groups, such as Norway's Bifrost and the Swedish SAS, threatened to boycott the event as a result of McNallen's invite. In 2011, the AFA sent a contingent to the annual conference of a white nationalist organization, the National Policy Institute, in what some figures close to McNallen revealed was an attempt to recruit members. After this incident was publicized it resulted in accusations of racism being levelled against McNallen and the AFA from various parts of the Pagan blogosphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, <b>who</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.|$|E
