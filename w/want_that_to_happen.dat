Frank told The Washington Post after McKinney's death that there was [...] "An unfortunate debate about 'Was he or wasn't he? Didn't he or did he?' I said to myself, I don't <b>want</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to me." [...] Frank's announcement had little impact on his electoral prospects. Shortly after coming out, Frank met and began dating Herb Moses, an economist and LGBT activist; their relationship lasted for eleven years until an amicable break-up in July 1998. Moses, who was an executive at Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998, was the first partner of an openly gay member of Congress to receive spousal benefits and the two were considered [...] "Washington's most powerful and influential gay couple".|$|E

The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind.

2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't <b>want</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision now whether you're going to pick us up or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E

40|$|It is {{a commonplace}} {{that we have}} reason to care about ourselves, to pursue our own interests, to do what {{benefits}} us, and to save ourselves from harm. What is contentious is the strength of these reasons, and what else we have reason to do. Details aside, most would accept the following claim: Self-Concern: The fact that an event will benefit or harm me is a {{reason for me to}} want, or not <b>to</b> <b>want,</b> <b>that</b> event <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> This reason derives from the effects of the event on my well-being, not its effects on anything else. And its force as a reason turns on its first person character. This principle can be clarified in three ways. First, that benefit and harm provide me with reasons of this kind is a generic proposition, which may admit exceptions. The fact that I would benefit from an immoral act may be a reason <b>to</b> prefer it <b>that</b> is outweighed by moral objections, or it may be silenced by morality, so not a reason at all. [1] Both views are consistent with Self-Concern, which speaks to the ordinary case. Second, the reasons in question do not derive from the instrumental significance of my well-being for some further end: the general happiness, say, or the fulfillment of my obligations. Benefiting me may contribute to the greater good, and harm may prevent me from acting as I should. If these facts are reasons for preference, they are not reasons of self-concern, whose normative explanation stops with my well-being...|$|R
5000|$|Rehaai is {{the story}} of Shamim, a woman married off when she was barely more than a child. Her brutish son Waseem is married to Shehnaz, a wife he uses as a {{convenient}} punching bag anytime he feels the need to vent his frustration, about anything and everything. The opening chapter revolved around Waseem’s increasingly vocal demand for an heir. Though Shehnaz has an unlikely ally in her mother-in-law, there is nonetheless a steady trickle of neighbors who drop in frequently to remind Shamim and Shehnaz of her inability to bear Waseem’s child. Out of all these [...] "well-wishers," [...] none is more insidious than chacha Inayat, who regularly fans the flames of Waseem’s desire to father a child. It is evident that Inayat is merely using Waseem’s childlessness as a means to further his own end, but the solution he offers is beyond macabre. Inayat offers up his own preteen child, Kulsoom as the bride, asserting that a younger woman can produce heirs much faster than an older woman such as Shehnaz. Waseem agrees to Inayat’s proposal and threatens his mother and wife of dire consequences if they {{stand in the way of}} his gaining the object of his desire. The story follows the consequences caused by this child marriage. Although Kulsum is Waseem's second wife, Shehnaz adores Kulsum as her daughter instead of hating her. Shameem's sister has a son Akmal. Akmal is helpful to Shameem, Shehnaz and Kulsum. He has a liking towards Kulsum. Kulsum grows and gives birth to 3 daughters which makes Waseem angry. He doubts that something in going between Akmal and Kulsum and so Waseem beats Akmal. Waseem does not earn even a single penny and so their condition becomes from bad to worse because of which Shameem is forced to become a maid. All the neighbours make fun of Shameem. Shameem's sister starts hating her because Waseem had beaten Akmal and tells Akmal not to help them. But Akmal could not see their condition and helps them secretly. He later convinces his mother. Meanwhile, Waseem has run out of the house and has married Noor Jahan. Noor Jahan had already married 2 times. But they do not get along as Waseem is a gharjamai and Noor Jahan's mother hates him. She throws him out of the house. Then he meets his long lost friend who was doing an illegal business of gambling. Police attacks them and Waseem gets shot by a gun because of which he is handicapped. On the other hand, Shameem, Shehnaz and Kulsum had started a clothing business which makes Waseem jealous. One day when Shameem told Kulsum to go to Akmal's shop for calculation, Waseem shouts at her mother and tells her that she is solding Kulsum towards Akmal and so she is shameless. She tells [...] "I'm shameless because I gave birth to such a child who spoilt a girl's life and her daughter-in-law's i.e Shehnaz life. He is in a shock. From that day Waseem feels guilty of what he had done and asks for forgiveness from Shameem, Shehnaz and Kulsum. They forgive and Waseem decides that Kulsum should marry Akmal. Chacha Inayat fights with Waseem but Waseem does not change his mind. But Kulsum thinks that she has no respect in society and she could not remarry. She tries to commit suicide. The very next day Shehnaz's sister comes and asks Kulsum's daughter's hand for her son. Shehnaz gets furious as she is very young and she does not <b>want</b> <b>that</b> what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her mother (Kulsum)to happen with Kulsums daughter. Her daughter tells Waseem that she does not want to marry and wants to become a doctor. Shameem is listening to them and is scared if Waseem allows the marriage. But he encourages his daughter to study making Shameem happy. In this way Shameem gets freedom or Rehaai from the society's evil traditions making the show end on a happy note.|$|R
