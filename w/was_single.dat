5|$|The line <b>was</b> <b>single</b> tracked between Appledore and Ore on 1 October 1979, {{leaving a}} passing loop at Rye. At Winchelsea, the down {{platform}} was removed; trains {{in both directions}} now stop on the former up platform. Line speed was reduced from 85mph to 60mph, but there are additional long term speed restrictions in place, including 40mph between Doleham and Ore and 20mph across a half barrier level crossing at Winchelsea.|$|E
5|$|Williamson's {{work during}} this decade was his most {{prolific}} {{in terms of}} comic book work and has garnered considerable praise for its high quality. He has been noted for his perfectionism and love for the medium. Despite its high reputation, S.C. Ringgenberg felt that Williamson's artwork from this period could at times be uneven and uninspired. Williamson <b>was</b> <b>single</b> during this period and, according to The Art of Al Williamson, had a bohemian and undisciplined lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|After her {{engagement}} to Day ended, Sabrina {{spent eight years}} at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met {{and went on to}} marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sabrina met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell <b>was</b> <b>single</b> and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not paid much attention to Sabrina since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto <b>was</b> <b>single</b> with no children.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier <b>was</b> <b>single</b> breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

The Maerdy branch (Rhondda Fach) passenger service was withdrawn on 15 June 1964, and the branch <b>was</b> <b>singled</b> later that year.

25|$|In 1974 a {{campaign}} was begun by Stoke Parish Council to re-open {{the line to}} passenger traffic. This proposal was opposed by BR {{on the grounds that}} as the line <b>was</b> <b>single</b> track only, a passenger service would interfere with the line's freight operations. There were also signalling complications.|$|E
25|$|The line <b>was</b> <b>single</b> track, {{except for}} two {{crossing}} loops: one {{just south of the}} bridge and the other just south of Mount Pleasant Road.

Buses replaced the tram services.|$|E
25|$|Designed under {{instructions}} from LB Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, {{the line was}} constructed to take double track.
