He wrote an autobiographical fitness book, Train Like an Action Hero: Be Fit Forever, published in Sweden (by Bonnier Fakta) on 9 August 2011, offering tips he learned over the years to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> various situations (with a busy schedule and a lot of traveling). On 9 September 2014, Lundgren published Dolph Lundgren: Train Like an Action Hero: Be Fit Forever, a book which contains a detailed account of his earlier life and troubles. He cites a better quality of life as having inspired him to maintain his physical fitness.|$|E
5|$|Macaulay was {{selected}} for the third Test against Australia at Headingley, possibly because Arthur Carr, the England captain, expected the pitch to favour spinners. The Australians were concerned that Macaulay represented {{a threat to their}} batting, but the match did not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Macaulay's favour as a bowler; having been dropped at the start of play, Charlie Macartney played what Wisden called one of the best innings of his career and vigorously attacked the England bowling, achieving the rare feat of scoring a century before the lunch interval. The Australian batsman had asked his captain if he could attack Macaulay in particular, and the Yorkshire bowler suffered as Macartney quickly dominated him. Macaulay eventually had Macartney caught after hitting a short ball in the air, but it was Macaulay's only success in the innings. Macaulay conceded 123 runs in 32 overs as Australia scored 494. When Macaulay came into bat from number ten in the batting order, England were 182 for eight wickets and facing defeat. He played an attacking innings of 76, hitting ten fours, in a partnership of 108 with George Geary. This began an England recovery which helped the team to escape with a draw. Nevertheless, Macaulay did not play in the final two Tests of the series. Later in the season, he took fourteen wickets for 92 runs against Gloucestershire, including eight for 43 in the second innings. These were the best bowling figures of his career that he achieved in a match. Apart from his batting success in the Test match, Macaulay scored another two fifties and in the match against Somerset achieved a century.|$|E

It was never published, as Hall had been relying on the viscount's sponsorship of the project. Walter Hall attempted to bring the <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1939, but was prevented by paper shortages during the Second World War. At this date, the Reverend A. L. Moir, vicar of St Mary's and St Michael's, Burleydam, also attempted to obtain the manuscript for publication without success. The manuscript, which ran to 780 foolscap sheets and covered many of the small settlements near the abbey, has since been lost.|$|E

[...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E

Pasi Saukkonen, {{a political scientist at the}} University of Helsinki, made a comparison between similar EU referendums in Denmark and Ireland (following which a similar referendum passed the measure, though it was in turn followed by a similar proposed measure) where the smaller EU member states wielded immense influence; though he said that such controversial matters usually <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the end.|$|E

500|$|According to Poe, Janeway Lambda one was {{an example}} of an idea that [...] "sounded good in theory, ... didn't <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> practice", and was {{abandoned}} since everyone disliked it. Taylor reported that fans' lack of interest, and the criticism of Janeway being portrayed in the role of a servant or subordinate, resulted in the holonovel being discontinued. Seymour attributed the storyline's removal to the decision to avoid excessive use of the holodeck. Taylor wrote a conclusion for the novel, which was never developed into an episode, and she expressed disappointment that the narrative was left incomplete. Despite feeling attached to the project, she allowed that she was [...] "never afraid to cut our losses if something wasn't working". The holonovel was replaced with Janeway seeking counsel from a holographic version of Leonardo da Vinci. In her book Star Trek, Ina Rae Hark wrote that this decision was taken to make the series more appealing to a male audience.|$|E
500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the end.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was {{directed}} by Michael Haussman, and is a lavish period-style piece filmed from November 3–8, 1994 in Ronda and in the bullring of Antequera, Spain. In the video Madonna wore a fitted, classic suit by British fashion designer John Galliano. The costumes worn by Madonna in the video were created by stylist Lori Goldstein who received the VH1 Fashion and Media award for best styling. Other designers who provided clothing included Donatella Versace and a then-unknown Christian Louboutin. Madonna had a 1940s style on her, with tight corset, silk dresses and a black-veiled hat. The plot of the video was set in the 1940s, depicting Madonna as a neglected lover of a bullfighter, played by real-life Spanish actor and bullfighter Emilio Muñoz. Madonna's character yearns for the bullfighter's presence, with erotic heartbreak. In an interview with MTV's Kurt Loder {{on the set of}} the music video, Madonna said that when she was initially writing [...] "Take a Bow" [...] the inspiration for the song was an actor, but she wanted the male character in the video to be a matador instead because she wanted the video to be about an [...] "obsessive, tragic love story that doesn't <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the end" [...] and a matador would be more visually effective in expressing the emotion of the song.|$|E

In the summer, David Beckham also moved to Real Madrid, while Juan Sebastián Verón joined Chelsea. United in the meantime rebuilt their team: Tim Howard replaced Barthez in goal and Kléberson, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Cristiano Ronaldo came in to bolster the squad. Ronaldinho might have also joined [...] "had he not said yes, then no, to our offer".

The resulting applications were highly portable, although Microsoft's focus and IBM's standardization on MS-DOS eventually made portability less important.

2500|$|There are few {{empirical}} studies linking {{the use of}} balanced scorecards to better decision making or improved financial performance of companies, but some {{work has been done}} in these areas. Broadcast surveys of usage have difficulties in this respect, due to the wide variations in definition of 'what a balanced scorecard is' noted above (making it hard to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a survey if you are comparing like with like). [...] Single organization case studies suffer from the 'lack of a control' issue common to any study of organizational change – what the organization would have achieved if the change had not been made isn't known, so it is difficult to attribute changes observed over time to a single intervention (such as introducing a balanced scorecard). [...] However, such studies as have been done have typically found balanced scorecard to be useful.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{maintains}} {{a strong sense}} of continuity—characters and plots from past episodes are often referenced or expanded on. Occasionally, story arcs span multiple episodes and even entire seasons, the most memorable being season four, which revolved around the pilot pitch to NBC by Jerry and George. Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in [...] "The Stake Out" [...] and he ends the relationship when things do not <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> [...] "The Stock Tip". Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the [...] "Peterman catalog". Larry David, the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. Curb Your Enthusiasm—David's later comedy series—expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the ideas}} of the {{movement}} were anticipated by A.W.N. Pugin (1812–1852), a leader in the Gothic revival in architecture. For example, he, like the Arts and Crafts artists, advocated truth to material, structure and function. Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society (such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor) unfavorably with the Middle Ages, a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book Contrasts (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer Rosemary Hill notes that in it he [...] "reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmaship and tradition in architecture that it would take the rest of the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to <b>work</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> detail." [...] She describes the spare furnishings he specified for a building in 1841 - [...] "rush chairs, oak tables" [...] - as [...] "the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo." ...|$|E
