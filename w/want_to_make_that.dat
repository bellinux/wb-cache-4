500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{directed}} by Wim Wenders, produced by Debbie Mason, and edited by Jerry Chater. The video was filmed in Berlin {{over the course of}} three days, primarily in black-and-white but with some sequences in colour. It contains cameos of some of the actors who appeared in Faraway, So Close!, including Otto Sander, as well as Wenders' nephew. Several scenes are taken directly from Faraway, So Close! and Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, which also served as the principal inspiration for the video's premise. Wenders noted that [...] "making a video is really a very different ballgame. You have the script, so to speak, because you have the song, and everything you do is in order to help the song shine... You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> song look as good as possible and sound as good as possible and as interesting as possible." [...] Several shots depict the band members standing on the statue of Victoria, a monument {{at the top of the}} Berlin Victory Column; a model of the angel was created for those scenes. Leftover military equipment from the Cold War, including the Soviet MiG, were included in the background.|$|E
500|$|In April 1969, Clancy {{got married}} and went on a honeymoon trip around the world, swimming, surfing and [...] "getting some sun." [...] He said, however, {{marriage}} had not reduced his desire to play football. [...] "Just the opposite", he said. [...] "I'm more hungry than ever. [...] I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> money." [...] After a season on crutches, the UPI reported: [...] "The former rookie wonder wants to get back under quarterback Bob Griese's passes, to reclaim his billing as the Miami Dolphins' top receiver. [...] Despite a scar on his knee, Clancy was dashing, cutting and jumping for passes during summer workouts. [...] However, even Clancy acknowledged the injury had slowed him down: [...] "I'm still {{a couple of steps}} slower than before the operation. [...] But I'm optimistic. [...] It doesn't pain me. [...] I figure I have a month to work the way I want to, I'll be all right." [...] Clancy's comeback appeared to be on track in early November, as he was a close second among Miami receivers with 21 catches for 289 yards. [...] However, the comeback was cut short on November 2, 1969, when he suffered torn ligaments, this time to his right knee in a loss to the New York Jets. [...] Clancy missed the final six games of the 1969 season due to the injury.|$|E
2500|$|Joey Ramone stated [...] "I {{spent most}} of the early 70s {{listening}} to Slade Alive! thinking to myself, [...] "Wow – this is what I want to do. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> kind of intensity for myself. A couple of years later I was at CBGB's doing my best Noddy Holder." [...] Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated [...] "Slade never compromised. We always had the feeling that they were on our side. I don't know but I think we were right." [...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E

Because of the large budget that would be required, Kelly said he will look into securing the necessary resources, once he finishes with his next film.|$|R

5000|$|According to the singer, he had {{initially}} thought about Nigeria turning 53 on 1 October and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> day a special one {{for himself and}} his fans.

50|$|The Dushkins were passionate {{in their}} love of music, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> love {{a part of the}} {{everyday}} life of as many children as they could reach.

60|$|But {{now it was}} different. Berande meant everything. It must succeed--not {{merely because}} Joan was a partner in it, but because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> {{partnership}} permanently binding. Three more years and the plantation would be a splendid-paying investment. They could then take yearly trips to Australia, and oftener; and an occasional run home to England--or Hawaii, would come {{as a matter of}} course.|$|R

I have lost myself and I must forget myself by getting hold of something bigger than myself. And becoming that. That's why I have been making a sort of historical pilgrimage.... That's my story, Sir Richmond. That's my education.... Somehow though your troubles are different, {{it seems to me that}} my little muddle makes me understand how it is with you. What you've got, this idea of a scientific ordering of the world, is what I, in my younger, less experienced way, have been feeling my way towards. I want to join on. I want to got hold of this idea of a great fuel control in the world and of a still greater economic and educational control of which it is a part. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> idea a part of myself. Rather I want to make myself a part of it. When you talk of it I believe in it altogether." ...|$|E

2500|$|Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines, {{with their}} {{alternating}} heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as Lemmy from Motörhead and Johnny Ramone.

5000|$|While making Escape Fire, Heineman {{said his}} goal was to be {{politically}} agnostic and offer solutions, not just problems. “So many of these documentaries - you know, you sort of walk out of them feeling depressed and hopeless.

"Oh, yes; I {{worked with}} him a long time, and gave him {{information}} which helped him very much in writing his histories; {{but it would have}} been of greater advantage to the world if he had adhered more closely to my statements.

50|$|On D-Day, {{when the}} Allies invaded Normandy, France, Warlimont telephoned General Jodl to {{request that the}} German tanks in Normandy should be {{released}} to attack the Allied invaders. Jodl responded {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> decision; they would have to wait until Hitler awoke. Once Hitler awoke and authorised the release of the tanks for a counter-attack, {{it was too late to}} blunt the successful Allied invasion. The following day, Hitler sent Warlimont to inspect the German defences in Italy.|$|E
50|$|Personal Choice. The {{taxpayer}} here is {{choosing to}} work at the clothing boutique. On the one hand, we want people to be employed and we don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> harder by forcing certain persons to make expenditures that prevent employment. On the other hand, Mrs. Pevsner chose {{to work at}} an upscale clothing boutique. She reasonably knew that the dress requisite for work would likely be something that she may not wear otherwise. But, she did receive some breaks. First, she was allowed to wear the clothing outside of work. Then, she was allowed to purchase the clothing at a discount. Finally, she got a lot of use out of the clothing. She wore it to work, to independent meetings, and to fashion shows. This demonstrates the versatility and adaptability of the clothing.|$|E
5000|$|Variously {{described}} as a [...] "prodigy", a [...] "badass virtuoso", and a classical music [...] "sex symbol", Jean Rondeau began playing harpsichord at age six having first heard the instrument {{on the radio and}} declaring to his parents [...] "I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> sound". He ultimately spent a decade studying under Blandine Verlet. He went on to graduate from Paris' Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique and undertook further study at London's Guildhall School of Music where he was taught by Carole Cerasi and James Johnstone. In 2012 Rondeau won first place in the harpsichord competition at the Musica Antiqua Festival in Bruges, Belgium. The same year he was given the European Union's EUBO Development Trust Prize and won second-place at the Prague Spring International Harpsichord Competition.|$|E

5|$|Val Guest, who had {{directed}} The Quatermass Xperiment, returned for Quatermass 2. Guest once again sought {{to create a}} film that felt as real as possible, using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film's climactic scenes. Guest planned each day’s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> day.|$|R

5000|$|Supporters of the Jesse Ventura faction began {{encouraging}} Donald Trump {{to enter}} the race, likely as a placeholder for Ventura, who {{said he would not}} consider a presidential bid until after his term as governor ended. On October 25, 1999, Trump joined the Reform Party. and for a brief time he seemed to be a credible alternative to Buchanan. His pre-campaign gained a great deal of media attention. It seemed as though the primaries would amount to a showdown between Buchanan and Trump, the latter of whom remained confident he could win not only the primary, but also the general election. Trump told reporters: [...] "It's not so much the Reform Party, it's really the fact that I'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> if I ran and {{spent a lot of money}} I could actually win, I could beat that Democrat-Republican apparatus." ...|$|E
5000|$|In October 2007, details {{began to}} emerge of a British Government plan that might end the Common Travel Area {{encompassing}} the United Kingdom and Ireland (and also the Isle of Man and Channel Islands) in 2009, possibly creating an anomalous position for Northern Ireland in the process. In a statement to Dáil Éireann, the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern assured the House that [...] "British authorities have no plans whatsoever to introduce any controls on the land border between North and South. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> clear. All {{they are looking at}} is increased cross-border cooperation, targeting illegal immigrants." [...] This immediately raised concerns north of the border. Jim Allister, {{a former member of the}} Democratic Unionist Party and then a Member of the European Parliament, told The Times that it would be [...] "intolerable and preposterous if citizens of the UK had to present a passport to enter another part of the UK".|$|E

I didn’t think it was right for me, but I couldn’t explain why. So I finally went {{to the head of the}} William Morris Agency and he gave me three reasons why I should make this movie. He said “It’s {{important}} to keep making movies. Look at the billing you’re getting. Look at your money you’re getting.” He didn’t say “Maybe this is a career move.” He wasn’t thinking that way either. He thought it was important to be seen and the money was good. But if you’re thinking of a career and properties you want to associate yourself with, none of that was happening and I didn’t know how to make it happen. I don’t say that with any real regret, but it was something I had to learn.|$|E
