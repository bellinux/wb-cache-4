5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend {{hours at a time}} in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
25|$|When Lovecraft visited New Orleans in June 1932, Howard telegraphed Price {{to alert}} {{him to the}} visitor's presence, and the two writers {{spent much of the}} {{following}} week together. A disproven myth claims that Price took Lovecraft to a New Orleans brothel, where Lovecraft <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> to find that several of the employees there were fans of his work; the same apocryphal story was originally told about Seabury Quinn sometime earlier.|$|E

25|$|Voigt {{was arrested}} on 26 October and on 1 December sentenced to four {{years in prison for}} forgery, impersonating an officer and {{wrongful}} imprisonment. However, much of public opinion was on his side. German Kaiser Wilhelm II pardoned him on 16 August 1908. There are some claims that even the Kaiser <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> by the incident, referring to him as an amiable scoundrel, and being pleased with the authority and feelings of reverence that his military obviously commanded in the general population.|$|E
25|$|According to the Church Tradition, Christianity {{was first}} {{brought to the}} {{territory}} of modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine by Saint Andrew, the first Apostle of Jesus Christ. He traveled over the Black Sea to the Greek colony of Chersonesus Taurica in Crimea, where he converted several thousand men to new faith. Allegedly Saint Andrew traveled also north along the Dnieper River, where Kiev would be founded around the 5th century, and {{as far north as}} the future location of Veliky Novgorod. The legendary account of the Rus'ian Primary Chronicle tells that Saint Andrew <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> by the Slavic customs of washing in hot steam bath, banya, on his way.|$|E
25|$|In year 1843 Barnum {{hired the}} {{traditional}} Native American dancer fu-Hum-Me, {{the first of}} many Native Americans he presented. During 1844–45, Barnum toured with Tom Thumb in Europe and met Queen Victoria, who <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> and saddened by the little man, and the event was a publicity coup. It opened the door to visits from royalty across Europe including the Czar of Russia and let him acquire dozens of attractions, including automatons and other mechanical marvels. He was almost able to buy the birth home of William Shakespeare. Barnum spent about three years abroad with Thumb. Barnum went on a spending spree, buying other museums, including Peale's museum in Philadelphia, the nation's first major museum. By late 1846, Barnum's Museum was drawing 400,000 visitors a year.|$|E

25|$|In 751, An again visited Chang'an. On An's {{birthday}} on 20 February, 751, Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Yang rewarded {{him with}} clothing, treasures, and food. On 23 February, when An {{was summoned to}} the palace, Consort Yang, in order to please Emperor Xuanzong, had an extra-large infant wrapping made, and wrapped the obese An in it, causing much laughter among the ladies in waiting and eunuchs. When Emperor Xuanzong asked what was going on, Consort Yang's attendants joked that Consort Yang gave birth three days before and was washing her baby Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> by the comic situation and rewarded both Consort Yang and An greatly. Thereafter, whenever An visited the capital, he was allowed free admittance to the palace, and there were rumors that he and Consort Yang had an affair, but Emperor Xuanzong discounted the rumors.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 Courtneidge and Hulbert {{suffered}} a serious setback when {{they discovered that}} their financial manager had been speculating with their money, suffering heavy losses and putting their business into liquidation. Hulbert accepted responsibility for all the business's debts and undertook to repay every creditor. To achieve this, he and Courtneidge temporarily went their separate professional ways, reasoning that they could earn more as individual stars than as a double act. A boom in the film industry enabled both to earn large sums; Courtneidge appeared in 11 British films and one Hollywood film in the 1930s. She <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> to find that in eight weeks in a film studio she could earn more than she could in {{a year in the}} theatre. She and Hulbert managed to work together on several films, including The Ghost Train (1931) and Jack's the Boy (1932).|$|E
25|$|Kỳ {{began his}} {{association}} with the American covert operations community in 1961. While still ranked as a major commanding Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base, {{he became the first}} pilot for South Vietnam's presidential liaison officer, which was organizing to infiltrate military intelligence teams into North Vietnam. He recruited pilots from his command for this intelligence program of the Central Intelligence Agency, and flew some of the missions himself after being trained by an expert pilot from Air America. At one point, Kỳ took the CIA's Saigon station chief, William Colby, for a demonstration low-level flight. Kỳ's flight training graduation gift for himself and his pilots was a flight to Singapore, where he purchased black flight suits, silk scarfs, and cigarette lighters for all hands. Colby <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> by his flight but unhappy with the selection of flashy attire.|$|E

25|$|His {{interest}} in first-hand {{investigation of the}} human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and universalist theories. Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a critical eye. Like Junimea, he <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> by the cultural legacy of 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed {{that there was a}} clear difference between the first generation of liberal activists—Ion Câmpineanu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Nicolae Bălcescu—and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption. He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu. At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the Conservatives. He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to take inspiration from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.|$|E

He wrote a [...] "jazz band piece" [...] that Imogen later arranged for orchestra as Capriccio. Having composed operas throughout his life with varying success, Holst found for his last opera, The Wandering Scholar, what Matthews calls [...] "the right medium for his oblique sense of humour, writing with economy and directness".|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reception}} in Nigeria was mixed. When Hill tried {{to promote the}} book in West Africa, he was met with scepticism and ridicule. The faculty at the University of Ibadan <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> {{at the thought of}} a worthwhile novel being written by an alumnus. Others were more supportive; one review in the magazine Black Orpheus said: [...] "The book as a whole creates for the reader such a vivid picture of Ibo life that the plot and characters are little more than symbols representing a way of life lost irrevocably within living memory." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} the New York premiere, the critics greeted Gianni Schicchi warmly; most reviewers {{found it to}} be the best of the three operas. New York Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel described it as [...] "so uproariously funny... so full of life, humor, and ingenious devices". The New York Times reviewer James Huneker considered the opera to be [...] "a rollicking, madcap scherzo, overflowing with merry deviltries... And the last shall be first." [...] Huneker praised De Luca as [...] "a most engaging rascal, fit for a minor niche in Moliere's gallery". The Times critic also <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> by Marto Malatesta as [...] "The 'Kid' Gherardino, who is spanked by the irate family".|$|E

500|$|Reviewers have praised Chulip for {{a charming}} presentation, quirky characters, and absurd, Japanese humor. Admitting {{that the game}} had some blurry or {{pixelated}} textures and cramped environments, both Seff and Davis noted the peculiar art style of Chulip to be aesthetically pleasing. Seff specifically found the game [...] "surprisingly easy on the eyes" [...] and to feature unique character designs, [...] "wacky" [...] dialogue, and an art style comparable to other titles like the Mother series and Katamari Damacy. Davis <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> by the script and the townsfolk's gibberish speech, and was satisfied with largely a cappella soundtrack. Seff was unimpressed by the game's audio, remarking the music as [...] "entirely boring".|$|E
500|$|Festivities {{began in}} the {{afternoon}} {{on the day before}} his birthday, when Hitler rode in the lead car of a motorcade of fifty white limousines along architect Albert Speer's newly completed East-West Axis, the planned central boulevard for Welthauptstadt Germania, which was to be the new capital after the planned victory in World War II. Hitler, anticipating that Speer would give a speech, <b>was</b> <b>amused</b> when he evaded this by briefly announcing that the work should speak for itself. The next event was a torchlit procession of appointments from all over Germany, which Hitler reviewed from a balcony in the Reich Chancellery. Then, at midnight, Hitler's courtiers congratulated him and presented him with gifts, including, [...] "Statues, bronze casts, Meissen porcelain, oil-paintings, tapestries, rare coins, antique weapons, and a mass of other presents, many of them kitsch. Hitler admired some, made fun of others, and ignored most." ...|$|E
500|$|The notes {{range from}} nearly {{insignificant}} details to major discrepancies and deliberate distortions. [...] They have a self-deprecatory tone that {{is common in}} North American comics, tracing its roots to the awkwardly self-aware underground comix of the 1960s and 1970s. [...] They also reveal Brown's process in shaping the story from conflicting sources. [...] He acknowledges {{some of the more}} capricious details. [...] He explains he was not committed to the conspiracy theory he presented, but included it in order to present Macdonald in a certain light: [...] "illains are fun in a story", he said, and he was [...] "trying to tell this tale in an engaging manner". [...] He also included a [...] "Major-General Thomas Bland Strange" [...] in an 1885 meeting at which the general was not actually present.
