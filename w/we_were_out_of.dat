500|$|The Americans {{were pulling}} out of Southeast Asia as quickly as {{negotiations}} with the North Vietnamese would allow them. Ambassador Godley, stunned by the diplomatic developments, ruminated that [...] "We had led him (Souvanna) down the garden path. Let's face it, we were cutting and running... Once <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Vietnam {{the only way we}} could have protected Laos was with an Army corps. It was totally out of the question and we knew it. We were licked." [...] Souvanna then faced a dilemma, sign a separate agreement with the Pathet Lao on almost any terms, or continue the war with no prospect of success. Hanoi was also desirious to obtain a quick agreement with Vientiane. The sooner the fighting in Laos ceased, the sooner the Hanoi would obtain unimpeded use of the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "dynamic and intelligent" [...] Chapin was {{appointed}} to fill the CEO position at AMC following the departure of Roy Abernethy in 1967, along with William Luneburg as president. Chapin realized he was taking over at a crucial time; The Wall Street Journal described it as [...] "a dying company." [...] At the time, Chapin said, [...] "We're {{going to have to}} show ingenuity." [...] He reflected later that the most difficult period was [...] "... when our president, Bill Luneburg, and I took over. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money and we had to do something to overcome the immediate problems. We had no time to think about long-range problems. Obviously, we managed to solve immediate considerations..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Ulver’s evolution, Rygg said, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} will be surprised. The shock value is gone, I think it went away with Metamorphosis. Since then, the changes haven't been {{fundamental}} at all.” Continuing, “I think the shapeshifting story {{is one that}} has been greatly exaggerated by the media. There have been a couple of twists and turns after the Blake record, that's granted, but nothing too significant. I see Ulver as having a part one and a part two. And that's a division that we already had in our minds before those first three albums were even finished. We already knew we were going somewhere else after Nattens madrigal. Due to logistics, we had to wait almost two years until that one got released, and in the interim we had amassed a huge array of influences. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our teens and our outlook was becoming more complex." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the next}} moment <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that room and in the cab and moving quick.|$|R
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. Well, I {{think you}} might at least drop them until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> mourning.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} a strategist," [...] Forrest remarked grimly. [...] "Do as she says, Cecil. The sooner <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this, the better." ...|$|R
60|$|Within a {{few minutes}} afterwards, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the canal, and in the Ohio river again.|$|E
60|$|He glanced {{round to}} make sure <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> earshot, then sunk his voice to a whisper.|$|E
60|$|She looked round cautiously. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{plantation}} now, {{in the open}} park, where eavesdropping was impossible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Into the bedchamber of the Lady Letitia Mandeleys!" [...] {{he proclaimed}} triumphantly. [...] "Keep your voice low, boy. Remember <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> doors." ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Turning on him, sarcastically.] I'm glad someone's feeling good. [Wearily.] Gee, I sure wish <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this dump {{and back}} in New York.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear papa and all, good-bye. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{sight of}} land. Three years, and keep {{up a good}} heart. I shall soon be all right.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You won't go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!' I commenced, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house. 'You are not {{dreaming of}} it, are you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Makarooroo, quick march, and don't draw rein till {{we reach}} the cave," [...] said Jack when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight of the canoe.|$|E
6000|$|Once {{the night}} began to shut in, however, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight, and Darius {{said as we}} hauled in the drags for the last time: ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain {{dropped his}} gun upon the ground. [...] "Miss Markham!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Mrs. Cliff! I truly believe <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all danger--that we--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that!" [...] Mr. Hethcote said, as {{the fire}} ceased and the boats headed for a light hung up to direct then.|$|R
6000|$|A certain added {{brightness}} {{came into}} Ann's face. [...] "Nobody won't {{be able to}} come leaving cards on us, Artie, now, any more. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|And <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{sight of}} land {{without a single}} {{celestial}} body to guide us! Even the pendent world was not visible from our position! ...|$|E
60|$|Turning as {{he spoke}} and making an easy way for us, he stopped when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the press in a corner behind a great red curtain.|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} {{him from the}} room, and when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing on the stoep inquired what he thought. I {{did not like the}} look of that leg.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{live or die}} {{together}} this day," [...] said he; [...] "keep but fast hold till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the press, and then my horse is yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank goodness, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that at last!" [...] exclaimed Matt, as {{the road}} finally {{appeared}} in sight. [...] "Now {{to see if any}} damage has been done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let us hurrah until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the woods," [...] added Dick soberly. [...] "We are in {{the hands}} of a desperate gang, to my way of reasoning." ...|$|R
6000|$|These words {{caused the}} Englishman to glance back apprehensively, and hurry on faster than ever. [...] "It's a beastly woods," [...] he said. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I mean, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing, but we {{saw them}} at it, and {{walked up and down}} till Lance got tired out, and Willie and I stayed to make it proper.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Let me {{take you}} to Winks and Pinks,” she said as soon as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the building: “they’ve got such lovely shades of blotting-paper—pearl and {{heliotrope}} and momie and crushed—” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the woods}} or not," [...] said {{the owner of}} the launch. [...] "Where there is one bob cat there are often more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall ask no {{questions}} till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the harbour, {{or you will}} be running foul {{of one of those}} colliers--a tribute with which the Fair Unknown may dispense.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do? I'd rather take my chances on the Sally, even if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight of land, than stay here another minute. This brig has got ghosts aboard!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ugh! I wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this!" [...] muttered Matt, as {{he tried}} in vain to pierce the gloom ahead. [...] "You must find the road, Billy, for I can't see it----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{less than}} an hour they'll have force enough to do as they please. It's time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this; you go home to tell Joe, and I'll see Mr. Wright if possible." ...|$|E
60|$|I put up {{the tiller}} and eased the sheet, and the salmon boat ran off five or six points. Big Alec watched us till <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range, when he {{returned}} to his work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] he replied. [...] "If the Abati go anywhere, it's to hell, {{where they}} haven't {{whitewashed}} walls and four-post beds. Oliver, wake up. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that cave, anyway." ...|$|R
5000|$|Virgin Forest is a {{collection}} of twelve related essays about how we think about and treat nature. The collection was published by the University of Georgia Press, and is loosely tied together by a theme: the importance of history to an ecological understanding. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in nature, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> also <b>out</b> <b>of</b> place in time, and the two kinds of exile are related." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{acknowledged}} that he understood what this meant, by a very unprofessional choice of words. [...] "We are in a mess," [...] he began, [...] "and the sooner <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it the better." ...|$|R
