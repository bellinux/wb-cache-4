25|$|On {{our arrival}} at Annapolis we {{embarked}} also, {{on board the}} Marquis Lafayette.

Obama has often {{described}} Payne's role in liberating the Ohrdruf forced labor camp. There was brief media attention when Obama mistakenly identified the camp as Auschwitz during the campaign. In 2009, Payne spoke about his war experience: Ohrdruf was in that string of towns going across, south of Gotha and Erfurt. Our division {{was the first one}} in there. When <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> there were no German soldiers anywhere around that I knew about. There was no fighting against the Germans, no camp guards. The whole area was overrun by people from the camp dressed in the most pitiful rags, and most of them were in a bad state of starvation.|$|E

500|$|The Rolling Stones' first US tour in June 1964 was, {{according}} to Wyman, [...] "a disaster.... When <b>we</b> <b>arrived,</b> we didn't have a hit record [...] or anything going for us." [...] When the band {{appeared on the}} variety show The Hollywood Palace, that week's guest host Dean Martin mocked both their hair and their performance. During the tour they recorded for two days at Chess Studios in Chicago, meeting many of their most important influences, including Muddy Waters. These sessions included {{what would become the}} Rolling Stones' first No.1 hit in the UK, their cover version of Bobby and Shirley Womack's [...] "It's All Over Now".|$|E

Also there at the same time were Mia Farrow, her sister Prudence and brother John, Donovan, Gyp [...] "Gypsy Dave" [...] Mills, Mike Love, jazz flautist Paul Horn, journalist Lewis H.

500|$|On January 7, 2008, Rise Against {{announced}} on their website {{that they had}} begun writing and demoing for their next album. When asked in May what {{the status of the}} album was, frontman Tim McIlrath told the Los Angeles modern rock radio station, KROQ, that the band {{was in the middle of}} the recording process. He also stated that the album would be recorded at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado and produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, who had produced The Sufferer & the Witness. Also in May 2008, Rise Against posted a blog on their website, stating that they were back in the studio working on the album. It explained that they had [...] "spent many weeks in Chicago throughout the end of winter writing new songs" [...] in their [...] "rehearsal space". Asked later about the writing and recording process, McIlrath said, [...] "We kind of blocked a month off over the winter and said, 'Let's all get together, get the rehearsal space, and start putting some ideas together,' which is what we did. And then, we also blocked off a week or two at the Blasting Room after <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> in Fort Collins to just kind of jam stuff out, get some new ideas going." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, {{to visit}} the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India {{a few days earlier}} to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his {{inoculation}} shots were causing him pain. Evans: “When <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'." [...] Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: [...] "The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me [...] "No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country", I cooled it." [...] Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: [...] "It's hard to believe that a week has already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," [...] and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.|$|E
500|$|James Guthrie, {{recommended}} by previous Floyd collaborator Alan Parsons, arrived {{early in the}} production process. He replaced engineer Brian Humphries, emotionally drained by his five years with the band. [...] Guthrie {{was hired as a}} co-producer, but was initially unaware of Ezrin's role: [...] "I saw myself as a hot young producer...When <b>we</b> <b>arrived,</b> I think we both felt we'd been booked to do the same job." [...] The early sessions at Britannia Row were emotionally charged, as Ezrin, Guthrie and Waters each had strong ideas about the direction the album would take. Relations within the band were at a low ebb, and Ezrin's role expanded to that of an intermediary between Waters {{and the rest of the}} band. [...] As Britannia Row was initially regarded as inadequate for The Wall the band upgraded much of its equipment, and by March another set of demos were complete. However, their former relationship with NWG placed them at risk of bankruptcy, and they were advised to leave the UK by no later than 6April 1979, for a minimum of one year. As non-residents they would pay no UK taxes during that time, and within a month all four members and their families had left. Waters moved to Switzerland, Mason to France, and Gilmour and Wright to the Greek Islands. Some equipment from Britannia Row was relocated in Super Bear Studios near Nice. [...] Gilmour and Wright were each familiar with the studio and enjoyed its atmosphere, having recorded there during the production of their solo albums. While Wright and Mason lived at the studio, Waters and Gilmour stayed in nearby houses. Mason later moved into Waters's villa near Vence, while Ezrin stayed in Nice.|$|E

500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E
