There were three Cyclone touchdowns negated by the officials in that game (one called caught out of bounds, two on offensive penalties). Oklahoma lost to Texas {{for the second straight}} year in the Red River Rivalry in Dallas and was unable to mount a successful offensive drive for the entire second half.

5|$|Many {{residents}} {{moved away}} from Bow Street after the theatre {{was established in the}} early 18th century. Life in the street declined and became known for pornography and prostitution. The publisher Edmund Curll lived at No.2 during this time, and by 1740 the street held 8 pubs, concealing a number of brothels. In 1833, the Commissioners of Woods, Forest and Land Revenues <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> buy land on and around Bow Street, and discovered that James Robinson, lessee to the Duke of Bedford, was running a brothel there. In the following legal dispute, Robinson's legal team accused the Commissioner's surveyor of being prejudiced against prostitution. The building was demolished, but made little difference to the area's reputation. In 1844, a resident suggested the street should be renamed as a continuation of Wellington Street to distance itself from the reputation Bow Street had acquired.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July 2010, reports {{surfaced}} {{suggesting that}} English club Newcastle United <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> sign Ben Arfa.

Milan. On 9 August, a season-long loan with an option to make the move permanent was reportedly being negotiated between the two clubs. However, a loan-fee for the deal {{could not be reached}} with Newcastle offering £650,000; £350,000 short of what Marseille wanted.

In Week 17, with the Cowboys already having clinched the NFC's #1 seed, Sanchez split time with starter Prescott and backup Romo. Prescott played the first two series of the game, Romo played the third and Sanchez played the rest. Sanchez completed 9 of 17 passes for 85 yards with two interceptions as the Cowboys lost to the Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 27–13.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the Cardinals were {{wavering}} between starting Murry Dickson or Harry Brecheen in game two, {{while the}} Dodgers <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> use either Higbe, who had pitched {{in the previous}} game, or Joe Hatten; the two clubs went with Dickson and Hatten. Hatten began {{the game in the}} top of the first inning by only allowing one hit to Terry Moore. In the bottom of the first, the Dodgers scored the game's first run. After Eddie Stanky struck out, and Dick Whitman flied out, Augie Galan singled. He was brought home by a walk and another single. After Carl Furillo flied out, the first inning ended with a score of 1–0. In the top of the second, the Cardinals responded when Erv Dusak tripled after a Slaughter ground out. Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly to score Dusak, and after a single by Clyde Kluttz, Dickson tripled to score another run, giving St. Louis a 2–1 lead, before a fly out ended their half of the inning. Dickson walked Bruce Edwards, but retired the next three batters, leaving the score 2–1 at the end of the second inning.|$|E
5|$|Since 1888, when Mahdist rebels {{forced the}} {{evacuation}} of then governor Emin Pasha, the Lado Enclave had been occupied by rebels {{under the leadership of}} Emir Arabi Dafalla. Rejaf was their strongest fortified position in the area, and it was there Arabi Dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers. The establishment of Mahdist Sudan had provided the context for European powers to commence the invasion and colonization of the Sudan, in which King Leopold desperately wanted to take part in order to expand his Congolese empire. However, a direct military campaign into the area was not an option; Leopold {{would not have been able}} to get permission from either the French or the British according to the rules laid out in the 1884 Berlin Conference, especially considering both nations <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> annex the Sudan themselves. King Leopold II therefore decided to disguise his campaign into the Sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim the Lado Enclave from the Mahdists, although he inended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past the boundaries of Belgian territory, first to Fashoda and then on to Khartoum. After receiving a new loan of 6.5 million francs from the Belgian government in 1895, Leopold ordered preparations to be made for the execution of his plan.|$|E
5|$|The German government, for {{political}} reasons, preferred the An-70-based solution. During a separate German Ministry of Defence {{evaluation of the}} An-7X, the aircraft was apparently considered to be superior to the A400M designed by the military branch of Airbus. According to AirTruck, the Defence Ministry estimated the An-7X to be 30 percent cheaper than its rival, would provide industrial benefits as Germany would receive substantial workshare, and was deemed to be technically superior, due mainly to its new propfan technology; however, a Defence Ministry spokesperson denied that a conclusion had been reached. On the other hand, DASA preferred the A400M, and refused to be the prime contractor for the An-70 if {{it was to be}} chosen. In the meantime, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the UK, were tentative members of the FLA programme and were estimated to have a requirement for up to 288 aircraft; Russia and Ukraine themselves <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> acquire 210 An-70s. Other contenders for the FLA were the C-17 and C-130J. In April 2000, the German government, the strongest supporter of the An-70, stated that it was committed to buying the same aircraft as the other countries. In the end, the A400M was chosen for the FLA project; had the An-70 been chosen, fifty percent of the aircraft would have been manufactured by Airbus.|$|E

5|$|The {{intention}} was to rationalise the industry to cut costs, and the government offered incentives for amalgamation through promises of contracts for new aircraft orders for the armed forces. At the time, the RAF <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> replace the English Electric Canberra light bomber in the long-range interdictor role, and the Hawker Hunter in the close air support role, while the Royal Navy sought an aircraft to assume the fleet air defence role from the de Havilland Sea Vixen. BAC, through its English Electric subsidiary, had begun developing a new high-performance strike aircraft, the TSR-2, which was intended for long-range, low-level strike missions with conventional and tactical nuclear weapons, as well as tactical reconnaissance. Hawker Siddeley was also developing a new aircraft, based on its P.1127 V/STOL demonstrator. The P.1154 was proposed as a supersonic version that could be marketed to both the RAF and Royal Navy to fulfil a number of roles: close air support, air superiority and fleet air defence.|$|E
5|$|With a {{large part}} of the French Empire's forces now {{entangled}} in the bloody Peninsular War, the Austrian Empire believed that its best opportunity to avenge the humiliating defeat of 1805 had finally come. The Austrians <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> defeat France and regain their former influence in Italy and Germany. In early 1809, the Austrian war preparations were so intense that Napoleon was forced to leave Spain and head back to Paris to reorganise his main army in Germany. In spring, Nansouty was therefore recalled to the command of 1st of the three heavy cavalry divisions of the Cavalry Reserve, placed this time under the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières. As the War of the Fifth Coalition broke out, Nansouty's division was soon detached from the Reserve and temporarily attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, the force that was assigned the most difficult tasks during the early military operations of this war. As Napoleon then ordered a concentration of the army at Ratisbon, Nansouty's division was once again put under the command of Bessières and sent to serve with the Bavarian army. After his initial victories at Abensberg and Landshut, Napoleon concentrated the bulk of his army, including Nansouty's men, at Eckmühl, where Davout was waiting.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Patriots and {{new head}} coach Bill Parcells <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed Scott Secules, and {{attempted}} to sign Steve Beuerlein, but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade. In April, Millen {{was traded to the}} Dallas Cowboys, and the Patriots chose Drew Bledsoe with the first pick in the 1993 NFL Draft. During the offseason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback. Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes. He became a restricted free agent in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years. As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. As {{was the case in the}} 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the holder for extra point and field goal attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback. The 1995 season was similar, with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992. On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 3017. Although Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the Denver Broncos. This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained for the rest of the season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the CL's independence, various larger {{companies}} <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> acquire it, {{mainly for}} the valuable Court Street terminal property. The most persistent rumor {{was that the}} Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (CJ, later a NYC line) would buy the CL as an entrance to Cincinnati. The CJ had built south from Michigan to Carlisle, Ohio in 1887, and initially acquired trackage rights over the CH to reach Cincinnati. Negotiations between the CL and CJ convinced the CH that the latter was capable of becoming a strong competitor, despite its poor financial state, and the CH attempted to acquire the CJ in 1892. But the CL stopped the consolidation based on Ohio's laws prohibiting such anti-competitive practices, and the CJ continued {{to look at the}} CL as a possible part of its line. After the CL's conversion to standard gauge was completed in 1894, the CJ secured trackage rights over the CL into Court Street, beginning service on January 27, 1896 via an extension from Carlisle to Franklin, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four, later a NYC line) to Middletown, and the recently opened Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad to the CL at Hageman. The CJ also acquired the long-dormant Deer Creek Tunnel project in an attempt to construct its own route into the city, tired of dealing with Hafer and the CL The Pennsylvania Railroad, owner of the Little Miami Railroad that had been constructed east of Lebanon in the 1840s, entered the negotiations in 1896 to protect its Cincinnati-area interests, and in March it (through the Pennsylvania Company) acquired a majority of the CL's stock. Pennsylvania officials took over management in May, and in 1902 the CL acquired the tunnel property and some terminal property near Court Street from the Cincinnati Northern Railroad, successor to the CJ, which had become part of the Big Four and terminated its use of the CL in 1901.|$|E
