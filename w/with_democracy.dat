5|$|As the 19thcentury {{gave way}} to the 20th, there {{followed}} in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic, followed by the bloody Philippine–American War of conquest by US military force. Aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II, when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience <b>with</b> <b>democracy,</b> which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution.|$|E
5|$|The political, {{economic}} and social reforms that were brought about during the relatively short duration of the Batavian Republic have had a lasting impact. The confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state. For {{the first time in}} Dutch history, the constitution that was adopted in 1798 had a genuinely democratic character. For a while the Republic was governed democratically, although the coup d'état of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power, after another change in constitution. Nevertheless, the memory of this brief experiment <b>with</b> <b>democracy</b> helped smooth the transition to a more democratic government in 1848 (the constitutional revision by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, limiting the power of the king). A type of ministerial government was introduced {{for the first time in}} Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Catholicism was {{widespread}} in the 1920s; anti-Catholics, including the Ku Klux Klan, believed that Catholicism was incompatible <b>with</b> <b>democracy</b> and that parochial schools encouraged separatism and kept Catholics from becoming loyal Americans. The Catholics responded to such prejudices by repeatedly asserting their rights as American citizens and by arguing that they, not the nativists (anti-Catholics), were true patriots since they believed in the right to freedom of religion.|$|E
25|$|Although the Socialist Party is {{committed}} to using the ballot box for making its proposed revolution, it does so on a class basis – i.e. its concern <b>with</b> <b>democracy</b> is limited to having sufficient prospects of enabling the working class to make its revolution. The party thus does not enter in discussion over proportional representation or reforms to Parliament, the House of Lords, etc. because there is enough means within the current system for the working class to assert its will.|$|E
25|$|Academics {{have been}} investigated, imprisoned, and forced into exile over accusations of lèse-majesté.

Somsak declared that he had never proposed to overthrow the monarchy and had never insulted Bhumibol personally.|$|E

The DS–DL–MRE joint list obtained 31.2% of the vote and 220 deputies, while the DS list 17.2% and 62 senators. The party's dismal result and the razor-thin win of The Union coalition over the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition prompted a discussion on the party's future. By the end of 2006 the party leadership was committed to a merger with DL.|$|E

Oprah Winfrey's book club selection in 2001 of The Corrections led to a much publicized feud with the talk show host. In recent years, Franzen has become recognized for his opinions on everything from social networking services such as Twitter ("the ultimate irresponsible medium") {{and the proliferation of}} e-books ("just not permanent enough") to the disintegration of Europe ("The people making the decisions in Europe are bankers. The technicians of finance are making the decisions there.

25|$|American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) is an American Muslim {{think tank}} formed in 2003 {{by a small}} group of Muslim {{professionals}} in Phoenix, Arizona. The group's founder is Zuhdi Jasser who is also the group’s president and chief spokesman. AIFD advocates for the separation of religion and state and confronts the ideologies of political Islam and openly counters the belief that the Muslim faith is inextricably rooted to the concept of the Islamic state. Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the group with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam <b>with</b> <b>democracy</b> and American values. The AIFD supports separation of religion and state, religious pluralism, equality of the sexes, the unconditional recognition of Israel, and the creation of an independent Palestine “on the current ‘occupied territories.’” The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it. Zuhdi Jasser has been the center of various controversies and has been criticized by several muslims and non muslims alike.|$|E

25|$|Ruiz’s {{work does}} focus on race issues, {{considering}} she calls for “an essential Latin ‘difference,’ believing Latinos to be culturally and morally superior,” but her work also encompasses political issues. She warns against U.S. expansionism and corporate monopolies. For instance, in both her novels, she feminizes the male characters in order “to depict the subordinated status of those ‘handicapped’ by societal constraints”. These male characters are hurt by forces of decay and corruption. For example, in Squatter and the Don, the Californio men are victim to both illnesses and land loss {{because of the}} government. This novel centers on {{the corruption of the}} United States government due to the combination of capitalism <b>with</b> <b>democracy.</b> Ruiz paints the enemy here not to be the squatters, but the railroad barons. Even the Alamars and the Darrells, who in the end foster true love and marriage despite race, fall victim to the railroad barons.|$|E
25|$|The revised {{sequence}} concept {{applies only}} to the industrial system – that is, the manufacturing core {{of the economy in}} which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the market system in the Galbraithian dual economy. In the market system, composed of the vast majority of business organizations, price competition remains the dominant form of social control. In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so largest corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith's view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and value judgments. That this power is exercised in the shortsighted interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent <b>with</b> <b>democracy</b> and a barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.|$|E
