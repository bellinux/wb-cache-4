5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan). In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once and for all. Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> had started.|$|E
25|$|Chavacano or Chabacano is a Spanish-based creole {{language}} and known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish. Chabacano is originally spoken by {{majority of the}} Caviteños that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after {{the arrival of the}} Spaniards three centuries ago. The various dialects of Chabacano were formed out of necessity like all languages, though scholars and laypersons disagree about exactly when and <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> began. The various language groups working at the Cavite naval base needed a way to communicate with each other, and to the soldiers who were barking the orders in less-than-genteel Spanish. It was from this situation that Cavite Chabacano began as a simplified form of Spanish – a pidgin language that later developed into a mixed, or creole language. The fact that the first Chabacanos learned their Spanish from the coarse language of soldiers is probably why they were called Chabacanos in the first place.|$|E

Under her Cheerleader gimmick, she beat Nikki Roxx and later {{appeared}} as Raisha Saeed also winning against Ariel. She appeared again in May losing a return match to Roxx but staying undefeated as Saeed against Daizee Haze. She was scheduled for a rematch with Roxx on November 16 but after Roxx pulled out she defeated Hailey Hatred to earn a match against Sara Del Rey for the JAPW Women's Championship. Anderson won the match by disqualification after Hatred interfered, leading to a no-disqualification Three Way match in January 2010 at Back <b>Where</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Began for the title in which Anderson was pinned by Del Rey. Anderson met Del Rey later in 2010, on July 25, {{under the guise of}} her Raisha Saeed gimmick.

25|$|The launch {{was delayed}} until February 1985 {{due to a}} delay in the chat show Wogan, {{that was to be}} a part of the major revamp in BBC1's schedules. Smith was uneasy about the late start as EastEnders no longer had the winter months to build up a loyal {{following}} before the summer ratings lull. The press were invited to Elstree to meet the cast and see the lot, and stories immediately started circulating about the show, about a rivalry with ITV (who were launching their own market-based soap, Albion Market) and about the private lives of the cast. Anticipation and rumour grew in equal measure until the first transmission at 7p.m. on 19 February 1985. Both Holland and Smith could not watch; they both instead returned to the place <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> began, Albertine's Wine Bar on Wood Lane. The next day, viewing figures were confirmed at 17 million. The reviews were largely favourable, although, after three weeks on air, BBC1's early evening share had returned to the pre-EastEnders figure of seven million, though EastEnders then climbed to highs of up to 23 million later on in the year. Following the launch, both group discussions and telephone surveys were conducted to test audience reaction to early episodes. Detailed reactions were taken after six months and since then regular monitoring was conducted.|$|E

500|$|Many of Barbirolli's pre-war {{recordings}} for HMV were of concertos. His {{reputation as}} an accompanist tended to obscure his talents as a symphonic conductor, and later, his detractors in New York [...] "damned him with faint praise by exalting his powers as an accompanist and then implying that that was <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> stopped." [...] Barbirolli became very sensitive on this point, and for many {{years after the war}} he was reluctant to accompany anyone in the recording studio. Among his early HMV records are works, mainly concertos, by Brahms, Bruch, Chopin, Dvořák, Glazunov, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schumann, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky and Vieuxtemps. From the 1990s onwards, archive recordings of Barbirolli's early concerts in New York have been issued on CD. Kennedy wrote in 2004 that they [...] "prove that the orchestra played superbly for him and that the criticism of him was largely unjustified." [...] Recordings from this period include symphonies by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Sibelius and Tchaikovsky, and other orchestral music by Berlioz, Debussy, Menotti, Purcell, Ravel, Respighi, and Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E

[...] "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There {{was no indication}} that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, {{and there was no}} reason to think otherwise," [...] said Haynes. The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup. [...] "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I’m sitting there thinking, 'This is it. This is how it finally ends,'" [...] said Trucks. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.|$|E
500|$|The season's finale Death And All His Friends {{was highly}} praised. Marsi gave the episode five stars, and {{expressed}} {{that it may}} have been the best episode of the series, adding: [...] "The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "At any rate, now you can at least see <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> began.

His first touch saw him gang tackled by three Collingwood players, another contest saw him beaten by Martin Clarke, which led to a Collingwood goal; Collingwood captain, Nick Maxwell, gestured to Watts [...] "that's your goal, mate! Welcome to real footy". The team ultimately lost by sixty-six points with Watts recording just eight disposals, a mark and a behind, playing on the half-forward line. He retained his spot the next week for a forty-eight point loss against [...] at Etihad Stadium in which he kicked his first AFL goal. Recording nine disposals in his second match, the excitement surrounding Watts quickly turned to criticism with his school football coach and former AFL footballer, Robert Shaw, stating that he was not ready for AFL football. Premiership player and coach, Leigh Matthews, said he had not seen anything in Watts' first two matches to warrant him being the number one draft pick. He played his third and final AFL match of the year the next week in the fifty-five point loss against [...] at the Gabba, where The Age journalist, Andrew Stafford, noted his confidence looked low.

Additionally, Loiacono dismissed the fact that Cox has never received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Monica as [...] "downright criminal".
