Modern beekeeper produces an artifical swarm, a bee nuclei, when it is the most suitable period for him, in terms of pasture and climate conditions. Organizing production of the selected fertilized queen-bees allow beekeepers not to spend valuable time in the season for the production of queen-bees, because it is possible to get supply on the market. Comparison of two of the most common production methods have been described: inserting fertilized selected queen-bee into the nuclei consisting of three frames with covered brood and two frames with honey (Group A) and inserting fertilized selected queen-bee into the package-swarm (Group B).

5000|$|The English {{are derived}} from another hockey game Irish is called [...] "hurley" [...] and also [...] "hurlino", a gamethat was practiced very hard with many players. The modern hockey made its {{appearance}} early in thesecond {{half of the nineteenth}} century, namely ago over a hundred years. Such as hockey was played on a field with a certain size,150 by 84 yards, a rectangle whose side lines start at 21, 50 and 75 yards.

50|$|Around 1993, an {{engineer}} and computer aided design (CAD) guru named Sandy Strayer joined Tripp Research, Inc. Tripp and Strayer revolutionized the 1911 market by designing a modular hi-capacity 1911 frame for IPSC shooters. While Para Ordnance already had a hi-capacity 1911 frame on the market, {{it was made of}} steel. The modular frame made use of a fiber-reinforced plastic which combined the trigger guard, grip, and integral magazine well. It used a proprietary grip which attached to the upper portion of the frame (a metal part that comprised the dust cover and frame rails). The result was that the modular <b>frame</b> <b>weighed</b> less than half of what the steel <b>frame</b> <b>weighed.</b> Further, while the Para frame feels notably larger than a standard 1911 in the hand, the STI feels similar to a regular 1911 since the grips are molded into the plastic of the frame rather than screwed to the outside. Tripp and Strayer were listed as the co-patent holders on the modular frame. Soon after the modular frame was introduced, the company name changed to STI (Strayer-Tripp, Inc.) and Strayer was given an equity stake in the new company.|$|R
5000|$|The {{one-piece}} {{aluminum frame}} and handlebars conceal cables {{in an effort}} to protect them from vandalism and inclement weather. The heavy-duty tires are designed to be puncture-resistant and are filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. [...] Twin LED rear lights are integrated into the frame, and the robust <b>frame</b> <b>weighs</b> approximately 18 kg. The bikes are designed by industrial designer Michel Dallaire and built in the Saguenay, Quebec region by Cycles Devinci, with aluminum provided by Rio Tinto Alcan.|$|R
5000|$|The frame {{dimensions}} of the street 350 {{are very similar to}} the Yamaha TZ250 and TZ350 series factory road race bikes, differing mainly in weight and front fork rake - the RD being ~27 degrees and the TZ being ~25 degrees.

The weight difference is substantial though, with the street-going RD <b>frame</b> <b>weighing</b> almost twice as much as the [...] "TZ" [...] roadrace race frame.|$|R
50|$|Frame {{manufacturers}} {{are free to}} use any material they choose in the frame. For most {{of the history of}} road racing, bicycle frames were constructed from steel tubing, and aluminium and titanium alloys were also used successfully in racing bicycles. Racing bicycles in these three materials are still commercially available and are still used by some amateur racing cyclists or in vintage racing classes. However, virtually all professional road racing cyclists now use frames constructed from various carbon fiber composite materials, and a typical modern carbon fiber <b>frame</b> <b>weighs</b> less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs).|$|R
50|$|Look {{designed}} the 566 frameset around responsiveness {{as well as}} comfort. It features 'X Design' seat stays which {{have been designed to}} provide lateral stiffness to aid responsiveness and some vertical flexing to provide the rider with some comfort. This was achieved by suing a flattened tube design, creating a virtual point of flexing. The 566 also features a taller than normal head tube, as well as a shorter sloping top tube providing yet further comfort. The manufacturer claims that the total weight of the bike 8.2 kg, with the <b>frame</b> <b>weighing</b> 1.1 kg.|$|R
50|$|These bikes {{will also}} have very slack head tube angles (66 degrees or less), long wheelbases (over 45 in), and will {{accommodate}} the use of up to 3 in width knobbed tires. Downhill frames are also overbuilt to handle the stress of riding over rocky terrain, drops, and jumps. Bike weights have been typically over 34 lb, but modern downhill bikes have broken the 30 lb weight barrier (with some custom builds on carbon <b>frames</b> <b>weighing</b> between 27-29 pounds) Some newer (2014/5) downhill bikes can be built to weigh under 30 lb, such as the Trek Session 9.9 or Kona Supreme Operator.|$|R
50|$|Carbon fiber {{frames are}} {{expensive}} but generally more flexible, making for a smoother ride {{at the expense}} of worse power transfer between the leg and the wheels. In general, carbon fiber <b>frames</b> <b>weigh</b> about 160-180 grams. Recently, high-end carbon fiber frames with a monocoque construction have been introduced. They offer the same level of stiffness as aluminum <b>frames</b> while <b>weighing</b> only around 130g. Aluminum can weigh from 170 to 240 grams. Frame length ranges from 2 wheel framed freestyle wheels (used in aggressive skating) to around 230 mm for short-framed four wheel skates (used in most inline designs), up to about 325 mm for a five-wheel racing frame.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} how framing of messages and the intentions inferred from different—positive vs. negative—framings, {{interact with the}} development of trust. Empirical evidence is presented showing that different, logically equivalent, frames are supposedly interpreted as implying different intentions. Next, the relationship between different frames (and the corresponding intentions reflected from these frames) and trust are explored. Finally, and most important, the relationship between the assessment of trust, inferred from different frames, and the corresponding choice behavior resulting from these frames, are investigated. Specifically, consider agents A and B offering to sell exactly the same commodity, except that one agent formulates it in a positive and the other in a negative frame. The different frames may lead to different assessments of the trustworthiness of the two agents. Following common wisdom, if agent A is trusted more than B, then one should prefer to conduct transactions with the former rather than with the latter agent. Several experiments are presented that are incompatible with this conjecture. For example, when faced with a choice between two butchers, whose ground beef is advertised as containing 25 % fat (negative frame) or 75 % lean (positive frame), respectively, most people have more trust in the former yet most indicate they would buy their meat from the latter butcher. This phenomenon, in which negative <b>framing</b> <b>weighs</b> more in trust assessments, and positive <b>framing</b> <b>weighs</b> more in choice, is labeled trust–choice incompatibility. The robustness of the phenomenon is further demonstrated in several experiments, and possible explanations for its occurrence are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The Six13 model, {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 2004, used carbon tube sections in the main triangle, and still employs aluminum rear triangles.

Cannondale advertised this light weight frameset with the slogan [...] "Legalize my Cannondale". In reality, only the smallest size (50 cm) of bike actually approached the 6.8 kg limit. Some in the bicycle industry considered this to be a creative marketing effort because Six13 <b>frames</b> <b>weighed</b> the same as, or more than, competing frames from other manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The Mark VI in {{many ways}} {{reflected}} Chapman's background in engineering: his designs resulted from a stress analysis of loads into the frame, they were extremely light (the 6' space <b>frame</b> <b>weighed</b> only 55 lbs (25 kg)), and the suspension incorporated the latest advances. The prototype chassis was built up by the Progress Chassis Company and the aluminum body was constructed by panel beaters Williams and Prichard. (Both firms would later furnish bodies and chassis for subsequent models.) The cheap and easily available mechanical parts were sourced from the Ford Prefect. The Mark VI became a popular sight on Britain's racetracks, and was a frequent winner, beating many more powerful and expensive cars, earning praise for very good handling and superior low-speed acceleration.|$|R

With this in mind, Bandini made changes to the engine lubrication system, distributor, and valvetrain, also marginally increasing the stroke, enlarging the capacity from 721 cc to 747 cc. He designed space <b>frames</b> <b>weighing</b> only 18 kg (40 lb), to which he fitted bodies by Motto, whose designs were perfectly {{in harmony with the}} Bandini philosophy, incorporating practicality and compliance with regulations, without sacrificing elegance of form. So was born the Bandini 750 sport siluro. These cars, when their headlights were removed, qualified to race in the sports category: they could also be adapted to qualify for the racing category simply by removing their cycle fenders (separate mudguards).|$|R
2500|$|The GG1 was [...] {{long and}} <b>weighed</b> [...] The <b>frame</b> of the {{locomotive}} was in two halves joined {{with a ball}} and socket joint, allowing the locomotive to negotiate sharper curves. The body rested on the frame and was clad in welded steel plates. The control cabs were {{near the center of}} the locomotive on each side of the main oil-cooled transformer and oil-fired train-heating boiler. This arrangement, first used on the Modified P5 class, provided for greater crew safety in a collision and for bi-directional operation of the locomotive. A pantograph on each end of the locomotive body was used to collect the 25Hz, 11,000V alternating current (AC) from the overhead lines. [...] In operation the leading pantograph was usually kept lowered and the trailing raised to collect current, since if the rear pantograph failed it would not strike the forward pantograph. Transformers between the two cabs stepped down the 11,000V to the voltages needed for the traction motors and other equipment.|$|R

50|$|CFRP bicycle <b>frames</b> <b>weigh</b> {{less than}} one of steel, aluminum, or {{titanium}} for the same strength. The type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness in required directions. Frames can be tuned to address different riding styles: sprint events require stiffer frames while endurance events may require more flexible frames for rider comfort over longer periods. The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed aerodynamic tube sections. CFRP forks including suspension fork crowns and steerers, handlebars, seatposts, and crank arms are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles. CFRP rims remain expensive but their stability compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel and the reduced mass reduces the moment of inertia of the wheel. CFRP spokes are rare and most carbon wheelsets retain traditional stainless steel spokes. CFRP also appears increasingly in other components such as derailleur parts, brake and shifter levers and bodies, cassette sprocket carriers, suspension linkages, disc brake rotors, pedals, shoe soles, and saddle rails. Although strong and light, impact, over-torquing or improper installation of CFRP components has resulted in cracking and failures, which may be difficult or impossible to repair.|$|R
40|$|This design report {{details the}} design process {{utilized}} by Adaptive Exercise Designs (AED) in creating the sixth design of the Universal Play Frame (UPF). The UPF is an adaptive frame which supports a variety of devices that allows athletes in wheelchairs with limited range of motion to participate in physical activity. The past five frame designs {{do not meet the}} needs of the Friday Club due to complications with function and time constraints. To ensure all of Fridays Club 2 ̆ 7 s needs were met, the problem was better defined by converting the customer requirements into engineering specifications. The design process our team followed was guided by the engineering specifications and is presented in detail in this report. The final dimensions of the UPF VI that varied from the original anticipated design are summarized as follows. The UPF VI utilizes four 12 ’’ wheels instead of two wheels like the previous UPFs. The additional and larger wheels will improve the frame 2 ̆ 7 s ability to maneuver over different terrain. In the final design the <b>frame</b> <b>weighs</b> approximately 50 lbs. The frame is 40 ’’ wide (fixed width) to provide clearance for the user’s wheelchair and for the UPF wheels to rotate. The height adjusts between the range of 34 ’’ and 42 ’’ and has a maximum length of 74 ” in order to accommodate different height and length wheelchairs. The Cargo Buckle ratchet tie-down was selected as a new method of attachment in order to allow for a quick and easy connection of the UPF to the wheelchair. The UPF VI cost a total of 1, 239. 65, which includes an estimated 130. 00 for a powder coat to improve the visual aesthetics of the UPF...|$|R

In high school his 5’11 <b>frame</b> <b>weighed</b> 136 pounds. He maintained a thin physique his entire life and was known by the nickname [...] "Fats". In 1955, he responded to an advertisement for a meal and medal to competitors who completed a 15-mile race walk in a specified time at Lake Hopatcong, NJ. He finished under the time limit but was too tired to eat and blisters developed that kept him from walking for several days but the sport piqued his interest. He developed a lifelong love for race walking and began competing in about 25 races a year. He even took a job as letter carrier with the United States Post Office from 1959- 1962 to spend working hours training. His labors were rewarded in 1960 when he qualified for a berth on the United States Olympic team as a competitive racewalker in the 20K. In 1964 he was the subject of an article in Sports Illustrated. Bob won Eastern, National, North American and Pan American Track Championships in Master’s Competition. He competed in World Masters Championships starting in 1975 and brought home the gold medal 10 times for individual performance in the racewalk. Bob was selected three times as racewalker of the year in the Masters category by United States Track & Field. He held national as well as world records in his sport. He also completed numerous marathons competing as a race walker in a field of runners. He was inducted into the USATF Masters Hall of Fame, Shore AC Hall of Fame and The New Jersey Sports Writers Hall of Fame. At age 91 he was still walking five miles a day at Mill Creek Park in Willingboro.|$|R
