25|$|In {{the early}} days of Hogwarts, the four founders {{hand-picked}} students for their Houses. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>founders</b> worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house. The student's own choices may affect the decision: the clearest example is the Hat telling Harry that he would do well in Slytherin in the first book, but ultimately selecting Gryffindor after Harry asks it not to put him in Slytherin.|$|E

40|$|A large {{fraction}} of business {{groups around the}} world are run by families. In this paper, we analyze how the structure of the families behind these business groups affects the groups’ organization, governance and performance. To address this question, we constructed a unique data set of family trees and business groups for nearly 100 of the largest business families in Thailand. We find a strong positive association between family size and family involvement in the ownership and control of the family business. The sons of <b>the</b> <b>founders</b> {{play a central role in}} both ownership and board membership, especially <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>founder</b> of <b>the</b> group is gone. The availability of more sons is also associated with lower firm-level performance, especially in private firms and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>founder</b> is gone. We identify a possible governance channel for this performance effect. Excess control by sons, but not other family members, is associated with lower firm performance. In addition, excess control by sons increases with the number of sons and with the death of <b>the</b> <b>founder.</b> Relatedly, at <b>the</b> group-level, we find that larger families are associated with larger (more firms) and more pyramidal groups, again especially <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>founder</b> is gone.
