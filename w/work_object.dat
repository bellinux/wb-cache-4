50|$|Mark is {{an artist}} who makes {{conceptual}} artworks {{across a range of}} media. Formats include: sculptural installation, performance, video, photography, sound, neon, art multiples, mail art, wallpaper, Letraset and tattoos. A student of Gerald Ferguson at NSCAD, Mark’s work has, as Robin Metcalfe notes, “an echo of Ferguson’s obsessive, process-oriented serial works of the early 1970s”. Re-workings of conceptualist strategies, such as process and repetition, are a prominent feature of Mark’s early art practice. In the Jar Series the artist fills mason jars with various white substances (White Jars, 1994), or black substances (Black Jars, 1996) and arranges them in a grid on the floor. Christina Ritchie, the curator of Mark’s 1997 exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario writes, Mark’s artworks often combine an emphasis on the formal characteristics of Minimalism with “personal, psychological expression.” In the Until Drawings (1997), for instance, the artist makes a drawing “until the pencil runs out”; e.g., One Castell 9000 4B (1997) features deep gouges of thick graphite lines made in a repeating series covering the top half of a piece of paper. As Ritchie comments, in this aspect of her practice, Mark moves “into the realm of obsession and irresistible compulsion to order.” An interest in “framing daily habits so they cross into the realm of art ” is consistent throughout Mark’s <b>work.</b> <b>Object</b> Carried for One Year (2003-2012) is a series of performances/sculptures consisting of a steel bar the artist carried in her pocket for an entire year. Mark’s working class politics are evident in In and Out (1997-2032), a long term performance piece (ending when the artist dies or reaches retirement age 65) that requires the artist to punch an old-fashioned time clock. The piece has been owned by the Toronto art collector Dr. Paul Marks since 1999, “meaning that Mark, in effect, has a 'boss' who pays her on a yearly basis for the work”. The artist’s strategy of reframing the everyday is also evident in her use of TV as a sculptural material. Glow House (2005-2009) presents the temporary installation of 35-40 television sets turned to the same channel and distributed throughout a residential house. Animating the house with flickering light for those passing by in the night, Glow House was called “a true example of democratic public art ” by Leslie Jen in Canadian Architect. Mark’s video work, REM (2007), is compiled from more than 170 films and TV shows, to create a composite feature film that “meshes production and consumption into narrative hyper-time.” REM is {{in the collection of the}} National Gallery of Canada.|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{automation}} {{has been}} recognized as a fundamental key to build and keep manufacturing industries in developed countries. In most automation tasks, knowing the exact position of the objects to handle is essential. This is often done using a positional calibration system, such as a camera-based vision system. In this article, an alternative six-degrees-of-freedom <b>work</b> <b>object</b> positional calibration method using a robot-held proximity sensor, is presented. A general trigonometry-based measurement and calculation procedure, which, step-by-step, adjusts a <b>work</b> <b>object</b> coordinate system to the actual <b>work</b> <b>object</b> position, is explained. For suitable robot tasks and <b>work</b> <b>object</b> geometries, the benefits with the presented method include its robustness, large work area and low investment cost. Some drawbacks can be longer cycle time and its limited capacity to handle unsorted and complicated objects. To validate the presented method, it was implemented in an experimental robot setup. In this robot cell, {{it was used to}} calibrate the position of a stator section <b>work</b> <b>object,</b> which is used in the Uppsala University Wave Energy Converter generator.

40|$|Payload {{development}} in truck hauling of tree sections was studied, using production statistics from central Sweden. An increase of payload weights {{over four years}} was ob-served. Factors influencing productivity may be divided into groups connected to a) technology, b) human skills, c) <b>work</b> <b>object</b> properties and d) working conditions. Apart from varying weather and seasonal climactic change, no productivity change or development could be observed associated with technology, <b>work</b> <b>object</b> properties or working conditions {{during the course of}} the 49 -month study. The operators studied were all experienced roundwood hauling contractors, but had no previous experience with tree section hauling. Their experience of the work studied and on the equipment in-creased during the study. Under the stable conditions of this study, the most impor-tant factors influencing payload variation are increased op-erator skill and varying weather and climate. Meteorological data explained more than 70 per cent of the variation but a logarithmic increase of payloads along with a decreasing sensitivity to weather conditions remained unexplained. Hy-pothetically, this is accredited to growing operator skill in-cluding an increased ability to judge and compensate for varying characteristics of tree sections handled. If so, the learning phase might be longer than generally assumed. To shorten this low-productivity period is an important aim for vocational training for workers and contractors in forestry. Some methodological problems connected with the interpre-tation of production studies are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{explores the}} role of {{boundary}} <b>work</b> and boundary <b>objects</b> in enhancing learning and innovation processes in hybrid multi-actor networks for sustainable agriculture ({LINSA}). Design/Methodology/Approach: Boundary work in {LINSA} is analysed {{on the basis of}} six case studies carried out in {SOLINSA} project under a common methodology. In developing typologies of boundary <b>work</b> and <b>objects,</b> a grounded approach is used. Findings: {LINSA} analysis demonstrates the dynamic character, diverse forms and multiple functions of boundary <b>work</b> and <b>objects</b> in three domains: learning, innovation, and sustainability. Addressing specific types of goals and actors leads to specific types of boundary <b>work</b> and boundary <b>objects.</b> Context-appropriate boundary <b>work</b> allows aligning differing actor attitudes, gaining increased external support, and developing {LINSA}. The concepts of boundary <b>work</b> and boundary <b>objects</b> are relevant in a broad range of divergent {LINSA} settings. Boundary work has its limitations, but its facilitation supports reaching {LINSA} goals. Practical Implications: The paper proposes recognising context-appropriate forms of boundary work and skilful use of emerging boundary objects to both promote internal consolidation of {LINSA} and effective external communication to foster learning and innovation for sustainability. Originality/Value: The paper provides insights into the forms, dynamic and outcomes of boundary work in {LINSA} in three key domains: developing shared knowledge base, co-producing innovation and negotiating sustainability...|$|R
