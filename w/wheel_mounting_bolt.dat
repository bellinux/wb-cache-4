50|$|The C.37 had a fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage.

50|$|Below the cymbal, the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> {{passes through}} first a dome washer {{and then a}} bottom felt, which support the cymbal. The bolt then passes through the cymbal. The part of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> that passes through the cymbal is {{separated}} from the cymbal by a sleeve, most commonly of plastic, which protects the metal cymbal from contact with the metal bolt. Omission of this sleeve by beginners is common, and leads to keyhole damage to the cymbal mounting hole, and often also to cracking around the hole.|$|R

40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the TGB had moved from its {{position}} by fracturing the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts.</b> As a result, the tail rotor blades have hit the TRG causing fracturing of both TRG and TRBs. The most probable reason for failure of the TGB <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> appears to be excessive load on the TGB due to some abnormalities in the tail rotor blades. However, with the available evidences, {{the nature of the}} problem on the tail rotor blades could not be identified. Hence it is necessary to establish the reason for the abnormal sound in the helicopter prior to the accident and also to ascertain whether or not the same could cause excessive load on the TGB. The damages seen in the input side of the TGB, which includes TDS, floating bearing, bearing support assembly and the couplings are secondary in nature and might have occurred after failure of the TGB <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts.</b> There were no evidences of delayed failure such as fatigue in any of the components examined...|$|R

40|$|During the {{prototype}} vibration {{tests of the}} GAS adapter beam, significant impacting of the beam at its support points was observed. The cause of the impacting was traced to gaps under the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> heads. Because of the nonlinear nature of the response, {{it was difficult to}} evaluate the effects which Shuttle launch dynamics might have on the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> loads. A series of tests were conducted on an electrodynamic exciter in which the transient acceleration time histories, which had been measured during the Space Transportation System- 1 (STS- 1; Space Shuttle mission 1) launch, were simulated. The actual flight data had to be filtered and compensated so that it could be reproduced on the shaker without exceeding displacement and velocity limitations. <b>Mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> loads were measured directly by strain gages applied to the bolts. Various gap thicknesses and bolt torques were investigated. Although increased gap thickness resulted in greater accelerations due to impacting, the bolt loads were not significantly affected. This is attributed to the fact that impacting excited mostly higher frequency modes which do not have significant modal mass...|$|R
