5|$|Early in his career, Raonic was {{questioned}} about <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{follow the example}} of Rusedski, the last prominent Canadian tennis player, who decided to represent Great Britain instead. Raonic declared that he would play for Canada.|$|E
5|$|Off the field, Miller was {{dogged by}} {{speculation}} as to <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> honour a contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the English Lancashire League, {{which would have}} ended his Test career. Miller resolved that he would remain in Australia, and accepted a job offer in New South Wales, but kept his decision private.|$|E
5|$|There {{were great}} {{expectations}} for Kuch Kuch Hota Hai {{leading up to}} its premiere, because it re-united the Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge team of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, and specifically concerning the debut of Karan Johar, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be in the same}} league as Aditya Chopra as a first-time writer/director.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to being asked <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> thought people <b>would</b> accept this as historical accuracy, Falconer said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You cried out, Madame," [...] M. de Putange {{reminded}} her, and Buckingham {{may well}} have wondered <b>whether</b> presently <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be receiving M. de Putange's sword in his vitals. He must have known that his life now hung upon her answer.|$|R
2500|$|In The Winning Way then Australian coach Bob Dwyer wrote, [...] "I am {{not sure}} <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> [...] <b>would</b> have made the tour if Brendan Moon and the others had not pulled out, but even if <b>he</b> had <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been a {{borderline}} choice and might have remained {{on the fringe of}} the team for much of the tour. Instead, he occupied centre-stage and performed brilliantly." ...|$|R
5|$|Adams {{wrote the}} main parts of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect with actors Simon Jones and Geoffrey McGivern in mind. According to Jones, Adams telephoned {{him when he}} was writing the pilot to ask <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{essentially}} play himself; Adams later stated that although Dent was not a portrayal of Jones, he wrote the part to play to Jones's strengths as an actor.|$|E
5|$|During the postgame celebration, ABC {{commentator}} Jack Arute asked Dennis Franchione <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{return to}} the team the following year. Coach Franchione responded by asking the announcer to let the players enjoy their victory. At {{the beginning of the}} subsequent press conference, Coach Franchione announced his resignation, effective immediately. Shortly thereafter, Texas A announced defensive coordinator Gary Darnell would lead the Aggies in their bowl game.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> run. Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E
60|$|He had closely inquired, from Malinche, <b>whether</b> {{she thought}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be well received, did he reach her country. Malinche's opinion was not encouraging.|$|R
60|$|I asked Poirot <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> thought John <b>would</b> be condemned. To my intense surprise, {{he replied}} that, on the contrary, he was {{extremely}} likely to be acquitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{uncertainty}} about <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be offered another contract with Taranaki had prompted Bedwell-Curtis {{to head to}} Manawatu on a one-year deal.|$|R
5|$|On May 9, 2017 Yoshiki's {{management}} {{announced that}} the drummer would undergo urgent surgery on May 16, where an artificial disc would be inserted between his vertebrae. Due to his health conditions, {{it was reported that}} concerts would need to be either rescheduled or cancelled. On June 9, X Japan announced at a press conference that the concerts would not be postponed but instead performed in an acoustic set, with Yoshiki at the piano, as it is uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to play the drums in the future.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{was passed}} {{fit in the}} days leading up to the race. At the {{previous}} race, he had suffered a serious crash at the Sainte Devote corner and he sustained a three-inch gash on his left calf which required stitches. The Williams team had their test driver Bruno Junqueira ready to replace Ralf Schumacher should the latter have been not ready to race. Ralf Schumacher said that he would decide after the event's first free practice sessions <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> compete.|$|E
5|$|Roy faced {{challenges}} {{before entering}} college. His parents {{and his older}} brother had not attended college, and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT; his reading comprehension was slow, which increased the time he needed for tests. He had taken the test four times (with tutors) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements. Unsure <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to attend a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping containers for $11/hour.|$|E
5000|$|... "Second Advertisement for Myself" [...] - After his {{stint in}} the Army, Mailer spent all his time working on The Naked and the Dead. The novel was a bigger success than <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have ever imagined. But it led to {{questions}} about <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>would</b> be able to repeat that success. In a sense, he writes, {{he may have been}} trying to evade that question by writing Barbary Shore.|$|R
60|$|Hardwick {{aimed the}} pistol at Hal's head. <b>Whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have fired cannot be told, for {{at that instant}} the door opened, and Mr. Sumner stepped in.|$|R
2500|$|There was a {{sense that}} Paul Buckle was {{clearing}} the decks in time for the January transfer window. [...] However, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>would</b> still be at Torquay by the end of January was in serious doubt as he was being heavily tipped to take over from the recently sacked Paul Trollope at League One side Bristol Rovers.|$|R
5|$|At {{seventeen}} years of age, Watts entered the 2008 season primarily playing school football with Brighton Grammar in the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS) competition, instead of under-18 {{level in the}} TAC Cup with the Sandringham Dragons. He was completing year eleven and could choose to nominate for the AFL draft in either 2008 or 2009; touted as a likely early draft pick despite being a year younger than most of his fellow draft prospects, he spent {{the majority of the}} season undecided on <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> nominate for the 2008 draft. He did, however, state that he would remain in Victoria in 2009 to complete year twelve at Brighton Grammar even if he was recruited by an interstate team.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which was a signal for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax. His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as President.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
50|$|Following this, Hacker {{appears in}} a {{television}} interview with Ludovic Kennedy to further bolster his public profile. He declines to be drawn on <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stand for PM.|$|R
60|$|She departed, attired very smartly, in a shawl of price, and {{a certain}} chapeau vert tendre--hazardous, as to its tint, for any {{complexion}} less fresh than her own, but, to her, not unbecoming. I wondered what she intended: whether she really would send Dr. John or not; or <b>whether</b> indeed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> come: <b>he</b> might be engaged.|$|R
60|$|Florence made no comment. <b>Whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{continue}} to be content with the mere interest on the money was a question with which she would be competent to deal when it arose.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{injuries}} throughout his later years, Thome totaled, according to Fangraphs, 71.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a sabermetrics baseball statistic intended to quantify a player's total contributions to a team. He {{was one of}} few players whose prime was during the steroid era and was not suspected of using steroids; Thome adamantly denies ever using performance-enhancing drugs. Soon after the announcement of his front office position (which signified {{the end of his}} playing career), writers began to speculate {{as to whether or not}} Thome would make it to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and more specifically, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> gain entrance in his first year of eligibility in 2018. Writers also questioned whether Thome's candidacy would be hindered by his lack of self-promotion and others' tendency to overlook him.|$|E
5|$|For a while, he was {{uncertain}} <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where {{a friend had}} also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{the year}} of Shaw's ninetieth birthday, he {{accepted}} the freedom of Dublin {{and became the first}} honorary freeman of the borough of St Pancras, London. In the same year the government asked Shaw informally <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> accept the Order of Merit. He declined, believing that an author's merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication, as The Crime of Imprisonment, of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions. It was widely praised; a reviewer in The American Journal of Public Health considered it essential reading for any student of the American criminal justice system.|$|E
50|$|Begich {{voted in}} favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (most {{commonly}} known as Obamacare) when the Bill first passed Congress. Begich has not said <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> vote for the Bill again.|$|R
50|$|Despite waiting <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sign a {{contract}} with the club for another season, he left Feyenoord by mutual consent. on 13 August 2015. After being released by Feyenoord, Wikshire explained his release, citing new challenges.|$|R
50|$|In a {{recording}} of Heck at a private event in October 2016, he said he believed Trump may hurt other Republicans' electoral bids. Prior to the election, {{he did not say}} <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> vote for Trump.|$|R
5|$|In {{the spring}} and summer of 1942, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin {{regularly}} toured villages in the Goražde, Kalinovik and Foča districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians. The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as auxiliaries during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan Operation Trio in April–May. In May, Jevđević met with German intelligence officers in Dubrovnik and was asked <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia. Mihailović was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin. Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin frequently met with Chetnik commander Momčilo Đujić in Split, and the three men quarrelled over how to divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|Patton's final {{assignment}} was {{to command the}} Fifteenth United States Army, based in Bad Nauheim. The Fifteenth Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff tasked to compile {{a history of the}} war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but quickly lost interest in the duty. He began traveling, visiting Paris, Rennes, Chartres, Brussels, Metz, Reims, Luxembourg, and Verdun, as well as Stockholm, where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. Patton decided he would leave his post at the Fifteenth Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for Christmas leave. He intended to discuss with his wife <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> continue in a stateside post or retire.|$|E
5|$|Philip began besieging Amphipolis in 357 BC; the Amphipolitans, abandoning their anti-Athenian policy, {{promptly}} {{appealed to}} Athens, offering {{to return to}} its control. However, during the siege, Philip {{sent a letter to}} Athens saying that he would hand over the city once he captured it (thus appearing to follow the same policy as he had in 359 BC). The Athenians, thus lulled, waited to see <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> The Athenians may also have been unable to send help to Amphipolis. During the summer months, strong northerly winds blew into the Aegean Sea, making it difficult for the Athenians to send ships north. Philip was to make repeated use of the Etesian winds, campaigning during those months (or in winter), when the Athenian navy would be unable to send assistance to his enemies.|$|E
50|$|Offseason reports {{involved}} David Beckham's contract concluding {{at the end}} of 2011, and <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{remain with}} the Galaxy. On January 18, 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Rubin was {{originally}} enquired about by Russian management during 1998 {{as to where}} his heritage lay and <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to represent Russia for their World Cup qualifying fixtures in their bid to gain entry for the 2000 competition.|$|R
5000|$|When asked <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{describe}} as transference a relationship {{in which each}} party saw the other through a veil of unconscious fantasy, instead of as they were, {{he is said to}} have replied ironically, [...] "I'd call that life".|$|R
