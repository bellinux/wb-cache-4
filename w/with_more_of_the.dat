25|$|For example, a {{surviving}} quotation {{shows that}} the Little Iliad narrated how Neoptolemus took Andromache prisoner {{after the fall of}} Troy; however, in Proclus, the Little Iliad stops before the sack of Troy begins. Some scholars have argued that the Cypria as originally planned dealt <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trojan War than Proclus' summary suggests; conversely, others argue that it was designed to lead up to the Iliad, and that Proclus' account reflects the Cypria as originally designed.|$|E
25|$|The next {{development}} of the bicycle, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling. During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on the rear wheel. However, as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller, <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider's weight over the front wheel, braking on the rear wheel became less effective. The front brake, introduced by John Kean in 1873, had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power.|$|E

25|$|Rock Band 4 {{now has the}} use of Freestyle Guitar Solos, an {{optional}} feature. If this feature is disabled, guitar solos in songs are presented {{as they were in}} previous Rock Band games <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same note-matching aspects in beat with the original song's solo; the player scores as they normally do as during regular song sections, with an added scoring bonus based on the percentage of the solo notes hit correctly. When this feature is enabled, instead of the predefined solo, the game shows suggestions for the solo style to emulate at that time, such as single notes or longer licks, chords, or tremolos, using different patterns to highlight the guitar player's on-screen track. The track markings also indicate which set of fret keys on the instrument control to use, which determine the pitch of the notes. Players cannot fail these freestyle sections, but they are scored on how well they hit the suggested style during the segment, and they can retain their scoring multiplier by performing the proper playing style on each section of the solo. The game includes tutorials to help explain these mechanics to players. Further, the audio feedback from these solos has been refined as to make whatever the player performs stay consistent and in-tune with the other active and backing instruments.|$|E

He highlighted [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{as one of the}} album's three [...] "most wonderful songs" [...] and the track on which [...] "a stunning alchemy occurs" [...] due to the presence of Harrison and Lennon. Although less impressed with Ringo, Alan Betrock of Phonograph Record wrote that the song heralded Lennon's comeback as a writer, saying that after his recent overtly political work, [...] "the gum chewing proverbial tongue-in-cheek rocker has returned <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old genius – and Ringo handles the song quite well." [...] In his review for the NME, Charles Shaar Murray found that Lennon's composition [...] "verges uncomfortably on self parody" [...] with Starr left as [...] "the butt of the joke". Amid his criticism of the lyrics, Shaar Murray said that the return of Billy Shears [...] "complete with canned applause" [...] suggested an attempt to [...] "plug the musical holes in the album with large handfuls of charm and nostalgia".|$|E
