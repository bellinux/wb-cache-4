5|$|The novel {{takes place}} during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought {{profound}} changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters– especially young Rastignac, <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study compared selected HIV/STD-related risk variables (sexual behavior, condom use, STD diagnosis, and beliefs) between adults <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{a rural area}} and those <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a non-rural area. Participants were recruited through an electronic mailing list of a large, internet-based sexual enhancement product company and completed a web-based questionnaire. A sample comprising 123 rural {{men and women and}} 1131 non–rural men and women, ages 18 to 39 years, were analyzed. No significant differences were found for any of the variables between those <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a rural area compared to those <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a non-rural area, although both groups reported HIV/STD risk behaviors. Hence, prevention education efforts appear justified in rural, as well urban area...|$|R

5|$|Specter {{was born}} in Wichita, Kansas, the {{youngest}} child of Lillie (née Shanin) and Harry Specter, <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bachkuryne village of Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Specter was Jewish, and wrote in his memoir, Passion for Truth, that his father's family was the only Jewish family in the village. The family lived at 940 South Emporia Street in Wichita before moving to Russell, Kansas, where he graduated from Russell High School in 1947. Russell is also the hometown of fellow politician Bob Dole (who graduated from Russell High School in 1941). Specter said that his father weighed items from his junkyard on a scale owned by Dole's father Doran Dole (who owned a granary). He said his brother Morton and Dole's brother Kenny were contemporaries and friends.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Zach left New Jersey to {{sign with}} the Minnesota Wild on July 4. In an {{interview}} with media from both NJ and Minnesota, he simply states 'I want to enjoy the lakes and my time here". After becoming an unrestricted free agent, Parise signed a 13-year contract worth $98 million with the Minnesota Wild. The move represented a homecoming for Parise, <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twin cities of Minneapolis–Saint Paul and whose father J. P. Parisé once captained the Minnesota North Stars. Parise joined fellow free agent signee Ryan Suter in signing with the Wild; Suter signed on terms identical to Parise's deal. Parise would wear number 11 with the Wild, the same number that his father J. P. wore with the North Stars, as number 9 was already taken by team captain Mikko Koivu. Both Parise and Suter were named alternate captains for the Wild on July 10.|$|E

25|$|During {{the later}} 19th century Surrey became {{important}} {{in the development of}} architecture in Britain and the wider world. Its traditional building forms made a significant contribution to the vernacular revival architecture associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, and would exert a lasting influence. The prominence of Surrey peaked in the 1890s, when it was the focus for globally important developments in domestic architecture, in particular the early work of Edwin Lutyens, <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county and was greatly influenced by its traditional styles and materials.|$|E
25|$|European {{versions}} of the game give the Marshal the highest number (10), while the initial American versions give the Marshal the lowest number (1) to show the highest value (i.e. it is the #1 or most powerful tile). More recent American {{versions of}} the game, which adopted the European system, caused considerable complaint among American players <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s and 1970s.

25|$|Knowledge of Aaron, {{along with}} his brother Moses, comes {{exclusively}} from religious texts, such as the Bible and Qur’an. The Hebrew Bible relates that, unlike Moses, <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian royal court, Aaron and his elder sister Miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border-land of Egypt (Goshen). When Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites, Aaron served as his brother's spokesman ("prophet") to the Pharaoh. Part of the Law (Torah) that Moses received from God at Sinai granted Aaron the priesthood {{for himself and his}} male descendants, and he became the first High Priest of the Israelites. Aaron died before the Israelites crossed the North Jordan river and he was buried on Mount Hor (Numbers 33:39; Deuteronomy 10:6 says he died and was buried at Moserah). Aaron is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible.|$|E
25|$|Deeley {{felt the}} revised script, now called The Deer Hunter, broke fresh {{ground for the}} project. The protagonist in the Redeker/Garfinkle script, Merle, was an {{individual}} who sustained a bad injury in active service and was damaged psychologically by his violent experiences, but was nevertheless a tough character with strong nerves and guts. Cimino and Washburn's revised script distilled the three aspects of Merle's personality and separated them out into three distinct characters. They became three old friends <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same small industrial town {{and worked in the}} same steel mill, and in due course were drafted together to Vietnam. In the original script, the roles of Merle (later renamed Mike) and Nick were reversed in {{the last half of the}} film. Nick returns home to Linda, while Mike remains in Vietnam, sends money home to help Steven, and meets his tragic fate at the Russian roulette table.|$|E
25|$|When Mrs. Brehm died in 1962, the Old Mill was willed to the City of San Marino. The {{city has}} {{preserved}} {{the building and}} opened {{it to the public}} as a museum and art gallery (California Art Club Gallery), operated first by the California Historical Society and later by the Old Mill Foundation. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. A model showing how the mill operated is located {{on the ground floor of}} the museum. While nothing remains of the waterwheel, two of the millstones (pictured above) are displayed in the garden area. The millstones were found more than a century after the mill closed on the grounds of the Huntington Library by General George S. Patton, <b>who</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area and recalled seeing them used as blocks for mounting horses. There is also a 16th-century volcanic rock fountain in the patio to the east of the mill. The fountain was acquired in Mexico by Mrs. Brehm's daughter, Mrs. Albert Doerr.|$|E
