500|$|The role of Frank, the suicidal Proust scholar, was {{originally}} written for Bill Murray, {{and there was}} also studio pressure for Robin Williams. The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began, and in an interview revealed: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> Steve Carell, we didn't know he could do this based upon what he had done. But when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> him and talked to him about the character, the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it, he was right on the same page with us". Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine, he was relatively unknown in Hollywood. Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience.|$|E
500|$|John Buchanan, an American {{historian}} and archivist, postulated that at most, Torrence's Tavern discouraged further militia turnout among North Carolinians of fighting age, noting, however, that turnout {{had previously been}} very low in that state. [...] Buchanan {{went so far as}} to state that [...] "had Tarleton not lived to write his history of the campaign Torrence's Tavern probably would have merited at most a footnote." [...] Cornwallis, however, wrote to George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville about the engagements of February 1–2, 1781, and stated that [...] "this stroke, with our passage of the ford, so effectively dispirited the militia, that <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> no further opposition on our march to the Yadkin." ...|$|E
500|$|Erik Nordby of KNB (known for {{his work}} on The Haunting in Connecticut, which also {{features}} co-star Kyle Gallner) stated, [...] "We immediately went into pitch mode in January and spent a solid two weeks trying to not only bid the script but also collect as much reference material and stuff for the first client get together." [...] He said the director and producers wanted an [...] "old-school, hands-off, lo-fi approach to the visual effects" [...] so that the horror elements would not overpower the storyline. Based on the script, MPC similarly came to the same conclusion and [...] "provided a clear direction" [...] for Nordby and his team. [...] "At that point when <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> them, they had already met with KNB, who had already done up a stylized still of what, at the time, they were calling 'Evil Jennifer,'" [...] he said. [...] "There was a lot of info yet to come, but based on the script, Jennifer goes from very beautiful Megan Fox to a very ghoulish, succubus creature whose jaw distends half-way down her face." [...] Nordby said the look was eventually toned down at the wishes of MPC. From there, KNB [...] "produced some tests, grabbing a bunch of stills from [...] and [...] work to indicate how that balance could exist between special effects and visual effects and still maintain a level of subtlety" [...] and that [...] " [...] responded really well".|$|E

2500|$|Tiana is {{loosely based}} on both Princess Emma, the heroine of Baker's novel, and the princess who appears in the Grimm fairy tale. Clements {{described}} Baker's The Frog Princess as [...] "a kind of fairy tale with a twist" [...] because in it [...] "the princess kissed the frog and instead of him turning into a prince she turned into a frog." [...] Clements and Musker pitched {{the idea for the}} film to Walt Disney Animation Studios CEO John Lasseter [...] "as a hand-drawn film with an African American heroine", conceiving Tiana [...] "as someone who would never have been a big fan of Disney fairy tales." [...] The character was inspired by famed restaurateur Leah Chase, who Clements and Musker met on their research trip to New Orleans. Clements elaborated, [...] "There's a woman in New Orleans named Lee (sic) Chase who was a waitress and ultimately opened a restaurant with her husband … <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> her and we talked with her and she went to kind of into her story, her philosophy about food, which is a big element of the movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the eight}} players who had refused the {{contracts}} {{offered by the}} board, with former skipper Morris Ouma, Alfred Luseno and Nelson Odhiambo being late inclusions, asked their views to be heard, and despite the board granting them another chance, they finally took a firm stance against them. While Obanda, Shem and James Ngoche, Odhiambo, and Otieno were made renewed offers, while Ouma, Luseno, and Nelson had a three-month agreement till March 2012 subject to performance. If they could do something good, they could retain their spot in the team. Sears said of this debacle,"It's a shame that yet again some of these players have turned down their contracts but that is their choice. <b>We</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> these players as we promised we would, we listened to their views and made them offers that reflected what they wanted – an agreement that would run {{until the end of}} the contract year in May 2012 if they met certain performance criteria which all players have to meet. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was that they refused to represent their teams in the East African Competitions last weekend pulling out at the very last minute. Again sadly it calls into question the professionalism of these players, how committed they are to putting in the effort, their application in fulfilling their potential and the advice they have been getting from their advisors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson gave {{a congressional}} speech—Dallek {{considers}} it his greatest—in {{which he said}} [...] "rarely at anytime does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself…rarely are <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> the challenge… to the values and the purposes {{and the meaning of}} our beloved nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation." [...] In 1965, he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination in voting thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time. In accordance with the act, several states, [...] "seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy" [...] (Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia) were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965 while Texas, home to the majority of the African American population at the time, followed in 1975. The Senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of 77-19 just after 2 1/2 months and won passage in the house in July, by 333–85. The results were significant—between the years of 1968 and 1980, the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled. The act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally—in 1965, a few hundred black office-holders mushroomed to 6,000 in 1989.|$|E
