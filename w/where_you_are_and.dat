500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its variety {{of weapons and}} enemies. Game Revolution said that each enemy is [...] "unique both in ability, structure, and behavior so that each requires a specific combat approach". Maximum PC reviewer Josh Norem praised the levels for their interesting objectives, stating that the missions [...] "vary widely, ranging from finding lost colleagues to defending strategic structures against enemy assaults". Computer Games Magazine praised {{the fact that the}} developers replaced the wire-frame automaps of previous Descent games with flat-shaded polygons because they [...] "provide more detail and make it easier to recognize <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> how to get where you want to go". The multiplayer was highlighted positively due to its replay value and variety of game types. Computer Games Magazine also credited its [...] "rock-solid performance on standard dialup modems and easy connectivity", while GameSpot praised it for being [...] "fun and stable". The game was a runner-up for GameSpy's Action Game of the Year and a nominee for GameSpot's PC Action Game of the Year. Despite the positive reviews, the game did not perform well in sales. As a result, Daily Radar awarded the game a [...] "System Shock Award", named after the Looking Glass Studios 1994 game of the same name, implying that Descent 3 is a [...] "game that the critics loved but is over-shadowed by lesser or greater games".|$|E
500|$|Feminist scholar Maria Lauret {{states that}} the {{formation}} of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as [...] "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to [...] "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou begins this technique in her first book, and continues it in Gather Together, especially her demonstration of the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. [...] Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with {{what it means to}} be Black and female in America, but she now describes [...] "a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and [...] "tell the truth as a writer". [...] Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem [...] "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird, because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where [...] "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs... The children need to know you can stumble and fumble and fall, see <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> get up, forgive yourself, and go on about the business of living your life".|$|E

6000|$|... "I reckon you didn't ax me," [...] he {{returned}} coolly. [...] "She told me <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> as I had business down this way she guessed I might drop in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all sad business," [...] groaned Mrs. McFarlane, [...] "and I can see you're keeping {{something}} back. How did Cliff {{happen to}} know just <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were?</b> <b>And</b> what started <b>you</b> back without your father?" ...|$|R

60|$|GEORGE. You're a josher! You {{went off}} while I was away, without telling me <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going. <b>And</b> then, when I found out <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> hustled over to Newcastle in my car, you turned me down hard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I didn't {{know you}} didn't write it," [...] faltered the porter. [...] "I axed the man <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> he said <b>you</b> <b>was</b> visitin' {{his house and}} wanted to show him {{something}} you had in the case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{fortunate}} I knew <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> came {{round to}} pick you up," [...] he said, {{and turned to the}} head of the station, who leaned upon the balustrade apparently shaken and bewildered by what had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{will help}} you. I'll {{help you to}} {{understand}} just <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> how you got there. I'd like you to know before you die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lizzy," [...] cried her mother, [...] "remember <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> do not run on in {{the wild}} manner that you are {{suffered}} to do at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go down, my dear," [...] {{she said}} gently, [...] "you must not neglect your friends. They will wonder <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>And</b> at what {{time do you}} breakfast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{made you}} come back here, ye auld beldam?' {{said one of the}} gipsies; 'could ye not have staid <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> spaed {{fortunes}} to the Cumberland flats? Bing out and tour, ye auld devil, and see that nobody has scented; that's a' you're good for now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Escape me?'--She laughed, {{pointing}} to the teraph--'Me, who, if you fled beyond Kaf, or dived to {{the depths of the}} ocean, could make these dead lips confess <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> command demons to bear you back to me upon their wings! Escape me! Better to obey me, and see your sister.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, Jessie, thank God indeed! But for His mercy {{we should}} have all been lost. I was floundering about beside the canoe when your scream showed me <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> enabled me to save you. But rest here, {{in the lee of}} this bale.--I cannot stay by <b>you.</b> Frank <b>is</b> in danger still." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, then, Reynolds, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> {{the whiskey}} with you, I believe there's {{likely to be}} little {{discretion}} but the discretion of drunkenness,--and not much of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was some}} one passing," [...] she said. [...] "I don't {{understand}} why. They {{all came to}} bed some time ago. Stay <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> don't move." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{shook her}} head as if this were not worth taking up. [...] "My absence has helped you--as I've only to look at you to see. It <b>was</b> my calculation, <b>and</b> I'm justified. You're not <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b> <b>And</b> the thing," [...] she smiled, [...] "was for me not to <b>be</b> there either. <b>You</b> can go of yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas said to Him, [...] "Lord, we do {{not know}} <b>where</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> going, <b>and</b> how can we know the way?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Remember you! Why, {{of course}} I do. I haven't ever forgot you, Ben.

Well, well, you have seen a good bit more of the world than I ever have. You've changed a lot, Ben. You ain't a boy no longer. D'ye mind all the pranks you used to play?" ...|$|R

"Why, my dear," [...] Hilda said, [...] "coming here {{as often}} as he does, he {{naturally}} inquired <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> as I <b>was</b> uncertain how long <b>you</b> would <b>be</b> away, <b>and</b> as he had always been in our counsels, I could hardly keep him in the dark, even had I wished to do so. Now, my dear, let us know all about it; there can be no possible reason for keeping silent any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> {{attend to}} the horse!" [...] said Troy, peremptorily {{throwing}} her the reins and the whip. [...] "Walk the horse to the top: I'll see to the woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said firmly, [...] "you can {{do nothing}} further. You have done your part and done it well. Stay <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> wait. The rest belongs to me." ...|$|E
