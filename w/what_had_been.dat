By 1944, he had risen to the post of majority leader in that body and {{played a central role in}} writing the state's budget that year. Due to Clements' efforts, educational appropriations were increased far above <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> called for by Republican governor Simeon Willis.|$|E

5|$|What is now MD 5 between Leonardtown Road and Poplar Hill Road was {{constructed}} as {{a gravel road}} by 1927. This road was designated part of MD 233. In 1956, MD 382 was extended west into Charles County along part of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> MD 233 to MD 5 at Beantown. MD 382 was removed from Charles County in 1989. That same year, MD 205 {{was assigned to the}} westernmost portion of Poplar Hill Road in Beantown and north along two-lane MattawomanBeantown Road to US 301 and MD 5 at Mattawoman. The route was expanded to a four-lane divided highway and was taken over as MD 5's bypass of Waldorf in 1997. The portion of MD 5 from <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> MD 205's southern terminus west to US 301 became MD 5 Bus.|$|E

5|$|A further twelve bodies, pending {{refinements}} {{of knowledge}} regarding their physical properties, were possible candidates {{to join the}} list under this definition. Some objects in this second list were more likely eventually to be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and race {{relations}} in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E

The event was (to date) the biggest {{sporting}} event ever held in Wales; however, {{it would not have}} been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club. Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the greyhound track. It would turn out to be the last time that South Africa would participate in the Games until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth Games in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Jim Carrey was {{considered}} for the part of Jack Sparrow. However, the production schedule for The Curse of the Black Pearl conflicted with Bruce Almighty. Others {{considered for the}} role include Michael Keaton and Christopher Walken. Although Cook had been a strong proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Verbinski told his concept artists to keep working on the picture, and when Eisner came to visit, the executive was astonished by <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> created.|$|E

Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.|$|E

The gold caused a stampede of miners to the area, and buildings sprang up around Barnette's trading post. In November 1903, the area's residents voted to incorporate the city of Fairbanks. Barnette became the city's first mayor, and the city flourished as thousands of people came in search of gold during the Fairbanks Gold Rush.|$|E

Palmer started a project in 1880 to make <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire. This would mean a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah. This would also place the D in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad, then operated by Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The first road to use {{the general}} {{alignment}} of modern Route 14 was called the El Camino Sierra, or Sierra Highway, which extended from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe. A dirt road was completed in the 1910s from <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a pack trail. The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete in 1931, when the portion from Mojave to the Owens Valley, along modern US 395, was paved.|$|E

The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a largely agrarian economy.|$|E

It originally began in downtown Elmira and ended at the Pennsylvania state line in Chemung. NY427 was realigned on its east end in 1967 to meet the newly constructed exit59 on NY17 and on its west end in 1978 to follow <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> New York State Route379 through the town of Southport.

5|$|The state {{responded by}} {{establishing}} the Department of Divinity ("jingikan") in 1869. This government bureaucracy encouraged the segregation of Kami spirits from Buddhist ones, and emphasized the divine lineage of the Emperor from the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu. This action sought to reverse <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a blending of Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japan. That department was unsuccessful, and demoted to a Ministry. In 1872, policy for Shrines and other religions {{was taken over}} by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry intended to standardize rituals across shrines, and saw some small success, but fell short of its original intent.|$|E
