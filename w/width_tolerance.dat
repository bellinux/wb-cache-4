This is important for vector network analyzer measurements in the THZ range where waveguide tolerances become large compared the wavelength and to cross sectional dimensions. Besides causing reflections in the waveguide interface, the waveguide <b>width</b> <b>tolerance</b> also causes a change in the propagation constant that can shift the reference planes and cause problems in estimating the propagation constant of the Line standard.

40|$|Current {{designs of}} bileaflet {{mechanical}} heart valves (BMHVs) and trileaflet polymeric heart valves(TPHVs) are plagued by unacceptable levels of hemolysis and thrombus formation in critical areas thereby producing mediocre clinical performance. The {{objective of this}} study is: (1) to investigate the influence of BMHV designs on hinge flow characteristics, (2) to quantify the influence of hinge gap <b>width</b> <b>tolerance</b> in a BMHV design, and (3) to investigate the influence of TPHV design on flow characteristics. St. Jude Medical (SJM) provided four transparent mitral BMHVs: one 23 mm CarboMedics (CM), one 27 mm SJM Standard and two 27 mm prototype BHMVs with altered hinge gap widths. Aortech Inc. provided three 23 mm aortic prototype TPHVs. Laser Doppler velocimetry and Particle Image velocimetry were used to measure flow velocity inside these valve prostheses. The flows through the valves were maintained within physiological limits. All valves revealed Reynolds shear stress (RSS) levels greater than 200 Pa far exceeding the threshold for platelet activation and hemolysis. MHV hinge flows in the mitral position were characterized by a strong recirculation during ventricular diastole while leakage jets over and adjacent to leaflets were prominent during ventricular systole. CM hinge flow had higher RSS than in the SJM hinge. The large gap width hinge had the largest leakage jet size and highest RSS (> 400 Pa) during ventricular diastole. The Standard gap width hinge showed better washout during systole and provided optimum hemodynamic performance than the prototype designs. In aortic prototype PHVs, elevated RSS conducive to hemolysis was observed along the central jet during systole and the leakage jet at the high central region inside the valve during diastole. This study showed that hinge geometry designs and hinge gap <b>width</b> <b>tolerance</b> governed {{the success of the}} bileaflet MHV design. Also the performance of the three aortic PHVs is dependent on commissural designs and leaflet thicknesses. Owing to the critical nature flow fields on clinical outcomes studies such as the current study should be conducted in the pre-clinical evaluation phase for all new MHV or PHVs. Ph. D.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a novel {{measurement}} setup and thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration kit for vector network analyser (VNA) measurements at 220 GHz to 325 GHz (WR- 03) is presented. Measurements on passive membrane circuit devices under test (DUTs) show {{improvement in the}} S-parameters compared to a waveguide integrated membrane circuit setup in previous work, especially in reducing the ripples and increasing repeatability of the measurements. VNA measurements provide a challenge when measuring on waveguide integrated membrane circuit devices at terahertz frequencies. In this setup, phase uncertainty in the measurements, due to waveguide <b>width</b> <b>tolerance,</b> is reduced by shortening the access waveguides. Because both waveguide inputs are placed in the same flange, the access waveguides can be made much shorter. However, {{in order to accommodate}} different DUT and TRL line lengths, two bends were introduced in each waveguide, and the trade-off between sharper bends or longer access waveguides effect on uncertainty, investigated. By the use of an adapter block, which puts the VNA extender outputs in the same flange, phase uncertainty due to cable flex is eliminated by locking the VNA frequency extenders in position during the entire measurement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Robotic {{knee surgery}} {{performs}} bone cutting without relying on mechanical jigs during bone preparation of TKA (Total Knee Arthroplasty). The inaccuracy induced by loose jig fixation and slot <b>width</b> <b>tolerance</b> can, subsequently, be avoided. Mill is usually {{used as the}} bone cutter {{in most of the}} current knee surgical robots, in which all bones are milled out. This might not be desired. In some cases, the cut bone may be used by the surgeon for adjustment of soft tissue balance and/or varus/valgus for some patients. Therefore the existent bone cutting method may not be adequate. Different scenarios of bone cutting in order to preserve the cut-off bones to be in pieces should be developed. In the proposed cutting process, the side edge instead of the bottom edge of the mill is used to move and cut the bone along the designated boundary of the cutting plane. Thus cut-off bone {{is in the form of}} pieces rather than blurs or chips. However, this cutting process will give rise to large and non-uniform cut forces on the cutter. As a result, the cutter is under large bending and the cutting trajectory may be deviated or, even worse, the cutter may be broken. To overcome the problem, the paper proposed an adaptive impedance force control strategy to maintain the stability and accuracy of bone cutting process. I...|$|E

40|$|Substantial {{technical}} {{progress was made}} {{on all of the}} three high-risk subsystems of this program. The subsystems include dielectric antenna, G-band receiver, and electro-optic image processor. Progress is approximately on-schedule for both the receiver and the electro-optic processor development, while greater than anticipated challenges have been discovered in the dielectric antenna development. Much of the information in this report was covered in greater detail in the One-Year Review Meeting held at TTC on 22 February 1996. The performance goals of the dielectric antenna project are: Scan Angle [...] 20 deg. desired; Loss [...] 6 dB end to end (3 dB average); Frequency [...] 206 - 218 GHz (6 % bandwidth); Beam width [...] 0. 25 deg.; and Length [...] 12 inches. The scan angle requirement was chosen to satisfy the needs of aircraft pilots. This requirement, coupled with the presently limited bandwidth processors (1 GHz state-of-the-art and 12 GHz in development in this program) forces the antenna to be dielectric (high scan angle air-filled waveguide-based antennas would be too lossy and their performance would vary too much as a function of frequency). A high dielectric constant (e. g., 10) was initially chosen for the dielectric material. This choice lead to the following fabrication challenges: total thickness variation (TTV) tolerance is 1 micrometer; coupler spacing tolerance is 1 micrometer; <b>width</b> <b>tolerance</b> is larger, but unknown, and the surfaces must have mirror finish. Also of importance is the difficulty in obtaining raw materials that satisfy the overall length requirement of 12 inches while simultaneously satisfying the above specifications...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} variables {{in the design of}} the end cap calorimeter is the number of angular divisions that should be made in the face of the calorimeter array. While it would be ideal to have no such divisions, they are unavoidable because the maximum size for uranium sheets is less than the diameter of the array. These divisions create regions which are either partially or totally devoid of absorber and readout. It is the purpose of this note to analyze the effects of different parameters on the size of these cracks. This analysis assumes wedge shaped structures of significant depth (i. e. > 20 % of the total depth). For such modules there are five variables which affect the size of a crack. They are: (1) The clearance between modules. The extent to which the module wall and the array extend into this region depends on the tolerances on the manufacture of the module. All of the module construction techniques currently under consideration have very tight tolerances (e. g. 2 mils). Therefore, this region is assumed to be void of solid material. In the C. C this region is thought to be. 090 inches wide. (2) The thickness of the module walls. The wall thickness depends on which module is discussed. Design thicknesses range from. 078 inches in the C. C. modules to. 150 inches in the E. C leakage modules. Because tight tolerances are assumed on the construction of the modules the skin is assumed to be perfectly flat. (3) The dimension tolerance on the uranium width. The effect of the dimension tolerance varies depending on the location of the module. Modules near the a o'clock and 9 o'clock position will see a gray zone equal to the dimension tolerance at the top of each module. There will be a solid black zone at the bottom of each module. This results from gravity pulling the uranium plates down to touch the lower wall of the module. Modules near the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock region will see a gray zone equal to the dimension tolerance at both edges of a module since there are no plans for a mechanism to insure their alignment along one wall. (4) The straightness tolerance on the plate edges. The straightness tolerance creates a gray zone equal to its width along each side of a module. (5) The region of reduced signal pickup. The extent of this region is not yet well understood. The current design requires an area along the edge of the module which does not have resistive coat. The width of this region has not been determined. Some portion of this region should still collect all of the signal. The size of this region is not known, either. As an example we can use the tolerances currently achieved for the Harvard plates at Rocky Flats. The <b>width</b> <b>tolerance</b> requested was + 0. 000, - 0. 020 inches. Rocky Flats is delivering plates with a <b>width</b> <b>tolerance</b> of + 0. 000, - 0. 040 inch. There is no tolerance on the straightness of the datum edge. If we assume that. 010 inch of the. 040 inch tolerance is do to straightness variation then we can determine the crack sizes for a C. C. E. M. module...|$|E

40|$|Artifacts {{that are}} {{fabricated}} {{with the help}} of molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) are undergoing development for use as dimensional calibration standards with submicron widths. Such standards are needed for calibrating instruments (principally, scanning electron microscopes and scanning probe microscopes) for measuring the widths of features in advanced integrated circuits. Dimensional calibration standards fabricated by an older process that involves lithography and etching of trenches in (110) surfaces of single-crystal silicon are generally reproducible to within dimensional tolerances of about 15 nm. It is anticipated that when the artifacts of the present type are fully developed, their critical dimensions will be reproducible to within 1 nm. These artifacts are expected to find increasing use in the semiconductor-device and integrated- circuit industries as the <b>width</b> <b>tolerances</b> on semiconductor devices shrink to a few nanometers during the next few years. Unlike in the older process, one does not rely on lithography and etching to define the critical dimensions. Instead, one relies on the inherent smoothness and flatness of MBE layers deposited under controlled conditions and defines the critical dimensions as the thicknesses of such layers. An artifact of the present type is fabricated in two stages (see figure) : In the first stage, a multilayer epitaxial wafer is grown on a very flat substrate. In the second stage, the wafer is cleaved to expose the layers, then the exposed layers are differentially etched (taking advantage of large differences between the etch rates of the different epitaxial layer materials). The resulting structure includes narrow and well-defined trenches and a shelf with thicknesses determined by the thicknesses of the epitaxial layers from which they were etched. Eventually, {{it should be possible to}} add a third fabrication stage in which durable, electronically inert artifacts could be replicated in diamondlike carbon from a master made by MBE and etching as described above...|$|R

It is shown that the proposed interval procedure has advantages over an existing method in its theoretical justifi-cation, computational simplicity, and numerical performance. For design planning, the corresponding sample size proce-dures for precise interval estimation of the weighted eta-squared association measure are also delineated.

40|$|The use of {{regression}} models for prediction purposes {{is one of}} the most common applications of chemometrics. In most cases, only reporting the point predictions is unsatisfactory and intervals are needed to quantify the uncertainty involved. It is common practice to use the 95 % prediction interval for this goal and to interpret such an interval as if 95 % of the future responses will be contained within this interval. However, this is inappropriate, and it can result in a gross underestimation of the real uncertainty of the predicted response, especially in cases where the degrees of freedom is small. To correctly quantify the uncertainty of a prediction, so-called tolerance intervals should be used. Although the theoretical background on tolerance intervals is well documented in the statistical literature, practical guidelines to calculate and use tolerance intervals in real-world applications are lacking. Another less known concept is that of simultaneous versus non-simultaneous intervals. In this tutorial, we explain the origin, interpretation and practical calculation of confidence, prediction, and tolerance intervals, both in their simultaneous and non-simultaneous form. Depending on the case, equations for exact or approximate tolerance intervals are provided. The accuracy of the approximations is discussed. A MATLAB program is available to estimate the exact <b>width</b> of <b>tolerance</b> intervals in all cases involving ordinary least squares regression. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

As fiber laser provides a combination of high beam quality and awavelength that is easily absorbed by metal surfaces, the named future laser isexpected to challenge the CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers {{in the area of}} metal cutting. This thesis studied the performance of fiber laser cutting mild steel. In the literature review part, it introduced the laser cutting principle and the principle of fiber laser including the newest development of fiber laser cuttingtechnology. Because the fiber laser cutting mild steel is a very young technology, a preliminary test was made in order to investigate effect of the cutting parameters on cut quality. Then the formal fiber laser cutting experiment was madeby using 3 mm thickness S 355 steel with oxygen as assistant gas. The experimentwas focused on the cut quality with maximum cutting speed and minimum oxygen gas pressure.

After analysis the cutting result, several conclusions were made. Although the best result got in the experiment is not perfect as predicted, the whole result of the test can be accepted. Compared with CO 2 laser, a higher cutting speed was achieved by fiber laser with very low oxygen gas pressure.

To date, GBS is becoming popular for population studies, genetic diversity, QTL mapping, and genomic selection (He et al. 2014). GBS enabled the construction of high-density linkage map and QTL analysis in maize, wheat, barley (Poland et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2014), oat (Huang et al. 2014), and chickpea (Jaganathan et al. 2015).

40|$|Time series {{analysis}} of plant physiological data {{has been used}} to access the effects of environmental disturbances on plant metabolism [1, 5]. However, there are several critical statistical issues in the proper application of complexity measures, both theoretically and especially to real data [4]. To produce a model-independent, replicable assessment of complexity, we utilize Approximate Entropy (ApEn) in the {{analysis of}} plant physiological time series data. ApEn is defined in [2], with further mathematical properties and representative biological applications [3, 4]. ApEn is robust or insensitive to both low level noise and to infrequent artifacts or outliers. ApEn assigns a non-negative number to a sequence or time-series, with larger values corresponding to greater apparent process randomness or serial irregularity, and smaller values corresponding to more instances of recognizable features or patterns in the data. Two input parameters, a run length m and a tolerance window r, must be specified to compute ApEn. This parameter measures the logarithmic likelihood that runs of patterns that are close (within r) for m contiguous observations remain close (within the same <b>tolerance</b> <b>width</b> r) on next incremental comparisons...|$|R
40|$|A {{tolerance}} curve {{defines the}} dependence of a genotype's fitness {{on the state of}} an environmental gradient. It can be characterized by a mode (the genotype's optimal environment) and a width (the breadth of adaptation). It seems possible that one or both of these characters can be modified in an adaptive manner, at least partially, during development. Thus, we extend the theory of environmental tolerance to include reaction norms for the mode and the <b>width</b> of the <b>tolerance</b> curve. We demonstrate that the selective value of such reaction norms increases with increasing spatial heterogeneity and between-generation temporal variation in the environment and with decreasing within-generation temporal variation. Assuming that the maintenance of a high breadth of adaptation is costly, reaction, norms are shown to induce correlated selection for a reduction in this character. Nevertheless, regardless of the magnitude of the reaction norm, there is a nearly one to one relationship between the optimal breadth of adaptation and the within-generation temporal variation perceived by the organism. This suggests that empirical estimates of the breadth of adaptation may provide a useful index of this type of environmental variation from the organism's point of view. ...|$|R

Moreover, it is shown that the textile stripline is robust in terms of propagation characteristics, as even when bent up to 90 and 180 it can maintain consistent propagation properties in the whole operation band.

To help answer this as generally as possible, we conduct state-of-the-art modelling in which we sweep the inputs that represent major technology-related constraints, such as diffusion depth, metal finger width and height, alignment tolerances, etc. (these are assigned to the x- And y-axes of our graphs). We then predict the optimum device parameters resulting from these restrictions (shown as contour lines). There are many different ways to achieve 22 %. Our modelling predicts, for example, that 60 μm wide screen-printed metal fingers are sufficiently narrow if the alignment <b>tolerance</b> (<b>width</b> of the n++ region) is below 90 μm. The rear may be contacted with 30 μm wide openings of the Al 2 O 3 /SiNx stack and with local J 0,BSF values as high as 900 fA/cm 2. If these requirements cannot be met, they may be compensated by improvements in other device parts. Regardless of this, the wafer material requires a SRH lifetime of at least 1 ms at excess carrier densities near 10 (14) cm(- 3) ...|$|R
40|$|The lugworm Arenicola marina {{is a key}} {{organism}} {{from the}} intertidal zone, which is very abundant and shapes the ecosystem by bioturbation. The lugworm is distributed over a wide latitudinal range and exposed to widely fluctuating temperature conditions during seasonal as well as diurnal (tidal) cycles. Animals are specialized to adjust to ambient climate conditions as well as climate variability as evidenced from patterns of latitudinal adaptation and seasonal acclimatisation of thermal tolerance windows. While thermal responses {{can be found at}} various levels of organisation we expect climate sensitivity to be highest at the organismal level, the animals balance of oxygen demand and supply. Quantification of the resulting organismal performance range is relevant in the light of global warming and climate change, as exposure to temperatures beyond the performance window likely leads to fitness losses with the consequence of decreased local abundances and eventually a shift in geographical distribution. Performance optima, the <b>width</b> of thermal <b>tolerance</b> windows and their location on the temperature scale were quantified by investigating basic metabolism, growth and muscular exercise on the demand side and ventilation, haemoglobin concentration and oxygen affinity on the supply side in populations of Arenicola marina from the French Atlantic coast, the German North Sea and the Russian White Sea. Performance optima shift to higher temperatures at decreasing latitudes. Seasonal shifts to higher temperatures occur during summer acclimatisation emphasizing a close relationship between the local climate regime and the degree of thermal specialisation of the respective population...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of the {{physiological}} mechanisms shaping latitudinal adaptation and seasonal acclimatization to temperature {{are carried out}} to go further into {{the question of how}} marine invertebrates and their ecosystems respond to climate change. While thermal responses can be found at various levels of organisation we expect sensitivity to be highest at the organismal level, the animals balance of oxygen demand and supply. This balance is composed of energy consuming processes like metabolic maintenance, growth, reproduction, muscular exercise and others on the demand side, and of oxygen providing processes like ventilation, blood oxygenation, circulation, tissue oxygenation and cellular respiration on the supply side. Rising temperature leads to a mismatch situation causing an increased oxygen demand. The organism has to react either by increasing the rate of supply processes or by reducing energy consuming processes that are not essential for survival. The capacity of the supply system is limited and when pejus temperatures are reached, it is not able to meet demand any more, blood oxygenation decreases. Long-term warming beyond pejus temperatures thereby leads to reduced performance (e. g. growth, reproduction, muscle exercise) with likely severe ecological consequences (decreased abundance, local extinction, shift in distribution). Performance optima and the <b>width</b> of thermal <b>tolerance</b> windows and their location on the temperature scale were quantified investigating standard metabolism, growth and muscular exercise on the demand side and ventilation, haemoglobin properties and tissue oxygenation on the supply side in populations of the lugworm Arenicola marina. The data demonstrate latitudinal differences between these windows and their seasonal shifts and thus a close relationship between the local climate regime and the degree of thermal specialization of the respective population...|$|R
40|$|Genotyping by {{sequencing}} (GBS) is {{the latest}} application of next-generation sequencing protocols {{for the purposes of}} discovering and genotyping SNPs in a variety of crop species and populations. Unlike other high-density genotyping technologies which have mainly been applied to general interest "reference" genomes, the low cost of GBS makes it an attractive means of saturating mapping and breeding populations with a high density of SNP markers. One barrier to the widespread use of GBS has been the difficulty of the bioinformatics analysis as the approach is accompanied by a high number of erroneous SNP calls which are not easily diagnosed or corrected. In this study, we use a 384 -plex GBS protocol to add 30, 984 markers to an indica (IR 64) × japonica (Azucena) mapping population consisting of 176 recombinant inbred lines of rice (Oryza sativa) and we release our imputation and error correction pipeline to address initial GBS data sparsity and error, and streamline the process of adding SNPs to RIL populations. Using the final imputed and corrected dataset of 30, 984 markers, we were able to map recombination hot and cold spots and regions of segregation distortion across the genome {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, thus identifying regions of the genome containing putative sterility loci. We mapped QTL for leaf <b>width</b> and aluminum <b>tolerance,</b> and were able to identify additional QTL for both phenotypes when using the full set of 30, 984 SNPs that were not identified using a subset of only 1, 464 SNPs, including a previously unreported QTL for aluminum tolerance located directly within a recombination hotspot on chromosome 1. These results suggest that adding a high density of SNP markers to a mapping or breeding population through GBS has a great value for numerous applications in rice breeding and genetics research.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} heat tolerance attributes of Nigerian locally adapted chicken as affected by strain and some qualitative traits. The experimental birds consisted of four matured strains. A total number of 120 healthy matured birds consist of 30 each of Naked Neck, Normal Feather, Fulani and Frizzle feather. Each bird was monitored and measured {{for the number of}} comb cups, comb length, comb height, wattle height and width {{at the beginning of the}} experiment and recorded for each strain. Data were obtained on a daily basis (afternoon) for 12 weeks. The measurement taken include: Numbers of comb cups, Comb length, Comb height, Wattle height, and Wattle <b>width.</b> The heat <b>tolerance</b> attributes considered were the rectal temperature, pulse rate and respiratory rate. Chicken strain and sex had significant effect (P 0. 05) effect was shown in rectal temperature. Comb cups also affected (P < 0. 05) pulse and respiratory rates. The lowest pulse rates were obtained in chicken with measuring 5 cm high and 4 cm long. Regarding respiratory rate and heat stress index, the lowest values were recorded in chicken having combs that measured 8 cm high 7 cm long. The lowest respiratory and pulse rates were observed in chicken whose comb had 14 and 8 cups respectively. There was significant (P < 0. 05) wattle size variation in pulse and respiratory rate and heat stress index. The lowest pulse respiratory rates were observed in 7 cm wattle height while the lowest respiratory and heat stress index occurred in chicken whose wattle measured 7 cm in diameter. However, 6 cm wattle width had the lowest pulse rate. It can therefore, concluded that strain, sex and some qualitative traits in chickens affect heat tolerance attribute...|$|R
40|$|Current New Zealand {{guidelines}} {{encourage the}} installation of painted centrelines and edgelines on rural roads. Though {{it is known that}} speed is directly proportional to both accident likelihood and severity, the effect of pavement markings on speed is unclear. This study looked at the effect of pavement markings (centrelines and edgelines) on speed. The study method involved speed surveys at matched pairs, to compare sites with an edgeline and centreline, to centreline only sites, and to compare a further set of centreline-only sites to sites with no markings. Sites within pairs were all on straight, flat, single-carriageway rural roads in country environments, with 100 km/h posted speed limits. Pairs were matched for sealed carriageway <b>width,</b> with a <b>tolerance</b> 0. 5 m difference in width allowed within pairs. In addition, a before/after study compared speeds at one of the centreline-only sites before and after installation of an edgeline. Results showed that compared to the case of no markings, presence of a centreline increases the mean speed and lowers the coefficient of variation. For matched pair sites with significant results, the increase in mean speed observed within pairs comparing no centreline to centreline only was 12. 1 km/h, from 71. 9 km/h for sites with no markings, to 84. 0 km/h for sites with a centreline only. The increase in mean speed observed at pairs comparing centreline only to centreline plus edgeline was 11. 3 km/h, from 86. 0 km/h for sites with centreline only, to 97. 3 km/h for sites with a centreline and edgeline. A before/after study showed a significant increase in speed with addition of an edgeline to a centreline-only road of 7. 8 km/h. Overall, an increase in delineation generally leads to an increase in speed, and a lowering of the coefficient of variation across all observed speeds. As it is unlikely that drivers would admit to being consciously motivated by {{the presence or absence of}} a centreline or edgeline, it is likely that this effect is due to an unconscious process of some kind...|$|R
