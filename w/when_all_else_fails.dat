25|$|Eric Black, {{played by}} Blake Bashoff: He is a gay {{teenager}} {{who had been}} so badly abused that he was blind for two years. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails,</b> Maxine reluctantly takes him into her home, where he rapidly bonds with the family; afterwards, Sean becomes his foster father. Eventually, Eric protectively confronts and kills a stalker after Amy and Lauren. He is tried and found not guilty, but does so by lying on the witness stand. Maxine is disappointed in him, so he decides to move to Canada with his boyfriend, Mark.|$|E
2500|$|Masami Eiri is {{introduced}} {{as the project}} director on Protocol Seven (the next-generation Internet protocol in the series' time-frame) for major computer company Tachibana General Laboratories. He had secretly included code of his very own creation to give himself absolute control of the Wired through the wireless system described above. He then [...] "uploaded" [...] his own brain, conscience, consciousness, memory, feelings, emotions – his very self – into the Wired and [...] "died" [...] a few days after, leaving only his physical, living body behind. These details are unveiled around {{the middle of the}} series, but this is the point where the story of Serial Experiments Lain begins. Masami later explains that Lain is the artifact by which the wall between the virtual and material worlds is to fall, and that he needs her to get to the Wired and [...] "abandon the flesh", as he did, to achieve his plan. The series sees him trying to convince her through interventions, using the promise of unconditional love, romantic seduction and charm, and even, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails,</b> threats and force.|$|E

50|$|The Fourteenth Century {{legal system}} {{included}} practices of vigilantism and retribution. Debts were often recovered using force, disputes resolved by duels and judges were only involved <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed.</b> The Folvilles, finding themselves as 'heroes of the revolution' (at least locally, having saved their neighbours from the nefarious acts of Despencer and Belers), became emboldened {{and continued to}} commit acts of retribution and, {{as the years went}} by, found themselves {{on both sides of the}} law being repeatedly outlawed and then pardoned.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{conflict}} has reached life-or-death intensity and when petition and nonviolent resistance have failed, a satyagrahi will sometimes deliberately court {{the possibility of}} death {{as a last resort}} to open the heart of the opponent. Gandhi's famous [...] "fasts unto death" [...] during the Indian freedom struggle is an example, as well as the courageous work of activists like Kathy Kelly who, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed,</b> have repeatedly gone into war zones to share the fate of the victims and awaken their oppressors.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails</b> {{follow the}} caribou,--that {{is the law}} which governs the wolf in the hungry days; but before they crossed the {{mountains}} and followed the long valleys to the far southern ranges the wolves {{went back to the}} hills, where the trail began, for a more exciting and dangerous kind of hunting. The pack had held closer together of late; for the old wolves must often share even a scant fox or rabbit with the hungry and inexperienced youngsters. Now, when famine drove them to the very doors of the one enemy to be feared, only the wisest and wariest old wolf was fit to lead the foray.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this. When I found I had got to live, {{and live}} manfully, I said to myself, 'I must have help or I cannot do it.' To no living soul could I tell my grief, {{not even to}} my mother, for {{she had her own}} to bear: no human being could help me, yet I must have help or give up shamefully. Then I did what others do <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails</b> to sustain them; I turned to God: not humbly, not devoutly or trustfully, but doubtfully, bitterly, and rebelliously; for I said in my despairing heart, 'If there is a God, let Him help me, and I will believe.' He did help me, and I kept my word." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hilda Wade {{seemed to}} collect herself. [...] "Now, Mr. Le Geyt is {{essentially}} a Celt--a Celt in temperament," [...] she went on; [...] "he comes by origin and ancestry from a rough, heather-clad country; he belongs to the moorland. In other words, his type is the mountaineer's. But a mountaineer's instinct in similar circumstances is--what? Why, to fly straight to his native mountains. In an agony of terror, in an access of despair, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>fails,</b> he strikes a bee-line for the hills he loves; rationally or irrationally, he seems to think he can hide there. Hugo Le Geyt, with his frank boyish nature, his great Devonian frame, is sure to have done so. I know his mood. He has made for the West Country!" ...|$|E
50|$|Apu, as the lying {{statue of}} Jesus is fondly called by devotees, {{has become a}} symbol of hope for people longing for a {{connection}} to the divine especially <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed.</b> His image is supine, bruised, caught in the final act of love and sacrifice that has spelled salvation for those who believe in Him. Every kiss that lands His badly bruised feet or a touch that grazes His battered hand comes with a deep conviction that through His death and resurrection, He made all things new. Apung Mamacalulu bestows mercy beyond the grave.|$|R
50|$|The {{civilian}} population was correspondingly pro-allied. Prisoners of war {{were sent to}} Corsica. There they occupied every available space from rooms in monasteries to cells in citadels. Stone sheds were converted for their use. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed,</b> wooden barracks were constructed on the mountainsides. The prisoners were put to work in agriculture and forestry. Corsica was also turned into a hospital for the wounded. Most of the allies sent medical units or volunteers. The island was so useful as a base that the sea lanes leading to it were under constant surveillance and attack by U-boats.|$|R
5000|$|Corporate {{power can}} also {{increase}} income inequality. Joseph Stiglitz wrote in May 2011: [...] "Much of today’s inequality {{is due to}} manipulation of the financial system, enabled by changes in the rules that have been bought and {{paid for by the}} financial industry itself—one of its best investments ever. The government lent money to financial institutions at close to zero percent interest and provided generous bailouts on favorable terms <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed.</b> Regulators {{turned a blind eye to}} a lack of transparency and to conflicts of interest." [...] Stiglitz explained that the top 1% got nearly [...] "one-quarter" [...] of the income and own approximately 40% of the wealth.|$|R

60|$|Fortunately for Chauvelin {{there were}} two keys which, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed,</b> were apt to open the doors of Carrier's stronghold: the key of fear and that of cupidity. He tried both and succeeded. He bribed and he threatened: he endured Fleury's {{brutality}} and Lalouët's impertinence but he got his way. After an hour's weary waiting and ceaseless parleyings he was once more ushered into the antechamber where he had sat earlier in the day. The doors leading to the inner sanctuary were open. Young Jacques Lalouët stood by them on guard. Carrier, fuming and raging at having been disturbed, vented his spleen and ill-temper on Chauvelin.|$|R

5000|$|James {{launched}} {{a series of}} ploys to keep Barbara and Gunnar (to whom she was now engaged due to her and James undergoing a divorce) from gaining custody of little Paul and learning he wasn't a true [...] "Stenbeck". His ploys included trying to kill John Dixon by poisoning a jug of water so he wouldn't expose {{he was not a}} biological [...] "Stenbeck", hiring a woman named Mme. Koster to pose as [...] "Sylvia" [...] Barbara's housekeeper in order to drive Barbara insane, and even tried to poison Gunnar numerous times to gain the sole fortune. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed,</b> James turned to attempting to murder Gunnar by throwing him from a catwalk, but Barbara saved Gunnar when she shot James, but he survived.

50|$|After a {{visit with}} his mother to Chicago World's Fair, they decided that {{opportunities}} in the North were more plentiful than in the South. Facing poverty on every side in Arkansas during the Great Depression, {{the family moved to}} Chicago, Illinois in 1933 to try to find work and for Johnson to continue his education. Johnson entered all-black DuSable High School while his mother and stepfather scoured the city for jobs during the day. He looked for work after school and during the summer as well, but without success. His mother was not even able to find any domestic work, which was generally available <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed.</b> To support themselves, the family applied for welfare, which they received for two years until Johnson's stepfather was finally able to obtain a position with the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Johnson himself secured a job with the National Youth Administration (NYA).|$|R

50|$|Under Woolsey, Sheppard {{continued}} to lead efforts {{to fight the}} Wraith and briefly Michael who returned a final time to takeover Atlantis. With the help of Todd, Sheppard and his team attempted {{to find a way}} to eliminate the Wraith's need to feed on humans, but this led to a betrayal by Todd when he believed Sheppard activated the Attero Device to destroy the Wraith at the cost of any activated Stargate in the Pegasus Galaxy. Despite this, Sheppard continued working with Todd when the situation called for it. In the series finale, Enemy at the Gate, Sheppard learned of a new, more powerful hive ship from Todd and worked to stop it from reaching and destroying Earth. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed,</b> even Atlantis, Sheppard boarded the ship with a nuclear weapon in a suicide mission to save Earth. Sheppard succeeded in destroying the hive ship and saving Atlantis and Earth, but due to a surprise appearance by the rest of his team, survived the experience. He later joined Atlantis' senior staff at looking out over the Golden Gate Bridge from Atlantis which had landed on Earth in the aftermath of the hive ship's attempted attack.|$|R

5000|$|... In Dr. Gull were {{combined}} energy that never tired, watchfulness that never flagged nursing so tender, ministry so minute, {{that in his}} functions he seemed to combine the duties of physician, dresser, dispenser, valet, nurse,-now arguing with the sick man in his delirium so softly and pleasantly that the parched lips opened to take the scanty nourishment on which depended the reserves of strength for the deadly fight <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed,</b> now lifting the wasted body from bed to bed, now washing the worn frame with vinegar, with ever ready eye and ear and finger to mark any change and phase, to watch face and heart and pulse, and passing at times twelve or fourteen hours at that bedside. And when these hours were over, or while they were going on-what a task for the physician !-to soothe with kindest and yet not too hopeful words her whose trial was indeed great to bear, to give counsel against despair, and yet not to justify confidence."

Nay, listen and you will say that I do well, for before I go I would tell you all. Messenger, you are doomed, are you not? Well, it was I who doomed you. That fruit which you ate a while ago was poisoned, and by my hand, for I am a master of such arts. From the {{beginning}} I hated you, as well I might, for had you not worsted me and torn power from my grasp, and placed {{the people and the}} king under the rule of another God? Therefore, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed,</b> I determined to murder you, and I did the deed by means of that woman who not long ago was hung for the killing of her sister, though in truth she was innocent."

60|$|The estrangement {{between her}} ladyship and the King, which dated {{back to the}} time of his desperate {{courtship}} of Miss Stewart, was at last made up; and once again we see her ladyship triumphant, and firmly established in the amorous King's affections. She had cause to be grateful to the Chancellor for this. But her vindictive nature remembered only the earlier injury still unavenged. Here at last was her chance to pay off that score. Clarendon, beset by enemies on every hand, yet trusting in the King whom he had served so well, stood his ground unintimidated and unmoved--an oak that had weathered mightier storms than this. He did not dream {{that he was in the}} power of an evil woman. And that woman used her power. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>else</b> <b>failed,</b> she told the King of Clarendon's part in the flight of Miss Stewart, and lest the King should be disposed to pardon the Chancellor out of consideration for his motives, represented him as a self-seeker, and charged him with having acted thus so as to make sure of keeping his daughter's children by the Duke of York in the succession.|$|R
