5|$|Critics {{commented that}} the book seemed to be aimed at fans of The Simpsons rather than a more general audience. Other criticisms {{included}} {{the simplicity of the}} writing and a lack of interesting stories. In 2004, Cartwright adapted the book into a one-woman show, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> performed in the UK and North America, including at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.|$|E
5|$|Kirsty Howard was {{the final}} runner to carry the Queen's Baton {{at the opening of}} the 2002 Commonwealth Games, when she was chaperoned by England {{football}} captain David Beckham. Born with a rare condition in which her heart is back-to-front, she has been a resident in Didsbury's Francis House Hospice, for <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> raised over £5million.|$|E
60|$|She {{put down}} the slip of paper on <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> marked the sum they had to pay, {{and walked back to}} the table at <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been sitting. Philip flushed with anger.|$|R
60|$|Throughout <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{spoken in}} a low plain voice, that neither rose nor fell; ceasing, she dropped the hand with <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{enforced}} herself to be so passionless and distinct, but not the eyes with <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> so steadily observed him.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned from}} him impatiently and, {{throwing}} herself {{back into the}} chair from <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> risen at his entrance, she began to exchange the thick woolen stockings <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been wearing upon the stage for others of fine silk.|$|R
5|$|The {{main reason}} to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, their lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{released}} two solo albums—Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 23, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 5, 2006.|$|E

5|$|Brian Mansfield {{speculated that}} Carey was {{addressing}} Eminem in the lyrics, {{with whom she}} has had a longstanding feud. Carey has reportedly been romantically linked with several male celebrities {{during the course of}} her career, some of <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> openly spoken about and acknowledged, while others she has denied dating. Eminem has claimed on multiple occasions that he dated Carey, but Carey has always firmly denied that she knew him on a romantic level. In 2001, Carey contacted Eminem to discuss the possibility of writing a song together for inclusion on Carey's ninth studio album Charmbracelet (2002), and they reportedly started dating soon after.|$|E
60|$|Don Ippolito and Florida {{extended}} their hands. Neither spoke, {{and as she}} sank back upon the seat from <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> half risen, <b>she</b> drew more closely {{the folds of the}} veil <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not lifted from her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} faintly. [...] "That is, {{if you will}} approve;" [...] and then she blushed as she remembered the promise <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> so lately volunteered to him and <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> so utterly {{forgotten}} in making her engagement with Mr. Arabin.|$|R
60|$|The sudden {{shock to}} body and mind, the sudden prostration of strength, had {{brought out the}} disease <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> dreaded so intensely, and against <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken so many precautions, and which yet lay, all the while, lurking unfelt in her system.|$|R
5|$|Hisako is second-in-command of Girls Dead Monster {{who plays}} a Fender Jazzmaster {{electric}} guitar as lead guitarist. She has a candid personality and likes to play mahjong, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> incredible luck with. As noted by Hinata, Hisako is also athletic and is greatly admired by Yui for her guitar riffs. In life, she {{was a part of}} a band whose main vocalist ended up committing suicide, but after meeting Iwasawa, she forms Girls Dead Monster with her.|$|E

She is {{well known}} for her voice work on the Fox network's {{animated}} television series The Simpsons, in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> played recurring characters such as Maude Flanders, Helen Lovejoy, Miss Hoover, and Luann Van Houten, as well as several minor characters. This work has earned her both an Emmy Award nomination and an Annie Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of the last ten days must satisfy everyone that if freight trains are stopped on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the city of Baltimore is not only deprived of the great commercial advantages <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> heretofore enjoyed, but the entire community is made to feel that all business must be seriously crippled {{and the price of}} all kinds of family supplies greatly increased.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have known}} him all our lives," [...] said Emily, forgetting {{probably}} {{that out of the}} twenty-three years and some months <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> hitherto lived, there had been a consecutive period of more than twenty years in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never seen this man whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> known all her life.|$|R
6000|$|The frame at <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> worked, was {{put away}} upon a shelf and covered up. The chair in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sat, was {{turned against the}} wall. A history was written in these little things, and in Meg’s grief-worn face. Oh! who could fail to read it! ...|$|R
60|$|Sybil {{unfolded}} {{a journal}} <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> brought; not {{now to be}} read for the first time; but {{now for the first}} time to be read alone, undisturbed, in a scene of softness and serenity. It contained a report of the debate in the House of Commons on the presentation of the National Petition; that important document which had been the means of drawing forth Sybil from her solitude, and of teaching her something of that world of <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> often pondered, and yet <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> so inaccurately preconceived.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and features a tearful and distraught Stefani, lying in bed as she begins to sing to the camera. In a white inside-out L.A.M.B. T-shirt, she wanders around her apartment lost and questioning her lover, who is in fact absent from the video. The lyrics describe an argument, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> with an off-screen lover throughout the video. After lying around her apartment and crying during a bath, she leaves her house at night and travels in a car, as she sits tearfully in the back. The video ends with Stefani rolling on the bed.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{interviews}} Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in {{a retirement}} home. Leland recalls how Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrates {{more and more}} over the years, and he begins an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while he is running for Governor of New York. Both {{his wife and his}} political opponent discover the affair and the public scandal ends his political career. Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating operatic career for <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> neither the talent nor the ambition.|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E
50|$|The show {{started in}} 1999 after the {{retirement}} of veteran broadcaster Gay Byrne. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> moved from her Liveline slot <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> had since the late 1970s.|$|R
60|$|Stung to {{madness and}} despair by the {{crushing}} agonies of a life, Cassy had often resolved in her soul {{an hour of}} retribution, when her hand should avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been witness, or <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> in her own person suffered.|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir John {{produced}} the letter <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> written to Caldigate, and in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> distinctly offered to marry Crinkett {{if the money}} demanded were paid. <b>She</b> must <b>have</b> expected the production of this letter, but still, for a few moments, it silenced her. 'Yes,' she said, at last, 'I wrote it.' ...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited {{as one of the}} most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.|$|E
5|$|Suzy gets {{a job at}} {{a burger}} joint, and moves into an {{abandoned}} boiler, with entry through the attached pipe. Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides {{something has to be done}} ("Thinkin' "). He is unable to come up with an answer, and eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E
5|$|Viv wakes to find Bond gone, {{leaving a}} note in which he {{promises}} to send her police assistance and which he concludes by telling her not to dwell {{too much on the}} ugly events through <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer in charge of the detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that all men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on—including Bond himself—are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off {{at the end of the}} book, continuing her tour of America, but despite the officer's warning still devoted to the memory of the spy who loved her.|$|E
60|$|But {{our present}} story {{will have more}} to do with his {{daughter}} than with him. A pretty girl, I have said, was Patience Woolsworthy; and one, too, in many ways remarkable. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> taken her outlook into life, weighing the things <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> and those <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not, in a manner very unusual, and, as a rule, not always desirable for a young lady. The things <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not were very many. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> not society; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not a fortune; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not any assurance of future means of livelihood; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not high hope of procuring for herself a position in life by marriage; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not that excitement and pleasure in life <b>which</b> <b>she</b> read of in such books as found their way down to Oxney Colne Parsonage. It would be easy to add to the list of the things <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not; and this list against herself she made out with the utmost vigour. The things <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> or those rather <b>which</b> <b>she</b> assured herself of having, were much more easily counted. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> the birth and education of a lady, the strength of a healthy woman, and a will of her own. Such was the list as she made it out for herself, and I protest that I assert no more than the truth in saying that she never added to it either beauty, wit, or talent.|$|R
50|$|Carlisle {{confirmed}} {{in a radio}} interview in August 2015 that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> completed work on a new album, tentatively earmarked for release in January 2016. She commented that the music on the album will be partly inspired by Kundalini yoga, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken up while pregnant in 1991/1992 and of <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> qualified as a teacher since becoming sober in 2005.|$|R
60|$|She {{thanked him}} incoherently, {{as if for}} a favor. And {{it was not until}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{returned}} home to North Oakland and conferred with her own kind, and had the Portuguese grocer investigate, that she really knew that she was the owner of the little house in <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> lived and for <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> paid rent so long.|$|R
5|$|Wahdati's neighbors, meanwhile, {{move to the}} United States {{with their}} {{children}} after the Soviet invasion. Cousins Idris and Timur return to Afghanistan over two decades later in 2003 to reclaim their family's property. While there, Timur makes a great show of publicly distributing money to street beggars while Idris privately bonds with Roshi, an Afghan girl who suffers from a horrific injury and whose family was murdered by her uncle. Idris at first promises to arrange for Roshi to undergo the operations needed for her recovery but distances himself from her and Afghanistan on returning to the States. Several years later, Idris comes across Roshi signing copies of her bestselling memoir, <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> dedicated to her adoptive mother and Timur, who paid for her surgery.|$|E

60|$|Jeanie {{might have}} enjoyed {{the sights and}} {{novelties}} of this great city more, {{had it not been}} for the qualification added to her sister's pardon, which greatly grieved her affectionate disposition. On this subject, however, her mind was somewhat relieved by a letter <b>which</b> <b>she</b> received in return of post, in answer to that <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> written to her father. With his affectionate blessing, it brought his full approbation of the step <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken, as one inspired by the immediate dictates of Heaven, and <b>which</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been thrust upon in order that she might become the means of safety to a perishing household.|$|R
