40|$|Automating {{the process}} of {{automotive}} <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> assembly has been a challenge to production engineers for years. In fact, a recent publication concluded that this process is too difficult to automate. At the IPA a robot tool for flexible automation of the <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> assembly process has been developed. In close cooperation with Opel AG, <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> supplier Mesnel S.

The assembly system consists of a pick-up station supplying the <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> seals, a sophisticated insertion tool, and an industrial robot (Fanuc S- 420 F). The basic function of the robot tool is very similar to the manual operation. The tool combines gripping, guiding and hammering functions. It uses open guides with pneumatic fingers to pickup and guide the seal, and a pneumatic hammer to drive the seal onto the flange. Based on a thorough analysis of significant process parameters, the cycle time of the seal assembly could be halved compared with manual operation.

50|$|Restoration of a vehicle’s {{exterior}} {{can take many}} forms. A vehicle that has been left or abandoned will often accumulate rust over time. Sometimes this rust deterioration can render an exterior part unusable. In which case a replacement part like a fender, front grill or door mirror much be purchased outright from an external source. If rust damage is minor however the part will undergo rust repair. This {{is the process of}} removing rust from metal and returning structural integrity. This is accomplished by removing the rust through sanding or blasting to get down to bare metal. Then new sheet metal or fiberglass is applied to the affected area. Finally the piece is worked until smooth, primed and re-painted. Other materials like glass and <b>weather</b> <b>stripping</b> must be replaced as they become damaged over time. Factors like weather erosion can lead to faded and broken glass as well as dried out <b>weather</b> <b>stripping.</b> Another typical area of exterior repair is dent removal. This entails taking the original metal and re-working it to remove dents and other such blemishes. Professionals often use hammer and dolly work to remove dents. This involves placing the dented metal piece over a curved metal dolly and using an electric or manual hammer to remove the dent and smooth the metal.|$|E
5000|$|Neoprene resists {{degradation}} {{more than}} natural or synthetic rubber.

5000|$|Yet {{another option}} for {{reducing}} the carbon footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home. By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home, and installing <b>weather</b> <b>stripping</b> or caulking around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than 25 percent. Similarly, one can very inexpensively upgrade the [...] "insulation" [...] (clothing) worn by residents of the home. For example, it's estimated that wearing a base layer of long underwear (top and bottom) made from a lightweight, super insulating fabric like microfleece (aka Polartec®, Capilene®) can conserve as much body heat as {{a full set of}} clothing, allowing a person to remain warm with the thermostat lowered by over 5 °C. These measures all help because they reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool the house. One can also turn down the heat while sleeping at night or away during the day, and keep temperatures moderate at all times. Setting the thermostat just 2 degrees lower in winter and higher in summer could save about 1 ton of carbon dioxide each year.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of adaptive facades presents a barrier {{as there is}} no established assessment technique. Many of the available facade performance evaluation systems or frameworks have limited applicability for such advanced building facades. The complexity of adaptive or dynamic facades’ evaluation is related to the performance evaluation of facade elements, systems, and overall building performance coupled with occupant behavior and occupant satisfaction. In this context, this paper presents a case study of an adaptive sunscreen facade and evaluation of its performance and occupant behavior.

40|$|Twenty {{per cent}} of all energy {{consumed}} in New England and ten per cent of all energy {{consumed in the}} United States is consumed in home heating. This paper reports on an effort to ascertain the major factors affecting the consumption of home heating oil. Three general classes of factors are analyzed: (1) physical and occupant characteristics (number of rooms, number of occupants, number of stories, amount of insulation, income level, etc.); (2) external (price, shortage awareness, weather); and (3) behavioral and physical changes (change in temperature settings, change in insulation, change in oil burner, etc.). The study is based on four data series: (1) actual monthly home heating oil consumption data on 8000 suburban homeowners in suburban Boston; (2) questionnaire responses from 2000 homeowners on their homes' physical and occupant characteristics, as well as changes in physical and occu- pant behavioral characteristics between 1972 and 1975; (3) monthly weather data; and (4) heating oil price data. The data {{is associated with the}} years from 1972 through 1975, a period in which marked price changes, shortages, and behavioral changes occurred, hence providing an opportunity to study the effects of these various events. Three models are central to the study: Model I. A cross-sectional model that depicts consumption per degree-day as a function of physical and occupant characteristics of a home. Model II. A time series regression model that establishes consumption per degree-day as a function of price and consumer awareness of an energy shortage. Model III. A cross-sectional regression model that attempts to explain change in consumption per degree-day from one year to the next as a function of specific conservation actions such as temperature resetting, addition of storm windows, etc. The major findings of each model are as follows: Model I: House size, age of home, family income, and the presence of storm doors and windows are all significant factors in predicting the amount of home oil consumption. Model II: Estimated values of price elasticity with respect to demand for residential heating oil and a measure of 'mnpact of shortage awareness on consumption are determined. This model also demonstrates that there were substantial savings in consumption corresponding to increases in price and shortage awareness from 1972 - 1975. Model III: he data from the questionnaire indicate that only a few consumers made physical home improvements; however, the data from the oil company indicate that a substantial savings (over 12 %) in consumption occurred between the heating seasons 1972 / 73 and 1973 / 74. The conclusion from this data indicates that behavioral changes were the major conservation actions taken. Model III indicates that the behavioral change of temperature resetting is significant and the physical change of additional <b>weather</b> <b>stripping</b> and change of burner are significant. Further study is needed, however, to determine those behavioral changes that accounted for the major change in consumption. In addition, this model indicates that different groups within the sample (e. g., by income level, house characteristics) display similar conservation efficiency. In addition to the findings of the models, the paper includes (in Appendix B) a detailed discussion of biases associated with the data. Major conclusions from that discussion are: (1) our sample is representative of suburban homes in the Northern United States; (2) the consumers who responded to the questionnaire were slightly more energy- conscious and responded slightly more dramatically to price increases than the general populace; (3) our residential heating oil prices are representative of those that prevailed in the region; and (4) the heating seasons 1972 through 1975 were warmer than usual. Trends in the data indicate that new homes in the sample have a considerable amount of insulation and the typical single-family house in the sample has storm windows and doors.

40|$|Yellowstone National Park has a {{difficult}} challenge ahead {{in dealing with}} rising energy costs and concerns of carbon emissions. To deal with this challenge, Yellowstone has tasked itself with reducing its energy consumption by 15 %, fossil fuel consumption by 18 %, and greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % below 2003 levels. The University of Michigan team spent 18 months conducting a facility energy audit on 25 buildings within the park {{with the goal of}} adding the park’s green team to achieve these goals. The goals also included providing building specific energy improvement recommendations that could be applied to similar buildings, and exploring policies hindering the development of renewable energy resources in the park. To achieve these goals, data was collect about each building from several different sources. Two years of historical energy use data was gathered in the form of electricity bills and fuel invoices. Use and maintenance information was collected through interviews with key building and maintenance personnel. Each building was audited for building envelope characteristics, HVAC systems, lighting layout and design, and other industrial electronics. This was done by surveying the buildings in person and looking at building blueprints when available. The building surveys included an infrared camera audit which allowed the team to “see” issues areas in the building envelope and systems. Recommendations were developed by looking for improvements in equipment, building envelope, maintenance practices, building use and behavior, and lighting. While each building was analyzed, several common park wide recommendations became apparent. These included lighting upgrades, <b>weather</b> <b>stripping</b> and caulking, maintenance, vending machine management, smart power strips, monitoring and benchmarking, and behavioral changes. Lighting upgrade recommendations take advantage of recent reductions in LED, CFL, and T 5 light prices. Upgrading to these lighting types reduces energy consumption and overall demand, while maintaining lighting intensity and quality. These upgrades may not be cost effective to perform in the near term, {{but it is important to}} consider these lighting technologies in any future renovations or new construction. Other lighting upgrades include installing occupancy sensors in common areas and installing photo sensors near windows to reduce artificial lighting when there is ample sunlight. Maintaining weather-stripping and caulking is important to minimize the building leaks. The pictures taken with the infrared camera revealed that this maintenance was lacking in many of the buildings. Improving the maintenance schedule will greatly reduce the energy consumed by a building’s HVAC system. Many of the vending machines in the park are old and run continuously. New vending machines have sensors that reduce the energy consumed when there are few or no people using the machine. Old vending machines can be upgraded with off-the-shelf-components to reduce their energy use. Similarly to the vending machine upgrades, smart power strips reduce the amount of energy consumed by “vampire” loads, or loads caused by electronics that are plugged in, but not turned on. These strips work by shutting down the outlets on the strip when specified equipment is turned off, like a workstation computer. Current park practices of tracking electricity bills and fuel invoices do not accurately and sufficiently monitor how and where energy is being used. Current practices also do not allow for establishing a good baseline or benchmarking against other buildings of similar type. Using a program like Energy Star Portfolio Manager allows for quality benchmarking, as well as increasing ii | P a g e the viability of energy use. Improving the systems that use energy in a building is only partially the solution. Changes in how the occupants use the building is just as important. To address this, the team recommends variety of techniques to better education the park staff on energy management programs and on how to include the park staff in future energy management improvements. In addition to the park wide upgrades, it is recommended that the Gardiner Heritage Center establish a more extensive program to maintain the seals on the cold storage equipment in the building. Infrared pictures of the equipment indicated that some units where leaking more cold air than others. Similarly, upright freezers should be considered for upgrades to Energy Star rated chest freezers. This may not be cost effective for newer upright units, but should be considered for any future freezer purchases. The lower Mammoth residences are currently being upgraded, but extra care should be taken to verify that wall insulation is present. It was observed in an infrared picture that a small strip of insulation was likely to be missing in # 562. Appliances upgrades are also recommended for all residences. The Mammoth Community Center is a prime example of how building uses change over time and how this creates a building which uses an excess of energy. Many electronic devices were found throughout the building and a thorough audit should be done to remove all unused and unnecessary electronics. Boiler pipes should be insulated as it was found with the infrared camera that much of the heat was emitted into the boiler room itself. From an overall building use perspective, the Community Center has much of its space unused, yet those spaces are still being heated. Considerations should be made on either modifying the builds systems to allow for these spaces to be shut down completely, or renovating the building to better suit its current uses. The Mammoth Fleet Operations Garage is a large consumer of energy in comparison to the other buildings audited. This allows for a large impact when energy efficiency measures are implemented. Although, the nature of the work being performed in the garage bays makes major changes to the energy systems difficult. Current heating units in the work bays are hung from the rafters and attempt to heat the entire space. Upgrading these to allow for heating of the works would allow for a large reduction in energy consumption. Similarly to the Community Center, the boiler pipes supplying hot water to the building should be insulated. The YCC facilities, both dorms and the mess hall, are buildings where use varies seasonally. Upgrading heating systems to radiant propane heating, replacing the electric baseboard heaters along with insulating hot water pipes, and reducing hot water heaters set points are all simple steps to reduce the energy consumption of these buildings. Other advanced upgrades to these buildings include occupancy and motion sensors on all common area lighting, and heat recovery from walk-in freezers and refrigerators. While most of the buildings audited are older, the Old Faithful Visitor Center is a new, LEED Gold certified building, but there are still energy improvements that can be made. These improvements are centered on developing a better understanding of how the energy management systems in the building can be deployed. The Canyon Visitor Education Center, while being recently renovated, has several opportunities to reduce its energy use. The lighting systems used on the education displays do not iii | P a g e utilize many new bulb technologies, the lighting in the building is not considering the natural light in the building, and older HVAC and AHU components could be supplemented with variable frequency drives to improve their energy performance. Being off the grid, the Lamar Buffalo Ranch already had many energy efficiency measures in place. However Lamar does not have an accurate understanding of how much energy it consumes and when it is using this energy. Currently, the amount of energy produced by the solar array must be back calculated based on generator run time and propane use is calculated from propane delivery invoices. These techniques only allow for the accuracy of energy use to be on a yearly time scale. Additional metering would allow for a large increase in accuracy, as well as better inform decisions about expanding renewable energy production and upgrades to the generator systems. The park has a wide variety of water treatment facilities which all make use of large batteries of pumps performing various tasks. Pumps which are regularly throttled by valves, cycled on and off to control flow and output, or which are run intermittently for maintenance reasons could use less energy by installing variable frequency drive control. There are electronic units which control the electricity inputs to a pump and control the flow and output of the pump. When a pump does not have this control, while on, it uses the maximum amount of energy it is rated for. Variable frequency drives reduce the energy demands when pump demands are also reduced. This project also considered how the park can institutionalize sustainable practices in order to improve its existing environmental management strategies. The park’s sustainability efforts are currently led by the park’s Green Team, which is a small interdisciplinary group based in the Mammoth administrative area. Although this group has done many things to improve sustainability in the park, there is still room for improvement. This group should include a wider coalition of park employees in order to make sustainability a park-wide priority and more achievable goal. The Green Team should consider working more closely with the departments in the park, and outside of the park, that plan, design, and maintain the built environment at the park. This includes the planning department, the Denver Service Center, interpretation and exhibit design, as well as maintenance and operations. Developing a broad interdepartmental strategy to improve sustainability at multiple scales will eliminate many of the problems between building design and function that the team noticed at the park. While the primary purpose of this project was to reduce energy demand within the park, the team also developed a guide to help the park consider renewable energy options in order to increase the park’s supply of electricity. Developing renewable energy in the park is a measure to both significantly mitigate and adapt to climate change. There are many limitations on developing renewable energy within the park, such as historic preservation areas and concerns about viewsheds. However, there are also many areas within the park that are zoned as administrative areas that the park should prioritize for these types of projects. Technology such as solar photovoltaics, solar hot water, small wind turbines, and hybrid systems would be appropriate for most administrative areas within the park. However, before moving forward with a renewable energy strategy, the park should either negotiate a better rate for net generation from the electric company or develop energy storage capabilities. While the National Park Service has prioritized off-grid areas for renewable energy development, because it is usually much cheaper than a grid connection, this is not the best strategy to reduce the park’s carbon footprint. Because the local grid is very carbon intensive, in order to more meaningfully address climate change mitigation the park should prioritize renewable energy development in on-grid areas...|$|E

A so-called alternating tangent approach based on the bisection method is finally proposed to estimate the optimal magnetron power and curing time...|$|R

50|$|Twelve Mile Drome {{was renamed}} Berry Drome after Major Jack W. Berry, the {{commander}} of the 39th Fighter Squadron, who was killed on a practice bombing mission on 4 August when his bomb exploded directly underneath his aircraft, causing it to flip and crash into the sea. It was located on higher ground south east of Schwimmer. Casey and George assigned it a high priority, and the 96th Engineer General Service Regiment was assigned to the task. The existing dry <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> was cleared and grubbed for a 4500 by 100 ft runway. The short runway restricted air operations to fighters and transports, but it could not be extended without extensive earth removal. It was ultimately surfaced with 8 in of crushed rock and gravel.|$|R

25|$|A French door {{consists}} of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a French window, as it resembles a door-height casement window. When a pair of French doors {{is used as a}} French window, the application does not generally include a central mullion (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An espagnolette bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.|$|R
30|$|The {{absorber}} of {{the proposed}} single tilted solar basin is manufactured from steel sheet of 1.25  mm thickness, 100  cm length, and 50  cm width. The depth of the solar still is 10  cm. The absorber was painted with matt-finish black to enhance its absorptivity of sun radiation and was placed towards the south and tilted 20 ° to the horizontal, which provided an almost uniform thickness of {{a thin layer of}} water flow. Also, the tilted angle 20 ° towards the south is optimum for solar radiation as reported by Reindel et al. (1990) and Perez et al. (1990), respectively. The cover was clear glass of 6  mm thickness. The casing to the absorber was made of 1  mm thick galvanized iron and of slightly larger size, thus allowing fiber-glass insulation to be placed at the sides (25  mm thick) and backside of the absorber (50  mm thick). The glass cover was sealed to the casing using a <b>weather</b> <b>strip</b> and silicone rubber all around.|$|R

60|$|Autumn in Virginia, {{especially}} {{if one is}} not too near the mountains, is a season in which greenness sails very close to Christmas, although generally veering away in time to prevent its verdant hues from tingeing that happy day with the gloomy influence of the prophetic proverb about churchyards. Long after {{the time when the}} people of the regions watered by the Hudson and the Merrimac are beginning to button up their overcoats, and to think of <b>weather</b> <b>strips</b> for their window-sashes, the dwellers in the land through which flow the Appomattox and the James may sit upon their broad piazzas, and watch the growing glories of the forests, where the crimson stars of the sweet gum blaze among the rich yellows of the chestnuts, the lingering green of the oaks, and the enduring verdure of the pines. The insects still hum in the sunny air, and the sun is now a genial orb whose warm rays cheer but not excoriate.|$|R
