500|$|The title {{sequence}} of SpongeBob {{for the special}} was made exclusively for the series' tenth anniversary. It was animated in stop motion animation, with Cee Lo Green performing the theme. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan of Screen Novelties animated its opening titles. Finnegan claimed that the crew were [...] "thrill" [...] to do the title sequence because [...] "the original title sequence is so recognizable and everyone seen {{it over and over}} and it's so great in its own way." [...] Executive producer and the episode's writer Paul Tibbitt said [...] "We don't just want to redraw it , {{we want it to be}} something special and different So <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do it in three dimensions" [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson lauded the new title sequence and said it is [...] "SO great!" [...] Some traditional animation on scraps of brown paper are intermixed into the stop motion.|$|E

2500|$|Hell's Kitchen {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Superjesus {{on the eve of}} the Big Day Out in Adelaide on Australia Day long-weekend, January 1996. Tennent {{provided}} the new name. Berryman explained, [...] "It was basically just a piss-take on commonly used words in the '90s. Like The Jesus and Mary Chain, [...] "Jesus Built My Hotrod", the Jesus Lizard, Jesus Jones; there's just heaps of Jesus' out there in the music world so <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have that and super was kind of like a '90s catch word." [...] Their debut five-track extended play, Eight Step Rail, was released in August 1996 on Aloha Records. It spent a couple of months on top of the Australian Independent charts.|$|E

2500|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier than <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do a film. [...] It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. [...] And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman {{does not have a}} main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. [...] I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [...] and Olivia in Peep Show, to have taken that same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really weird thing for the audience. [...] I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|E

5000|$|Island universes On {{the version}} of his theory that Lewis {{strongly}} favours, each world is distinct from every other world by being spatially and temporally isolated from it. Some have objected that {{a world in which}} spatio-temporally isolated universes ("island universes") coexist is therefore not possible, by Lewis's theory (see for example Bigelow, John, and Pargetter, Robert, [...] "Beyond the blank stare", Theoria, 1987, Vol. 53, pp. 97-114). Lewis's awareness of this difficulty discomforted him; but he could have replied that other means of distinguishing worlds may be available, or alternatively that sometimes there will inevitably be further surprising and counterintuitive consequences — beyond what <b>we</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be committed to at the start of our investigation. But this fact in itself is hardly surprising.|$|R
40|$|How we answer life's biggest {{questions}} {{is one of}} the largest factors in how we conduct ourselves. Our set of core values shape the people that we are and our place in society. But when those values are challenged, and a paradigm shift of immense proportions occurs within us, we may find ourselves making choices <b>we</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> make. One of these questions would be, "If there is no divine justice, why be good?" I explore this idea in novel form, using my characters as varying arguments on the question and examining the repercussions of such a discussion in a real-world setting. This full-length novel also serves as my own addition to the everlasting conversation on the nature of good, evil, justice, and why we make the choices that we make.

5000|$|The first {{release of}} the VRML, a {{standard}} for defining virtual reality environments, was {{less than six months}} old when Worlds Chat was released. This meant that Worlds Inc. needed to discover and define its own best practices while creating Worlds Chat. The additional speed of dial-up Internet connections naturally placed limitations on the amount of information that could be transmitted to and from the Worlds Inc. servers. An increasing number of users and expanding virtual world increased these pressures. Tamiko Thiel, a creative director and producer and Worlds Inc. from 1994 to 1996, wrote an article entitled [...] "Cyber-Animism and Augmented Dreams" [...] describing the history of virtual worlds, in which she wrote::"In the virtual worlds and avatar communities in the mid 1990's <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> all <b>would</b> start parallel, virtual, online existences in which we could create ourselves anew and realize our personal dreamworlds. The technology however was too awkward, the processors and the Internet connections too slow, and the user base for our worlds never extended beyond a small dedicated community. By 2002 the virtual communities of the first generation all went bankrupt or looked for other ways to earn money." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Paris Commune {{inspired}} other uprisings named or called Communes: in Moscow (December 1905); Budapest (March-July 1919); Canton (December 1927), most famously, Petrograd (1917), and Shanghai (1927 and 1967). The Commune {{was regarded}} with admiration and awe by later Communist and leftist leaders. Vladimir Lenin wrote: [...] "We are only dwarves {{perched on the}} shoulders of those giants." [...] He celebrated by dancing in the snow in Moscow on the day that his Bolshevik government was more than two months old, surpassing the Commune. The ministers and officials of the Bolshevik government were given the title Commissar, which was borrowed directly from the Commissaires of the Commune. Lenin's Mausoleum in Moscow was (and still is) decorated with red banners from the Commune, brought to Moscow for his funeral by French communists. Stalin wrote: [...] "In 1917 <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> form a commune, an association of workers, and that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> put an end to bureaucracy...That is a goal that we are still far from reaching."

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we will explore {{how to use}} the Cadence Conformal LEC tool {{capabilities}} to verify different types of designs, based on the experiences of various projects at Intel. In particular, we will focus on the Conformal Ultra capability for verifying complex data-path synthesis and layout [...] As an example, we will present a 1 Gigabit Ethernet chip with around 10 million standard cells. At first glance <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> need to use the divide and conquer technique, and split the big design into smaller blocks in order to complete the verification. To our surprise, using the Conformal Ultra together with the effort &quot;complete &quot; we managed to verify the majority of the design in one flat run. In this presentation we will also discuss {{how to use the}} different Cadence Conformal LEC capabilities and what benefits they provide, describing numerous best-known-methods developed at Intel. The following learnings are based on using the tool on different types of designs. This kind of information can provide a significant saving of time and increase in user productivity.

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} through Columbia Pictures and Imagine Entertainment by daughter and father Bryce Dallas Howard and Ron Howard, {{as well as}} Brian Grazer. In August 2009, Gus Van Sant signed on to direct Restless. Based on a play by Jason Lew, the story centers on young love and mortality. Lew and Bryce Dallas Howard were fellow drama students at New York University; she encouraged him to take his project further and agreed to be a producer on the script. Her father Ron wanted to direct, but his schedule did not allow for it; [...] "It was honestly like, 'If {{we could get a}} Gus Van Sant-type director...' That's what we were saying. <b>We</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> actually get him to direct it," [...] Bryce Dallas Howard said in an interview for the film's soundtrack release. [...] "But he said yes immediately, and five weeks later we were shooting." [...] Casting was done in Los Angeles with the intention of casting unknowns for the leads. In October 2009, Mia Wasikowska joined the project as the female lead. Wasikowska cut her hair for the film. The following November, Henry Hopper was cast as the male lead. Danny Elfman composed the score.|$|R
