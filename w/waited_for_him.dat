5|$|Kenya {{competed in}} the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. The country's {{participation}} at the Games marked its Winter Olympics debut, although it had {{competed in the}} Summer Olympics since 1956. The delegation consisted of a single cross-country skier, Philip Boit. He had been trained {{as part of a}} scheme created by American sportswear company Nike, Inc. Although Boit did not win a medal, his efforts received worldwide attention after gold medallist Bjorn Daehlie of Norway <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at the finish line as Boit completed the race in difficult conditions in last place.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt still owned a {{house in}} Tombstone with his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, but she <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in Colton, where his parents and Virgil were living. During the summer of 1882, she sent Wyatt a letter saying she wanted a divorce. She had met a gambler from Arizona and he {{had asked her to}} marry him. Wyatt, who did not believe in divorce, refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, and he later {{abandoned}} her in Arizona.|$|E
25|$|Police {{believed}} that two assailants murdered Jim Richards. Police said his murderers <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{and shot him}} several times in his driveway after he returned home in his camper van from a workout at an all night gym around 4:15a.m.|$|E

25|$|The 2000 Tour de France brought Ullrich, Marco Pantani and Armstrong {{against each}} other for the first time. Armstrong proved too strong and won then and again in 2001. Ullrich crashed in 2001 and Armstrong <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to return to his bike. Ullrich cited his failure to defeat Armstrong as why he fell into {{depression}} next year.|$|E
25|$|The pattern {{returned}} in 2003, Armstrong taking {{first place and}} Ullrich second. Only {{a minute and a}} second separated the two {{at the end of the}} final day in Paris. U.S. Postal won the team time trial on stage four, while Armstrong took stage 15, despite having been knocked off on the ascent to Luz Ardiden, the final climb, when a spectator's bag caught his right handlebar. Ullrich <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> which brought Ullrich fair-play honors.|$|E
25|$|When Toole {{was unable}} to resume his {{position}} at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor. This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument. He stopped by the house {{the next day to}} pick up some things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account. After a week she called the police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels knew where he was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.|$|E

Upon {{reaching}} home, he found Hee-dong and Hong-guan <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to join the feast. Hee-dong poured the wine. As they knocked their first glass to drink their first toast, Hongguan drank for the friendship bond between the themselves.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} stage, the favourites {{remained}} calm. This first stage was won by Charles Crupelandt. Defraye finished 14th, while Garrigou finished in 21st place. In the second stage, Defraye and Garrigou were {{ahead of the}} rest, and Defraye won the stage. At that point, Defraye was second in the general classification, only one point behind Vincenzo Borgarello, the first Italian leader of the general classification ever. When Garrigou punctured because of nails spread by vandals, Defraye <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> During the long chase for the rest, {{it was clear that}} Defraye was stronger than Garrigou, who encouraged Defraye to continue alone. Defraye became a favourite for the overall victory, and his team mates gave him their support. He was the first Belgian who had a serious chance to win the Tour de France, so all Belgians in the race, regardless of their team, were helping him.|$|E
25|$|Krishna {{had a large}} force {{called the}} Narayani Sena and was himself a great warrior. Duryodhana and Arjuna thus both went to Krishna at Dwarka to ask for his help. Duryodhana arrived first and found Krishna asleep. Being arrogant and viewing himself as equal to Krishna, Duryodhana chose a seat at Krishna's head and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to rouse. Arjuna arrived later and being a humble devotee of Krishna, chose to sit and wait at Krishna's feet. When Krishna woke up, he saw Arjuna first {{and gave him the}} first right to make his request. Krishna told Arjuna and Duryodhana that he would give the Narayani Sena to one side and himself as a {{non-combatant}} to the other. Since Arjuna was given the first opportunity to choose, Duryodhana was worried that Arjuna would choose the mighty army of Krishna. When given the choice of either Krishna's army or Krishna himself on their side, Arjuna on behalf of the Pandavas chose Krishna, unarmed on his own, relieving Duryodhana, who thought Arjuna to be the greatest fool. Later Arjuna requested Krishna to be his charioteer and Krishna, being an intimate friend of Arjuna, agreed wholeheartedly and hence received the name Parthasarthy, or 'charioteer of the son of Pritha'. Both Duryodhana and Arjuna returned satisfied.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{commitment}} to overseeing {{the release of}} the Concert for Bangladesh documentary film prevented him from being able to start on the follow-up to his All Things Must Pass triple album until midway through 1972. Another delay was caused by producer Phil Spector's unreliability, as Harrison <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to turn up {{for the start of the}} sessions. Author Bruce Spizer writes that [...] "the eccentric producer's erratic attendance caused George to realize the project would never get done if he kept waiting for Spector", and by October that year, Harrison had decided to produce the album alone.|$|E

500|$|Khrushchev {{arrived at}} the VIP hall of Vnukovo Airport; KGB Chairman Semichastny <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> there, flanked by KGB {{security}} guards. Semichastny informed Khrushchev of his ouster and {{told him not to}} resist. Khrushchev did not resist, and the plotters' coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend and ally until that very moment, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party. Khrushchev was then taken to the Kremlin, to be verbally attacked by Brezhnev, Suslov and Shelepin. He had no stomach for a fight, and put up little resistance. Semichastny was careful not to create the appearance of a coup; ...|$|E
500|$|García Márquez met Mercedes Barcha {{while she}} was at school; they decided to {{wait for her to}} finish before getting married. [...] When he was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent, Mercedes <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to return to Barranquilla. Finally they married in 1958. The {{following}} year, their first son, Rodrigo García, now a television and film director, was born. In 1961, the family traveled by Greyhound bus throughout the southern United States and eventually settled in Mexico City. García Márquez had always wanted to see the Southern United States because it inspired the writings of William Faulkner. Three years later the couple's second son, Gonzalo, was born in Mexico. Gonzalo is currently a graphic designer in Mexico City.|$|E
500|$|The name Gaius occurs {{three other}} {{times in the}} New Testament. First, a Christian Gaius is {{mentioned}} in Macedonia as a traveling companion of Paul, along with Aristarchus (Acts 19:29). One chapter later, a Gaius from Derbe is named as one of Paul's seven traveling companions who <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at Troas (Acts 20:4). Next, a Gaius is mentioned residing in Corinth as being {{one of only a}} few people there (the others being Crispus and the household of Stephanas) who were baptised by Paul, who founded the Church in that city (1 Corinthians 1:14). Lastly, a Gaius is referred to in a final greeting portion of the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:23) as Paul's [...] "host" [...] and also host of the whole church, in whatever city Paul is writing from at the time (probably Corinth). [...] However, {{there is no reason to}} suppose that any of these men were the Gaius of 3 John.|$|E

500|$|On 24 June, Pirlo {{produced}} a Man of the Match {{performance in the}} quarter-finals against England, as Italy won 4–2 on penalties after the game had finished 0–0 in extra time. Pirlo scored in the shoot-out with an audacious chipped penalty down {{the centre of the}} goal, also known as a Panenka. Following the match Pirlo spoke of his eloquent penalty, stating, [...] "At the moment I saw the goalkeeper making strange movements, so I <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to move and hit it like that... It was easier for me to chip it at that stage. Maybe my effort put some pressure on England." [...] Pirlo completed more passes than the entire England midfield, as he managed 131 passes, the most of any player during the match, and the second most in a single match {{in the history of the}} European Championship, behind Xavi, with an 87% pass completion rate, as Italy finished the match with 63% ball possession. He also ran 11.58 kilometres throughout the match, covering more distance than any England player.|$|E
500|$|Arnold Schwarzenegger {{was quickly}} cast. He became {{available}} in February 1996 after Fox's remake of Planet of the Apes {{was held up}} again; Columbus also exited that project to work on Jingle All the Way. The film marks Schwarzenegger's fourth appearance as the lead in a comedy film, following Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). Schwarzenegger was paid a reported $20 million for the role. He enjoyed the film, having experienced last-minute Christmas shopping himself, and was attracted to playing an [...] "ordinary" [...] character in a family film. Columbus initially wanted Joe Pesci to play Myron. Comedian Sinbad was chosen instead, partly due to his similar height and size to Schwarzenegger. Sinbad was suggested for the part by Schwarzenegger's agent, but the producers felt he was unsuited {{to the role of}} a villain as it could harm his clean, family-oriented comedy act and reputation, although Sinbad felt the character would generate the audience's sympathy rather than hate. Furthermore, he missed the audition due to his appearance with First Lady Hillary Clinton and musician Sheryl Crow on the USO tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but Columbus <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to return to allow him to audition and, although Sinbad felt he had [...] "messed" [...] it up, he was given the part. He improvised the majority of his lines in the film; Schwarzenegger also improvised many of his responses in his conversations with Sinbad's character.|$|E
2500|$|The name, Maghdouché, {{originates}} {{from the}} Syriac word, which means [...] "crop collectors." [...] It is also {{derived from the}} Syriac word Kidsh and its derivatives (Kadisho, Kadishat, Makdosho). In Hebrew, it means [...] "holy" [...] or [...] "saintly." [...] According to Christian belief, when Jesus came to Sidon, the Virgin Mary who accompanied him, <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{at the top of}} the hill where Maghdouché is located today. [...] She spent the night in a cave that came to be known as Mantara, or the [...] "Awaiting." [...] Emperor Constantine the Great responded to St. Hélène's request and transformed the cave into a sanctuary for the Virgin.|$|E

2500|$|Ražnatović was not there, so {{his mother}} {{called him and}} said that two unknown males <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He showed up with a {{revolver}} and proceeded to shoot and wound both policemen – he shot the first one on the spot and the other while trying to flee the scene. Arkan was detained immediately, however, barely 48 hours later he was released. The occurrence {{made it clear to}} all observers that he enjoyed protection from the political elite. He spent the mid-1980s running a disco club, [...] "Amadeus", together with Žika Živac and Tapi Malešević. Located in the Tašmajdan neighbourhood, the club was reportedly another perk of their contractual work for the security service.|$|E
2500|$|Jack [...] "the Dandy" [...] Parisi {{was acquitted}} of two murders, Teamsters {{official}} Morris Diamond in Brooklyn and music-publishing executive Irving Penn in the Bronx. Penn was killed by mistaken identity, as the intended target, Philip Orlofsky, a Cutters Union official, left his home early to get a shave the day his killers <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Parisi was a fugitive for 10 years, until he was captured in Pennsylvania in 1949. Albert Tannenbaum was brought in from Atlanta, where he was reportedly living, to testify for the prosecution. One accomplice in the Penn murder, Jacob [...] "Kuppy" [...] Migden, who provided the erroneous identification of Penn and {{who was also a}} fugitive for several years, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree assault {{in the middle of his}} murder trial and was sentenced to a term of 5–10 years. Each of Parisi's murder trials ended with an acquittal, as the judges directed a verdict of not-guilty due to the lack of corroborating evidence, since the chief witnesses for the prosecution were accomplices. He died at home of natural causes on December 27, 1982, at the age of 85.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley and Brent {{separated}} from the group and walked to García's, a popular restaurant-store close to the border. Kilroy stopped at the steps of a house on Álvaro Obregón {{to say good-bye to}} the girl from Miss Tanline. He then waited for Bill to walk towards him. Bill then ran to a nearby alley to urinate while Kilroy <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> By the time Bill came out and caught up to the other two near García's, Kilroy had vanished. [...] "Hey, Mark, stop fucking around", Bill said, but Kilroy was nowhere to be found. His friends searched for him for hours, even after the establishments had closed and the streets had cleared at around 4:30a.m. CT. They then crossed the border thinking Kilroy may have crossed to Brownsville and was perhaps waiting near their parked car. His friends did not find him near their car and waited a few minutes in Brownsville before heading to South Padre Island. They thought that Kilroy probably left to the hotel with someone else. They woke up the next day at the hotel and Kilroy's whereabouts were still unknown. His friends then contacted the police to report him missing.|$|E
