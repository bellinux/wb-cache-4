25|$|The {{thematic}} {{exploration of}} free will vs. determinism is made clear from the start. In the film's brief prologue, an unseen narrator asks a series of rhetorical questions that prime the audience to view the film through a metaphysical lens touching on traditional philosophical questions involving determinism vs. philosophic libertarianism, as well as epistemology. The theme is reinforced through the repeated appearance of a blind woman who briefly interacts with Manni in each alternative reality, and seems to have supernatural understandings of both the present and potential futures in those realities. The film ultimately seems to favor a compatiblist philosophical view to the free <b>will</b> <b>question</b> {{as evidenced by the}} casino scene and by the final telephone booth scene in which the blind woman redirects Manni's attention to a passerby, which enables him to make an important choice near the film's climax.|$|E

500|$|When first {{published}} in 1945, The North Ship received just one review, in the Coventry Evening Telegraph, which concluded [...] "Mr Larkin has an inner vision that must be sought for with care. His recondite imagery is couched in phrases that make up {{in a kind of}} wistful hinted beauty what they lack in lucidity. Mr Larkin's readers must at present be confined to a small circle. Perhaps his work will gain wider appeal as his genius becomes more mature?" [...] A few years later, though, the poet and critic Charles Madge came across the book and wrote to Larkin with his compliments. When the collection was reissued in 1966 it was presented as a work of juvenilia, and the reviews were gentle and respectful; the most forthright praise came from Elizabeth Jennings in The Spectator: [...] "few <b>will</b> <b>question</b> the intrinsic value of The North Ship or the importance of its being reprinted now. It is good to know that Larkin could write so well when still so young." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{election}} of the President, and the appointment of the High Representative by the European Council, each Commissioner is nominated by their member state (except for those states who provided the President and High Representative) in consultation with the Commission President, although he holds no hard power to force a change in candidate. However the more capable the candidate is, the more likely the Commission President will assign them a powerful portfolio, the distribution of which is entirely at his discretion. The President's team is then subject to hearings at the European Parliament which <b>will</b> <b>question</b> them and then vote on their suitability as a whole. If members of the team are found to be too inappropriate, the President must then reshuffle the team or request a new candidate from the member state or risk the whole Commission being voted down. As Parliament cannot vote against individual Commissioners there is usually a compromise whereby the worst candidates are removed but minor objections are put aside so the Commission can take office. Once the team is approved by parliament, it is formally put into office by the European Council (...) [...]|$|E

Visions of a Ghost Cassie, {{who appears to be}} at the age she would have been had she lived, regularly appeared to Sharon while she was off her medication. A vengeful Victor hired a Cassie lookalike, Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), to gaslight/haunt Sharon, so that Nick <b>will</b> <b>question</b> her sanity once more. Through Mariah, Victor discovers that Sharon is hiding a secret, but fails to discover what it is. To stop having these [...] "visions", Sharon undergoes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which causes her to experience missing gaps in her memories, and she forgets changing Summer's DNA results. Morrow dubbed Victor's actions as [...] "evil", and while speaking of Sharon's secret about Summer's paternity, stated: [...] "When it comes out, it’s certainly going to create a problem for Nick and Sharon. In September 2014, Nick proposes to Sharon once again and she accepts. Later that month, a special Nick and Sharon episode aired, where twenty of the show's characters ended up arrested altogether after the couple's Bachelor/Bachelorette party. The Soap Opera Network called this a [...] "first for daytime television". Phyllis ends up waking up from her coma and stops the wedding. Soon afterwards, Phyllis exposes Sharon's memories and secrets. Nick and Sharon break-up, and he sues her for full custody of Faith.|$|E
