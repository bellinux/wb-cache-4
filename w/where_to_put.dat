25|$|Shortly after, the {{government}} of New York City {{made a series of}} decisions announcing its intent to acquire ownership of the ferry. The Sinking Fund Commission decided in 1903 that the city could acquire the Staten Island ferry route in 1903. The city would pay $3.2 million to take over operations of the ferry, including $2 million for five new screw-propelled ships. From 1902 to 1903, there were debates on <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the new Whitehall terminal; the location at Whitehall Street was decided as the best location. The locations of the Staten Island terminal were also debated, with the terminal proposed to be built in West Brighton, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Port Richmond. In 1904, after the Staten Island Railway Company refused the city's offer of $500,000 for the two terminals, the city started a process to condemn the land around the terminals. The B's access to the Whitehall Street terminal was revoked on October 25, 1905. The city's Department of Docks and Ferries assumed ownership of the ferry and terminals. A new St. George Terminal was then built by the city for $2,318,720. The city acquired five boats from the B operation. The five new ships, one named for each of the new boroughs, were commissioned and entered service in 1905.|$|E

Washington Convention Center left the city with very few hotels rooms to accommodate the greatly expanded number of visitors expected. [...] A convention center [...] "headquarters hotel" [...] was urgently needed, but controversy raged for several years over <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the hotel. In mid-2004, the Washington Convention and Sports Authority (WCSA) commissioned a study of potential sites.

In particular, the sequence depicting the Omaha Beach landings {{was named the}} [...] "best battle scene of all time" [...] by Empire magazine and was ranked number one on TV Guide's list of the [...] "50 Greatest Movie Moments". The scene cost US$12 million and involved up to 1,500 extras, {{some of whom were}} members of the Irish Reserve Defence Forces.

Hernandez criticized the film for its portrayal of Cubans. Hernandez wrote, [...] "The main problem here was the accents.

[...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized Glimcher's direction, writing in his review, [...] "...when it comes to directing dramatic sequences, he is on his own and lacking in resources to make what drama there is come to a coherent or meaningful point." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1914, the PSC {{chairman}} and the commissioner committed to building the line toward Bayside. However, at the time, the LIRR and IRT were administered separately, and the IRT plan would require rebuilding {{a section of}} the Port Washington branch between the Broadway and Auburndale stations. The LIRR moved to block the IRT extension past Flushing since it would compete with the Port Washington Branch service in Bayside. One member of the United Civic Association submitted a proposal to the LIRR to let the IRT use the Port Washington Branch to serve Flushing and Bayside, using a connection between the two lines in Corona. The PSC supported the connection as an interim measure, and on March 11, 1915, it voted to let the Bayside connection be built. Subsequently, engineers surveying the planned intersection of the LIRR and IRT lines found that the IRT land would not actually overlap with any LIRR land. The LIRR president at the time, Ralph Peters, offered to lease the Port Washington and Whitestone Branches to the IRT for rapid transit use for $250,000 annually (...) , excluding other maintenance costs. The lease would last for ten years, with an option to extend the lease by ten more years. The PSC favored the idea of the IRT being a lessee along these lines, but did not know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the Corona connection. Even the majority of groups in eastern Queens supported the lease plan. The only group who opposed the lease agreement was the Flushing Association, who preferred the original Flushing subway plan.|$|E

[...] With few notable exceptions such as Boston University, universities in America classify archaeology as a sub-discipline of anthropology, while in Europe it {{is thought to be}} a subject more like historical studies. It is important to analyze which sciences are close kin because such analysis highlights the questions of what archaeology ought to study and in what ways. Like the other social scientists, the New Archaeologists or processualists wanted to utilize scientific methodology in their work. Archaeology, and in particular archaeology of the historical period, has sometimes been allied more with humanities disciplines such as Classics. The question of <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> archaeology as a discipline, and its concomitant issues of what archaeology ought to study and which methods it ought to use, likely played no small part in the emergence of post-processualism in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|BBC1 was relaunched on 18 February 1985 {{with a new}} look, new {{programming}} including Wogan, EastEnders and {{a revised}} schedule to help streamline and maintain viewers {{throughout the course of}} the evening. Grade started to gear most programmes to either on the hour or half past the hour, while Panorama and Omnibus were both moved after the Nine O'Clock News. Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC1 scheduling which was hampering the network and which was holding back good programmes. Grade stated [...] "When I took over BBC1, I discovered there were wonderful things, it was just a case of <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them." [...] Wogan had been scheduled for a 10pm slot, but Grade moved it to a 7pm slot as he believed the show had potential. From February to August 1985, a high amount of American mini series were broadcast while filming took place of a number of new home grown programmes, including 'Allo 'Allo!, In Sickness and in Health, and Open All Hours. Further improvement come about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £30 million, with eight new series, including Howards' Way, All Creatures Great and Small, Hold the Back Page, and Bluebill, along with the return of Bergerac and Big Deal. The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the money away from the administrative service over a three-year period, after BBC1 was criticised, for failing in matching ITV's output in drama. EastEnders was moved to a 19:30 slot, where it managed to soar to 20 million, helping the BBC1 audience share increase to nearly 50% {{for the first time since}} 1982.|$|E
