5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw a {{demonstration}} of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who <b>witnessed</b> <b>them.</b> Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E
5|$|The detainees at Omarska had {{one meal}} a day. The food was usually spoiled {{and the process}} of getting the food, eating and {{returning}} the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were often accompanied by beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, the detainees were in very poor physical condition. He <b>witnessed</b> <b>them</b> eating a bowl of soup and some bread and said that he had the impression they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, the detainees drank water from a river that was polluted with industrial waste and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were the detainees apprised of any concrete charges against them. Apparently, there was no legitimate reason justifying these people’s detention.|$|E
5|$|After 1555, {{the initial}} {{reconciling}} {{tone of the}} regime began to harden. The medieval heresy laws were restored. The Marian Persecutions of Protestants ensued and 283 Protestants were burnt at the stake for heresy. This resulted in the Queen becoming known as Bloody Mary, due {{to the influence of}} John Foxe, one of the Protestants who fled Marian England. Foxe's Book of Martyrs recorded the executions in such detail that it became Mary's epitaph; Convocation subsequently ordered that Foxe's book should be placed in every cathedral in the land. In fact, while those who were executed after the revolts of 1536, and the St David's Down rebellion of 1549, and the unknown number of monks who died for refusing to submit, may not have been tried for heresy, they certainly exceeded that number by some amount. Even so, the heroism of some of the martyrs was an example to those who <b>witnessed</b> <b>them,</b> so that in some places it was the burnings that set people against the regime.|$|E

25|$|The criminals were punished {{in front}} of their peers and {{officers}} and the utter humiliation suffered was meant to deter from any further wrongdoing. Punishments were often painful and disgraceful to discourage those who <b>witnessed</b> <b>them</b> from undergoing the same fate. However, it was customary for a soldier to be accepted back into his regiment without any discredit once he had been punished.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1840, Thiers helped {{secure the}} {{election}} of Victor Hugo to the Académie Française, despite the opposition of the more conservative members. Hugo was accepted only on the fifth ballot, by a single vote. When elected, Hugo sent {{a copy of his}} new poem about Napoleon to Thiers, declaring to Thiers that Thiers was [...] "a man I honor and love; your spirit is one of those that seduces my own. One feels that before you entered the world of great affairs, you traversed that of great ideas. With my full sympathy, high estime and vivid admiration." [...] From 1840 through 1844, Thiers traveled around Europe, crisscrossing Holland, Germany, Switzerland and Spain and visiting he battlefields where Napoleon fought and meeting people who had <b>witnessed</b> <b>them.</b> In the meanwhile, his chief political rival, Guizot, the leader of the right wing in the Deputies, headed the government. He called new elections in July 1846, which Guizot's party narrowly won, with 266 seats of 449. However, in an ominous sign, ten of the twelve deputies from Paris opposed the government. As the King's [...] unpopularity grew, he suffered also a personal tragedy with great political implications; [...] his son, the heir to the throne, was killed in an accident. His grandson, the new heir, was only a child.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} itself {{was built in}} AD 30 on a site which was then beyond the city walls.

60|$|The two naval {{officers}} {{acknowledged the}} introduction with characteristic brevity.

60|$|The Alamo had fallen, {{and now it}} was {{necessary}} to figure up results. As said before, all of the Texans, about one hundred and eighty in number, had been slaughtered, while the loss to the Mexicans was variously estimated at from three to five hundred. The sights about the mission were truly horrible, and never forgotten by those who <b>witnessed</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|The next witness was Sir Terence, {{who gave}} his {{evidence}} quietly from his {{place at the}} board immediately on the president's right.

6000|$|... "La Biche was by {{no means}} so {{affected}} as you seem to be, ladies, by the recital of these horrors. She had <b>witnessed</b> <b>them</b> in her time. She came from the Senecas, whose villages lie near the great cataract between Ontario and Erie; her people made war for the English, and against them: they had fought with other tribes; and, in the battles between us and them, it is difficult to say whether whiteskin or redskin is most savage.|$|E
60|$|At any rate, whether {{protected}} by his attendants or {{only by the}} fortune of war, Temujin passed through the battle without being hurt, and the courage and energy which he displayed were greatly commended by all who <b>witnessed</b> <b>them.</b> His mother was in the battle too, though, perhaps, not personally involved in the actual conflicts of it. She directed the manoeuvres, however, and by her presence and her activity greatly encouraged and animated the men. In consequence of the spirit and energy infused into the troops by her presence, and by the extraordinary ardor and bravery of Temujin, the battle was gained. The army of the enemy was put to flight. One of the leaders, Taychot, was slain. The other made his escape, and Temujin and his mother were left in possession of the field.|$|E
60|$|Not {{long after}} this the sea itself {{came to the}} aid of the Tyrians. There was a storm; and, as a {{consequence}} of it, a heavy swell rolled in from the offing, which soon undermined and washed away {{a large part of the}} pier. The effects of a heavy sea on the most massive and substantial structures, when they are fairly exposed to its impulse, are far greater than would be conceived possible by those who had not <b>witnessed</b> <b>them.</b> The most ponderous stones are removed, the strongest fastenings are torn asunder, and embankments the most compact and solid are undermined and washed away. The storm, in this case, destroyed in a few hours the work of many months, while the army of Alexander looked on from the shore witnessing its ravages in dismay.|$|E
5000|$|Joana Isabel Cipriano (born 31 May 1996) {{disappeared}} on 12 September 2004 from Figueira, {{a village}} near Portimão in the Algarve region of Portugal.

6000|$|I replied, [...] "In part, by not inquiring into them.

6000|$|Mr. Fordyce {{told him}} he was afraid of being like the {{fisherman}} who wedded a mermaid, and made Ellen tell the story in her own pretty way; but while we were laughing over it, I saw my mother steal her hand into my father's and give it a strong grasp. Such gestures, which she denominated pawing, when she <b>witnessed</b> <b>them</b> in Emily, were so alien to her in general that no doubt this little action was infinitely expressive to her husband. She was wonderfully softened, and Clarence implied to me that {{it was the first time}} she had ever seemed to grieve for him more than she despised him, or to recognise his deprivation more than his disgrace,--implied, I say, for the words he used were little more than--'You can't think how nice she was to me.' ...|$|E
60|$|Paula and {{her lover}} backed yet further, till {{the hem of}} her skirt touched Havill's feet. Their attitudes were {{sufficient}} to prove their relations to the most obstinate Didymus who should have <b>witnessed</b> <b>them.</b> Tender emotions seemed to pervade the summer-house like an aroma. The calm ecstasy of the condition of {{at least one of them}} was not without a coercive effect upon the two invidious spectators, so that they must need have remained passive had they come there to disturb or annoy. The serenity of Paula was even more impressive than the hushed ardour of Somerset: she did not satisfy curiosity as Somerset satisfied it; she piqued it. Poor Somerset had reached a perfectly intelligible depth--one which had a single blissful way out of it, and nine calamitous ones; but Paula remained an enigma all through the scene.|$|E
6000|$|Kirby and Spence tell us {{that the}} battles of ants have long been celebrated and the date of them recorded, though they say that Huber is the only modern author who appears to have <b>witnessed</b> <b>them.</b> [...] "Æneas Sylvius," [...] say they, [...] "after giving a very circumstantial account of one contested with great obstinacy by a great and small species on the trunk of a pear tree," [...] adds that [...] "this action was fought in the pontificate of Eugenius the Fourth, in the {{presence}} of Nicholas Pistoriensis, an eminent lawyer, who related the whole history of the battle with the greatest fidelity." [...] A similar engagement between great and small ants is recorded by Olaus Magnus, in which the small ones, being victorious, are said to have buried the bodies of their own soldiers, but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds. This event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant Christiern the Second from Sweden. The battle which I witnessed took place in the Presidency of Polk, five years before the passage of Webster's Fugitive-Slave Bill.|$|E
60|$|The {{coronation}} at York {{was attended}} and followed, as that at London had been, with banquets and public parades, and grand celebrations of all sorts, which continued for several successive days, and the hilarity and joy which these shows awakened among the crowds that assembled to <b>witness</b> <b>them</b> {{seemed to indicate}} a universal acquiescence {{on the part of}} the people of England in Richard's accession to the throne.|$|R

50|$|Both Bethell and Gisborne include {{extensive}} footnotes that {{elaborate on}} the particular places mentioned throughout their poems. In these notes, they often address the reader by presuming his or her response, belief or disbelief in the scene.
