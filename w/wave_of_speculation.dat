50|$|East 96th Street, {{particularly}} near Second and Third Avenues, underwent significant gentrification in {{the late}} 1980s. By 2005, a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>speculation</b> for Harlem real estate pushed a corridor of luxury condos and coops up First Avenue from 96th Street as well. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway, which built a station on the street, has disrupted lives and businesses along 96th Street, but its opening in 2017 is expected to further increase residential and commercial development in East Harlem, as well as increasing housing value in Yorkville.|$|E

40|$|The {{signature}} of the Maastricht Treaty, which was intended to usher in currency stability by transforming the European Monetary System (EMS) into an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) with a single currency, was instead followed within months by the worst currency crisis for two decades. Ireland was hit by the crisis as badly as any region in the Community and the whole experience had already brought the issue of currency policy to centre stage when, {{at the end of}} July 1993, the EMS quite suddenly collapsed under pressure of a new <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>speculation</b> directed mainly against the French franc. This paper reviews Ireland's experience in the EMS and asks whether any changes in currency policy are suggested by recent events. Increasing complacency about the stability of the system {{over the past five years}} led to realignment policy within the system becoming too rigid. Its last months highlighted the weaknesses of such a system from Ireland's point of view, including its vulnerability to speculation and the volatility which it entails for the Irish pound-sterling exchange rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{shale gas}} {{phenomenon}} {{has transformed the}} US from prospective LNG importer to the current expectation of it becoming a major LNG exporter. In the UK the recent upgraded estimates by the British Geological Society of shale gas resources {{in the north of}} England have unleashed a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>speculation</b> in the media which includes an anticipation of lower prices and eliminating the need for natural gas imports. Drawing on US data, this Comment seeks to highlight the practicalities to be faced in developing the UK’s shale gas resources and addresses the drilling intensity and timescale required to achieve meaningful levels of production. It is deemed unlikely that UK shale gas development would have a discernible effect of wholesale gas prices. Whilst the increased fiscal contribution and balance of payments impact of shale gas would be beneficial at a national level, the real challenge will be that of gaining public acceptance in the locales where shale gas development will have a visual and traffic impact during the drilling phase. In the event that exploratory activities confirm the viability of UK shale gas plays the industry will need to engage in a public acceptance campaign based mainly on an offer of training, jobs and local economic stimulus if it is to succeed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{conflict}} {{over the right}} way to tackle the so-called refugee crisis in Europe has proved that relations between the EU and the Visegrád Group have changed. The political dispute surfaced most clearly regarding the different proposals for a quota-based refugee relocation system - a decision which was refused by the V 4. The bloc consisting of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia first articulated its common position on migration in September 2015 and several times afterwards. On the basis of these statements, one can summarise their approach as follows: (1) Protecting the external borders of the EU and underlining the importance of fulfilling the obligations for the EU acquis; (2) Effective management of the root causes of migration flows, which could help reduce the number of migrants; (3) Refusing Germany's open-door migration policy. Although an increasing number of EU member states share a similar approach, the V 4 as the whole started to be perceived as a coalition known for obstructing practices. The split on the issue gave life to a new <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>speculation</b> about the increasing split between "old" and "new" Europe and the possible shift of the later eastwards. Furious politicians and public opinion in Western Europe continued to remind the Visegrád countries of their lack of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a lightweight protocol to support selective re-execution on the TRIPS processor. The protocol permits multiple <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>speculation</b> to be traversing a dataflow graph simultaneously {{and in any}} order, with a cleanup "commit" wave propagating as well to determine completion {{of a group of}} instructions. The protocol is completely distributed, consisting of point-to-point messages and requiring no centralized control. Thus, recovery from value mis-speculations requires no additional fetching or decoding of instructions, and no issue of instructions that were independent of the faulting instruction. We describe briefly one way in which this protocol can be exploited: by allowing every instruction to use a decentralized last value predictor. Our results show that in this scheme up to 26 % of all instructions can fire as soon as they are fetched, with 0. 001 % of instructions firing incorrectly...|$|R
40|$|A Neural {{network with}} {{topology}} 2 - 8 - 8 is evaluated against {{the standard of}} supervised non-parametric maximum likelihood classification. The purpose of the evaluation is to compare the performance in terms of training speed and quality of classifica-tion. Classification is done on multispectral data from the Thematic Mapper(TM 3,TM 4) in combination with a ground reference class map. This type of data is familiar to {{professionals in the field}} of remote sensing. This means that the position of clusters in feature space is well known and under-stood, and that the spatial pattern is equally well known. As a spin-off, the application of a neural net to a classical task of statistical pat-tern recognition helps to demystify neurai networks. neural nets, k-nearest neighbours, remote sensing, classification INTKODUCTION After the sobering up, out <b>of</b> <b>speculations</b> about neural networks as prevalent in the behaviouristic school of artificial intelligence, in the late nineteen-seventies, as a iesult of the publication on Perceptrons by Minsky (Minsky, 1969) (2), a new <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>speculations</b> started off in tne early nineteen-eighties. Neural networks are of technical interest because of the parallel nature of the calculations. Several manufacturers are attempting to build and market hardware neural necwork devices now. In case these parallel processing devices become available at the right pricr/performance figure, image processing of remote sensing data, with its massive data flows, could profit from these devices. For this reason it is worthwhile to investigate the performance of simulated (neural) nets, when applied to e. g. computation intensive classifica-tion tasks.

50|$|After the abolishment {{of control}} of living space in 1960, Hans Kampffmeyer, {{the head of the}} social {{democratic}} planning department developed the concept of decentralising the inner city. The adjacent boroughs were to become an extension of the Westend. The so-called Fünf-Fingerplan of 1967 designated that through the Westend five leading axles - Mainzer Landstraße, Bockenheimer Landstraße, Reuterweg, Grüneburgweg and Eschersheimer Landstraße - should be developed under an intensive construction plan. From this came a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> property <b>speculation,</b> numerous nineteenth century building were demolished in the following years, their long established tenants driven out by rough methods.

5000|$|Soon after Walpole {{returned}} to the Cabinet, Britain was swept by a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> over-enthusiastic <b>speculation</b> {{which led to the}} South Sea Bubble. The Government had established a plan whereby the South Sea Company would assume the national debt of Great Britain in exchange for lucrative bonds. It was widely believed that the Company would eventually reap an enormous profit through international trade in cloth, agricultural goods, and slaves. Many in the country, including Walpole himself (who sold {{at the top of the}} market and made 1,000 percent profit), frenziedly invested in the company. By the latter part of 1720, however, the company had begun to collapse as the price of its shares plunged..|$|R

Allegedly, Echevarría had become jealous of a relationship Vigoreaux had started with actress Nydia Castillo, and had paid Newman and López-Watts to either beat him or murder him. Vigoreaux's body was found gagged, stabbed, and burned inside the car's trunk.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the term}} [...] "canals" [...] {{indicates}} an artificial construction, the term [...] "channels" [...] connotes that the observed features were natural configurations of the planetary surface.

Among the most fervent supporters of the artificial-canal hypothesis was the American astronomer Percival Lowell, who spent much of his life trying to prove the existence of intelligent life on the red planet. After Lowell's death in 1916, astronomers developed a consensus against the canal hypothesis, but the popular concept of Martian canals excavated by intelligent Martians remained in the public mind {{for the first half of}} the 20th century, and inspired a corpus of works of classic science fiction.|$|R
2500|$|Cotton, ranching, {{and farming}} {{dominated}} the economy, with railroad construction after 1870 {{a major factor}} in the development of new cities away from rivers and waterways. Toward the end of the 19th century, timber became an important industry in Texas as well. In 1901 a petroleum discovery at Spindletop Hill, near Beaumont, was developed as the most productive oil well the world had ever seen. The <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> oil <b>speculation</b> and discovery that followed came to be known as the [...] "Oil Boom", permanently transforming and enriching the economy of Texas. Agriculture and ranching gave way to a service-oriented society after the boom years of World War II. Segregation ended in the 1960s due to federal legislation. Politically, Texas changed from the virtually one-party Democratic state achieved following disenfranchisement, to a highly contested political scene, until 2000 when it was solidly Republican. The economy of Texas has continued to grow rapidly, becoming the second-largest state in population in 1994, and became economically highly diversified, with a growing base in new technology.|$|R

In anticipation of the railroad, San Francisco began work in 1865 to build the Long Bridge, to connect San Francisco proper through Mission Bay to Potrero Hill, Dogpatch and Bayview. Dogpatch, once deemed too far south, was suddenly a stone's throw away. The Long Bridge completely transformed Potrero Nuevo from no man's land to a central hub. One of the first <b>of</b> many <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> real estate <b>speculation</b> on Potrero Hill soon followed. The Long Bridge was closed after Mission Bay was filled in the early 1900s, which made Dogpatch an even more desirable location.|$|R
40|$|The {{world economy}} is in crisis. Since the initial turbulences in the U. S. {{subprime}} mortgage market {{in the summer of}} 2007, we have experienced a global recession in 2008 - 9 and a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>speculation</b> threatening the existence of the European Monetary Union in 2009 - 10. At the same time, there has been a remarkable shift in economic policies and economic thinking more broadly. Hardly anyone would doubt today that the Keynesian stimulus packages which were put in place all over the world have so far prevented an even sharper fall in output and increase in unemployment and poverty. Fiscal policy is again considered a powerful tool for macroeconomic stabilisation policies. Similarly, few would now question the necessity of tighter regulation of the financial markets. Central banks around the world have taken ‘unconventional measures’ such as the purchase of asset-backed-securities to stabilise the financial system and the real economy. But the crisis also has more structural roots, amongst which are the massive increases in income and wealth inequalities {{over the past three decades}} or so, and the global imbalances in international trade. At this stage, it is still unclear how far policy makers around the world will be able to live up to these challenges. The chapters in this book address these issues from different angles, analysing the underlying structural causes of the crisis, assessing the policy responses to the crisis with a special emphasis on Europe, and making concrete proposals for financial market reforms and a Keynesian New Deal more broadly. ...|$|R
