25|$|The Science and Engineering {{building}} {{received a}} LEED Silver rating in March 2009. SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB {{was made to}} reflect 92 percent of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building and therefore, reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also pre-cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High performance <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, {{as well as a}} drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape reduces water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons of water a day that is used to flush toilets.|$|E
2500|$|Dinky offerings at {{this time}} were striking, but {{due to the lack}} of much competition, {{development}} of new models was perhaps a bit slow at least until July 1956, when Mettoy introduced a rival line of models under the Corgi brand name. The most obvious difference was the addition of clear plastic <b>window</b> <b>glazing.</b> While Corgi Toys called their vehicles, [...] "The Ones With Windows", Meccano Ltd responded by updating the Dinky Toys range and the models from both companies quickly became more and more sophisticated featuring such things as working suspension, [...] "fingertip steering", detailed interiors, and jewelled headlights. The first model to have jewelled headlights was the no. 196 Holden Special sedan made from 1963-1969.|$|E
2500|$|It seems (again {{according}} to Sutter's {{account of the}} aftermath) that this meeting may have made a real difference to Soviet aircraft design, but Boeing's contribution could naturally not be acknowledged publicly by the Soviet side. [...] Ilyushin therefore had to stress {{that it had been}} the first in the world to use podded engines suspended from pylons beneath and ahead of the wing, on the experimental Ilyushin Il-22 four-engined jet bomber of 1946 (first use of this designation). Having thus presented the Il-86's ultimate configuration as indigenously Soviet, the bureau could at last show it in public in 1973, six years after publication of the aerobus specification and four years after the design assignment. A modern six-window flightdeck followed, in place of the 18-to-20 <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> of the Il-18, Il-62 and Il-76.|$|E

50|$|Skylights {{are widely}} used in {{designing}} daylighting for residential, public, and commercial buildings. Increased daylighting can result in less electrical lighting use and smaller sized <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> (sidelighting), saving energy, lowering costs, and reducing environmental impacts. Daylighting can cut lighting energy use in some buildings by up to 80%.|$|E
50|$|The model 400 was {{the only}} Bristol to be fitted with a steel and {{aluminum}} skin, and had all flat glass, but for the curved rear <b>window,</b> <b>glazed</b> in perspex, which was available to specification with a top hinge. This feature was very welcome on warmer climate export markets, where the sliding door windows provided only marginal ventilation to the passengers.|$|R
50|$|This two {{storeyed}} buildings sits on {{the corner}} of Wickham Terrace and Robert Street and has an T-shaped plan. The building is timber framed and clad with fibrous-sheeting, which in some areas has been vandalised creating holes. The shallow pitched, half-hipped roof is clad with corrugated iron. The building is lined with discrete timber framed <b>windows</b> <b>glazed</b> with arctic glass.|$|R
50|$|A multi-lite {{window is}} a <b>window</b> <b>glazed</b> with small {{panes of glass}} {{separated}} by wooden or lead glazing bars, or muntins, arranged in a decorative glazing pattern often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or lattice window) {{was the most common}} window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.|$|R
50|$|While {{determining}} how much UV light should be filtered by art glazing, {{it may also}} be important to consider the amount of UV light present inside a room or a building. Note that regular <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> filters away {{a significant portion of the}} UV light, which originates from the sun.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its campaigning and educational roles, the Trust comments on planning applications and takes part in planning policy consultations. It also provides limited financial assistance towards the repair or reinstatement of external architectural features (railings, <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> bars, urns, gateposts, etc) that may be missing from listed buildings in Bath.|$|E

50|$|The two east <b>windows,</b> <b>glazed</b> with {{coloured}} panes, {{are believed}} to be Georgian in origin, being referred to as 'recent' additions in documents dating from 1849. The nave roof has a ceiling, the painted imitation-plasterwork in the covings being of interest, believed to be 18th century work. During the last restoration, the plaster ceilings in the chancel and the remaining south transept were removed, exposing roof timbers from the 15th century.|$|R
50|$|A {{window is}} {{an opening in}} a wall, door, roof or vehicle that allows the passage of light, sound, and/or air. Modern <b>windows</b> are usually <b>glazed</b> or covered in some other {{transparent}} or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are {{also referred to as}} a <b>window.</b> Many <b>glazed</b> <b>windows</b> may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. Windows often have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{entrance to}} the body of the church is via the western end, with the eastern end providing access to a small vestry. The western entrance door is a double pointed arched timber boarded door. Lining the nave of the church are lancet windows in timber frames, divided into three glazed panels, the two lower of which are hopper windows. The <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> has been painted.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{technology is}} a computer model which simulates the propagation of aircraft noise and its penetration into buildings. Variations in aircraft types, flight patterns and local meteorology can be analyzed along with benefits of alternative building retrofit strategies such as roof upgrading, <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> improvement, fireplace baffling, caulking construction seams and other measures. The computer model allows cost effectiveness evaluations {{of a host of}} alternative strategies.|$|E
50|$|Implementing energy {{efficiency}} measures {{in a home}} or business {{can also lead to}} behavioral changes. When an {{energy efficiency}} change has been made and the energy consumer sees the benefits, more changes are often wanted to further their savings. These small changes create awareness and {{can be as simple as}} turning of lights when a room is not in use, or as complex as adding <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> or installing demand-control ventilation.|$|E
50|$|Internally, Mayes Cottage {{consists}} of four major rooms with additional rooms added to the verandah space of {{the western side of}} the building. Timber boarding is used throughout the cottage for flooring and internal partitioning, with beaded boards used to line the ceiling. Throughout the cottage there are simple moulded four panelled timber doors. The walkway joining the main house to the kitchen wing is enclosed with casement <b>windows,</b> <b>glazed</b> with coloured and clear arctic glass.|$|R
50|$|The double height nave of {{the church}} is {{essentially}} rectangular in plan and runs in an east-west direction under a low pitched gable roof clad with red concrete roof tiles. The eaves are lined with timber boards above exposed decorative rafters that carry half round gutters. A series of long, narrow, high level, arched windows punctuate its northern and southern elevations and contain fixed, nine pane, steel framed <b>windows</b> <b>glazed</b> with randomly set yellow, blue, green and uncoloured obscure glass. Located beneath these windows and of equal width are a series of square, recessed, hit-and-miss brick ventilation panels that reveal the symbol of the cross in their patterning. These baffled ventilation panels, similarly expressed on the interior in metal, are part {{of the church}}'s passive cooling system, allowing air to be drawn into the church. The western elevation includes a circular timber vent above a single centrally positioned high level window with arched head housing a fixed, thirty two pane, steel framed <b>window</b> <b>glazed</b> with the same palette of coloured glass. Located below the window is the marble foundation stone of the church commemorating benefactor Charles Shepherd.|$|R
40|$|The use of vacuum <b>glazed</b> <b>windows</b> is {{increasing}} {{due to their}} application in modern building design. Among various types of vacuum <b>glazed</b> <b>windows</b> reported in literature, thermal transmittance of single glass sheet (conventional window) i. e 6 W/m 2 k is reduced by 66 and 77 % using air filled double glazed and air filled triple <b>glazed</b> <b>windows</b> respectively. Using low emittance coatings thermal transmittance of double <b>glazed</b> <b>windows</b> is reduced by 53 %, however it offsets the visibility by reducing light transmittance by 5 %. Stresses due to temperature/pressure gradients if not eliminated may lead to reduction in service life of vacuum <b>glazed</b> <b>windows.</b> Vacuum created between the glass sheets is used to reduce conductive heat transfer. Degradation in the vacuum is caused by number of factors such as, permeation of gaseous molecules through glass sheets, leakage through sealing, thermal/optical desorption and photo-fragmentation of organic species have been critically reviewed and future trends are outlined...|$|R
50|$|The {{conduction}} of heat {{between the}} panes, {{caused by the}} spacers, tends to limit evacuated glazing’s overall insulative effectiveness. Nevertheless, evacuated glazing is still as insulative as much thicker conventional double glazing and tends to be stronger, since the two constituent glass sheets are pressed together by the atmosphere, and hence react practically as one thick sheet to bending forces. Evacuated glazing also offers very good sound insulation in comparison with other popular types of <b>window</b> <b>glazing.</b>|$|E
50|$|From {{that initial}} project, the Philamlife Corporation gave Arguelles {{his first big}} office-building {{commission}} — the Philamlife headquarters. This he shaped {{into one of the}} first international-style buildings in Manila. The medium-rise block was a rectangularly-planned structure with a centralized core that allowed some 20,000 square meters of office space to be naturally daylighted through the use of wraparound ribbon <b>window</b> <b>glazing</b> and aluminum sunshades supported by pipes and mullions. Sculpted concrete formed entrance canopies and a roof for the complex’s auditorium. Arguelles also used the artwork of Filipino artists like Galo Ocampo and Manansala to enhance the clean, spacious and brightly lit interiors.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is widely {{known for its}} corrugated aluminium cladding, radiused corners and sloping glazed roof. The exterior belies the light and spacious interiors of the flats. Living space is maximised by concentrating bathrooms, lifts and stairs in a central structural core. Natural light is maximised by placing the freestanding perimeter columns behind continuous <b>window</b> <b>glazing.</b> Curved corners add the sensation of panoramic views over London. Most internal walls are non-loadbearing which allows flats to be combined as larger units. This shows the benefits of designing residential accommodation on the same principles as commercial offices where habitable space is freed by concentrating services in a central core.|$|E
50|$|In 636 Birinus {{sent for}} masons from Italy who started {{work on the}} Abbey at Dorchester. Bede wrote: “Many churches were built and endowed by Birinus.” These were often built of wattle and daub, and the <b>windows</b> <b>glazed</b> with horn. Birinus {{established}} a small chapel for himself on Berin’s Hill, about 1.5 mi from Checkendon. He was an ardent missionary and it seems probable that he also converted Caeca, after whom Checkendon is named. Birinus' favourite saints were Peter and Paul.|$|R
5000|$|Careful {{attention}} to the placement and siting of the building has created natural ventilation system. The building’s location, orientation, and shape take into account prevailing winds and exposure to the sun [...] As a result, only one small section of the office space {{on the ground floor}} is equipped with air conditioning [...] The design of windows further maximizes both ventilation and light levels; for example, special attention was paid to shading and <b>window</b> <b>glazes</b> to mediate southern and western exposures.|$|R
