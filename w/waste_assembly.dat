Brief Description of Revision: A complete revision {{to reflect a}} recent change in name for the NTS; changes in name for some tenant organizations; and to update references to current DOE policies, orders, and guidance documents. Article 237. 2 was deleted. Appendix 3 B was updated. Article 411. 2 was modified. Article 422 was re-written to reflect the wording of DOE O 458. 1. Article 431. 6. d was modified. The glossary was updated. This manual contains the radiological control requirements {{to be used for}} all radiological activities conducted by programs under the purview of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO). Compliance with these requirements will ensure compliance with Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 835, &#x 27;Occupational Radiation Protection. &#x 27; Programs covered by this manual are located at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS); Nellis Air Force Base and North Las Vegas, Nevada; Santa Barbara and Livermore, California; and Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. In addition, fieldwork by NNSA/NSO at other locations is covered by this manual. Current activities at NNSS include operating low-level radioactive and mixed waste disposal facilities for United States defense-generated <b>waste,</b> <b>assembly</b> and execution of subcritical experiments, assembly/disassembly of special experiments, the storage and use of special nuclear materials, performing criticality experiments, emergency responder training, surface cleanup and site characterization of contaminated land areas, environmental activity by the University system, and nonnuclear test operations, such as controlled spills of hazardous materials at the Hazardous Materials Spill Center. Currently, the major potential for occupational radiation exposure is associated with the burial of low-level radioactive waste and the handling of radioactive sources. Remediation of contaminated land areas may also result in radiological exposures...|$|E

The Primary Propulsion System includes self-contained hydrazine modules for station reboost, attitude control and contingency maneuvers. These Propulsion Modules contain reboost and attitude control thrusters, propellant storage, thermal conditioning and electronic controls. The modules are serviced {{on the ground}} and launched on the Space Shuttle as replacements for the on-orbit modules which have expended their propellant. The expended modules are returned to the ground for reservicing and subsequent reuse. The Supplemental Reboost System includes a <b>Waste</b> Gas <b>Assembly</b> and Resistojet Modules which are used for reboost maneuvers only.

40|$|This {{technical}} report evaluates and develops options {{for reducing the}} amount of steel in the emplacement drift invert. Concepts developed in the ''Invert Configuration and Drip Shield Interface'' were evaluated to determine material properties required for the proposed invert concepts. Project requirements documents prescribe the use of a carbon steel frame for the invert with a granular material of crushed tuff as ballast. The ''Invert Configuration and Drip Shield Interface'' developed three concepts: (1) All-Ballast Invert; (2) Modified Steel Invert with Ballast; and (3) Steel Tie with Ballast Invert. Analysis of the steel frame members, runway beams, and guide beams, for the modified steel invert with ballast, decreased the quantity of steel in the emplacement drift invert, however a substantial steel support frame for the gantry and <b>waste</b> package/pallet <b>assembly</b> is still required. Use of one of the other two concepts appears to be an alternative to the steel frame and each of the concepts uses considerably less steel materials. Analysis of the steel tie with ballast invert shows that the bearing pressure on the ballast under the single steel tie, C 9 x 20, loaded with the <b>waste</b> package/pallet <b>assembly,</b> drip shield, and backfill exceeds the upper bound of the allowable bearing capacity for tuff used in this study. The single tie, C 10 x 20, will also fail for the same loading condition except for the tie length of 4. 2 meters and longer. Analysis also shows that with two ties, C 9 or 10 x 20 's, the average ballast pressure is less than the allowable bearing capacity. Distributing the waste package/pallet, drip shield, and backfill loads to two steel ties reduces the contact bearing pressure. Modifying the emplacement pallet end beams to a greater width, reducing the tie spacing, and increasing the width of the ties would ensure that the pallet beams are always supported by two steel ties. Further analysis is required to determine compatible tie size and spacing and pallet beam width. Testing is also required to determine the bearing capacity of the tuff materials. Analysis of the all-ballast invert shows that the <b>waste</b> package/pallet <b>assembly,</b> as currently designed, can be supported by the compacted crushed tuff. The drip shield and related backfill loads cannot be supported by the compacted crushed tuff because of the narrow base angle that currently supports the drip shield. Increasing the width of the base angle of the drip shield will better distribute the drip shield and backfill load to the compacted crushed tuff. Testing is required to determine the bearing capacity of the tuff materials. Emplacement/retrieval equipment will also require analysis and development to be compatible with the all-ballast invert...|$|R

40|$|Standard Work is a {{very useful}} tool of the Lean Production {{paradigm}} to specify standards and to establish the best methods and sequences for each process and for each worker, helping to reduce wastes. Despite its usefulness, this tool is often underused, neglected and misunderstood. Apart from that, {{there is a lack}} of literature about Standard Work. It is possible to find many papers on Lean Production in general and on some Lean tools, but there are few that focus on or describe in detail this particular tool. The main purpose of this paper is to prove the validity and show the importance and the applicability of Standard Work. The main aspects and ideas to understand this tool are described, as well as the benefits of applying it in a real world manufacturing environment. In this paper, an application example is given on a production unit of an elevators company, following the Action-Research methodology. The main findings are that Standard Work is effectively a good tool to normalize work procedures, allowing increased flexibility and production, and decreased <b>wastes</b> and <b>assembly</b> errors...|$|R
40|$|For the {{disposal}} of vitrified high level <b>waste</b> <b>assemblies,</b> which are highly active (high concentration of beta and gamma radiation resulting in heat emitted by this type of waste), the use of cylindrical concrete supercontainers is considered as the reference design in Belgium, based {{on the use of}} an integrated waste package composed of a carbon steel overpack surrounded by a massive concrete buffer based on Ordinary Portland Cement. Once the buffer is cast and hardened sufficiently in controlled environment, the radwaste is emplaced inside the buffer, the remaining gap is filled by casting a fresh mortar material (the filling) and the container is closed by fitting the lid. As a consequence, the concrete buffer, the filling and the lid, will be exposed to the effect of the heat-emitting radioactive waste during hardening (the filling) and in a hardened state (the buffer and the lid). The effect of gamma radiation (with a relevant dose rate) on the strength of the hardening filling is investigated in a preliminary study, by means of compressive strength tests, sample weighing, fluorescence microscopic test methods and scanning electron microscopy, to verify whether a possible strength loss can be noticed and to identify the main mechanisms behind the strength variations, e. g. by evaluating the possible changes in capillary porosity or to evaluate the drying process due to gamma irradiation. Furthermore, the simulations of the early-age behaviour of the concrete buffer of the supercontainer indicate a possible macro cracking risk of the outer concrete buffer, mainly devoted to the thermal expansive behaviour of the carbon steel overpack. The main goal is to prevent through-going concrete macro cracking of the buffer and the filler material, as it facilitates transport mechanisms of aggressive species once placed in the underground disposal galleries and this might jeopardize the durability of the radiological Second International Conference on Microstructural- elated Durability of Cementitious Composites, 11 - 13 April 2012, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Second International Conference on Microstructural-related Durability of Cementitious Composites, 11 - 13 April 2012, Amsterdam, The Netherlands protection medium. An efficient way to overcome this cracking nature can be achieved by reducing the modulus of elasticity of the filler material, which can be a consequence of irradiation by means of gamma rays during hardening of the cementitious filling...|$|R
50|$|The lean {{manufacturing}} system considers as waste {{the expenditure of}} resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer, and continually seeks ways to eliminate such waste. In particular, the system focuses on minimizing inventory throughout the assembly line. Kanban cards are used to signal only when the necessary inputs to production are needed, and in so doing, reduce <b>assembly</b> <b>waste</b> (inventory) and increase productivity. Additionally, immediate quality control checkpoints can identify mistakes or imperfections during assembly {{as early as possible}} to ensure that the least amount of time is expended developing a faulty product. Another primary focus of the lean management system is to maintain close connections with suppliers in order to understand their customers' desires.|$|R
40|$|Two {{significant}} {{pieces of}} legislation in California have mandated that cities and counties must reduce their <b>waste</b> streams. <b>Assembly</b> Bill 341 establishes that California must divert 75 % of its waste from landfills by the year 2020. The first bill that included composting, Assembly Bill 1826, was passed in 2014 and requires that commercial users enact composting beginning in 2016. These initiatives have led cities and counties to seek ways of implementing composting programs. Using the City of Napa as a case study, this thesis argues that a composting program can be integrated into any existing waste hauling service. Although there are some challenges, including effectively reaching all residents eligible for the program and finding ways {{to encourage people to}} change waste disposal habits, other communities should be able to adopt Napa’s model. Napa’s program should act as an outline for other communities to develop similar outreach strategies, public education initiatives, and pilot programs. Once implemented, cities can continue creating a sustainable community through the use of new technologies. Not only will creating a composting program allow cities and counties to be in compliance with Assembly Bill 1826, it will also offer benefits that extend beyond the local scope, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R
40|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) {{achieved}} a national milestone {{on the road}} to shipping transuranic (TRU) waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) when it received certification authority on September 12, 1997. Since that time, LANL has been characterizing a non-mixed TRU waste stream and preparing shipments of this TRU waste for disposal in the WIPP. The paper describes the TRU waste identified as waste stream TA- 55 - 43 Lot No. 01 from LANL Technical Area- 55 and the process used to determine that it does not contain hazardous waste regulated by the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) or the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act (HWA). The non-mixed determination is based on the acceptable knowledge (AK) characterization process, which clearly shows that the waste does not exhibit any RCRA characteristics nor meet any RCRA listing descriptions. LANL has certified TRU waste from waste stream TA- 55 - 43 Lot No. 01 and is prepared to certify additional quantities of TRU waste from other non-mixed TRU <b>waste</b> streams. <b>Assembly</b> and preparation of AK on the processes that generated TRU waste is recognized as a necessary part of the process for having waste ready for shipment to the WIPP...|$|R

5000|$|When the {{messenger}} ship reached Athens {{with news of}} Conon's situation, the <b>assembly</b> <b>wasted</b> no time in approving extreme measures to build and man a relief force. The golden statues of Nike were melted down to fund {{the construction of the}} ships, and slaves and metics were enlisted to crew the fleet. To ensure a sufficiently large and loyal group of crewmen, the Athenians even took the radical step of extending citizenship to thousands of slaves who rowed with the fleet. [...] Over a hundred ships were prepared and manned through these measures, and contributions from allied ships raised the fleet's size to 150 triremes after it reached Samos. In a highly unorthodox arrangement, the fleet was commanded collaboratively by eight generals; these were Aristocrates, Aristogenes, Diomedon, Erasinides, Lysias, Pericles, Protomachus, and Thrasyllus.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a parametric {{evaluation of the}} fraction of the pressurized water reactor (PWR) <b>assembly</b> <b>waste</b> stream {{with the potential for}} the criticality threshold in a flooded 21 PWR waste package (WP). The parameters considered were: (1) fuel isotopics (i. e., burnup, enrichment, and age), (2) time of WP breach, (3) the degree of basket degradation, (4) the distribution of the resulting corrosion products, and (5) the infiltration rate. For this evaluation, a k{sub eff} of 0. 93 was chosen as the threshold for criticality based on the 5 % margin of safety required by 10 CFR 60. 131 (h), plus an additional 2 % to allow for the expected bias and uncertainty in the method of calculation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to provide an integrated overview of the calculation reports that define {{the response of the}} waste package and its internals to vibratory ground motion. The calculation reports for waste package response to vibratory ground motion are identified in Table 1 - 1. Three key calculation reports describe the potential for mechanical damage to the <b>waste</b> package, fuel <b>assemblies,</b> and cladding from a seismic event. Three supporting documents have also been published to investigate sensitivity of damage to various assumptions for the calculations. While these individual reports present information on a specific aspect of waste package and cladding response, they do not describe the interrelationship between the various calculations and the relationship of this information to the seismic scenario class for Total System Performance Assessment-License Application (TSPA-LA).

A second array, consisting only of heaters, will be operated as a control to determine those effects due solely to heat. In addition to the radioactive and control arrays, a ribpillar located between the two arrays will be heated electrically around its base to produce significant information on salt flow characteristics at elevated temperatures.

These are planar waveguides with a thin-film organic coating on the face and inorganic solar cells attached to the edges.

40|$|There are now urgent {{challenges}} {{around the}} supply of resources, materials, food and water. For instance, urban farming is a new urban design trend in Europe, where food is produced and consumed locally. This paper reports on best practice of urban design principles in regard to material flows, material recovery, adaptive re-use of building elements and components (design for disassembly; prefabrication of modular components), and other relevant strategies to implement zero waste behaviour. Prefabricated multi-story timber building for inner-city living are setting new benchmarks for minimisation of construction <b>waste</b> and on-site <b>assembly.</b> However, the construction sector {{is still one of}} the main producers of waste, but does still very little in regard to waste minimisation, waste avoidance and recycling. In the context of design education, it's still widely unclear how to best introduce a clear and holistic understanding of these challenges and possible solutions into the curriculum of the education of architects, urban designers and product designers. One of the findings is that embedding 'zero-waste' requires strong industry leadership, new policies and raising awareness (education), for attitudinal change and the reduction of wasteful consumption...|$|R
40|$|With globalization, {{sweeping}} technological development, {{and increasing}} competition, customers are placing greater demands on manufacturers to increase quality, flexibility, {{on time delivery}} of product and less cost. Therefore, manufacturers must develop and maintain {{a high degree of}} coherence among competitive priorities, order winning criteria and improvement activities. Thus, the production managers are making an attempt to transform their organization by adopting familiar and beneficial management philosophies like cellular manufacturing (CM), lean manufacturing (LM), green manufacturing (GM), total quality management (TQM), agile manufacturing (AM), and just in time manufacturing (JIT). The main objective {{of this paper is to}} propose an optimal assembly method for an engine manufacturer’s assembly line in India. Currently, the Indian manufacturer is following traditional assembly method where the raw materials for assembly are kept along the sideways of conveyor line. It consumes more floor space, more work in process inventory, more operator's walking time and more operator's walking distance per day. In order to reduce the above mentioned <b>wastes,</b> lean kitting <b>assembly</b> is suggested by some managers. Another group of managers suggest JIT assembly as it consumes very less inventory cost compared to other types of assembly processes. Hence, a Multi-attribute decision making model namely analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to analyse the alternative assembly methods based on various important factors...|$|R
40|$|In this {{competitive}} world, {{any company}} has {{to fulfill its}} customer needs {{to survive in the}} market. Lean manufacturing is a technique that can be adopted in a company {{to improve the quality of}} its products, reduce the cost of the production and also deliver the products in less time. The goal of this work is to show the applicability of lean manufacturing’s body of knowledge in a screw air compressor manufacturing company. Here, the main objective is to evolve and test several methodologies to eliminate <b>wastes</b> in the <b>assembly</b> line as the company at present unable to meet the customer demand. A systematic approach is suggested for the implementation of lean principles to showcase that lean could be applied to the compressor assembly line to enhance the productivity thereby making the line more efficient. In the current assembly line there was no work standardization followed by absence of kaizen that has led to an increased assembly time. Thus with the help of lean tools and techniques such as 5 S, kaizen, standardization, visual management, poke yoke and string diagram the total cycle time has been reduced from 236 to 209 minutes. This reduction has benefitted the company in meeting the customer demand, increased profit and work satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese {{automobile}} {{industry has been}} hit sharply by the economic downturn of recent decades. The rise in costs and decline in sales have led to serious problems in the auto industry. In order to address these issues, most companies engage in downsizing and redesigning production operations. It is crucial to investigate the time <b>wasted</b> by replacing <b>assembly</b> boards occurring in manufacturing lines. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to provide an integrated approach, Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskih Zadatch (TRIZ), to providing efficient solutions for the {{automobile industry}}. The first step of this methodology is to detail the technical problems using the Function and Attribute Analysis (FAA) model. Secondly, a contradiction matrix and the inventive principle were applied to find the solutions. In this study, an auto part supplier named Sumi-Hanel located in Hanoi, Vietnam, was taken as a case study; the empirical results showed that waste time had been reduced to 67 %, nearly 8400 square meters was saved, and a 20 % cost reduction was achieved by reusing old frames.

The {{aim is to}} maximize the minor actinides and fission products transmutation rates, which is created from the operation of nuclear power reactors {{for the production of}} electricity. The transmutation system is composed of a natural lead target, beam window, subcritical core, reflector, and structural material. The neutrons are produced by the spallation reaction of protons from a high intensity linear accelerator in the spallation target, and the fission reaction in the core. It is used a hexagonal lattice for the <b>waste</b> and fuel <b>assemblies.</b> The system is driven by a 1 GeV, 10 mA proton beam incident on a natural lead cylindrical target. The protons were uniformly distributed across the beam. The core is a cylindrical assembly. The main vessel is surrounded by a reflector made of graphite.

40|$|The {{cost impact}} to the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System of using rod {{consolidation}} is evaluated. Previous work {{has demonstrated that}} the fuel rods of two assemblies can be packed into a canister that can fit into the same size space as that used to store a single assembly. The remaining fuel assembly hardware can be compacted into the same size canisters with a ratio of 1 hardware canister per each 6 to 12 assemblies. Transportation casks {{of the same size}} as currently available can load twice the number of assemblies by placing the compacted assemblies in the slots currently designed for a single <b>assembly.</b> <b>Waste</b> packages similarly could contain twice the number of assemblies; however, thermal constraints would require considering either a low burnup or cooling. The analysis evaluates the impact of rod consolidation on CRWMS costs for consolidation at prior to transportation and for consolidation at the Monitored Geological Repository surface facility. For this study, no design changes were made to either the transport casks or waste packages. Waste package designs used for the Viability Assessment design were employed but derated to make the thermal limits. A logistics analysis of the waste was performed to determine the number of each waste package with each loading. A review of past rod consolidation experience found cost estimates which range from $ 10 /kgU to $ 32 /kgU. $ 30 /kgU was assumed for rod consolidation costs prior to transportation. Transportation cost savings are about $ 17 /kgU and waste package cost savings are about $ 21 /kgU. The net saving to the system is approximately $ 500 million if the consolidation is performed prior to transportation. If consolidation were performed at the repository surface facilities, it would cost approximately $ 15 /kgU. No transportation savings would be realized. The net savings for consolidation at the repository site would be about $ 400 million dollars...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to estimate the probability of misloading a commercial spent nuclear fuel waste package with a fuel assembly(s) that has a reactivity (i. e., enrichment and/or burnup) outside the waste package design. The waste package designs {{are based on the}} expected commercial spent nuclear fuel assemblies and previous analyses (Macheret, P. 2001, Section 4. 1 and Table 1). For this calculation, a misloaded waste package is defined as a waste package that has a fuel assembly(s) loaded into it with an enrichment and/or burnup outside the waste package design. An example of this type of misload is a fuel assembly designated for the 21 -PWR Control Rod waste package being incorrectly loaded into a 21 -PWR Absorber Plate waste package. This constitutes a misloaded 21 -PWR Absorber Plate waste package, because the reactivity (i. e., enrichment and/or burnup) of a 21 -PWR Control Rod <b>waste</b> package fuel <b>assembly</b> is outside the design of a 21 -PWR Absorber Plate waste package. These types of misloads (i. e., fuel assembly with enrichment and/or burnup outside waste package design) are the only types that are evaluated in this calculation. This calculation utilizes information from ''Frequency of SNF Misload for Uncanistered Fuel Waste Package'' (CRWMS M&O 1998) as the starting point. The scope of this calculation is limited to the information available. The information is based on the whole population of fuel assemblies and the whole population of waste packages, because there is no information about the arrival of the waste stream at this time. The scope of this calculation deviates from that specified in ''Technical Work Plan for: Risk and Criticality Department'' (BSC 2002 a, Section 2. 1. 30) in that only waste package misload is evaluated. The remaining issues identified (i. e., flooding and geometry reconfiguration) will be addressed elsewhere. The intended use of the calculation is to provide information and inputs to the Preclosure Safety Analysis Department. Before using the results of this calculation, the reader is cautioned to verify that the assumptions made in this calculation regarding the waste stream, the loading process, and the staging of the spent nuclear fuel assemblies are applicable...|$|R
40|$|The Used Fuel Disposition (UFD) Campaign {{within the}} Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE) Fuel Cycle Technology (FCT) {{program has been}} tasked with {{investigating}} the disposal of the nation's spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level nuclear waste (HLW) {{for a range of}} potential waste forms and geologic environments. The planning, construction, and operation of a nuclear disposal facility is a long-term process that involves engineered barriers that are tailored to both the geologic environment and the waste forms being emplaced. The UFD Campaign is considering a range of fuel cycles that in turn produce a range of waste forms. The UFD Campaign is also considering a range of geologic media. These ranges could be thought of as adding uncertainty to what the disposal facility design will ultimately be; however, it may be preferable to thinking about the ranges as adding flexibility to design of a disposal facility. For example, as the overall DOE-NE program and industrial actions result in the fuel cycles that will produce waste to be disposed, and the characteristics of those wastes become clear, the disposal program retains flexibility in both the choice of geologic environment and the specific repository design. Of course, other factors also play a major role, including local and State-level acceptance of the specific site that provides the geologic environment. In contrast, the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) repository license application (LA) is based on waste forms from an open fuel cycle (PWR and BWR assemblies from an open fuel cycle). These waste forms were about 90 % of the total waste, and they were the determining waste form in developing the engineered barrier system (EBS) design for the Yucca Mountain Repository design. About 10 % of the repository capacity was reserved for waste from a full recycle fuel cycle in which some actinides were extracted for weapons use, and the remaining fission products and some minor actinides were encapsulated in borosilicate glass. Because the heat load of the glass was much less than the PWR and BWR <b>assemblies,</b> the glass <b>waste</b> form was able to be co-disposed with the open cycle waste, by interspersing glass waste packages among the spent fuel <b>assembly</b> <b>waste</b> packages. In addition, the Yucca Mountain repository was designed to include some research reactor spent fuel and naval reactor spent fuel, within the envelope that was set using the commercial reactor assemblies as the design basis waste form. This milestone report supports Sandia National Laboratory milestone M 2 FT- 12 SN 0814052, and is intended to be a chapter in that milestone report. The independent technical review of this LLNL milestone was performed at LLNL and is documented in the electronic Information Management (IM) system at LLNL. The objective of this work is to investigate what aspects of quantifying, characterizing, and representing the uncertainty associated with the engineered barrier are affected by implementing different advanced nuclear fuel cycles (e. g., partitioning and transmutation scenarios) together with corresponding designs and thermal constraints...|$|R
