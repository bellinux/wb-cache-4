30|$|The {{heart of}} the {{proposed}} solution <b>is</b> <b>an</b> algorithm <b>that</b> auto generates the new reduced Vietnamese paragraph from the logical expression. With the given requirement that the generated paragraph has to satisfy the universality in common Vietnamese communication, our algorithm in turn considers three consecutive predicates representing actions and states of instances. The algorithm compares two predicate pairs [predicate (1), predicate (2)] and [predicate (2), predicate (3)] in considered three predicates based on the sustainable priority factor which proposed by us. The pair having the higher priority {{will be used for}} generating the syntactic structure of a new Vietnamese sentence, then combined with lexicons for completing. The remaining predicate is handled in two ways: re-create the original Vietnamese sentence or combine consideration with next two predicates in the logical expression. The algorithm is performed based on our assumption <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>paragraph</b> has the natural quality if each sentence in this has the natural quality.|$|R

At the same time I wish to understand her on the basis of two sources, which she were written by herself. The contemporary book is Vivian Etting’s Margrete the First – a queen and her time (2009). The two sources are firstly Margrete’s letter to her husband, King Haakon (1370) and secondly Margrete’s letter to her foster son, King Erik of Pomerania (1405). My project includes short information about the background of Margrete’s time and also short information about Margrete’s life.

The semantic array programming paradigm [Comment] – “The main difference with respect to previous attempts is the program-ming approach which is based on freely available software and a “semantic array pro-gramming paradigm”.

40|$|Understanding {{why and how}} {{students}} interact with educational videos is essential to further {{improve the quality of}} MOOCs. In this paper, we look at the complexity of videos to explain two related aspects of student behavior: the dwelling time (how much time students spend watching a video) and the dwelling rate (how much of the video they actually see). Building on a strong tradition of psycholinguistics, we formalize a definition for information complexity in videos. Furthermore, building on recent advancements in time-on-task measures we formalize dwelling time and dwelling rate based on click-stream trace data. The resulting computational model of video complexity explains 22. 44 % {{of the variance in the}} dwelling rate for students <b>that</b> finish watching <b>a</b> <b>paragraph</b> of <b>a</b> video. Video complexity and student dwelling show a polynomial relationship, where both low and high complexity increases dwelling. These results indicate why students spend more time watching (and possibly contemplating about) a video. Furthermore, they show that even fairly straightforward proxies of student behavior such as dwelling can already have multiple interpretations; illustrating the challenge of sense-making from learning analytics...|$|R

40|$|A. Uncertainty: The {{requirements}} {{to characterize the}} key uncertainties and to perform quantitative probabilistic uncertainty analysis of rules involving costs over $ 1 billion are welcome. But I think <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> more <b>that</b> needs to <b>be</b> said here. Specifically, I recommend <b>that</b> you add <b>a</b> <b>paragraph</b> explicitly criticizing the practice of combining two or more conservative assumptions in the calculation of an “Alternative Estimate”of benefits, as {{has been done by}} EPA, for example in its economic assessment of the Clean Skies Initiative. By incorporating at least three conservative assumptions in one calculation, the Agency has produced an estimate of benefits <b>that</b> has <b>a</b> very low probability of being true. Or to put it differently, the Agency has focused on the uncertainties on the down side to the virtual exclusion of the uncertainties on the upside, thus producing a biased picture of the true uncertainty in the estimation of benefits. A formal probabilistic analysis of the uncertainties in the Base Estimate would almost certainly result in <b>an</b> upper bound <b>that</b> <b>is</b> higher than the Alternative Estimate. The Guidelines should explicitly rule out this approach to characterizing uncertainties. B.

30|$|In summary, {{character}} segmentation is {{a critical}} process as the OCR engine requires a segmented clean and upright binarized image of the character as its input. When there is a row of characters or <b>a</b> <b>paragraph</b> of article on the image, segmentation can {{make use of the}} contextual information. On the other hand, if there are only one or two characters on the image, the orientation of the character is difficult to obtain. For <b>a</b> <b>paragraph</b> of article, lexicon verification is used to improve the recognition accuracy. Therefore, OCR is good for recognizing <b>a</b> <b>paragraph</b> or <b>a</b> page of article. It can achieve high recognition accuracy on documents printed on a media with uniform background.|$|R
