40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{developing}} esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) for patients <b>with</b> Barrett's esophagus (<b>BE)</b> is approximately 0. 5 % per year. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> estimate and perceive their risk {{of developing}} EAC. DESIGN: Questionnaire study. SETTING: Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> who were undergoing surveillance endoscopy based on histologic and flow cytometric results. PATIENTS: A total of 192 patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Individual patients were asked to estimate the numerical risk to develop EAC for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> in general and for themselves. How patients perceived their own risk was measured {{on a scale from}} "very small" to "very large. " RESULTS: At least 1 question was filled out by 169 patients (88 % response). Sixty percent of respondents underestimated the numerical risk for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE,</b> in general, to develop EAC, while even more patients (69 %) underestimated their own risk. Most respondents perceived their own risk as very small or small (63 %). LIMITATIONS: Risk estimations may depend on the response scale used. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> underestimated the numerical risk and perceived their {{risk of developing}} EAC as (very) low.

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 27 June 1954, a CIA Lockheed P-38M Lightning {{attacked}} Puerto San José and dropped napalm bombs on the British cargo ship, , which was on charter to the U.S. company W.R.

On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by the Guatemalan air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun <b>with</b> <b>were</b> shot down by the Guatemalan army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: GQ 1 b {{antibody}} (GQ 1 b-Ab) {{is detected}} in approximately two-thirds of sera of patients <b>with</b> Bickerstaffs encephalitis (<b>BE).</b> Whilst {{some of the}} remaining patients have antibodies to other gangliosides, many patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> are reported to be seronegative. METHODS AND RESULTS: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibody (VGKC-Ab) at high titer was detected during the diagnostic work-up of one patient <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> Sera of an additional patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and nine patients with Miller Fisher syndrome (MF) (all GQ 1 b-Ab positive) were investigated for VGKC-Ab and other anti-neuronal antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation using 125 I-dendrotoxin-VGKC and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Two patients with MF exhibited moderate titer VGKC-Abs. Regardless of positivity for VGKC or GQ 1 b antibodies, serum IgG of all patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF reacted with the molecular layer and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in a distinctive pattern. CONCLUSION: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies might be involved in some cases of BE or MF. The common staining pattern despite different antibody results suggests {{that there might be}} other, as yet unidentified, antibodies associated <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} the coexistence of bronchiectasis (BE) and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in series of patients diagnosed primarily <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the characteristics of patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> associated <b>with</b> COPD included in the Spanish Bronchiectasis Historical Registry and compare them to the remaining patients <b>with</b> non-cystic fibrosis <b>BE.</b> We conducted a multicentre observational study of historical cohorts, analysing the characteristics of 1, 790 patients who had been included in the registry between 2002 and 2011. Of these, 158 (8. 8 %) were registered as BE related to COPD and were compared to the remaining patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> of other aetiologies. Patients <b>with</b> COPD <b>were</b> mostly male, older, had a poorer respiratory function and more frequent exacerbations. There were no differences in the proportion of patients with chronic bronchial colonisation or in the isolated microorganisms. A significantly larger proportion of patients with COPD received treatment with bronchodilators, inhaled steroids and intravenous antibiotics, but there was no difference in the use of long term oral or inhaled antibiotherapy. During a follow-up period of 3. 36 years, the overall proportion of deaths was 13. 8 %. When compared to the remaining aetiologies, patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> associated <b>with</b> COPD presented the highest mortality rate. The multivariate analysis showed that the diagnosis of COPD in a patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> as a primary diagnosis increased the risk of death by 1. 77. Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> related to COPD have the same microbiological characteristics as patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> due to other aetiologies. They receive treatment with long term oral and inhaled antibiotics aimed at controlling chronic bronchial colonisation, even though the current COPD treatment guidelines do not envisage this type of therapy.

40|$|Patients with Barrett 2 ̆ 7 s {{esophagus}} (BE) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are at {{a higher}} risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA).

5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there {{has not always been}} consensus on how it ate.

He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|E

5|$|In October 1200 Geoffrey {{refused to}} allow the {{collection}} of carucage, a tax on land, on his property, and his lands were confiscated in retaliation. He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire, James of Poterne, who had ravaged Geoffrey's lands in revenge. In November 1200, Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln's funeral, which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates, but the archbishop's continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart. In January 1201, John made peace with his half brother, {{but it did not}} last, as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected. John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard's reign, which forced Geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace, which occurred in May 1201. But it was short-lived; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out, but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of a few of his own candidates. Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese, with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement. Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements <b>with</b> <b>were</b> Guisborough Priory, Meaux Abbey, and Fountains Abbey. Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices, but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house.|$|E

5|$|The Komori Force {{was also}} {{directed}} to withdraw on 24February {{as part of}} the general Japanese retreat from western New Britain. The Japanese immediately began to leave their positions, and headed north along inland trails to join other units. The Americans did not detect this withdrawal until 27February, when an attack conducted by the 2ndSquadron, 112thCavalry and the Marine tank company to clear the Arawe area of Japanese encountered no opposition. The Director Task Force subsequently established a number of observation posts along the southern coast of New Britain and increased the distances covered by its reconnaissance patrols. Komori fell behind his unit, and was killed on 9April near San Remo on New Britain's north coast when he, his executive officer and two enlisted men they were travelling <b>with</b> <b>were</b> ambushed by a patrol from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, which had landed around Volupai and captured Talasea, on the Willaumez Peninsula, in early March.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds {{was accompanied by}} a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with Final Fantasy VII; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked <b>with</b> <b>were</b> Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.|$|E
5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy.

She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt <b>with</b> <b>were</b> coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.|$|E
