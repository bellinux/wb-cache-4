40|$|This thesis deals {{primarily}} {{with the air}} carrier's liability {{in the case of}} passenger death or bodily injury under <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System.</b> It analyzes the problems of today and tries to offer solutions for the present crisis of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> for the future. The first chapter concentrates on an brief introduction of the development of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> from the original Warsaw Convention, to the 1996 ICAO new draft instrument. The chapter gives the trend of development and explains the different characteristics of each Warsaw instrument. The second chapter analyses the shortcomings of the original Warsaw Convention by comparing the rationales of the air carrier's limited liability in 1929 and the requirements of today. In this way, this thesis seeks to present the limited liability of air carriers as unreasonable and out of date. In order to offer the suggestions and possible solutions for the future, the third chapter analyses the merits and shortcomings of the Warsaw Instruments, unilateral or group action, the ECAC recommendation, the IATA Intercarrier Agreement and its implementing Agreement, and the ICAO new draft instrument. Finally, for the integrity of the air carrier's liability, this thesis also briefly criticizes the shortcomings of baggage liability under the present <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> and offers a better solution for baggage liability in the future. In the last chapter, the author introduces the related legal regime of the Republic of China, compares it with the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> and attempts to develop a method to link the Republic of China with the rest of world in the field of private air law...|$|E
40|$|After {{international}} transportation by air {{became a}} reality, {{the need to}} fashion out an appropriate global regime to govern the new relationships created by this development led to {{the signing of the}} Warsaw Convention in 1929. As time went on, the need to adjust this original Convention to contemporary technological and legal realities necessitated the enactment of several other instruments that were not new Conventions in themselves, but were merely welded to the original 1929 Convention. With the absence of consolidation, the undesirable result was total confusion created by the concurrent operation of the multiple regimes of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System.</b> The overwhelming need to modernise and consolidate all instruments of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>system</b> into a single uniform text culminated in the signing of the Montreal Convention on 28 May 1999. This thesis attempts to x-ray the Montreal Convention in the light of its potentials to alleviate the numerous problems of the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>system,</b> including the prospects of its ratification. In the same vein, the inherent deficiencies and imperfections of this new instrument, which might militate against its ratification, have been overtly highlighted for reference. This treatise also analysed the need for developing and African nations to ratify the new convention notwithstanding that their interests were given minimal considerations. The conclusion is a call to all nations, particularly the US, to ratify this new convention without further procrastination, in order to enable it come into force without further delay, lest it become just another relic in the kitty of the very <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> that it sought to replace...|$|E

40|$|The Warsaw Convention {{represents}} {{the unification of}} important rules concerning private international carriage by air. The international community has agreed on those rules, ever since {{the appearance of the}} Warsaw Convention in 1929. Today, it would be chaotic for the air transport industry to operate without such a legal framework. In fact, the Warsaw instruments have been the pillars of harmonized international air transportation. However, the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> now faces a crisis, {{due to the fact that}} participants in the air transport industry consider the Warsaw Convention liability regime obsolete, inadequate and outdated. Both governments and air carriers have reacted against this obstacle by adopting unilateral actions in order to update the liability limits. Some of these unilateral actions have substantially increased the limits of liability; others have even considered their disappearance. In particular, IATA has recently adopted two agreements in which air carriers voluntarily waive the Warsaw Convention limits. At the same time, ICAO has presented for the approval of its Legal Committee, a draft text to modernize the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System.</b> The intention of this proposal is to replace the Warsaw Convention with a new instrument that would modernize and harmonize the liability regime and other matters...|$|E
40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that the current <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> should be modified, mainly because the {{compensation}} limit is too low. The most trenchant problem has been to maintain the concept of uniformity while different economic conditions have become increasingly {{the order of the day}} and to cope with the increasing disparity between industrialized and developing nations. Overview of the problems of the current system is made, using the KAL flight 007 case. This thesis explores the relationship between passengers and air carriers, which should be interpreted as a common interest. It also examines the term "unlimited" which, frequently, leads to confusion. Even though the purpose of "willful misconduct" is to provide higher compensation for the passenger, it would be better to interpret it as "no-limit" so as not to confuse it with unlimited liability (full-compensation). The present thesis next explores unlimited liability (full-compensation) as being unrealistic in practice in the international community. The rationale of Montreal Protocols No. 3 and No. 4 and their opponents' opinions are also examined. In conclusion, we will propose that the Montreal Protocols No. 3 and No. 4 are an acceptable solution to modernize the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System...</b>|$|E

40|$|On 31 November 2003 the 1999 Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air {{entered into}} force. Its {{purpose was to}} {{consolidate}} and modernize the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>system</b> and to reunify the provisions of several international instruments of private international air law under one legal instrument. The Montreal Convention consolidates the positive elements of the Warsaw Convention, the Hague Protocol, the Guadalajara Convention, the Guatemala City Protocol and Additional Protocol Numbers 3 and 4. It also simplifies and modernizes the requirements of documentation relating to the carriage by air of passengers, baggage and cargo. Most importantly, the Montreal Convention modernizes of the liability regime for death and injury to passengers by adopting the passenger liability regime in the IATA Inter-carrier Agreement. It also modernizes the liability regime for damage to baggage and cargo and the delay. In spite of the foregoing, the Montreal Convention fails to advance the unification of private international air law any further than the Warsaw Convention. This thesis analyzes the provisions of liability regimes under the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> and the 1999 Montreal Convention. Chapter one studies the liability regime established under the original Warsaw Convention and the subsequent attempts by states, air carriers and other interested entities to update it.

40|$|The Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air {{was adopted}} when {{aviation}} {{was in its}} developing stage. In order to protect this infant industry, the Convention limited the liability of the air carrier in international air transportation to certain specified amounts. As time went by the Warsaw Convention was amended by several instruments. The end result {{is that there are}} several instruments to regulate the liability of air carriers engaged in international air transportation and most of these instruments provide only limited recovery to passengers. Often, passengers try to break the limits prescribed by the Convention alleging willful misconduct {{on the part of the}} carrier, his servants or agents or by bringing suits against potentially liable third parties like the aircraft manufacturer or by proving that the documents of carriage were faulty. In the mean time, Italy and Japan took matters into their own hands and raised the limits unilaterally. While Italy raised the limits to 100, 000 SDR, Japan waived entirely the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>systems</b> limits of liability.

40|$|Article 17 in the Warsaw Convention 1929, {{the core}} {{provision}} to all liability for passenger injury and death, {{has been the}} most litigated Article of the Warsaw Convention. The main {{reason for this is that}} the Warsaw Convention, the axis of private international air law, unfortunately did not provide clear definitions regarding "accident" and "bodily injury" in the Article 17. Its amendments, the Hague Protocol 1955 and the Guatemala Protocol 1971, did not succeed in clarifying the meanings. Although the Montreal Conference 1999 witnessed strong debates regarding the amendment of Article 17, the Montreal Convention 1999 did not succeed in changing Article 17. Since the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System</b> did not provide definitions of "accident" and "bodily injury", each State has interpreted the two terms individually. Inconsistency in interpreting "accident" and "bodily injury" has emerged, since every State has a different jurisprudence. This phenomenon has created confusion in the international air transport community. In order to clear up the confusion, the International Civil Aviation Organization should amend Article 17 to specify and clarify the terms: "accident" and "bodily injury", while balancing the interests of all parties in the international air transport community...|$|E

40|$|At present {{there are}} several {{instruments}} that regulate air carrier's liability in international transportation. These international treaties are collectively known as the <b>Warsaw</b> <b>System.</b> Unfortunately, not all States are parties to the same instruments. In this thesis, four possibilities will be introduced for amendment of the System. These possibilities are as follows: ratification of the Guatemala City Protocol through the Montreal Protocol No. 3, an international treaty instrument, meant to update and amend the whole Warsaw System; the Italian solution, a national "remedy" taken without international consultations; the Japanese action, Japanese air carriers have waived entirely the Warsaw System's limits of liability; and finally, a recommendation to the EC Commission on a regional remedy {{in the form of}} a multilateral agreement where carriers raise the liability limits but otherwise the Warsaw provisions apply. Each possibility will be thoroughly examined in order to determine whether it is the best solution to the present crisis that the System is facing. At the end of this thesis one solution will be recommended for Iceland and other States to update the System. Other solutions are available but will not be discussed since they are not considered desirable for the aim of unification of air carrier's liability in international air carriage. What must be kept in mind when the four possibilities are being examined is that the aim of this thesis is to find a solution that unifies the air carrier liability regime and sometimes, in order to reach a uniform solution, a compromise must be reached.
