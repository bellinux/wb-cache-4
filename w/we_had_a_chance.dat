60|$|In the sixth, after {{a desperate}} rally, we crowded the bases {{with only one}} out. Then Mullaney's hard rap to left, {{seemingly}} good for three bases, was pulled down by Stone with one hand. It was a wonderful catch and he doubled up a runner at second. Again in the seventh <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to score, only to fail on another double play, this time by the infield.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 July, Tisza {{informed}} {{another meeting}} of the Crown Council that any attack on Serbia was bound to lead to [...] "intervention by Russia and consequently world war". On the same day, Kurt Riezler's diary has his friend Bethmann Hollweg saying: [...] "If the war comes from the East, so that we are marching to Austria-Hungary's aid instead of Austria-Hungary to ours, then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of winning it. If war does not come, if the Czar does not want it or France dismayed, counsels peace, then <b>we</b> still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of maneuvering the Entente apart over this action." ...|$|R

My friend killed one of them and I killed the other. It was unfortunate, but it was their lives or ours, and if we hadn't done it then, the thing would have happened again, and next time we might have been stabbed before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of defending ourselves." ...|$|E

60|$|On the {{way back}} to Stawell <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to see a group of {{boulders}} called the Three Sisters--a curiosity oddly located; for it was upon high ground, with the land sloping away from it, and no height above it from whence the boulders could have rolled down. Relics of an early ice-drift, perhaps. They are noble boulders. One of them has the size and smoothness and plump sphericity of a balloon of the biggest pattern.|$|E

The Duke of Burgundy is a hot brained, impetuous, pudding headed, iron ribbed dare all. He charges {{at the head of}} his nobles and native knights, his liegemen of Artois and Hainault; think you, if you were there, or if I were there myself, that we could be much farther forward than the Duke and all his brave nobles of his own land? If we were not up with them, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to be turned on the Provost Marshal's hands for being slow in making to; if we were abreast of them, all would be called well and we might be thought to have deserved our pay; and grant that I was a spear's length or so in the front, which is both difficult and dangerous in such a melee where all do their best, why, my lord Duke says in his Flemish tongue, when he sees a good blow struck, 'Ha! gut getroffen [well struck]! a good lance--a brave Scot--give him a florin to drink our health;' but neither rank, nor lands, nor treasures come to the stranger in such a service--all goes to the children of the soil." ...|$|E
60|$|The active {{young men}} of our party had been on shore long before us, and seized upon all the {{available}} horses in the town; but we relied upon a letter from Halil Pasha, enjoining all governors and pashas to help us in all ways: and hearing we were the bearers of this document, the cadi and vice-governor of Jaffa came to wait upon the head of our party; declared {{that it was his}} delight and honour to set eyes upon us; that he would do everything in the world to serve us; that there were no horses, unluckily, but he would send and get some in three hours; and so left us with a world of grinning bows and many choice compliments {{from one side to the}} other, which came to each filtered through an obsequious interpreter. But hours passed, and the clatter of horses' hoofs was not heard. We had our dinner of eggs and flaps of bread, and the sunset gun fired: we had our pipes and coffee again, and the night fell. Is this man throwing dirt upon us? we began to think. Is he laughing at our beards, and are our mothers' graves ill-treated by this smiling swindling cadi? We determined to go and seek in his own den this shuffling dispenser of infidel justice. This time we would be no more bamboozled by compliments; but we would use the language of stern expostulation, and, being roused, would let the rascal hear the roar of the indignant British lion; so we rose up in our wrath. The poor consul got a lamp for us with a bit of wax-candle, such as I wonder his means could afford; the shabby janissary marched ahead with his tin mace; the two laquais-de-place, that two of our company had hired, stepped forward, each with an old sabre, and we went clattering and stumbling down the streets of the town, in order to seize upon this cadi in his own divan. I was glad, for my part (though outwardly majestic and indignant in demeanour), that the horses had not come, and that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of seeing this little queer glimpse of Oriental life, which the magistrate's faithlessness procured for us.|$|E

60|$|It is {{singular}} {{to glance}} at the extracts from the European press {{at that time and}} to observe the delight and foolish exultation with which our reverses were received. That this should occur in the French journals is not unnatural, since our history has been largely a contest with that Power, and we can regard with complacency an enmity which is the tribute to our success. Russia, too, as the least progressive of European States, has a natural antagonism of thought, if not of interests, to the Power which stands most prominently for individual freedom and liberal institutions. The same poor excuse may be made for the organs of the Vatican. But what are we to say of the insensate railing of Germany, a country whose ally we have been for centuries? In the days of Marlborough, in the darkest hours of Frederick the Great, in the great world struggle of Napoleon, we have been the brothers-in-arms of these people. So with the Austrians also. If both these countries were not finally swept from the map by Napoleon, it is largely to British subsidies and British tenacity that they owe it. And yet these are the folk who turned most bitterly against us at the only time in modern history when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of distinguishing our friends from our foes. Never again, I trust, on any pretext will a British guinea be spent or a British soldier or sailor shed his blood for such allies. The political lesson of this writer has been that we should make ourselves strong within the empire, and let all outside it, save only our kinsmen of America, go their own way and meet their own fate without let or hindrance from us. It is amazing to find that even the Americans could understand the stock from which they are themselves sprung so little that such papers as the 'New York Herald' should imagine that our defeat at Colenso was a good opportunity for us to terminate the war. The other leading American journals, however, took a more sane view of the situation, and realised that ten years of such defeats would not find the end either of our resolution or of our resources.|$|E

"I can {{understand}} that after all your life looking at the captain as your father, and after {{he and his wife}} being everything to you, you would find it mighty hard to regard me in that way. I don't expect it, and I don't want it. If he is not your father by blood, he is your father in right of bringing you up and caring for you and educating you, and it is quite right and quite proper that you should always regard him so. You can look upon me, lad, just as a foster-father--as the husband of the woman who was for a time your nurse, and who would gladly repair the wrongs he did to you. I just say this, lad, to make things straight between us. I want us to be friends. I am an old soldier, and you a young one. We are comrades in this expedition. We have taken to each other, and would do each other a good turn if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> I don't want more than that, lad, and I don't expect you to give more. If I can lend you a helping hand on or off duty, you know I shall do so. So let us shake hands on it, and agree to let the matter drop altogether until this campaign is over. Then we will talk over together what had best be done. A few months longer of this life will do you no harm, and you will make all the better officer for having had two or three years in the ranks. But I will say at once that I think that you are wrong, now you know how the matter stands, in not writing at once to the captain and letting him know the truth. Still there is no harm in its standing over for the present. You must go through the expedition as you are now, and they would be no easier for knowing that you are exposed to danger out here than they are at present when they know nothing of your whereabouts." ...|$|E
