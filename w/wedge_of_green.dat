50|$|Traditionally, {{this dish}} is cooked with chicken, <b>wedges</b> <b>of</b> <b>green</b> papaya, and {{leaves of the}} siling labuyo chili pepper in broth flavored with ginger, onions and fish sauce. A common variant {{substitutes}} fish or pork for chicken, chayote instead of papaya, or with tomatoes and moringa leaves known as marungay or malunggay or kamunggay (in Cebuano), instead of pepper leaves. However, an all-vegetable broth in Cebu with kamunggay in prominence is called utan kamunggay or utan bisayâ, while it is called law-oy in Mindanao and laswa in Hiligaynon. Another variation is Tinolang Tahong, a soup made with mussels, ginger, onion, garlic and bird's eye chili.|$|R

2500|$|Excepting the {{shoreline}} of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a green belt, designated in 1957, which stretches from Dalmeny {{in the west}} to Prestongrange in the east. With an average width of [...] the principal objectives <b>of</b> the <b>green</b> belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas. Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston lie within the zone. Similarly, suburbs such as Juniper Green and Balerno are situated on green belt land. One feature <b>of</b> the Edinburgh <b>green</b> belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples <b>of</b> these independent <b>wedges</b> <b>of</b> <b>green</b> belt include Holyrood Park and Corstorphine Hill.|$|R
50|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Denver's special teams player Detron Smith ran full speed into the <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Green</b> Bay blockers, forcing Freeman outside, to his left. Freeman was hit {{as he held}} the ball exposed running {{sideways}} and fumbled, then Denver defensive back Tim McKyer recovered the ball at the Packers 22-yard line. Immediately, the Broncos tried {{to capitalize on the}} turnover by trying to throw for a touchdown, a pass intended for Rod Smith as he ran a post pattern following a fake handoff and a roll out by Elway, but Packers safety Eugene Robinson intercepted Elway's pass in the end zone and returned it to the 15-yard line.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{western society}} {{is based on}} a balance between private and public interests, the {{economic}} and the social spheres of life. However, in recent years this balance has been completely upset, in favour of the private and economic. This has driven six wedges between business and society, fueled by as many half truths: a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> distrust, generated by the idea of homo oeconomicus; a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> disconnection, generated by the idea that the goal of the firm is to create shareholder value (how can that engage organisational member?); a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> disconnection, caused by the view of leadership as heroic and separate from the file and rank; a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> discontinuity, consequence of the continuous attempt to cut the fat out of organisations, that rendered them anorexic and unable to plan for the future; and a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> disparity, caused by the rising tide of prosperity which actually left the poorest behind. To counter all this, the authors suggest trying to go back towards engagement, leaving selfishness behind and restoring the original balance...|$|R
