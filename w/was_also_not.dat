5|$|According to an unquoted {{source in}} The Outlaw Bible of American Literature, on June 3, 1968, at 9:00am, Solanas {{arrived at the}} Chelsea Hotel, where Girodias lived. She asked {{for him at the}} desk but was told he was gone for the weekend. She {{remained}} for three hours before heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> available.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel {{appended}} 32 {{names of}} soldiers he recommended for awards {{that had been}} ignored. Two New Zealanders recommended for a Bar to their Distinguished Service Orders (DSO) were not even mentioned in despatches and an outstanding Australian regimental commander recommended for the CMG <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> even mentioned in despatches, while a brigade commander and a staff officer Chauvel recommended for DSOs received mentions.|$|E
5|$|Hecht saw K-1 as a safer bet, {{given it}} had more {{international}} notoriety. He <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> {{a fan of the}} grappling aspects of MMA, but the UFC rebuffed his suggestion to change the rules of the sport to accommodate striking. Hecht credits Kevin Kay and his editorial collaboration with the UFC for highlighting the show's story lines, which he believes helped drive its ratings success.|$|E

5|$|While long {{thought to}} have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were once {{thought to have}} been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> useful for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{worked through the}} {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, {{it is unlikely that the}} Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced {{that the government had}} purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1932, {{but due to}} a {{shortage}} of funds, the design was gradually revised and cut back, and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937, with the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies completed later. The design featured façades of load-bearing brickwork faced with Portland stone. Holden's intention to adorn the building with sculpture <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> fulfilled. As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.|$|E

5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, it {{was decided}} by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be {{appointed}} a professor {{as part of a}} cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer Mr. Brown, is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E
5|$|Murphy was lent to MGM at {{a salary}} of $25,000 {{to appear in the}} 1951 The Red Badge of Courage {{directed}} by John Huston and adapted from the Stephen Crane novel. At the urging of Spec McClure and celebrity columnist Hedda Hopper, over the misgivings of producer Gottfried Reinhardt and studio executives Louis B. Mayer and Dore Schary, director Huston cast Murphy in the lead of The Youth (Henry Fleming in the novel). The preview screening audiences were not enthusiastic, causing Schary to re-edit Huston's work, eliminating several scenes and adding narration by James Whitmore. MGM trimmed advertising efforts on what they believed was an unprofitable film. What eventually hit the theaters was not a commercial success, and it <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> the film both Murphy and Huston believed they had made. Murphy unsuccessfully tried to buy the rights to the film in 1955 in an attempt to re-edit and re-release it. Huston tried to buy it in 1957, but was told the original negative of what he had filmed was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 2011, Neptune {{completed}} its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, {{although it did}} not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit. Because of {{the motion of the}} Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.|$|E

5|$|Porting Final Fantasy XI to the Xbox proved {{difficult}} due to compatibility issues {{greater than}} was hoped for between Xbox Live and PlayOnline, likely because {{the latter was}} designed first. After negotiation, Xbox 360 players were able {{to play the game}} through PlayOnline's servers exclusively, despite Microsoft's initial wish that Square Enix would use its own platform. Downloadable content <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> available on the platform since the game played through PlayOnline. It was hoped that content would eventually be offered through the Xbox Live Marketplace. Final Fantasy XII started out as a game designed for the PlayOnline game platform.|$|E
5|$|The British {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to force Baji Rao into a treaty. The treaty (The Treaty of Pune) was signed on 13 June 1817. Key terms imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle's guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British. These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the Narmada and south of the Tungabhadra rivers. The Peshwa <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> to communicate with any other powers in India. The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The Limousin breed <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>not</b> {{immune to}} the wave of Anglomania {{affecting}} France {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. Some wealthy farmers maintained Durham cattle, which were prized by the elite of the time. However, this practice was criticised by the agricultural society of Limoges. The society encouraged farmers to continue selecting animals that were most consistent with the characteristics of the Limousin breed, which was perfectly adapted to the region's environment, rather than trying to adapt other breeds. Furthermore, the vast majority of Limousin breeders could not afford to raise livestock in addition to their working animals, as was the case on larger properties that practiced crossing with Durham cattle.|$|E
