They discussed the moral legitimacy of the action, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was a theft or a sinCatholicism was strong in this region. But the Dominican priest and worker Jean Raguenès, who himself was close to Maoism, absolved the workers in advance.|$|E
500|$|In December 1955, a small anti-communist women's {{group in}} Southern California, the American Public Relations Forum (APRF), issued an urgent {{call to arms}} in its monthly bulletin. It {{highlighted}} the proposed text of the Alaska Mental Health Bill, calling it [...] "one that tops all of them". The bulletin writers commented: [...] "We could not help remembering that Siberia is very near Alaska and since it is obvious no one needs such a large land grant, we were <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> could be an American Siberia." [...] They said that the bill [...] "takes away all {{of the rights of}} the American citizen to ask for a jury trial and protect him from being railroaded to an asylum by a greedy relative or 'friend' or, as the Alaska bill states, 'an interested party'." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 4, 2006, {{a letter}} {{authored}} by Camacho was read {{before an audience}} gathered in protest before the federal prison in Guaynabo. In it {{the former director of}} the EPB questions why he was jailed again, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was for [...] "violating some colonial conditions", noting that he had been freely roaming for two years with no consequence. Camacho cites two reasons for his arrest, the first being that a congressional commission had been proposed to investigate the death of Ojeda Ríos and an separate incident involving the local press, assuming that he was detained to prevent him from testifying before this commission and relay information that he received about the FBI's operations in Puerto Rico. The second was to stop the momentum that the Consejo Nacional para la Descolonización was gaining in his view, claiming that this entity represented an obstacle to the free association movement which in his opinion seemed to [...] "prolong colonialism" [...] by retaining a collaboration with the United States.|$|E

500|$|Like Percy Bysshe Shelley’s [...] "To a Skylark", Keats’s narrator {{listens to}} a bird song, but {{listening}} to the song within “Ode to a Nightingale” is almost painful and similar to death. The narrator seeks {{to be with the}} nightingale and abandons his sense of vision in order to embrace the sound in an attempt to share in the darkness with the bird. As the poem ends, the trance caused by the nightingale is broken and the narrator is left <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was a real vision or just a dream. The poem reliance on the process of sleeping common to Keats's poems, and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] shares many of the same themes as Keats's Sleep and Poetry and Eve of St. Agnes. This further separates the image of the nightingale's song from its closest comparative image, the urn as represented in [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The nightingale is distant and mysterious, and even disappears {{at the end of the}} poem. The dream image emphasizes the shadowiness and elusiveness of the poem. These elements make it impossible for there to be a complete self-identification with the nightingale, but it also allows for self-awareness to permeate throughout the poem, albeit in an altered state.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not long}} before science-fiction writers picked up this evocative concept, often using it in a humorous vein. [...] Several have taken the thought {{experiment}} a step further, pointing out extra complications that could arise should the experiment actually be performed. For example, in his novel American Gods, Neil Gaiman has a character observe, [...] "if they don't ever open the box to feed it, it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead." [...] Likewise, Terry Pratchett's Lords and Ladies adds the issue of a third possible state, in the case of Greebo, [...] "Bloody Furious". (In Pratchett's later novel The Last Hero, Death attempts the experiment himself, but cannot understand the mechanics of it, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> implies that he will kill the cat just by looking at it.) In Will Grayson, Will Grayson, by John Green and David Levithan, the Cat makes an appearance as an analogy for Will and Jane's relationship.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the words}} of {{historian}} M.L. Bruce, both Thomas and Elizabeth [...] "developed feelings of dislike" [...] for their daughter Mary. In later years, Mary's romantic involvements would only further strain this relationship. Around 1520, the Boleyns managed to arrange Mary's marriage to William Carey, a respected and popular man at court. It was sometime after the wedding that Mary became mistress to Henry VIII (the exact dates as to when the affair started and ended are unknown), although she never held the title of [...] "official royal mistress," [...] as the post {{did not exist in}} England. It has long been rumoured that one or both of Mary Boleyn's children were fathered by Henry and not Carey. Some historians, such as Alison Weir, now question whether Henry Carey was fathered by the King. Few of Henry's mistresses were ever publicly honoured, except Elizabeth Blount, who was mentioned in Parliament and whose son, Henry Fitzroy, was created Duke of Richmond and Somerset in an elaborate public ceremony in 1525. Henry's relationship with Mary was so discreet that within ten years, some observers were <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had ever taken place.|$|E
