5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Dungeon of Doom and the Four Horsemen broke down {{as a result of}} Kevin Sullivan's feud with Horsemen member Chris Benoit. As a result, the Faces of Fear were booked to face Benoit and Steve McMichael, another member of the Four Horsemen, at Halloween Havoc 1996. Benoit pinned Meng to win the match for the Horsemen team. The Barbarian and Meng's next major appearance was at Starrcade 1996, when they faced Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, who were members of another rival heel stable known as the New World Order.

5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Italy in early September, the Eighth Army advanced rapidly. By {{the middle of}} October the army <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of Termoli, Campobasso and Vinchiaturo. German resistance had stiffened in the last stages of the advance. The Fifth Army captured Naples on 1 October and then crossed the Volturno against strong German resistance. By this point the Allies had run up against the fortifications of the Winter Line. The 15th Army Group commander Harold Alexander revised the plan for the winter, which involved the capture of the high ground north of Pescara after crossing the Trigno, Sangro and Pescara rivers. The Fifth Army would advance up the Liri Valley and when both armies were close to Rome, an amphibious operation would be launched south of the Tiber. To prepare for the offensive, the Allies advanced through the outlying Winter Line defences. The Eighth Army crossed the Trigno in late October and Montgomery planned to advance along the coast road to Pescara, which was the most defended route. Montgomery considered his four infantry divisions too weak to break the line without reinforcement.|$|E
5|$|Reyes {{received}} his first yellow {{card in the}} 76th minute, when he was late in tackling Silvestre after the French defender had played a backpass to Carroll. The break in play allowed Manchester United to make their first substitution, bringing on Fortune for O'Shea, {{who appeared to be}} struggling with a calf injury. With six minutes left in normal time, United won a corner on the left hand side, which Ronaldo played short to Scholes. Scholes returned the ball to Ronaldo, who crossed it into the penalty area, where Keane was unmarked at the back post. The ball eventually broke to the United captain, who shot, only to see four Arsenal players between him and the goal, ready to block his effort behind for another corner. Lehmann came to meet the second corner kick, but missed the ball, allowing it {{to go all the way}} through to Van Nistelrooy; the Dutchman headed the ball goalwards, but Ljungberg <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and headed it up onto the crossbar and away.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} of midpoints in chaos game at early iteration {{looked like a}} shapeless or chaos. However, at the thousands of iterations the collection will converge to the Sierpinski triangle pattern. In this article Sierpinski triangle pattern will be discussed by the midpoint formula and affine transformation, that is dilation operation. The starting point taken is not bounded within the equilateral triangle, but also outside of it. This study shows that midpoints plotted always converge at one of vertices of the triangle. The sequence of collection midpoints <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> segments that form Sierpinski triangle, will always lie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> segments at any next iteration. Meanwhile, a midpoint that <b>is</b> not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> segments, in particular iteration will <b>be</b> possible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> segments that form Sierpinski triangle.

25|$|The {{secondary}} feud {{heading in}} to Sin, was between Goldberg and Buff Bagwell. This feud began at Mayhem, where Goldberg hit a spear on the referee by accident after Luger pushed {{him in his}} place. Although this {{would have resulted in}} a disqualification, Goldberg won the match after a jackhammer. Luger would claim that Goldberg had lost via disqualification, which led to his desire of ending Goldberg's undefeated winning streak. This feud carried over to Starrcade where Goldberg's career <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> as he would be forced to retire if he had lost, although Goldberg was victorious. Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell would then form the tag team of Totally Buffed in December 2000, where they got Goldberg's WCW Power Plant trainer, DeWayne Bruce, involved in the feud leading to a match between the two sides at Sin.|$|E
25|$|Mayweather's next {{match was}} the long-anticipated fight against six-division {{champion}} and WBC light-middleweight titleholder Oscar De La Hoya on May 5, 2007.

However, Mayweather was outweighed by more than 10 pounds {{the night of the}} fight, coming in at only 150 pounds. Despite De La Hoya's insistence that money was not a factor, the Mayweather-De La Hoya bout set the record for most PPV buys for a boxing match with 2.7million households, breaking the previous record of 1.95million for Evander Holyfield-Mike Tyson II. About $120million in revenue was generated by the PPV, another record. Including percentages De La Hoya earned $58million for the bout, the highest purse ever for a fighter; the previous record was $35million, held by Tyson and Holyfield. Mayweather earned about $25million for the fight.|$|E
25|$|The 1969 Ohio State vs. Michigan {{football}} game {{is considered to}} be one of the best-known games of the series, as well as one of the biggest upsets in college football history. The Buckeyes went into the game as the top-ranked team in the country, with a 22-game winning streak under the direction of legendary head coach Woody Hayes. They were also defending national champions. The Wolverines went into the game under a new head coach, Bo Schembechler, who was trying to redefine a college football power that had fallen on hard times. Ohio State was playing for its second straight national title, while Michigan was playing for the Rose Bowl, and the championship of the Big Ten Conference <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The game was witnessed by a (then) stadium-record crowd of 103,588 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, and began the highly combative stretch of the rivalry informally known as The Ten Year War.|$|E

25|$|The two started wearing {{identical}} {{outfits and}} develop the ”Fun loving pretty boy” gimmick they would be known for throughout their time together. After wrestling on {{the lower end of}} the card to get the fans familiar with the team the Midnight Rockers soon moved onto a feud with the team of Doug Somers and Buddy Rose who at the time were one of the top teams in the promotion. Their initial outing with Somers and Rose at the WrestleRock stadium show on April 20, 1986 did not go well for Jannetty and Michaels who lost in front of 22,000 fans. When Somers and Rose beat Scott Hall and Curt Hennig for the AWA World Tag Team Championship the Midnight Rockers suddenly found themselves chasing the main tag team title of the promotion. The Midnight Rockers teamed up with Curt Hennig to defeat Somer, Rose and Alexis Smirnoff at ”Battle by the Bay” on June 28, 1986 to prove that they were indeed capable of beating the champions. The Midnight Rockers would repeatedly challenge Somers throughout the rest of 1986 but never quite be able to get the win when the title <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Finally near the end of that year, Jannetty and Michaels defeated the champions in a ”non-title” Steel cage match on December 25, 1986 on the AWA’s ”Brawl in St. Paul” show. A month later on January 27 1987 the Midnight Rockers defeated Rose and Somers for the AWA Tag Team title. Jannetty and Michaels realized that the AWA was a promotion in decline, in fact it would shut down completely by 1990, and they decided that their best bet was to work for the WWF. The Midnight Rockers got an offer from Vince McMahon while holding the AWA Tag Title. The Midnight Rockers even signed with the WWF while still holding the gold, necessitating the quick title change to the unproven duo of Boris Zhukov and Soldat Ustinov on May 25, 1987.|$|E

[...] He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required {{to stand in front of}} the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. [...] Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.|$|E
