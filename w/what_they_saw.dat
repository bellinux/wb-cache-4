5|$|In {{response}} to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as the radically anti-business {{views of the}} Aberhart government and the Social Credit Board, Alberta's mainstream opposition parties—chiefly the Liberals and the Conservatives—began to cooperate {{under the auspices of}} the newly formed People's League.|$|E
5|$|All {{surviving}} medieval {{accounts of}} the movement are by supporters of reform, who strongly condemned <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as the corruption and religious inadequacy of the secular clergy, but historians {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries have increasingly seen these accounts as unfairly biased against the secular clergy.|$|E
50|$|Neither Borsellino nor Falcone had {{intended}} {{to get involved in}} the struggle against the Mafia. They were assigned cases involving the Mafia that continued to expand and became disturbed by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> discovered. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> colleagues murdered fighting the Mafia and it became increasingly impossible to turn back.|$|R
50|$|The Astrologer comes {{again before}} the curtain and announces {{the end of}} his story, {{reminding}} the public that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> just <b>saw</b> was “merely illusion,” that only he and the tsaritsa were mortals and real.|$|R

5|$|During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies against <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> {{as their}} {{potential}} enemy, Britain. The Russian blue-water navy {{was stationed in}} San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke out between the United States and Britain. This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|In New River, Cooley {{sustained}} {{himself as}} a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling arrowroot. His fortune and influence grew: {{he became the first}} lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser. Local Indians held him responsible for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as a misjudgment involving the murder of one of their chiefs, and attacked the settlement in revenge on January 4, 1836.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism was {{supported}} by a variety of groups, including the American Legion and various other anti-communist organizations. One core element of support was a variety of militantly anti-communist women's groups such as the American Public Relations Forum and the Minute Women of the U.S.A.. These organized tens of thousands of housewives into study groups, letter-writing networks, and patriotic clubs that coordinated efforts to identify and eradicate <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as subversion.|$|E
60|$|So far he {{had been}} going about with this gun under his arm, {{and a sense of}} lordly {{security}} in his mind, but <b>what</b> if <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the gun and decided to ambush him? Goat Island is nearly all cover, trees, rocks, thickets, and irregularities.|$|R
50|$|Investigations must {{result in}} notes being kept {{and given to}} the employee. They cannot just consist of uncorroborated {{anonymous}} informants; sometimes the employee will be entitled to know his accusers and the accusations, although the employee is not entitled to know everything {{as long as he}} knows the accusation. Anonymous accusers are easy to attack anyway as there may be questions around grudges, ability to have seen <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> and how <b>they</b> remember details. An employee is rarely entitled to cross-examine accusers.|$|R
60|$|The {{king and}} his {{minister}} {{had never seen anything}} like <b>what</b> <b>they</b> then <b>saw.</b> <b>They</b> could hardly believe it was not all magic and enchantment. At the end of the feast each of the guests was given a present of great value, and was sent away rejoicing. The king received a pearl as big as a marble; the minister a cup of wrought gold.|$|R
5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking farmers who protested <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> {{as a threat to}} their republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E
5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, {{although some of}} the others attempted to constrain <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw.</b> Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
25|$|Post Office murals {{and other}} public art, painted by artists in this time, can still be found at many {{locations}} around the U.S. The New Deal particularly helped American novelists. For journalists, and the novelists who wrote non-fiction, the agencies and programs that the New Deal provided, allowed these writers to describe about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> really <b>saw</b> around the country.|$|R
50|$|Two scenes {{could be}} {{exhibited}} in the rotunda simultaneously, however, the rotunda at Leicester Square {{was the only one}} to house two panoramas. Houses with single scenes proved more popular. While at Leicester Square, the audience walked down a long, dark corridor to clear their minds after viewing one panorama and before viewing the next. The idea was to have spectators forget <b>what</b> <b>they</b> just <b>saw,</b> leaving their minds blank to view the second scene.|$|R
50|$|The Theatremania.com critic wrote: At its conclusion, {{audience}} members {{may not know}} exactly <b>what</b> <b>they</b> just <b>saw</b> or <b>what</b> {{it was supposed to}} mean. Is Thom Pain a meditation on disappointment? An exercise in futility? Perhaps both. One thing is certain, however. Even if the piece is based on nothing, as its subtitle proclaims, its unconventional style makes it far more interesting than many other plays that are currently on the boards.|$|R
5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the newly minted Gang of Seven, railed against <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking scandal and Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii and directed by Takeo Oin. The story was written by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The game was not a commercial success, selling around 180,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2007, less than contemporary Mana games. While critics generally praised the graphics, they were dismissive of the plot, mixed on the actual gameplay and sharply negative on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as poor artificial intelligence and pathfinding inhibiting actual play.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 2009 about 250 {{protesters in}} Brisbane who {{expressed}} anger at Wotton's sentencing. The same week, similar rallies {{took place in}} major Australian cities and in Wellington, New Zealand. MUA workers in Sydney observed one minute's silence in solidarity. Speakers at a Brisbane rally argued that Wotton should {{have been given a}} bravery award for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as standing up to the racist oppression of Palm Islanders. Benefit concerts were also held in support of him.|$|E
50|$|The Dream or Al-Manam (المنام) is a 1987 Syrian {{documentary}} film {{by the director}} Mohammad Malas. The film is composed {{of a collection of}} interviews with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon during the civil war. The refugees were interviewed by Malas about <b>what</b> dreams <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> when <b>they</b> went to sleep. The film was shot between 1980-81 before the infamous massacre in Sabra and Shatila, where part of the film was set. It was only released in 1987.|$|R
60|$|Next day 'nothing {{particular}} happened.' Perhaps some of {{us would}} have regarded it differently. 'Passed a spar, but not near enough to see <b>what</b> it was.' <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> some whales blow; there were flying-fish skimming the seas, but none came aboard. Misty weather, with fine rain, very penetrating.|$|R
3000|$|... “What’s in a name? That {{which we}} call” an {{anonymous}} urban area “by any other name would look as” indefinite. A name cannot change {{the city and}} our connection with places. However, new terms for now-nameless sites would help to change people’s perception and their capability of seeing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> never <b>saw</b> before. The taxonomic geographer’s call for assigning new names to metropolitan sections’ typologies implies a political and ideological content. This is a radical approach and, in fact, it may become utterly rebellious! [...]...|$|R
5|$|Pope John Paul II celebrated mass {{over the}} train tracks leading to the camp on 7 June 1979. In the decades {{following}} his visit, controversies erupted over a group of Carmelite nuns founding a convent on the site and erecting a large cross originally used in the pope's mass. Protesters objected to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as Christianization of the site, while others argued that the cross's presence effectively recognized the camp's Catholic victims.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} panned by {{mainstream}} critics, particularly for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as its weak script and gratuitous violence. However, many horror genre critics were more positive, viewing {{the film as}} unpretentiously entertaining. The film topped the domestic box office on its opening weekend and was a major hit in Brazil, Russia, Germany, and Mexico. Its worldwide theatrical run gross exceeded $226 million for the production cost of $50 million. Due to the commercial success of the film, which was planned as {{the first part of}} a series, its sequel is currently in development.|$|E
5|$|The label {{was founded}} in 1996 in Durham, North Carolina by {{musician}} Kaia Wilson and artist/UNC photography professor Tammy Rae Carland, aiming to redress <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> {{as a lack of}} feminist record labels at the time. As well as a range of recording artists, the label was also heavily involved in other events that promoted feminist thinking and music, such as the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival – which led to some controversy in 1999 – and various art showcases. Mr. Lady closed down in June 2004.|$|E
50|$|In film, the {{aesthetic}} distance is often violated unintentionally. Examples might include a director's cameo, poor special effects, or perhaps blatant product placement - any can {{be enough to}} pull a viewer out {{of the reality of}} the film. David Mamet in On Directing Film asserts that any direct depiction of graphic sex or violence in film is an inherent violation of aesthetic distance, as audience members will instinctively make judgments {{as to whether or not}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> just <b>saw</b> was real, and thus be pulled out of the story-telling.|$|R
60|$|Here, then, are {{a number}} of localities in which the Mouse Apollo was adored, and where the old mouse-name lingered. That the mice were {{actually}} held sacred in their proper persons we learn from AElian. 'The dwellers in Hamaxitus of the Troad worship mice,' says AElian. 'In the temple of Apollo Smintheus, mice are nourished, and food is offered to them, at the public expense, and white mice dwell beneath the altar.' {109b} In the same way we found that the Peruvians fed their sacred beasts on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> usually <b>saw</b> them eat.|$|R
40|$|Although much {{research}} exists on student motivation, few studies speak directly with students or highlight their voices. In this grounded theory study, we inter-viewed and observed reluctant learners in an alternative {{high school to}} learn <b>what</b> factors <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as contributing to their school successes and failures. Themes emerging from the participants’words were echoed by themes found in motivation research. Building relationships with teachers, being interested in school assign-ments, and feeling competent to perform tasks were mentioned by the students as influencing their levels of engagement. The qualitative data suggested ways for teachers to create motivating learning environments...|$|R
5|$|The {{sequences}} set in 2029 and the stop-motion {{scenes were}} developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Junior. A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that {{the model of the}} structure was capable of doing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.|$|E
5|$|The two German governments {{promoted}} {{very different}} views of the border. The GDR saw it as the international frontier of a sovereign state– a defensive rampart against Western aggression. In Grenzer ("Border Guard"), a 1981 East German Army propaganda film, NATO and West German troops and tanks were depicted as ruthless militarists advancing towards East Germany. Border troops interviewed in the film described <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as the rightfulness of their cause {{and the threat of}} Western agents, spies and provocateurs. Their colleagues killed on the border were hailed as heroes and schoolchildren in East Berlin were depicted saluting their memorial.|$|E
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} became {{convinced}} that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw.</b> Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated {{examples}} of a universal error produced by mistaking an inference for the direct evidence of the senses, was the resistance made, on the ground of common sense, to the Copernican system. People fancied <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the sun rise and set, the stars revolve in circles round the pole. We now know that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> no such thing; <b>what</b> <b>they</b> really <b>saw</b> was a set of appearances, equally reconcilable with the theory they held and with a totally different one. It seems strange that such an instance as this of the testimony of the senses pleaded with the most entire conviction in favor of something which was a mere inference of the judgment, and, as it turned out, a false inference, should not have opened the eyes of the bigots of common sense, and inspired them with a more modest distrust of the competency of mere ignorance to judge the conclusions of cultivated thought.|$|R
