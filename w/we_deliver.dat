25|$|Rivers and {{daughter}} Melissa were contestants in 2009 {{on the second}} Celebrity Apprentice. Throughout the season, each celebrity raised money for a charity {{of his or her}} choice; Rivers selected God's Love <b>We</b> <b>Deliver.</b> After a falling out with poker player Annie Duke, following Melissa's on-air firing (elimination) by Donald Trump, Rivers left the green room telling Clint Black and Jesse James that she would not be in the next morning. Rivers later returned to the show and on May 3, 2009, she became a finalist in the series. The other finalist was Duke. On the season finale, which aired live on May 10, Rivers was announced the winner and hired to be the 2009 Celebrity Apprentice.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} abnormal premotor {{to motor}} (PMd-to-M 1) connectivity in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with repetitive {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (rTMS). We studied 28 patients off and on dopaminergic therapy and 28 healthy subjects. <b>We</b> <b>delivered</b> 5 Hz rTMS over M 1 before and after conditioning PMd with 5 Hz rTMS. In healthy subjects, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by M 1 -rTMS were facilitated and PMd-rTMS left MEPs unchanged. In patients, before PMd-rTMS, M 1 -rTMS induced no MEP facilitation, whereas after PMd-rTMS, it significantly facilitated MEPs only when patients were on therapy. In the second experiment, <b>we</b> <b>delivered</b> M 1 -rTMS under 3 different attention-demanding tasks: eyes closed, attention directed to the stimulated hand, and attention directed to the nonstimulated hand. In healthy subjects, a more pronounced MEP facilitation was present when subjects directed attention to the stimulated hand. In patients, the MEP facilitation was present when attention was directed to the stimulated hand only when patients were on therapy. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>delivered</b> M 1 -rTMS in patients on therapy while {{they were looking at}} the stimulated hand, before and after 1 Hz PMd-rTMS. PMd-rTMS reduced the attention-induced MEP facilitation. We conclude that in addition to abnormal M 1 plasticity, the reduced MEP facilitation in PD also reflects altered PMd-to-M 1 connectivity...|$|R

At {{least part of the}} increase in the perinatal mortality rate is due to the occurrence of unusual pathology peculiar to the increased number of non-national patients delivering in Ireland. Examples of these pathologies would be intrauterine syphilis and intrauterine malaria. In addition to unusual pathologies a large number of non-nationals {{have not been able to}} avail of antenatal care, due to their late arrival in Ireland.

60|$|We have {{observed}} that a species of greatness arises from the artificial infinite; and that this infinite consists in an uniform succession of great parts: we observed too, that the same uniform succession had a like power in sounds. But because the effects of many things are clearer {{in one of the}} senses than in another, and that all the senses bear analogy to and illustrate one another, I shall begin with this power in sounds, as the cause of the sublimity from succession is rather more obvious in the sense of hearing. And I shall here, once for all, observe, that an investigation of the natural and mechanical causes of our passions, besides the curiosity of the subject, gives, if they are discovered, a double strength and lustre to any rules <b>we</b> <b>deliver</b> on such matters. When the ear receives any simple sound, it is struck by a single pulse of the air which makes the ear-drum and the other membranous parts vibrate according to the nature and species of the stroke. If the stroke be strong, the organ of hearing suffers a considerable degree of tension. If the stroke be repeated pretty soon after, the repetition causes an expectation of another stroke. And it must be observed, that expectation itself causes a tension. This is apparent in many animals, who, when they prepare for hearing any sound, rouse themselves, and prick up their ears; so that here the effect of the sounds is considerably augmented by a new auxiliary, the expectation. But though after a number of strokes, we expect still more, not being able to ascertain the exact time of their arrival, when they arrive, they produce a sort of surprise, which increases this tension yet further. For I {{have observed}}, that when at any time I have waited very earnestly for some sound, that returned at intervals, (as the successive firing of cannon,) though I fully expected the return of the sound, when it came it always made me start a little; the ear-drum suffered a convulsion, and the whole body consented with it. The tension of the part thus increasing at every blow, by the united forces of the stroke itself, the expectation and the surprise, it is worked up to such a pitch as to be capable of the sublime; it is brought just to the verge of pain. Even when the cause has ceased, the organs of hearing being often successively struck in a similar manner, continue to vibrate in that manner for some time longer; this is an additional help to the greatness of the effect.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which noncontingent reinforcement (NCR), when used as treatment to reduce problem behavior, might interfere with differential reinforcement contingencies designed to strengthen alternative behavior.

Results showed that the NCR plus DRA intervention was associated with a decrease in SIB but little or no increase in appropriate mands. In a subsequent phase, when the NCR schedule was thinned while the DRA schedule remained unchanged, SIB remained low and mands increased. These results suggest that dense NCR schedules may alter establishing operations that result in not only suppression of problem behavior but also interference with the acquisition of appropriate behavior. Thus, the strengthening of socially appropriate behaviors as replacements for problem behavior during NCR interventions might best be achieved if the NCR schedule is first thinned...|$|R
