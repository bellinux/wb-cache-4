5|$|In 2012, the {{government}} of New York City installed <b>Wi-Fi</b> routers at 10 payphones in the city (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, and one in Queens) {{as part of a}} pilot project. The <b>Wi-Fi</b> was free of charge and available for use at all times. The <b>Wi-Fi</b> signal was detectable from a radius of a few hundred feet (about 100m). Two of New York City's largest advertising companies—Van Wagner and Titan, who collectively owned more than 9,000 of New York City's 12,000 payphones at the time—paid $2,000 per router, with no monetary input from either the city or taxpayers. While the payphones participating in the <b>Wi-Fi</b> pilot project were poorly marked, the <b>Wi-Fi</b> offered at these payphones was significantly faster than some of the other free public <b>Wi-Fi</b> networks offered elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In the US and Canada, nine {{variations}} of the third-generation iPad were offered, compared to six {{in the rest of}} the world, although some countries had only the <b>Wi-Fi</b> only model. Each variation was available with black or white front glass panels, with options for 16, 32, or 64GB of storage. In North America, connectivity options were <b>Wi-Fi</b> only, <b>Wi-Fi</b> + 4G (LTE) on Verizon, AT, Telus, Rogers, or Bell. For the rest of the world outside North America, connectivity options are <b>Wi-Fi</b> only (on the <b>Wi-Fi</b> model) or <b>Wi-Fi</b> + 3G (on the <b>Wi-Fi</b> + Cellular model), with the latter unavailable in some countries, as 4G (LTE) connectivity for the device is not available outside North America. The <b>Wi-Fi</b> + Cellular model includes GPS capability.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} share <b>Wi-Fi</b> {{credentials}} with other contacts via <b>Wi-Fi</b> Sense was removed; <b>Wi-Fi</b> passwords {{can still be}} synced between devices tied to the same Microsoft account.|$|E
5|$|HeartGold and SoulSilver {{can access}} the Nintendo <b>Wi-Fi</b> Connection to trade, battle, and {{interact}} with other players of the games, as well as players of Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. After completing a special <b>Wi-Fi</b> mission download on , the player can send a Deoxys to HeartGold and SoulSilver.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana {{features}} a local multiplayer option, where players can battle {{against each other}} using the progress they have made in the single-player game. There is no multiplayer support on the Nintendo <b>Wi-Fi</b> Connection service, though players {{can use it to}} access the <b>Wi-Fi</b> Heroes Ranking system to download additional maps, missions, and items.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DSi {{connects to}} the Internet via either its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g <b>Wi-Fi</b> or a Nintendo <b>Wi-Fi</b> USB Connector; both methods grant access to the Nintendo <b>Wi-Fi</b> Connection service. The DSi supports WEP, WPA (AES/TKIP), and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) wireless encryption; only software with built-in support can use the latter two encryption types, as they were {{not supported by the}} DS and DS Lite. Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional setup method, the first three profiles support WEP encryption, while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option, which supports WPA encryption. Under this advanced option, users may access the <b>Wi-Fi</b> Protected Setup method and configure proxy settings. The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup <b>Wi-Fi</b> connections. The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games, access to the Nintendo <b>Wi-Fi</b> Connection and DSi Shop, and may have location-specific content.|$|E
5|$|The {{device is}} {{available}} {{with either a}} black or white front glass panel and various connectivity and storage options.

5|$|In 2007, BART ran a {{beta test}} of <b>Wi-Fi</b> Internet access for travelers. It {{initially}} included the four San Francisco downtown stations: Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell, and Civic Center. It included above ground testing to trains at BART's Hayward Test Track. The testing and deployment was extended into the underground interconnecting tubes between the four downtown stations and further. The successful demonstration provided for a ten-year contract with WiFi Rail, Inc. {{for the services}} throughout the BART right of way. In 2008 the <b>Wi-Fi</b> service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube. BART terminated the relationship with <b>Wi-Fi</b> Rail in December 2014, citing that WiFi Rail had not submitted an adequate financial or technical plan for completing the network throughout the BART system.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the BBC and {{commercial}} radio operators launched RadioPlayer which allows over 400 radio stations to be listened to through its website and apps.

Networking {{was supported}} with two built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports. 802.11a/b/g/n <b>Wi-Fi</b> support (AirPort Extreme) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, {{whereas in the}} 2010 model and later <b>Wi-Fi</b> was standard. Bluetooth also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more PCIe graphics cards. More recent cards featured two Mini DisplayPort connectors and one dual-link Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card graphics memory available.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some of this}} {{directed}} topology is {{lost with}} the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as USB On-The-Go in smartphones, and USB-powered <b>Wi-Fi</b> routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables. See the USB On-The-Go connectors section below for a more detailed summary description.|$|E
