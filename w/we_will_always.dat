Sherwood, the playwright who served as president Roosevelt’s speech writer and information advisor. Direct programming began a week after the United States’ entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via a leased General Electric’s transmitter to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). Next step was the live broadcast to Germany, which was called Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") and was transmitted on February 1, 1942.

2500|$|The weaker {{form of the}} theorem can {{be proven}} from the undecidability of the halting problem as follows. Assume {{that we have a}} {{consistent}} and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers. Then we can build an algorithm that enumerates all these statements i.e. an algorithm N that, given a natural number n, computes a true first-order logic statement about natural numbers, such that for all the true statements {{there is at least one}} n such that N(n) is equal to that statement. Now suppose we want to decide whether the algorithm with representation a halts on input i. [...] By using Kleene's T predicate, we can express the statement [...] "a halts on input i" [...] as a statement H(a, i) in the language of arithmetic. Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an n such that N(n) = [...] H(a, i) or there is an n such that N(n) = ¬ H(a, i). [...] So if we iterate over all n until we either find H(a, i) or its negation, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> halt. This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem. Since we know that there cannot be such an algorithm, it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false.|$|E

We don’t want any Hindu women. We don’t want any Hindu children. It’s {{nonsense}} to talk about Hindu assimilation. The Sikh may be of Aryan stock; I always thought he was of Jewish extraction. He may be near-white though he does not look it. But we know him, and don’t want any more of him. British Columbia cannot allow any more of the dark meat {{of the world to}} come to this province. To deport these British subjects from India would be the wisest thing. These Sikhs are far too obtrusive. They are of no use to the country. British Columbia would be a hundred times better off without them. Certainly no more of them must be allowed to come." [...] Both Das and Kumar with the help of Surendramohan Bose and Hussain Rahim [...] had set to bring together the various Indian communities in terms of a united action, until it reached the climax in the Gadhar organisation. Bose had been sent to Japan by the Scientific and Industrial Association of Kolkata in 1906. On reaching Canada at the end of 1907, Bose had informed Sri Aurobindo on 26 December, that Bengalis were wrong in hoping for Japanese help in their nationalist movement, although they had some sympathisers. Specialised in chemistry, he also toured as a lecturer on Indian subjects. In 1913 he became the general secretary of the Hindustan Association of the USA. Shortly before leaving America, in 1913, [...] from Chicago, he sent to Harnam [...] notes and formulae of his own for making bombs. [...] In January 1914, Bose wrote again from Paris along with [...] "a valuable copy of the process used by the Russian Revolutionists..." [...] Having visited revolutionaries in Paris and Geneva, Bose reached India in February 1914. [...] Harnam Singh (of Sahri) was the other important revolutionary who shared with them this patriotic task : a former trooper of the 4th Cavalry in India, he had gone to China in 1904 and, three years later, reached Canada with Kumar. In 1908-1909 he attended school at Seattle, and went to Vancouver as Kumar’s guest. In a letter to Das, in July 1913, Kumar described Harnam {{as the leader of the}} revolutionary movement in Vancouver. Owing to his friendship with Harnam, Baba Gurdit Singh of the Komagata Maru affair knew well this zealous group and, prior to his expedition, had received from Das names and addresses of the leading Jugantar figures like Atulkrishna Ghose and Satish Chakravarti who worked under Jatindranath Mukherjee.
