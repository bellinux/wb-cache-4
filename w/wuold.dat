On examination of the results serious and frequent defects as a whole. Some were due to lack of maintenance and assistance, others to errors in planning and installations, and still others were by an irrational use of the installations {{on the part of the}} agricu 1 tural operators. All this has shown that it <b>wuold</b> be desireble to consider: certification of the milking machine installations; more widespread controls on farms, to be carried out annually; the teaching of reational milking techinnques to agricultural operators...|$|E
40|$|What {{popular music}} can {{teach us about}} certain issues- such as ethnic {{discrimination}} and the social constructedness of racial categories- is the subject in George Lipsitz's Footsteps in the Dark: The hidden Histories of Popular Music, a book in which Lipsitz calls for "reading popular music as history and interpreting history though popular music". Addressing a rich counterpoint of musical cultures and sociopolitical questions with the authors characteristic candor, commitment and acuity, Footsteps in the Dark is a volume few scholars other than Lipsitz <b>wuold</b> have been able, or willing to write. Footsteps in the Dark adds to a corpus that has firmly established Lipsitz {{as one of the}} seminal and most widely influential scholars in the fields and subfields of cultural studies...|$|E
40|$|Effects of conceptus-derived {{substances}} on the angiogenesis of {{the corpus}} luteum (CL) {{were examined in}} pregnant rats. Labeling index (LI), the ratio of endothelial cells which labeled with bromodeoxyuridine, {{was used to evaluate}} angiogenesis. In pregnant rats with 10 or more conceptuses (Fc group), LI increased rapidly from day 12 to day 14 of pregnancy, whereas in the rats whose sonseptus number was reduced to one on day 7 (D 7 asp group) or day 12 (D 12 asp group) of oregnancy, there was no increase in LI on day 14 of pregnancy. Subcutaneous implantation of testosterone capsules, a major placental hormone which is converted to estrogen in the CL, between day 12 and 14 of pregnancy increased LI values only in the D 12 asp group but not in the D 7 asp group. The nuclear contant of estrogen receptor, which was determined by the EIA using a specific monoclonal antibody, was also increased by testosterone treatment in the D 12 asp group, but not in the D 7 aso group. These results indicated that the conceptus-derived substances <b>wuold</b> stimulate the ability of the CL respond to estrogen between day 7 and day 12 of pregnancy, which would be essential for the CL to develop its angiogenesis after day 12 of pregnancy...|$|E
