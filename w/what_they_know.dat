5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> about other galaxies; {{it is difficult to}} observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E

25|$|Derivation by affix greatly expands a speaker's vocabulary, {{sometimes}} beyond <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> {{in their}} native language. For instance, the English word ommatidium (a single lens of a compound eye) is rather obscure, but a child {{would be able to}} coin an Esperanto equivalent, okulero, from okulo 'an eye' (or perhaps, more precisely, okularero, by first coining okularo for 'a compound eye'). In this way the Esperanto root vid- (see) regularly corresponds to some two dozen English words: see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for some of these concepts.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{the other}} three of the “Big Four,” PwC {{is said to have}} a “less competitive” atmosphere. According to one observer, the core to the {{business}} is how the firm values and promotes “difference by building an environment where everyone can be themselves.” The company employs large numbers of young workers, with 80 percent of their work-force millennials. PwC uses education to bridge the culture gap between generations. The firm also implements the “Connect-Embed-Improve plan to promote employee engagement. PwC relies on employees sharing of knowledge and learning. Senior staff facilitate learning. Teaching the next generation <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> is one of the keys that ensures that PwC can bring value to its clients.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{investigation}} of eastern women’s lives, {{they found that}} though the GDR’s socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, {{there had been no}} women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler’s, has allowed women’s historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn’t too difficult, but the challenge is in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> from the works.|$|E

25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. Early reading {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes {{all the words}} the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing {{on the principle of}} linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E
25|$|After Michael returns, {{he becomes}} the new Don, with Vito retiring, and shortly thereafter, dying. Michael {{promotes}} Aldo to Caporegime. Learning the FBI are conducting {{an investigation into the}} Corleones, Michael sends Aldo and Monk to find out <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know.</b> When Aldo arrives at the hotel used by the FBI, Monk tells him Michael has learned a Corleone informant is meeting with the FBI at that moment, and they are to kill him. They storm the hotel, and Monk kills a lone FBI agent, before fleeing. Aldo realizes that Monk himself is the informant. Michael calls, telling Aldo he knew there was an informant but was unsure if it was Monk or Aldo, and the job was a ruse to smoke out the culprit. Aldo pursues Monk, who explains he became disillusioned in the Corleones after Frankie's death, and allied with the Cuneo family. Furious with Monk's betrayal, Aldo kills him.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being {{in the right place}} at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [...] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence.

500|$|Coppola {{comes from}} a family of film-makers and actors, and she has said how {{childhood}} memories of living in hotels partially inspired her choice of setting. Somewhere presents a detailed portrait of life in that industry and charts its existential and emotional boundaries. While celebrity gossip websites inform us of the shallowness of much of [...] "star life", Coppola's feature differs in its emotional depth. She wanted to depict Marco working, but not on a film set. Instead he is shown giving interviews, being photographed, attending an awards ceremony in Italy, and having special effects make-up applied. When Marco attends the special-effects department his face is covered in latex, the camera then very slowly, hypnotically zooms in. Marco is obliged to use his [...] "star" [...] recognition to help promote his new film, when his publicist calls he becomes passive and mechanically takes the arranged chauffeured car and speaks to the press. In part, the humor derives from Marco's subdued response to these attentions, and Coppola's off-beat observation of people around him. At the Venice film festival, critics highlighted the repetition of characters in a cloistered existence in Coppola's films, to which she responded [...] "I feel like everyone should tell <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> in the world that they know".|$|E

The MythBusters still commonly consult with experts for myths or topics for which they need assistance. These topics include firearms, for which they mostly consult Lt. Al Normandy of the South San Francisco Police Department, and explosives, for which they consult retired FBI explosives expert Frank Doyle and Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. The MythBusters often ask other people, such as those supplying the equipment being tested, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> about the myth under investigation.

2500|$|Although Hume leaves {{open the}} {{possibility}} for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history: He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so {{for the benefit of}} their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in [...] "ignorant and barbarous nations" [...] and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> to be natural events. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} book, Rowling {{establishes}} that Voldemort hates non-pure-blood wizards, despite being a half-blood himself.

[...] In the same year, Rowling became more precise about Voldemort. She began to link him to real-life tyrants, describing him as [...] "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering". In 2004, though, Rowling said that she did not base Voldemort on any real person. In 2006, Rowling told an interviewer that Voldemort at his core has a human fear: the fear of death. She said: [...] "Voldemort's fear is death, ignominious death. I mean, he regards death itself as ignominious. He thinks that it's a shameful human weakness, as you know. His worst fear is death." ...|$|E
