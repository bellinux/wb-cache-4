In June 2003 the Treasury indicated the tests had not been passed.|$|E
5|$|Labour MPs criticised Key for not {{releasing}} {{specific policy}} information at their annual conference. Key responded that National <b>would</b> <b>set</b> its own policy agenda {{and that there}} was adequate time before the next election for voters to digest National Party policy proposals.|$|E
5|$|The second {{spirit to}} be {{contacted}} {{identified himself as}} Sunex Amures, and claimed that he <b>would</b> <b>set</b> fire to the rectory at nine o'clock that night, 27 March 1938. He also said that, at that time, the bones of a murdered person would be revealed.|$|E

5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides. An open space for worshiping was on the camp meeting site, and it was surrounded by more tents. When this area was filled up, more people <b>would</b> <b>set</b> up tents along the avenues that radiated outward from the camp.|$|E
5|$|As Balch {{finished}} his formal education early, he compensated through self-improvement, even cycling to London to buy books. He {{is known for}} discovering new caving techniques and carefully recording his finds. Balch would spend his free time on Saturdays and after work on caving expeditions, although he would not do any caving on Sundays, for religious reasons. He <b>would</b> <b>set</b> out for some expeditions directly after work, caving overnight and coming home in time to wash before returning to work.|$|E
5|$|Bruce led the Australian {{delegation}} to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements <b>would</b> <b>set</b> the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European Common Market in 1973.|$|E

I am {{exceeding}} unhappy at our not joining at Weelind , but don't know that either of us are to blame, the militia with us continue to desert, and consequently I cannot remain long in one place otherways should be happy in forming a junction here.... I shall move on slowly for the reasons before recited and you will use the greatest industry as you cannot possibly pass us without our knowledge. I have suffered much lately but you again encourage me.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, the Belgian {{government}} {{signed the}} Atlantic Charter in London alongside other governments in exile, presenting the common goals which the Allies sought to achieve after the war. A year later, the government signed the Declaration by United Nations in January 1942, with 26 other nations, which <b>would</b> <b>set</b> {{a precedent for}} {{the foundation of the}} United Nations Organisation in 1945.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Yusuf Pasha's request, the Ottoman government sent its instructions to Rhodes, where {{they arrived at}} the end of April. The government <b>would</b> <b>set</b> up an official investigatory commission before which representatives of the Jewish and Greek communities were ordered to present their evidence. In mid-May, the government sent orders to release the six remaining Jewish prisoners. On May 21, they were ceremoniously called before the court (shura) and freed under the guarantees of the elders of the Jewish community.|$|E

5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old Ã©pater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that <b>would</b> <b>set</b> the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it <b>would</b> <b>set</b> would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2001, Judah {{defeated}} Allan Vester by third-round knockout in {{his fifth}} successful {{defense of the}} IBF title. In round two, Judah put Vester down to the canvas twice. In the third round, Judah knocked out Vester with a left hand that connected on Vester's temple. Vester went {{down on his knees}} and nearly lost his mouthpiece. The referee stopped the fight right before the closing bell. The fight <b>would</b> <b>set</b> up a unification match between Judah and WBC and WBA Light Welterweight Champion Kostya Tszyu, who defeated Oktay Urkal on the undercard.|$|E

5|$|Petterson's {{compulsory}} {{delivery of the}} talking points based on faulty U.S. intelligence <b>would</b> <b>set</b> the stage for strained relations between Washington and Khartoum that lasted well into Carney's early tenure as ambassador. In late 1995, Carney was also asked to deliver a similar non-paper message {{based on what he}} would later recount as having been poorly sourced U.S. intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Sleaze-busting package: Following {{the cash}} for honours scandal, Brown {{said he would}} reduce sleaze, {{which led to the}} belief that Brown would {{introduce}} a new Ministerial Code that <b>would</b> <b>set</b> out clear standards of behaviour for ministers. Brown said that he intended to strip the Prime Minister of some the powers conferred on it by royal prerogativeincluding the ability to declare war. This would give Parliament more powers and rights to vet and veto appointments to senior public positions, in a bid to eliminate cronyism.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars <b>would</b> <b>set</b> up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|The railway {{never had}} a timetable, and {{operated}} according to demand. Whenever one station had {{a sufficient number of}} passengers the driver signalled to the other station {{that he was about to}} depart, and the trains from both stations <b>would</b> <b>set</b> off simultaneously, passing at the halfway crossing loop. The journey took approximately five minutes. Outside of times of peak demand the full-length trains were generally not used, and the trains used split into their two-car sections. There was no depot: trains were stabled in the lower section of the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Vera, {{also known}} as the , was an {{exceptionally}} intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September1959, becoming the strongest and deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on the country. The storm's intensity resulted in damage of unparalleled severity and extent, and was a major setback to the Japanese economy, which was still recovering from World War II. In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects <b>would</b> <b>set</b> a benchmark for future storms striking the country.|$|E
5|$|COMIGAL {{dispatched}} inspection teams throughout South Vietnam {{to identify}} {{areas that were}} suitable for accommodating the new arrivals according to their professional skills. This required a search for arable land for farmers, favourable coastal areas for fishing and areas near large population centres for industrially oriented arrivals. Having identified the relevant areas, COMIGAL <b>would</b> <b>set</b> up plans for settlement subprojects, sending proposals to the USOM or the French Technical and Economic Cooperation Bureau to gain approval and funding. The bureaucracy was relatively low, with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval. Each subproject was given a nine-month deadline for completion.|$|E
