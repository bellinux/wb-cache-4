5|$|Family {{holidays}} usually {{were spent}} with the Waugh aunts, at Midsomer Norton, {{in a house}} lit <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> lamps, a time that Waugh recalled with delight, many years later. At Midsomer Norton, Evelyn became deeply interested in high Anglican church rituals, the initial stirrings of the spiritual dimension that later dominated his perspective of life, and he served as an altar boy at the local Anglican church. During his last year at Heath Mount, Waugh established and edited The Cynic school magazine.|$|E
5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized {{country by}} the {{standards}} of Britain, Germany or the United States. A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments <b>with</b> <b>oil,</b> discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E

5|$|Peak oil, {{an event}} based on M. King Hubbert's theory, {{is the point}} in time when the maximum rate of {{extraction}} of petroleum is reached, after which {{it is expected to}} enter terminal decline. Peak oil theory is based on the observed rise, peak, fall, and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over time. It is often confused <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> depletion; however, peak oil is the point of maximum production, while depletion refers to a period of falling reserves and supply.|$|E
5|$|Repairs and {{alterations}} of {{the power}} plant continued until 1904, when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> fuel and convert Rostislav to coal in 1904 and 1905. Each round of repairs and alterations added more weight to the already overweight ship, and by 1907 the ship's belt armor was completely below the waterline.|$|E
5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one of the closest races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha blew a seal and sprayed the bike <b>with</b> <b>oil.</b> His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to the starting line with his gloves coated <b>with</b> <b>oil,</b> causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along with a crash by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|E

Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 22–34 by 8–9μm. The fusiform (fuse-shaped) cystidia are colourless <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> droplets, and have dimensions of 40–50 by 7–8μm.

5|$|When the {{generator}} building first went into operation, it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6,600 volts, operating at 225 rpm and producing 3 phase 60 cycle AC.

5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> wells and refineries constructed throughout the state. Galveston's direct {{role in this}} boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries on the island itself (though for a time oil was shipped through the island). Nevertheless, wealth {{brought on by the}} boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and other communities. Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston became even more tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, in the first two decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E

5|$|Braathens Helikopter was a pure {{helicopter}} airline, with a {{main base}} at Stavanger Airport, Sola and a secondary base at Bergen Airport, Flesland. It operated seven Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters, each with nineteen seats. They were used exclusively on long-term contracts <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> companies to ship crews to their oil platforms in the Norwegian {{sector of the}} North Sea. The company employed at the most 120 people, was owned by Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi, and was a sister company of Braathens SAFE. The airline served seven oil fields: Ekofisk, Gullfaks, Gyda, Oseberg, Ula, Valhall, Veslefrikk. These were on contract with Amoco, British Petroleum, Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil. The company had a 30% market share before it was sold.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, {{production}} in the East Texas Oil Field and oil prices stabilized.

As western Texas and the panhandle region began to be more fully explored, the Permian Basin gradually became the top producing area of the state. Though independent oil companies were still {{an important part of the}} industry for some time, the major new strikes were increasingly made by established companies.
