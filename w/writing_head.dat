The perpendicular remanence is not large enough to explain the difference between the in-plane remanence acquired from the head and the remanence acquired in a magnet. The perpendicular component of the field from the <b>writing</b> <b>head</b> is shown to have two adverse effects on the remanence of the tape.

40|$|Abstract—Electron beam {{lithography}} {{has shown}} great promise in photomask fabrication; however, its successive heating process centralizing {{in a small}} region may cause a severe problem of critical dimension (CD) distortion. Consequently, subfield scheduling that reorders the sequence of the writing process is needed to avoid successive writing of neighboring subfields. In addition, the writing process of a subfield raises the temperature of neighboring regions and may block other subfields for writing. This paper presents the first work to solve the subfield scheduling problem while considering blocked regions by formulating the problem into a constrained maximum scatter traveling salesman problem (constrained MSTSP). To tackle the constrained MSTSP that can {{be shown to be}} NP-complete in general, we identify a special case thereof with points on two parallel lines and solve it optimally in linear time. We then decompose the constrained MSTSP into subproblems conforming to the special case, solve each subproblem optimally and efficiently by a graph-based algorithm, and then merge the subsolutions into a complete scheduling solution. We also extend our algorithm to handle the cases when the moving time of an e-beam <b>writing</b> <b>head</b> is comparable with the writing time of a subfield.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} recording industry is {{keeping up with}} the ultra high demand of high capacity hard drives by improving the areal recording densities of these devices. Such imposing advancement in utilization and performance is due to successive scaling in the geometrical dimensions of the device. This progression has been truncated by the fundamental limit known as the superparamagnetic limit which occurs when bits of digital data are aggressively decreased that ambient heat demagnetizes them, leading to loss of the stored data. To overcome this problem, the use of large magnetic anisotropy energy density alloys is compulsory, but the write fields that are required by these alloys are prohibitively large, rendering these media effectively unwritable. Fortunately, heat assisted {{magnetic recording}} (HAMR) enables the use of the smallest possible thermally stable grains, irrespective of the ultra-large intrinsic anisotropy. HAMR exploits the substantial drop of coercivity of ferromagnetic material to a level attainable by the magnetic <b>writing</b> <b>head</b> when the disk temperature is elevated close to its Curie level, consequently enhancing the areal density dramatically.

The main objectives of this work are to investigate and develop a new servo pattern recording model, a new position sensor, actuator, servo controller used for submicron track positioning and following on a computer hard disk with ultrahigh track density, to increase its capacity. In this position sensor study, new modes of reading and writing servo information for longitudinal and perpendicular magnetic recording have been developed. The read/write processes in the model have been studied including the recording trackwidth, the bit length, the length and shape of the transition, the relationship between the length of the MR head and the recording wavelength, and the SIN of readout. lt has also been investigated that the servo patterns are magnetized along the radial direction by a transverse <b>writing</b> <b>head</b> that is aligned at right angles with the normal data head and the servo signals are reproduced by a transverse MR head with its stripe and pole gap tangential to the circumferential direction. lt has been studied how the servo signal amplitude and linearity are affected by the length of the MR sensor and the distance between the shields of the head. Such things as the spacing and length of the servo-pattern elements have been optimised so as to achieve minimum jitter and maximum utilisation of the surface of the disk. The factors (i. e. the skew angle of the head) affecting the SIN of the position sensor have been analysed and demonstrated.

40|$|The iron-group {{metals and}} alloys are of {{interest}} because of their excellent soft magnetic properties. They have found a wide application field in the storage technology, especially for reading/writing elements in the hard drive head, and in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Especially the CoFe system, which possesses the highest, among others, saturation magnetisation of 2. 45 T and a relatively low coercivity of about 2 × 10 ^- 5 T, is of interest. These properties are crucial for the further development in the storage technology. Electrodeposition is a very promising alternative to the physical vapour deposition techniques (PVD) to produce soft magnetic layers and microstructures. The advantage of electrodeposition in comparison to PVD processes {{is the fact that}} it is an inexpensive method. Moreover, electrodeposition is the most appropriate process for the <b>writing</b> <b>head</b> fabrication since it allows to deposit high aspect ratio layers with a thickness ranging from a few monolayers up to more than 1 um onto a complex geometry substrate. A superposition of an external magnetic field during the electrodeposition can affect the deposit properties. Mainly the morphology of the deposited layers is influenced. This is mostly caused by the Lorentz force driven convection, i. e. the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect. Whilst the knowledge of uniform external magnetic field effects on the electrodeposition of single metals has been greatly improved during the past decade, an alloy deposition is still a challenging task. Due to a lack of understanding of mechanisms of a magnetic field impact on the deposition of CoFe alloys and their technological importance a detailed investigation is of demand. The aim of this work is to analyse in detail the effects induced by a homogeneous magnetic field with different strength and relative to the electrode surface orientation on the electrodeposition of thin CoFe alloy films of different composition. This study is divided into three major parts: an analysis of the electrochemical behaviour (1), nucleation and growth processes (2) and the determination of the morphology and the physical properties of the deposited layers (3). 1. 	A detailed analysis of the electrochemical processes is performed. The influence of the magnetic field with respect to its flux density and relative to the electrode surface orientation on the reactions rates has been investigated. A special attention has been given to the side reactions accompanying the metal reduction, i. e. the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Which has a significant impact on the layer’s properties. It has been shown that the electrochemical reaction rates are improved in the parallel to the electrode magnetic field due to the classical MHD effect. On the contrary, in the perpendicular to the electrode magnetic field nearly no effect on the metal reduction is observed, whilst the HER rate is significantly increased. The reason of that is seen in the improved desorption of hydrogen bubbles from the electrode surface due to a localized convection in a bubble vicinity, the so called micro- MHD effect. Moreover, the additional convection introduced by a magnetic field, regardless of its relative to the electrode surface orientations, leads to a reduced interface pH value. This, in turn, results in an improved layer quality, i. e. the hydroxides precipitation is inhibited. 2. 	The nucleation and the very beginning of the layer growth are of particular importance for thin film deposition. Since the deposit properties are determined by these processes an extensive study of the very initial stages of electrocrystallisation is presented. This was performed by an analysis of the current density vs. time transients. It was found that the nucleation behaviour can be altered by a magnetic field. The changes in the nucleation behaviour have been studied on the basis of theoretical models by an current density-time transients analysis. Regardless of the electrolyte chemistry, the magnetic field strength, and its relative to the electrode orientation, similar features in the current density-time transients have been observed. The nucleation and growth are characterised by a layer-by-layer mode. The first nucleation and growth step at the very beginning of the potential step has been attributed to the 2 D (most probably epitaxial) layer formation (up to a few monolayers), which was found unaffected by a magnetic field superposition. The 2 D step is then followed by the next nucleation and growth step indicated by the occurrence of a maximum in the current density-time transients. This is attributed to the nucleation and 3 D diffusion controlled growth and is altered by a magnetic field applied in the parallel-to-electrode configuration. The experimental dependencies have been examined by known theoretical models. This analysis revealed that the superposition of the parallel magnetic field leads to a retardation of the steady state nucleation rate (AN 0) due to the MHD effect acting in the electrolyte. A qualitative model was proposed in order to explain this phenomenon. In contrast, the perpendicular to the electrode magnetic field does not change the nucleation behaviour. However, the growth mode of the layer is remarkably changed, i. e. a columnar growth is observed. 3. 	The magnetic field impact on the electrochemical reaction rates, on the desorption of hydrogen from the electrode surface, and on the nucleation behaviour has strong consequences for the resulting layer characteristics. This can be summarized as follows: •	The most pronounced effect is noticed for the morphology of the layers. The quality of the layers deposited in a magnetic field, irrespective of its relative to the electrode orientation, is strongly improved. The reason of this is an enhanced desorption of hydrogen from the electrode surface. As a result large holes left by hydrogen bubbles observed for the layers deposited without a field disappear for the layers deposited under the influence of a magnetic field. The layers deposited under an influence of the parallel to the electrode magnetic field appear denser and more homogeneous than the ones obtained without a magnetic field. On the contrary, the layers deposited in the perpendicular to the electrode magnetic field appeared more diverse. The most remarkable effect has been observed for the layers deposited from the Fe and the CoFe(A) electrolyte in a perpendicular magnetic field where the grains tend to grow as separated columns in the direction of the magnetic field. A scaling analysis has revealed a smoothing effect of a parallel magnetic field manifested in a reduced value of the roughness exponent in comparison to the layers deposited without a magnetic field. On the contrary, the roughness exponent has increased for the layers obtained in the perpendicular to the electrode magnetic field, i. e. a roughening effect of the perpendicular magnetic field is observed. •	No magnetic field effects neither on the crystal structure nor on the texture of the deposits have been observed. All layers irrespective of the deposition parameters develop a fibre texture. Nevertheless, the internal stress state of the deposited layers is affected by a magnetic field. A magnetic field applied during the deposition of alloy layers from buffered electrolytes, irrespective of its relative to the electrode orientation, reduces the internal stress of the layer. This effect is attributed to an improved desorption of hydrogen from the electrode surface, which is observed under the influence of a magnetic field. •	The chemical composition of the deposited alloy layers, irrespective of the deposition parameters, is unchanged by magnetic fields. •	The magnetic properties of the deposits are found to be affected by a magnetic field applied during the deposition. These effects are caused by microstructural changes induced by the magnetic field, i. e. the roughness of the layer, the internal stress state, and the chemical composition of the deposit. A good correlation between the coercivity and the roughness is found. Moreover, an in-plane magnetic anisotropy is observed in the alloy layers deposited under the influence of the parallel to the electrode magnetic field, where, according to the XRD investigations, isotropic properties were expected. The origin of this phenomenon is seen in a preferential same atom couples formation in the magnetic field direction. Metalle und Legierungen der Eisengruppe sind von großem Interesse insbesondere wegen ihrer exzellenten weichmagnetischen Eigenschaften. Ein breites Anwendungsgebiet liegt in der Speichertechnologie, sie finden vorrangig Einsatz in Lese- und Schreibköpfen und in mikroelektromechanischen Systemen (MEMS). Besonders das CoFe-System, das u. a. die höchste Sättigungsmagnetisierung von 2, 45 T bei einer relativ niedrigen Koerzitivfeldstärke von ca. 2 × 10 ^- 5 T aufweist, ist interessant für zukünftige Entwicklungen in der Speichertechnologie. Im Vergleich zu physikalischen Abscheideverfahren, wie PVD (physical vapor deposition) ist die Elektrokristallisation eine einfache und preiswerte Alternative zur Herstellung von weichmagnetischen Schichten und Strukturen, die sich im Herstellungsprozess von Schreib-und Leseköpfen durchgesetzt hat. Es ist möglich Schichten und komplexe geometrische Strukturen mit einer Stärke von einigen Monolagen bis zu mehr als 1 µm und in hohen Aspektverhältnissen abzuscheiden. Durch Überlagerung von externen Magnetfeldern während der Elektrodeposition können die Eigenschaften und insbesondere die Morphologie der Schichten signifikant beeinflusst werden. Die Ursache dafür besteht im Wesentlichen in der durch Lorentzkräfte angetriebenen Konvektion, die als magnetohydrodynamische Konvektion (MHD) bezeichnet wird. Während im letzten Jahrzehnt durch grundlegende Untersuchungen der Kenntnisstand bezüglich der elektrochemischen Abscheidung einzelner Metalle in überlagerten Magnetfeldern vertieft wurde, ist das Verständnis zum Mechanismus der Legierungsabscheidung wenig erforscht und eine Herausforderung. Es besteht kaum Kenntnis zum Mechanismus der CoFe Abscheidung unter dem Einfluss externer Magnetfelder und deren Bedeutung für technologische Prozesse. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, den Einfluss homogener Magnetfelder unterschiedlicher Stärke und Orientierung bezüglich der Elektrodenoberfläche während der Elektrokristallisation von CoFe Legierungen unterschiedlicher Zusammensetzung zu untersuchen und die magnetfeldinduzierten Effekte detailliert und grundlegend zu analysieren. Die Arbeit ist in drei wesentliche Abschnitte gegliedert, (1) die Analyse des elektrochemischen Verhaltens, (2) die Untersuchung von Keimbildungs- und Wachstumsprozessen, (3) die Charakterisierung der Morphologie und der physikalischen Eigenschaften der Schichten. 1. 	Die elektrochemischen Prozesse und Abscheideraten wurden in Abhängigkeit von der magnetischen Flussdichte und Orientierung bezüglich der Elektrodenanordnung detailliert analysiert. Besondere Berücksichtigung fand die die Metallabscheidung begleitende Nebenreaktion, die Wasserstoffreduktion (HER), die signifikant die Eigenschaften der Schichten beeinflusst. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Rate der Metallabscheidung in einem Magnetfeld, welches parallel zur Elektrode ausgerichtet ist, erhöht wird, was auf den klassischen MHD-Effekt zurückzuführen ist, der im Elektrolyten eine Strömung generiert. Im Gegensatz dazu wurde in einem homogenen Magnetfeld das senkrecht auf die Probe gerichtet ist, nahezu kein Einfluss auf die Reduktion der Metallionen gefunden, während die HER-Reaktion signifikant erhöht wird. Die Ursache ist in einer beschleunigten Desorption der Wasserstoffblasen von der Elektrodenoberfläche zu sehen, die durch lokale Konvektion in Blasennähe hervorgerufen und als mikro-MHD Effekt bezeichnet wird. Darüber hinaus bewirkt die magnetfeldinduzierte Konvektion unabhängig von der Magnetfeldorientierung einen geringeren Anstieg des oberflächennahen pH-Wertes. Das wiederum führt zu einer verbesserten Schichtqualität, da die spontane Bildung von Hydroxiden inhibiert wird. 2. 	Die Keimbildung und der Beginn des Schichtwachstums sind von besonderer Bedeutung für die Elektrokristallisation dünner Schichten, da die Schichteigenschaften wesentlich durch diese Prozesse bestimmt werden. Die Initialschritte der Elektrokristallisation wurden im Detail untersucht und dargestellt. Die Analyse erfolgt auf der Grundlage von Stromdichte-Zeit-Transienten. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass das Keimbildungsverhalten durch ein überlagertes Magnetfeld beeinflusst wird. Unabhängig von der Zusammensetzung des Elektrolyten, der magnetischen Flussdichte und der Orientierung zur Elektrodenoberfläche wurden vergleichbare Stromdichte-Zeit-Verläufe beobachtet. Keimbildung und Wachstum können durch einen Layer-by-Layer Modus charakterisiert werden. Der erste Keimbildungs- und Wachstumsschritt, der unmittelbar nach dem Anlegen des Abscheidepotentials stattfindet, ist durch eine 2 D Schichtbildung (wahrscheinlich epitaktisch) gekennzeichnet, die zur Ausbildung von einigen Monolagen führt. Dieser Schritt wird durch ein äußeres Magnetfeld nicht beeinflusst. Dem 2 D-Schritt folgen weitere Keimbildungs- und Wachstumsschritte, die durch ein Maximum im Stromdichte-Zeit-Transienten gekennzeichnet sind. Das Verhalten ist auf Keimbildung und 3 D diffusionskontrollierte Wachstumsprozesse zurückzuführen und wird durch ein Magnetfeld parallel zur Elektrodenoberfläche beeinflusst. Die experimentellen Ergebnisse wurden mit Hilfe bekannter theoretischer Modelle analysiert. Es wurde gezeigt, dass die Überlagerung eines parallel zur Oberfläche angeordneten Magnetdfeldes zu einer Verringerung der stationären Keimbildungsrate (AN 0) führt, was ebenfalls auf die Wirkung des MHD-Effektes zurückzuführen ist. In der Arbeit wird ein qualitatives Modell für die Legierungsabscheidung in einem überlagerten homogenen Magnetfeld vorgeschlagen, das die beobachteten Phänomene erklärt. Im Gegensatz dazu wurde in einem senkrecht zur Elektrodenoberfläche ausgerichteten Magnetfeld kein Einfluss auf den Keimbildungs- und Wachstumsmechanismus anhand der Stromdichte-Zeit-Transienten festgestellt. Trotzdem wird eine stark veränderte Schichtmorphologie, die ein kolumnares Kornwachstum zeigt, beobachtet. 3. 	Der Einfluss eines äußeren Magnetfeldes auf die elektrochemischen Abscheideraten, auf die Desorption von Wasserstoff von der Elektrodenoberfläche und auf das Keimbildungsverhalten hat Konsequenzen auf die Schichteigenschaften. Diese können wie folgt zusammengefasst werden: •	Der Einfluss eines äußeren Magnetfeldes auf die Schichtmorphologie ist auffallend. Die Qualität der Schichten, die in einem Magnetfeld abgeschieden wurden, wird unabhängig von der Orientierung des Magnetfeldes zur Elektrodenoberfläche deutlich verbessert. Als Ursache ist die beschleunigte Desorption der Wassersoffblasen von der Elektrodenoberfläche anzusehen. Ohne äußeres Magnetfeld verbleiben große Defekte in Form von Löchern auf der Oberfläche, die durch anhaftende Wasserstoffblasen verursacht werden, die in einem überlagerten Magnetfeld nicht beobachtet werden. Schichten, die in einem Magnetfeld parallel zur Elektrodenoberfläche erhalten werden, sind dichter und homogener. Im Gegensatz dazu haben Schichten in einem senkrecht zur Oberfläche abgeschiedenen Magnetfeld eine mannigfaltige Morphologie. Schichten aus Fe und CoFe Legierungen mit einem hohen Eisenanteil wachsen in Form von separaten Körnern und Säulen in Richtung des senkrecht ausgerichteten Magnetfeldes. Mittels Scaling-Analyse wurden Rauhigkeitsexponeten ermittelt, die den glättenden Effekt eines parallel zur Elektrode ausgerichteten Magnetfeldes auf die Schichtmorphologie bestätigen im Vergleich zu Schichten, die ohne Magnetfeld abgeschieden wurden. Die Rauhigkeitsexponenten für Schichten, die in einem senkrecht ausgerichteten Magnetfeld abgeschieden wurden, sind hingegen deutlich erhöht. •	Weder auf die kristallographische Struktur noch auf die Textur der Schichten konnte ein Einfluss des überlagerten Magnetfeldes nachgewiesen werden. Alle Schichten unabhängig von den Abscheidebedingungen weisen eine Fasertextur auf. Trotzdem konnte ein signifikanter Einfluss des Magnetfeldes auf die innere Spannung der Schichten bestätigt werden. Insbesondere vermindert sich die innere Spannung von Schichten unabhängig von der Orientierung des angelegten Magnetfeldes, die aus einem gepufferten Elektrolyten abgeschieden wurden. Die Ursache ist auch hier auf die verbesserte Desorption von Wasserstoff zurückzuführen. •	Die chemische Zusammensetzung der Schicht wird für die untersuchten Systeme durch ein Magnetfeld nicht verändert. •	Die magnetischen Eigenschaften der Schichten werden beeinflußt, wenn während der Elektrokristallisation ein Magnetfeld überlagert wird. Diese Effekte werden durch die mikrostrukturellen Veränderungen, die durch ein überlagertes Magnetfeld induziert werden verursacht, d. h. durch die Rauhigkeit der Schicht, die innere Schichtspannung und die chemische Zusammensetzung. Es wird eine gute Korrelation zwischen der Koerzitivfeldstärke und Rauhigkeit der Schichten gefunden. Darüber hinaus wurde eine in-plane Anisotropie beobachtet, wenn während der Elektrokristallisation ein Magnetfeld parallel zur Elektrodenoberfläche angelegt wurde, obwohl aus röntgenographischen Untersuchungen isotrope Eigenschaften erwartet wurden. Als Ursache für dieses Phänomen wird eine bevorzugten Ausbildung und Ausrichtung von gleichatomigen Paaren im Magnetfeld angenommen...|$|E

It is assumed that shingled recording would not require a big change in head and media design. Shingled recording uses a <b>write</b> <b>head</b> with wide pole and an extended conventional continuous recording medium. Written tracks partially overwrite adjacent data with a certain track pitch. With the help of the wide pole tip, the <b>write</b> <b>head</b> can generate a large recording field, which resolves the so-called trilemma. The down-side of shingled recording is that a new architecture should be introduced to ensure random access, which is mandatory in hard disk drives. In this article, head and media simulations of shingled recording are surveyed. Experimental results and the issues to be solved are also reviewed...|$|R
