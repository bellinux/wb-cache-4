5|$|The {{third season}} follows Michael inside Sona and Lincoln {{on the outside}} in Panama. Sona is a prison that has been run by the inmates and guarded only from the outside due to a riot the year before. Burrows is quickly {{contacted}} by Gretchen Morgan (a Company operative {{who was in charge}} of operations in Panama) who kidnapped his son LJ and Sara, the woman Michael loves. He is told that The Company wants Scofield to break James Whistler out of Sona. The season follows Michael and Whistler's trials in formulating an escape plan, as Michael has to deal with extreme tension and as Lincoln deals with The Company's operative Gretchen Morgan. Sucre gets a job at the prison to aid Michael in his escape plan. When Lincoln attempts to rescue Sara and LJ following a clue provided by Sara, Gretchen claims to have beheaded Sara and sends Lincoln a head in a box as a warning. As the season ends, the pair manage to escape along with Mahone, and another inmate, Luis, leaving behind several accomplices including T-Bag and Bellick. Sucre's identity is discovered by a prison guard and he is thrown into Sona just after the escape. LJ and Sofia (who was captured for a guarantee that Whistler <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> her) are traded for Whistler, and Michael seeks revenge against Gretchen for Sara's death.|$|E

Just under half {{of the population of}} the sovereign base areas are Cypriots, the rest are British military personnel, support staff and their dependants. In a declaration attached to the Treaty of Establishment of the Republic of Cyprus of 1960 the British government undertook not to allow new settlement of people in the sovereign base areas other than for temporary purposes.|$|E
500|$|In {{a perfect}} {{conductor}} (...) , {{there would be}} no diffusion. By Lenz's law, any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it. The theorem describing this effect is called the frozen-in-field theorem. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.|$|E

500|$|After Singer {{completed}} {{the three major}} productions X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns. Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards {{while growing up in}} New Jersey, and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X-Men. Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke, widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group. After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander's screenplay and signing on to direct, Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany's political landscape, and also met with one of Hitler's bodyguards, Rochus Misch, who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide. The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg's true motivation, but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did. Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy, Singer had bigger ambitions for the film, wanting it to be more than [...] "old men in rooms, talking". Singer looked back on his decision, saying, [...] "The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller.... I knew if I could keep the audience with [...] Stauffenberg, with his mission, they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the flow and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{burning in}} 1789 of Catherine Murphy, for coining, {{received}} practically no {{attention from the}} newspapers (perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages), but {{it may have been}} enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett, a former sheriff of London. [...] Hammett was also an MP, and in 1790 he introduced to Parliament a Bill for Altering the Sentence of Burning Women. [...] He denounced the punishment as [...] "the savage remains of Norman policy" [...] which [...] "disgraced our statutes", as [...] "the practice did the common law". [...] He also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution. [...] William Wilberforce and Hammett were not the first men to attempt to end the burning of women. [...] Almost 140years earlier, during the Interregnum, a group of lawyers and laymen known as the Hale Commission (after its chairman Matthew Hale), was tasked by the House of Commons to take [...] "into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law". [...] Among the proposed reforms was the replacement of burning at the stake with hanging, but, mainly through the objections of various interested parties, none of the commission's proposals made it into law during the Rump Parliament. [...] Hammett was confident though. [...] He believed that public opinion was on his side and that [...] "the House <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> him in the cause of humanity". [...] The change in execution venues, from Tyburn to Newgate, also attracted criticism. [...] Following Phoebe Harris's burning in 1786, as well as questioning the inequality of English law The Times complained about the location of the punishment and its effect on locals: ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the year, the war had {{developed}} {{in such a way that}} the new SAS detachment would not be needed in Persia. General Wilson was being transferred to Middle East Command, and Maclean extracted a promise that the newly trained troops <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> him, as their style of commando raids were ideal for southern and eastern Europe. [...] Frustrated by the abandoning of plans for an assault on Crete, Maclean went to see Reginald Leeper, [...] "an old friend from Foreign Office days, and now His Majesty's Ambassador to the Greek Government then in exile in Cairo". Leeper put in a word for him, and very soon Maclean was told to go to London to get his instructions directly from the prime minister. Churchill told him to parachute into Jugoslavia (now spelled Yugoslavia) as head of a military mission accredited to Josip Broz Tito (a shadowy figure at that point) or whoever was in charge of the Partisans, the Communist-led resistance movement. Mihajlovic's royalist Cetniks (now spelled Chetniks), which the Allies had been supporting, did not appear to be fighting the Germans very hard, and indeed were said to be collaborating with the enemy. [...] Maclean famously paraphrased Churchill: [...] "My task was simply to help find out who was killing the most Germans and suggest means by which we could help them to kill more." [...] The prime minister saw Maclean as [...] "a daring Ambassador-leader to these hardy and hunted guerillas".|$|E
2500|$|In 1898, Father Richard Wilson, {{a priest}} from Stepney, London, became {{curious as to}} what his parishioners did when they disappeared. He persuaded one family to take him with them. He too was appalled by the {{conditions}} the pickers had to live in, but <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> them each year, gradually gaining their trust. From 1897 he rented a cottage at Five Oak Green for 2s.6d a week, furnishing it with cots and providing a nurse. Thus, the Little Hoppers Hospital was born. It was very busy that year, as there was an outbreak of smallpox. A few years later, {{he was able to}} rent a larger cottage. By 1906 most of the districts of Kent had laws to similar effect, and many farms had hopper huts by 1914. In 1910, Father Wilson bought the Rose and Crown public house in Five Oak Green and turned the building into the Hoppers' Hospital. [...] The building bore the legend [...] "E and H Kelsey's Fine Ales, Stout and Porter Sold Here" [...] over three lines, to which Father Wilson simply added the word [...] "not" [...] before the last two words. [...] This Hoppers Hospital was in operation for over 60 years. The Salvation Army also used to visit the hop pickers in the fields and attend to their welfare. There was also a Hoppers Hospital at Marden, which was not connected with the one at Five Oak Green.|$|E
2500|$|Vliet {{was forced}} to quickly form a new Magic Band to {{complete}} support-tour dates, with musicians who had no experience with his music and in fact had never heard it. Having {{no knowledge of the}} previous Magic Band style, they simply improvised what they thought <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> each song, playing much slicker versions that have been described as [...] "bar band" [...] versions of Beefheart songs. A review described this incarnation of the Magic Band as the [...] "Tragic Band", a term that has stuck over the years. Mike Barnes said that the description of the new band [...] "grooving along pleasantly", was [...] "...an appropriately banal description of the music of a man who {{only a few years ago}} composed with the expressed intent of shaking listeners out of their torpor". The one album they recorded, Bluejeans & Moonbeams (1974) has, like its predecessor, a completely different, almost soft rock sound from any other Beefheart record. Neither was well received; drummer Art Tripp recalled that when he and the original Magic Band listened to Unconditionally Guaranteed, they [...] "...were horrified. As we listened, it was as though each song was worse than the one which preceded it". Beefheart later disowned both albums, calling them [...] "horrible and vulgar", asking that they not be considered part of his musical output and urging fans who bought them to [...] "take copies back for a refund".|$|E
