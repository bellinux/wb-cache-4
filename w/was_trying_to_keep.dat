In April 2009, Helen Marshall, the president of the Borough of Queens, said that the City of New York <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> JetBlue in the city; in January 2010, the CEO of JetBlue, Dave Barger, and Governor of Florida Charlie Crist met in Tallahassee, Florida to discuss a possible move to Orlando.

25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously she <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> him under control yet now {{the two of them}} are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, Banda {{supported}} {{both the}} government and the guerrilla movement during the Mozambique civil war. He successfully gave the Malawi Army and Malawi Young Pioneers opposing missions in Mozambique from 1987 to 1992. He had the Malawi Army support the Mozambican government, controlled by FRELIMO after the country's independence in 1975, to defend Malawi's interests in Mozambique. This was done formally through an agreement in 1984 with Samora Machel. Simultaneously, Banda used the MYP as couriers and active supporters of the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), which had been fighting against Machel's government since the late 1970s. Malawi was used to channel foreign aid from South Africa's apartheid government. Machel issued a dossier to Frontline States with evidence that Banda was still supporting the insurgents in spite of the 1984 agreement to stop. By September 1986, Machel, Robert Mugabe, and Kenneth Kaunda visited Banda to persuade him to stop supporting RENAMO. Machel's successor, Joaquim Chissano, continued to complain of Malawi's lack of willingness to stop supporting Renamo. Banda however <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Malawian interests in the Port of Nacala in Mozambique {{and did not want to}} rely on Tanzania and South Africa ports for its imports and exports due to the expense. Mozambique and Malawi came to an agreement to place troops from both countries in Nayuchi near the port. Incidents of Malawi Army members being killed over the course of four years angered the Army because MYP members were involved with the insurgents, essentially pitting the two against each other.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{commenced}} {{after only}} half a day's rehearsal and without a finished script; the actors received {{the rest of their}} lines in daily dispatches. According to Warren, [...] "dear old Max Cuff <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with us. He was writing like mad." [...] Certain scenes were partly or wholly improvised: one example is a sex scene between the characters of Jessica and Jo, which was added mainly to boost the film's overseas distribution prospects. Many of the crew had recently come off the production of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, on which Marcel had served as assistant director. They completed an average of 35 camera set-ups per day, employing hand-held shots whenever they fell behind schedule and filming scenes in no more than three takes to lower costs. Stokes needed injections to ease the discomfort caused by the contact lenses that he was required to wear as part of his alien make-up. The bird Wally was a cockatoo that often refused to perform when needed and squawked loudly off-camera, frequently causing problems with the sound recording. He eventually escaped from his cage and was never seen again.|$|E
500|$|An early {{pit stop}} during the safety car phase had put Sergio Pérez up into third place, with Daniel Ricciardo behind in fourth. By lap 43, Ricciardo, Bottas and Räikkönen had all moved into {{striking}} distance of Pérez, who <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his older tyres alive. On lap 45, Bottas used DRS to move ahead of Ricciardo's Red Bull. One lap later, Räikkönen tried to follow suit, only to run wide, having to concede the position back to Ricciardo. On lap 47, Carlos Sainz retired after spinning off the track due to a brake failure, losing his rear wing. Retrieving the wing from the track under racing conditions, a track marshall was called [...] "one very brave Russian" [...] by the passing Sebastian Vettel, who barely avoided contact. Just after being passed by Räikkönen on lap 49, Daniel Ricciardo had to retire with a suspension failure. The end of lap 52 saw Valtteri Bottas move ahead of Pérez into third place, with Räikkönen moving past the Force India as well. However, just some corners later on the last lap of the race, the two collided, forcing Bottas to retire and causing heavy damage to Räikkönen's Ferrari. Pérez thereby reclaimed third place and achieved Force India's first podium finish of the season. At the front, Vettel moved closer to Hamilton due to the latter suffering from a compromised rear wing, probably caused by rubber debris in the slot gap. However, Hamilton held on and took his ninth victory of the season, finishing ahead of Vettel, who was now his closest championship rival.|$|E

After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a [...] elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each [...] "basket" [...] or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so {{the bottom of the}} basket was removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.|$|E

Verdicts of accidental death were returned for the sixteen victims at the coroner's inquest held at Berkhamsted. The sole survivor, P/O P.D. Cliff, said at the inquest he could not remember anything after boarding the aircraft at Bovingdon. The coroner said that before the aircraft departed [...] "certain things were not done which should have been done. But the question of taking off was entirely a matter for the pilot to decide." [...] "For some reason height was lost – no one knows why, no one will ever know. That caused the unfortunate crash. There was nothing wrong with the engines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Production {{went very}} well, and as {{expected}} {{with so many}} comic actors and personalities around, was very lively. During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there {{would be so much}} comedy being generated and they were so funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strangé, the director said that [...] "what Grace was doing on the set while we were shooting was so funny that I remember Halle crying off camera, cause she <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a straight face but she couldn't.

2500|$|The book Alpha– the KGB's Top Secret Unit also {{suggests}} that a [...] "KGB operation co-ordinated with the military" [...] was undertaken by the KGB Alpha Group. Archie Brown, in The Gorbachev Factor, uses the memoirs of many people around Gorbachev and in the upper echelons of the Soviet political landscape, to implicate General Valentin Varennikov, {{a member of the}} August coup plotters, and General Vladislav Achalov, another August coup conspirator. These persons were characterised as individuals [...] "who were prepared to remove Gorbachev from his presidential office unconstitutionally" [...] and [...] "were more than capable of using unauthorised violence against nationalist separatists some months earlier". Brown criticises Gorbachev for [...] "a conscious tilt {{in the direction of the}} conservative forces he <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> within an increasingly fragile coalition" [...] who would later betray him; he also criticises Gorbachev [...] "for his tougher line and heightened rhetoric against the Lithuanians in the days preceding the attack and for his slowness in condemning the killings" [...] but notes that Gorbachev did not approve any action and was seeking political solutions.|$|E
2500|$|The next week, in episodes {{broadcast}} from 9 to 13 July 2012, Jack and Max both witness Kat dancing sexily with Ray, {{and they are}} judgemental of her, which Inside Soap said could be because {{one of them is}} jealous, and Jack keeps [...] "making eyes" [...] at Kat, which could be more revealing than Kat's own actions. They later said that Kat would probably not dance with Ray like that if she <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> an affair with him secret, especially in front of Kim, and said she could have been trying to make either Max or Jack jealous. All About Soap also thought Jack might be jealous, and when he asks Ray if any [...] "hot women" [...] are going to his party, Jack looks at Kat, which they thought could be because Jack hopes Kat will be there. The [...] "sexy dance" [...] between Ray and Kat was interpreted to be either evidence or a red herring, but Inside Soap noted that Kat seems keen to be around Ray. The fact she dances so close to Ray in front of Kim could mean Ray is not her secret lover, but she enjoys danger so may be willing to make a show of herself despite the risk. Kat also tells Kim she is [...] "lucky to have found her prince", which All About Soap thought might mean Kat is jealous, and made him their favourite suspect of the fortnight.|$|E
