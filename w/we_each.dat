I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but <b>we</b> <b>each</b> took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E

To avoid the possibility of being swept past the island by the fierce south-westerly winds, Shackleton ordered a slight change of course so that the James Caird would reach land on the uninhabited south-west coast. They would then try to work the boat round to the whaling stations on the northern side of the island. [...] "Things were bad for us in those days", wrote Shackleton. [...] "The bright moments were those when <b>we</b> <b>each</b> received our one mug of hot milk during the long, bitter watches of the night". Late on the same day floating seaweed was spotted, and the next morning there were birds, including cormorants which were known never to venture far from land. Shortly after noon on 8 May came the first sighting of South Georgia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{style of}} film is {{presented}} in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt {{that the only way to}} tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so <b>we</b> <b>each</b> brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|E
