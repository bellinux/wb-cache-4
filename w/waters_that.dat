5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, Cilla passed over Vanua Levu. Even though the region had been severely affected by Cyclone Ami two weeks earlier, flood <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> resulted from rains {{associated with the}} cyclone quickly receded due to the storm's rapid motion.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} possibly {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> were still warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late on October 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early on October 26.|$|E
50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>that</b> {{enters a}} field {{is removed from}} a field by runoff, drainage, {{evaporation}} or transpiration. Runoff is the <b>water</b> <b>that</b> flows on the surface {{to the edge of}} the field; drainage is the <b>water</b> <b>that</b> flows through the soil downward or toward the edge of the field underground; evaporative water loss from a field is that part of the <b>water</b> <b>that</b> evaporates into the atmosphere directly from the field's surface; transpiration is the loss of water from the field by its evaporation from the plant itself.|$|R

5|$|After {{stalling}} {{several hundred}} kilometres offshore, the storm weakened over cooler <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> it had upwelled. By May27, the system weakened to a cyclonic storm {{and by this}} time was approaching the northwestern coastline of India, near Gujarat. The following day, the storm made landfall in the Saurashtra region as a deep depression with winds of 55km/h (35mph 3-minute winds). The depression quickly weakened after moving inland and dissipated early on May29.|$|E
5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a {{revised version of}} an essay, The World of <b>Waters,</b> <b>that</b> she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E

5|$|The Una-class {{submarine}} (also {{known as}} Type 911) was {{a class of}} six midget submarines built for the Yugoslav Navy at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (English: Special objects shipyard) during the 1980s. They were designed {{with the purpose of}} laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces, with or without their submersibles, in shallow <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> were inaccessible for larger submarines. Due to their mission profile that called for a small design as well as the need to stay undetected, they lacked torpedo armament and a generator for battery recharging.|$|E
5|$|The marine hatchetfish is {{extremely}} flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, {{and the body}} is so silvery as to resemble aluminium foil. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures {{similar to those used}} to provide structural coloration: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Octave was {{considered}} the worst tropical cyclone {{in the history of}} Arizona. The origins of Tropical Storm Octave were from a tropical disturbance that formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September23, 1983. Steered by a deep layer high over Mexico, the disturbance moved west for four days before becoming a tropical depression on September27 off the southwest coast of Mexico. Over an area of warm sea surface temperatures, it was able to quickly strengthen to peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), through wind shear prevented much further development. By September30, Octave was accelerating to the northeast, steadily weakening due to cooler <b>waters.</b> <b>That</b> day it weakened to tropical depression status, and on October2, Octave dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Once again, Balize, Louisiana was {{directly}} in the hurricane's path, and suffered heavily as a consequence. The storm lasted from the afternoon on Friday, September 14 to late Saturday morning. Local reports indicate heavy rain and large hail fell {{in association with the}} cyclone, and in Balize, nearly every structure was destroyed; any buildings that withstood the initial winds were swept away by the ensuing inundation. Floodwaters killed ten people at one location alone in Plaquemines Parish. Residents of the hardest-hit communities were forced to wade to safety, in some cases through water shoulder-high. Northerly winds drove water from Lake Pontchartrain that had already been built up by northeasterly winds southward over small fishing and resort towns along the southern bank of the lake. Sheds, wharves, and bathhouses along that section of the lake were destroyed. Several people drowned in flood <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> covered lower Plaquemines Parish. The hurricane drove several ships, including the steamer Galveston, ashore.|$|E
5|$|Several Malaysian Members of Parliament {{have urged}} the Federal Government to assert {{sovereignty}} over Pulau Pisang {{which also has}} a lighthouse on it that is operated by Singapore, or to take over administration of the lighthouse. Concerns were also expressed for Pulau Merambong near the western boundary of Malaysia and Singapore. The Menteri Besar of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman, assured the public that Pulau Pisang belongs to Johor under a 1900 agreement between Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and British administrators in colonial Singapore. Nonetheless, Malaysian agencies have taken up efforts to stake claims over a hundred islands, reefs, rocks and other features in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, and off Sabahan <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> Malaysia could lose to China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Two of these islands are Pulau Unarang off eastern Sabah near the Indonesian border, and Pulau Perak {{to the west of}} Penang.|$|E

5|$|The Red River had {{a history}} of {{seasonal}} flooding, aggravated by the broad ancient lake bed that formed the Red River Valley. The 1997 Red River Flood caused extensive damage in the city. Fargo was upstream from the bulk of the flood <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> season, and Winnipeg had built an extensive system of flood control structures in the 1960s. In 1997 Grand Forks suffered the most damage of any major city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. The government began developing a new levee system to protect the city, which was completed ten years later. It required the relocation of numerous residents as some neighborhoods were emptied for this construction.|$|E
5|$|Built {{during the}} American War of Independence {{she spent the}} last three years of the war off the American coast, and saw action at the Battle of Cape Henry and at the Battle of the Chesapeake. The years of peace were spent either in the Caribbean or off Nova Scotia, before the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars saw her commissioned for service in the Leeward Islands and off the British coast. It was while serving in British <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> she became caught up in the mutiny at the Nore. As one of only two two-decker ships to remain in action during the mutiny she had to maintain the Dutch blockade by creating the illusion of being part of a larger fleet, which she managed successfully. Adamant then went on to fight at the Battle of Camperdown, after which she moved to the English Channel, and then the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope. Here she took part in the destruction of the French commerce raider Preneuse, and in her later years captured a number of privateers. She became a receiving ship and flagship of a port admiral during the last years of the Napoleonic Wars, until being broken up in June 1814.|$|E
5|$|Establishment of the C made Everglades National Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C for assistance, the C offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering {{the east side of}} the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns {{and brown}} {{pelicans}} all engage in plunge diving, taking fast moving prey by diving {{into the water}} from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from {{the momentum of the}} dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20m (70ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to sit still for several minutes.|$|E
5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of willow bark extract to cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the doctrine of signatures to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish <b>waters</b> <b>that</b> were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an astringency reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the active ingredient of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the active ingredient of willow extract, salicin, relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E

50|$|An {{atmometer}} or evaporimeter is {{a scientific}} instrument used {{for measuring the}} rate of water evaporation from a wet surface to the atmosphere.

Based on the amount of <b>water</b> <b>that</b> does evaporate and transpire, the user can water crops correspondingly, which results in less water use and possibly increased crop yields.
