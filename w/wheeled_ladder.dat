2500|$|A ground {{contingent}} of Hezbollah fighters {{crossed the border}} into Israeli territory, [...] and may have used a <b>wheeled</b> <b>ladder</b> to climb the fence. They hid in ambush in the wadi of Milepost 105. As two Israeli armored Humvees arrived, one of the Hezbollah fighters, who was hiding among weeds with an anti-tank missile, was spotted from a nearby IDF observation tower, but the tower was apparently unable to relay this information to the soldiers. [...] As the Israeli Humvees passed, they were attacked {{with a combination of}} pre-positioned explosives and anti-tank missiles. The team knocked out the trailing Humvee, killing three soldiers inside, and abducted two soldiers from the first vehicle. Another soldier was severely wounded, another lightly wounded and a third was scratched by shrapnel. The entire incident took no more than 10minutes.|$|E

Back, back he stumbles into a barrel of molasses which falls over, drenching him in its miry, brown former contents.

Bosko is helpless until he frees his feet from his shoes; that done, the stocking-footed Bosko pursues his tormentor, as the little cat ascends and rides a <b>wheeled</b> <b>ladder,</b> knocking over cans from a high shelf as he does so, which cans, falling, strike poor Bosko's head.|$|E

50|$|Determining if a graph can be colored with 2 colors is {{equivalent}} to determining {{whether or not the}} graph is bipartite, and thus computable in linear time using breadth-first search or depth-first search. More generally, the chromatic number and a corresponding coloring of perfect graphs can be computed in polynomial time using semidefinite programming.

40|$|Abstract. We {{initiate}} {{the study of}} forcing signed domination in graphs. A function f: V (G) − → {− 1, + 1 } is called signed dominating function if for each v ∈ V (G), � f(u) ≥ u∈N[v] 1. For a signed dominating function f of G, the weight f is w(f) = � f(v). The signed v∈V domination number γs(G) is the minimum weight of a signed dominating function on G. A signed dominating function of weight γs(G) is called a γs(G) -function. A γs(G) -function f can also be represented {{by a set of}} ordered pairs Sf = {(v, f(v)) : v ∈ V}. A subset T of Sf is called a forcing subset of Sf if Sf is the unique extension of T to a γs(G) -function. The forcing signed domination number of Sf, f(Sf, γs), is defined by f(Sf, γs) = min{|T | : T is a forcing subset of Sf} and the forcing signed domination number of G, f(G, γs), is defined by f(G, γs) = min{f(Sf, γs) : Sf is a γs(G) -function}. For every graph G, f(G, γs) ≥ 0. In this paper we show that for integer a, b with a positive, there exists a simple connected graph G such that f(G, γs) = a and γs(G) = b. The forcing signed domination number of several classes of graph, including paths, cycles, Dutch-windmills, <b>wheels,</b> <b>ladders</b> and prisms are determined. 1...|$|R

50|$|Siege warfare of {{the ancient}} Near East took place behind walls built of mud bricks, stone, wood or a {{combination}} of these materials depending on local availability. The earliest representations of siege warfare date to the Protodynastic Period of Egypt, c.3000 BC, while the first siege equipment is known from Egyptian tomb reliefs of the 24th century BC showing <b>wheeled</b> siege <b>ladders.</b> Assyrian palace reliefs of the 9th to 7th centuries BC display sieges of several Near Eastern cities. Though a simple battering ram had come into use in the previous millennium, the Assyrians improved siege warfare. The most common practise of siege warfare was, however, to lay siege and wait for the surrender of the enemies inside. Due to the problem of logistics, long lasting sieges involving anything but a minor force could seldom be maintained.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Edinburgh the tenth child of Francis James Braidwood, a cabinetmaker, and Janet Mitchell. He was educated at the Royal High School. He learned about the {{construction}} of buildings after joining his father's building firm as an apprentice, knowledge he was later to put to good use.Appointed Master of Fire Engines {{at the age of}} twenty-four, just two months prior to the Great Fire of Edinburgh, Braidwood established principles of fire-fighting that are still applied today. His training as a surveyor gave him exceptional knowledge of the behaviour of building materials and housing conditions in the Old Town of Edinburgh. He recruited to the service expert tradesmen - slaters, carpenters, masons and plumbers - who could apply their various fields of expertise to fire fighting. He also recruited experienced mariners for an occupation that required heavy manual work in hauling engines and trundling <b>wheeled</b> escape <b>ladders</b> up and down Edinburgh's steep streets, as well as nimble footwork when negotiating rooftops and moving through partially destroyed buildings. His many original ideas of practical organisation and methodology, published in 1830, were adopted throughout Britain. He was, however, resistant to the introduction of steam-driven engines. In 1833 he left Edinburgh to lead the London Fire Engine Establishment. The London Fire Engine Establishment had to fight a blaze at the Palace of Westminster, on 16 October 1834, that destroyed almost all of the Palace.|$|R

40|$|Primary {{motor cortex}} (M 1) {{contributes}} to the control of limb movements which have to be applied not only in isolation but also within purposeful sequences during everyday life. How the M 1 neuronal network encodes motion of individual limb joints and in particular how their encoding depends on contextual features of a movement sequence remains unclear. Here we combined two recent techniques to investigate these questions, optogenetic stimulation and two-photon calcium imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators. Using transgenic mice which express the light-excitable cation channel channelrhodopsin- 2 in cortical layer 5 neurons, we first applied optogenetic stimulation through a chronic cranial window to map the motor cortex. Without having to impair {{the architecture of the}} underlying neuronal networks with electrode penetrations, we were thus able to identify equivalent motor cortex circuits across mice that are involved in the control of proximal and distal forelimb joints. In the focal area of these M 1 circuits, we subsequently employed two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity in neuronal networks of layer 2 / 3 (L 2 / 3) while head-fixed mice moved across regularly or irregularly spaced rungs on <b>ladder</b> <b>wheels.</b> During skilled locomotion of the animals, we also tracked the motion in proximal and distal forelimb joints using high-speed videography. By predicting kinematics of the individual forelimb joint angles from M 1 L 2 / 3 network activity we discovered that finger motion was represented under both conditions whereas encoding of shoulder motion increased for the irregular pattern. Condition-related encoding differences of individual joints correlated with condition-related differences of their grasp-to-grasp variability during the entire movement sequence. This correlation persisted when we only considered discrete grasping actions on the regular and irregular pattern that featured equivalent kinematics in both conditions. We additionally classified three salient forelimb grasp types that occurred under both conditions ('standard', 'corrective', and near-slip 'digit tip' grasps). While the representation of finger motion was particularly high during digit tip grasps, the encoding of shoulder motion on the irregular pattern originated mainly from corrective grasps. Additionally, corrective and digit tip grasps, both of which are associated with an impending fall, could be directly predicted from the activity in neuronal networks of M 1 L 2 / 3. Our results suggest that neuronal populations in M 1 L 2 / 3 encode motion of individual joints according to their contextual relevance. In a learned movement sequence, neuronal networks incorporate the required grasp-to-grasp variability of individual joints as contextual signature to strengthen the representation of joints with frequent amplitude recalibration. Moreover, the encoding of motion in a joint is upregulated when its control seems to be especially relevant during the execution of a particular grasp type. Our findings are also associated with the forelimb deficits rodents modelling motor cortex stroke or Parkinson’s disease exhibit on the rung ladder, thereby providing a novel framework to investigate the cortical pathophysiology in these motor disorders...|$|R
