5|$|Though Rommel's forces placed {{more than}} a million <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> in fields, their effect on the {{invasion}} of Normandy was inconsequential. Later, in the French Riviera, only about 300 Allied casualties were attributed to the tactic.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Allied {{contact with}} Rommelspargel in Normandy was by British {{airborne}} forces. During Operation Tonga, the British airborne invasion of Normandy, Airspeed Horsa gliders landed among the <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> and suffered casualties. Some gliders were wrecked near Sainte-Mère-Église where Americans parachutists had also landed. Where encountered, British forces {{blew up the}} logs with dynamite and cleared landing fields for reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Rommel's {{asparagus}} refers {{specifically to}} <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> used against aerial invasion. The term {{has also been}} used to describe wooden logs set into the beaches of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean to disrupt amphibious landings of troops. Testing found these wooden defenses too weak to stop boats, and they were largely abandoned in favor of Hemmbalken ("obstruction beams") and other beach defenses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Insulation {{degradation}} {{leading to}} leakage current {{flow through the}} high voltage insulator {{is a major problem}} faced by various power distribution utilities. The excessive leakage current flow into the wooden supporting structures (<b>wooden</b> cross-arm and <b>pole)</b> leads to pole-top fires and subsequently power cut-off. Most prior researchers focused on flashover phenomena of insulators rather than investigation of leakage current leading to pole fire. This paper investigates the continuous current flow path originating from the high voltage conductor to various locations through the <b>wooden</b> <b>pole.</b> The results are of significance to the study of high voltage insulation whereby it extended the study of leakage current into the wooden supporting structures. Experiments were conducted on various locations of <b>wooden</b> <b>pole</b> to detect and track the leakage current flow. Also the moisture contents at these locations were measured to investigate its effect on the leakage current through the <b>wooden</b> <b>pole</b> structure. Key-Words:-Leakage current, <b>wooden</b> <b>pole</b> structure, moisture content, insulator and moisture content...|$|R
5|$|In November 1943, Rommel took {{command of}} the German Army Group B in {{occupied}} France. He also {{took control of the}} Atlantic Wall defenses on the French coasts facing the United Kingdom and during a tour of anti-invasion fortifications Rommel concluded that the defenses would have to be improved, and quickly. He ordered millions of wooden tree trunks and logs to be set against airborne forces. Barbed wire and tripwires were to be strung between the poles. On plans that Rommel sent to his subordinates, the complete system of <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> and interconnecting wires was called Luftlandehindernis.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the graves}} {{are marked by}} plain {{triangular}} stones set at one end. These are not carved or inscribed with names as in Christian cemeteries, but are similar to markers found in pagan cemeteries. Some graves are interrupted by stakeholes cut into them, possibly indicating the presence of <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> that might have served as markers or supported wooden structures within the graves. This is unusual {{in the north of}} England, though comparable examples have been found in Kent in the south-east.|$|E
5|$|The {{high bulk}} density of some ash {{deposits}} can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or {{the lines and}} structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) {{and there has been}} ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.|$|E

5|$|Wood {{was used}} for beams, and for lintels, even in masonry structures. Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples {{continued}} to be built from <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> and thatch. Adobe was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts. Like wood and thatch, adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of masonry structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.|$|E
5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with <b>wooden</b> <b>poles.</b> Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|Construction was of crossed <b>wooden</b> <b>poles,</b> {{driven into}} the {{waterlogged}} soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.|$|E

5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{moldboard}} iron plow: Although use of {{the simple}} wooden ard in China must have preceded it, the earliest discovered Chinese iron plows date to roughly 500 BC, during the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> and handles. By the 3rd century BC, improved iron casting techniques {{led to the development}} of the heavy moldboard plow, seen in Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) artwork such as tomb carved bricks. The moldboard allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without clogging the plowshare with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via slanted wings on both sides. While the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Warring States period (403–221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the moldboard attached to the top to turn the soil.|$|E
5|$|Many brick {{structures}} {{have been}} located at Kaveripumpattinam during on-shore, near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and {{a structure that}} looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery. At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that could have been used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.|$|E

5|$|While {{the other}} three grand pre-Columbian civilisations—the Maya, Aztec and Inca—are known for their grand {{architecture}} {{in the form of}} pyramids, stelae, stone cities and temples, the modest Muisca architecture has left very little traces in the present. The houses (called bohíos or malokas) and temples of the people, where spiritual gatherings took place honouring the gods and sacrificing tunjos, emeralds and children, were made of degradable materials such as wood, clay and reed. The circular structures were built on top of slightly elevated platforms to prevent them from flooding on the frequently inundated plains; small settlements of ten to one hundred houses were surrounded by <b>wooden</b> <b>poles</b> forming an enclosure, called ca in Muysccubun. Two or more gates gave entrance to the villages. The houses and temples themselves were built around a central pole of wood attached to the roof; the temples were constructed using the wood of Guaiacum officinale tree, giving high quality construction. The floors of the open spaced houses were covered with straw or, for the caciques, with ceramic floors. Cloths were attached to the roof and painted with red and black colours. The houses and sacred places were adorned with tunjos and emeralds, and in some cases with the remains of human sacrifices.|$|E

25|$|The {{people of}} Kintampo lived in open-air villages {{composed}} of rectangular structures made from wattle and daub construction techniques.

Rock shelters were also used as dwellings, especially to the south, near the Atlantic coast.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{the general}} {{population}} lived in large circular buildings (bohios), constructed with <b>wooden</b> <b>poles,</b> woven straw, and palm leaves. These houses, built surrounding the central plaza, could hold 10-15 families each. The cacique and his family lived in rectangular buildings (caney) of similar construction, with wooden porches. Taíno home furnishings included cotton hammocks (hamaca), sleeping and sitting mats made of palms, wooden chairs (dujo or duho) with woven seats, platforms, and cradles for children.|$|E
25|$|In his {{influential}} and meticulously annotated Latin {{edition of the}} works of Al-Haytam and Witelo Opticae thesauru (1572) German mathematician Friedrich Risner proposed a portable camera obscura drawing aid; a lightweight wooden hut with lenses in each of its four walls that would project images of the surroundings on a paper cube in the middle. The construction could be carried on two <b>wooden</b> <b>poles.</b> A very similar setup was illustrated in 1645 in Athanasius Kircher's influential book Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae.|$|E
