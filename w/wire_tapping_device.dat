40|$|A {{recent and}} {{carefully}} documented study of <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> concluded that although it 2 ̆ 2 {{is a crime}} in almost every state, and {{although there is a}} federal law prohibiting the interception and divulging of the contents of telephone communications, <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> is carried on virtually unimpeded in the United States today. 2 ̆ 2 This state of affairs is the culmination of many years of <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> history. Except for a one year interlude during World War I, <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> was a common practice {{both in and out of}} government until 1924 when Attorney General Stone banned tapping by the FBI as 2 ̆ 2 unethical tactics. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 The Stone policy continued in the Department of Justice until 1931 when Attorney General Mitchell announced that the Department would approve <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> when requested by the director of the bureau concerned. For the next nine years the Department of Justice countenanced <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> but only in criminal cases of 2 ̆ 2 extreme importance 2 ̆ 2 and never 2 ̆ 2 in minor cases nor on Members of Congress, or officials, or any citizen except where charge of a grave crime had been lodged against him. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Finally, in 1940, after the Department had lost three test cases under Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act, Attorney General Jackson announced a return to the Stone policy of 1924 forbidding <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> by the FBI. 2 ̆ 2 Under the existing state of the law and decisions, 2 ̆ 2 Jackson concluded, <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> 2 ̆ 2 cannot be done unless Congress sees fit to modify the existing statutes. 2 ̆ 2 But this policy of prohibition lasted for less than a year. In March, 1941, in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee urging the adoption of pending <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> legislation, Attorney General Jackson reversed himself with the pronouncement that the 2 ̆ 2 only offense under the present law [Section 605] is to intercept any communication and divulge or publish the same. Any person, with no risk of penalty, may <b>tap</b> telephone <b>wires...</b> and act upon what he hears or make any use of it that does not involve divulging or publication. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|Telephone <b>tapping</b> (also <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> or {{wiretapping}} in American English) is {{the monitoring}} of telephone and Internet conversations {{by a third}} party, often by covert means. The <b>wire</b> <b>tap</b> received its name because, historically, the monitoring connection was an actual electrical tap on the telephone line. Legal wiretapping by a government agency is also called lawful interception. Passive wiretapping monitors or records the traffic, while active wiretapping alters or otherwise affects it.|$|R
