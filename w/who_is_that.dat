500|$|A {{cardinal}}-nephew ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{a cardinal}} elevated by a pope <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cardinal's uncle, or, more generally, his relative. The practice of creating cardinal-nephews {{originated in the}} Middle Ages, and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries. The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice, when it appeared in the English language about 1669. From {{the middle of the}} Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) until Pope Innocent XII's anti-nepotism bull (a papal charter), Romanum decet pontificem (1692), a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule. Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals, and the nephew was the most common choice, although one of Alexander VI's creations was his own son.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, a 57-minute {{documentary}} on the Figwit phenomenon was created by McKenzie's fiancée (and now wife) Hannah Clarke and friends Stan Alley and Nick Booth. Entitled Frodo Is Great... <b>Who</b> <b>Is</b> <b>That?!!,</b> it premiered at the Auckland International Film Festival on July 23. Meant to [...] " [...] Bret's identity", it follows McKenzie to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and [...] "elvish good looks", and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites {{as well as with}} Peter Jackson, Barrie Osborne, Mark Ordesky, Ian McKellen, and other cast members. Booth stated that their film was [...] "much more irreverent and strange" [...] compared to other behind-the-scenes documentaries of the film trilogy, which were [...] "very much driven around the production and the cast and Tolkien".|$|E
500|$|On the {{creation}} of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained [...] "a little bit of [...] personality". Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E

They're trying to sabotage the Olympics in Beijing, and behind {{that is the}} hand of imperialism. We ask the world to support China to neutralize this plan. You see {{the images of the}} violence in Tibet. <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> against? Against China. It's the (U.S.) empire that wants to weaken China, because China is rising up." [...] Also according to Reuters, some leftists in Latin America see the Tibetan independence movement led by the Dalai Lama as a pro-Washington group of conservative monks.|$|E
2500|$|Two plays later, the Steelers faced 3rd {{down and}} 4 from the Dallas 17. Henderson sacked Bradshaw for a 12-yard loss, but {{the play was}} nullified by a delay of game penalty on Pittsburgh, {{bringing}} up 3rd down and 9 instead of a fourth down. Replays clearly showed the whistle blew before the play's onset, plus {{most of the players}} pulled up and stopped playing after a whistle sounded, but Henderson claimed, [...] "I didn't hear a whistle until after I had knocked Bradshaw down. [...] The same guy (Swearingen) made that call too. <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> guy?" [...] " [...] Franco Harris confronted Henderson for taunting Bradshaw after the whistle, and on the next play, Bradshaw handed the ball off to Harris, who raced untouched, with help from the Umpire Art Demmas impeding Cowboys safety Charlie Waters' attempt to tackle him, up the middle for a 22-yard touchdown run. [...] The next day Waters was quoted as saying, [...] "I don't know what I could do – maybe knock him [...] flat and maybe he'd knock Franco flat? [...] Our safeties {{play a vital role in}} the run. [...] That official gets in the way a lot. [...] He screened me off." [...] This score increased Pittsburgh's lead to 28–17. [...] The run would be the Steelers' longest touchdown run in Super Bowl competition until Willie Parker scampered 75 yards for a score against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, [...] "We sort of suckered people into this show [...] not {{presenting}} it {{as a science}} fiction show {{right out of the}} gate … Lost has really been about the long con, because {{by the time we get}} to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!"s Past and Future]", IGN. [...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox. [...] Paradox creates issues." [...] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that [...] "it is revealed who Locke actually is. [...] Although that's still kind of a mystery of <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>that.</b> [...] But there's still a pretty big revelation there." ...|$|E
