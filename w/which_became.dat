5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, <b>which</b> <b>became</b> Sohio, now part of BP.
