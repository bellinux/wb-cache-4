The green square of paper pinned round the lamp cast down a tender shade. On the dresser was a plate of sausages and <b>white</b> <b>pudding</b> and on the shelf there were eggs. They would be for the breakfast in the morning after the communion in the college chapel. <b>White</b> <b>pudding</b> and eggs and sausages and cups of tea. How simple and beautiful was life after all! And life lay all before him.|$|E

[...] Some versions of the recipe comprise pork meat and fat, suet, bread, and oatmeal or pearl barley formed into the shape of a large sausage - also known as 'Groats pudding' and are very similar to a <b>white</b> <b>pudding,</b> whereas others versions of the recipe contain a high percentage of offal such as lung and liver and can more accurately be described as a sort of West Country haggis. It is much spicier than <b>white</b> <b>pudding</b> as it contains black pepper, cumin, basil and garlic. The sausage is usually around two inches in diameter.|$|E

"The keen air {{has given}} me an appetite," [...] said the dear angel, as we entered the supper-room; and to say the truth, fairy as she was, she made a remarkably good meal--consuming a couple of basins of white soup, several kinds of German sausages, some Westphalia ham, some <b>white</b> <b>puddings,</b> an anchovy-salad made with cornichons and onions, sweets innumerable, and a {{considerable}} quantity of old Steinwein and rum-punch afterwards.

60|$|Kipps made a {{very special}} thing of his breakfast. Daily once hopeless dreams came true then. It had been {{customary}} in the Emporium to supplement Shalford's generous, indeed unlimited, supply of bread and butter-substitute, by private purchases, and this had given Kipps very broad, artistic conceptions of what the meal might be. Now {{there would be a}} cutlet or so or a mutton chop--this splendour Buggins had reported from the great London clubs--haddock, kipper, whiting or fish-balls, eggs, boiled or scrambled, or eggs and bacon, kidney also frequently and sometimes liver. Amidst a garland of such themes, sausages, black and <b>white</b> <b>puddings,</b> bubble-and-squeak, fried cabbage and scallops came and went. Always as camp followers came potted meat in all varieties, cold bacon, German sausage, brawn, marmalade and two sorts of jam, and when he had finished these he would sit among his plates and smoke a cigarette and look at all these dishes crowded round him with a beatific approval. It was his principal meal. He was sitting with his cigarette regarding his apartment with that complacency begotten of a generous plan of feeding successfully realized, when newspapers and post arrived.|$|R

50|$|In Ireland, as elsewhere, {{the exact}} {{constituents}} {{of a full}} breakfast vary, depending on geographical area, personal taste and cultural affiliation. The breakfast became popular there whilst Ireland {{was a part of}} the United Kingdom. Traditionally, the most common ingredients in Ireland are bacon rashers, pork sausages, fried eggs (or scrambled), <b>white</b> <b>pudding,</b> black pudding, toast and fried tomato. Sauteed field mushrooms are also sometimes included, as well as baked beans, hash browns, liver, and brown soda bread. Fried potato farl, boxty or toast is sometimes served as an alternative to brown soda bread. Limerick in particular has a long-standing traditional association with pork-based meat products.|$|E
5000|$|The crystal ooze, {{the deadly}} puddings (the black pudding, the brown pudding, the dun pudding, and the <b>white</b> <b>pudding),</b> the {{gelatinous}} cube, the gray ooze, the green slime, the ochre jelly appeared in second edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in Monstrous Compendium Volume One (1989).

60|$|The Sheep {{with the}} golden horns ordered that his chariot should be fetched, and a moment after {{appeared}} six goats, harnessed to a pumpkin, which was so big that two people could quite well sit in it, and was all lined with cushions of velvet and down. The Princess stepped into it, much amused at such {{a new kind of}} carriage, the King of the Sheep took his place beside her, and the goats ran away with them at full speed, and only stopped when they reached a cavern, the entrance to which was blocked by a great stone. This the King touched with his foot, and immediately it fell down, and he invited the Princess to enter without fear. Now, if she had not been so alarmed by everything that had happened, nothing could have induced her to go into this frightful cave, but she was so afraid of what might be behind her that she would have thrown herself even down a well at this moment. So, without hesitation, she followed the Sheep, who went before her, down, down, down, until she thought they must come out at {{the other side of the}} world--indeed, she was not sure that he wasn't leading her into Fairyland. At last she saw before her a great plain, quite covered with all sorts of flowers, the scent of which seemed to her nicer than anything she had ever smelled before; a broad river of orange-flower water flowed round it and fountains of wine of every kind ran in all directions and made the prettiest little cascades and brooks. The plain was covered with the strangest trees, there were whole avenues where partridges, ready roasted, hung from every branch, or, if you preferred pheasants, quails, turkeys, or rabbits, you had only to turn to the right hand or to the left and you were sure to find them. In places the air was darkened by showers of lobster-patties, <b>white</b> <b>puddings,</b> sausages, tarts, and all sorts of sweetmeats, or with pieces of gold and silver, diamonds and pearls. This unusual kind of rain, and the pleasantness of the whole place, would, no doubt, have attracted numbers of people to it, if the King of the Sheep had been of a more sociable disposition, but from all accounts it is evident that he was as grave as a judge.|$|R
5000|$|A breakfast roll {{typically}} {{consists of}} a bread roll or baguette containing one or more fillings such as sausages, bacon, <b>white</b> or black <b>pudding,</b> butter, mushrooms, tomatoes and tomato sauce or brown sauce. In some cases a hash brown or fried egg can be added. The roll itself is usually one of three varieties: a soft [...] "submarine"-type roll, a chunky, spherical dinner roll or a demi-baguette. The demi-baguettes are distributed to shops partially baked and frozen, allowing stores to quickly bake the bread for a [...] "freshly baked" [...] roll. An [...] "all-day breakfast" [...] sandwich featuring {{some or all of}} the above ingredients in a traditional sandwich of sliced bread may be used instead.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} sweetness, flavor, {{texture and}} overall acceptance of sucrose and fructose was determined at various sugar levels in sugar cookies, <b>white</b> cake, vanilla <b>pudding</b> and lemonade. Because {{of the reported}} increased sweetness of fructose and its increased tolerance in individuals with diabetes mellitus, the {{study was designed to}} investigate the possibility of fructose as an alternative sweetener. Taste panel members were used to evaluate the products. All products were served in duplicate and only data from those judges who had sampled both replications were used for the statistical analysis. Each product was prepared at 100 %, 50 % and 25 % of the specified recipe quantity, using three different sugars: sucrose, fructose equal to sucrose by weight and fructose equal to sucrose by volume. A second objective {{of this study was to}} determine if quantities less than suggested in traditional recipes for either sugar could be used without damaging product acceptability. The results of this study indicated that sucrose was both preferred and considered sweeter than fructose in sugar cookies, however; the reverse held true in lemonade. Based on the results of this study the author does not recommend that individuals substitute fructose for sucrose. In addition to panels comparing sucrose and fructose in baked products, the difference in diabetic and non diabetic taste sensitivity was also evaluated. Detection and recognition thresholds were determined for diabetic and non diabetic youth (19 - 15 yrs.) and adults (16 yrs. and older) for sweet, sour, salty and bitter taste stimuli. Diabetics showed a lower sensitivity, especially in older individuals, with the exception of sour stimuli. As previously reported, detection thresholds were lower than recognition thresholds. The youth groups were better able to detect the presence of stimuli at lower levels than the adult groups, however, they were not as good at recognizing the stimuli...|$|R
