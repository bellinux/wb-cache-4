500|$|However, not all reviews were favorable. Brian Lowry from Variety {{gave the}} series a mixed review, stating that {{he enjoyed the}} action {{sequences}} but that [...] "the soapier elements mostly fall flat", and called the series [...] "painfully old-fashioned". Mike Hale, from The New York Times, called the series [...] "average" [...] and [...] "good on the action, a little muddled on the ideas". He added that [...] "the tone is placid and slightly monotonous, as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> the Walton family {{at the end of}} the world".|$|E
500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Desert Strike {{underwent}} {{few changes}} from the plans {{outlined in the}} original design documents. The initial concept involved smoothly animated vehicles on an isometric playing field. The developers also aimed to include cinematic scenes, similar to The Revenge of Shinobis introduction sequence. The game began development some time before any discussion of an American invasion of Iraq, originally based on the Lebanese Civil War and titled Beirut Breakout; this was later changed to the Persian Gulf region. John Manley recalled, [...] "We actually wrote most of Desert Strike before Desert Shield happened. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> CNN {{at three in the}} afternoon {{and all of a sudden}} it was like, 'Oh my god - it's happening!'" [...] A special point system intended to punish players was omitted; the system would have deducted points from the player's score if they destroyed objects that resulted in negative economic and political results. The control scheme was not well received at internal reviews of the game's early versions, and Posehn had to alter his original design to obtain approval for further development.|$|E

I think that's what happened, and our art {{director}} goes, hey, that's not a bad idea. I think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> the Super Bowl, and we had some guacamole or something." [...] Because the album is self-titled, many fans refer to it as [...] "Avocado" [...] or [...] "The Avocado Album." [...] The cover was named in Pitchfork Media's top 25 worst album covers of 2006. The liner notes art features footage from the [...] "Life Wasted" [...] music video, directed by artist Fernando Apodaca. The photographs involve the band members with their skin decaying and animals crawling in and out of it, as Apodaca felt the songs, [...] "Life Wasted" [...] in particular, fit [...] "my interpretation of the how fragile life is". The album was also issued on a double vinyl.|$|E

(Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with {{the adoption of the}} 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: [...] "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> ... by the dim light of the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Smooth Noodle Maps, Devo's last album {{for twenty}} years, was released. It too was a {{critical}} and commercial failure which, along with its two singles [...] "Stuck in a Loop" [...] and [...] "Post Post-Modern Man", hold {{the distinction of being}} Devo's worst-selling efforts; all failed to appear on the U.S. charts. Devo launched a concert tour in support of the album, but poor ticket sales and the bankruptcy and dissolution of Enigma Records, who was responsible for organizing and financing the tour, caused it to be cancelled part way through. They had a falling out and played one final show in March 1991 before breaking up. In an interview with Mark Mothersbaugh from excerpts on their 1996 computer game [...] "Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol, [...] "Around '88, '89, '90 maybe, we did our last tour in Europe, {{and it was kind of}} at that point, <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> This Is Spinal Tap on the bus and said, 'Oh my God, that's our life.' And we just said, 'Things have to change.' So we kind of agreed from there that we wouldn't do live shows anymore." [...] Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film The Spirit of '76, except for Bob Mothersbaugh.

40|$|The 2012 European {{football}} Championships in Ukraine and Poland is {{only just}} another example of the connection between sport and politics. A positive effect of placing the Championships in Ukraine is that a more intense debate on the democratic deficit in Ukraine has emerged. That we should welcome. On the other hand, this can also lead to a situation where the regime in Ukraine benefit from the Championships, not least after the Championships have started and the general public becomes more interested in the games than in the political situation. Without doubt, sport can be used not only as means for political awareness but also as means for redirecting the severe political circumstances from the political scene to the football pitch, where the political objections are turned into athletic prowess among the football teams. Of course, {{it does not mean that}} the political problems have disappeared. They are still right in front of us, even when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> the games.
