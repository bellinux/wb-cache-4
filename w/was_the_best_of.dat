Reviewers thought the pack <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the set, and praised the Saints Flow superpowers sequence. Multiple reviewers questioned why the bee gun and superpowers were not unlocked in the main game.|$|E
5|$|Demaret {{took the}} team's second single-day win at the Tartu GP in late May. He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> a five-rider {{breakaway}} {{at the front}} of the race, one which included teammate Taaramäe. That same day, Gallopin took sixth in a sprint finish to the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan. The team's last race of the early season was Halle–Ingooigem in June, where Sijmens rode to ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{were widely}} varied for the episode: some felt it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the third season to date, {{and others were}} quite critical, though the overall mix was {{somewhat}} more positive than negative. A number of reviewers noted that tribute episodes {{have tended to be}} light on plot, though several felt that this episode had surmounted the usual storyline problems that had plagued past tributes.|$|E

5|$|Bruce {{set about}} {{applying}} his business principles to his cabinet, putting {{his experience as}} both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members {{up to speed on}} the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> several attempts.|$|E

5|$|James {{continued}} to be a key defensive player for the Browns in 1949, when the team won another AAFC championship behind a staunch defense and an offense led by quarterback Otto Graham and fullback Marion Motley. The AAFC dissolved after the season, however, and the Browns moved to the NFL. Cleveland's first year in the NFL <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> James's career: he intercepted nine passes, setting a club record that stood until 1978. The team finished the season with a 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. James made an interception in the game. He also held the ball for placekicker Lou Groza on the game-winning field goal with under a minute to play.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of {{games in the}} franchise, including all of the main series games, {{have led to a}} soundtrack album release. Many have also inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums as well. These albums have been produced and reprinted by a number of different companies, including DigiCube, NTT Publishing, Square Enix itself, and many others. Additionally, many albums have been made available at the iTunes Music Store. In addition to the regular albums, a number of compilation albums of pieces from several Final Fantasy games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups, both officially and unofficially. These albums include music directly from the games, as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles. Square Enix produced the first album, Final Fantasy 1987–1994 (1994) and has since produced 13albums, leading up to Final Fantasy Remix (2008). The first compilation album produced by an outside group <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> Final Fantasy 1994–1999: A Musical Tribute, released in 2000 by Sherman F. Heinig; the newest is Voices of the Lifestream, an unlicensed download-only album from OverClocked ReMix released in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Tomorrow Never Dies was {{the first}} of three Bond films to be adapted into books by then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson. Benson's version is {{expanded}} from the screenplay including additional scenes with Wai Lin and other supporting characters not in the film. The novel traces Carver's background as the son of media mogul Lord Roverman, whom Carver blackmails into suicide, later taking over his business. The novel also attempts to merge Benson's series with the films, particularly by continuing a middle-of-the-road approach to John Gardner's continuity. Notably it includes a reference to the film version of You Only Live Twice where he states that Bond was lying to Miss Moneypenny when he said he had taken a course in Asian languages. Tomorrow Never Dies also mentions Felix Leiter, although it states that Felix had worked for Pinkertons Detective Agency, which is thus exclusive to the literary series. Subsequent Bond novels by Benson were affected by Tomorrow Never Dies, specifically Bond's weapon of choice being changed from the Walther PPK to the Walther P99. Benson {{said in an interview that}} he felt Tomorrow Never Dies <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the three novelisations he wrote.|$|E

5|$|Transvaal {{began their}} reply strongly; their openers, Monty Bowden and John Hickson put on 69 {{runs for the}} first wicket, the {{majority}} being scored by Bowden. Once they lost their first wicket, the team continued to lose wickets at regular intervals; the second-highest partnership of the innings was the 17 runs made for the tenth, or last, wicket. George Glover <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the bowlers, collecting six wickets. Glover and Albert Rose-Innes bowled {{the majority of the}} overs, and took nine of the wickets between them. Bowden's score of 63 was substantially the best by any batsman in the innings, only John Piton, Spranger Harrison and Hickson scored more than 10 runs, and none managed as many as 20.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} summer, 1989, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> Bent's Worcestershire career. Although he {{had only}} a single (and unsuccessful) one-day outing, he played 13 first-class games and scored 530 runs {{at an average of}} just over 24. This was helped by a career-best innings of 144 against Kent at the end of July, in which he shared century partnerships with both Chris Tolley and Graeme Hick.|$|E
25|$|India added 129 {{runs for}} the loss of only Gambhir (83) in the morning session to go to lunch at 3/243. From the loss of Sachin Tendulkar (80), India {{collapsed}} from 3/271 to 7/286. India added 114 {{runs for the}} final three wickets, before being dismissed for 400 midway through the evening session, 68 runs short of making Australia bat again. Hilfenhaus (5/106) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the Australian bowlers.|$|E

Neumann refused but promised to update him. Stahlschmidt was nowhere to be found. He was posted as missing in action, and his exact fate remains unknown to this day. Recent research suggests that he may have been shot down by an American ace, Flight Lieutenant John H. Curry (RCAF; 7.5 claims), of 601 Sqn.|$|E
25|$|The 1907 season {{followed}} a similar pattern, in that Bailey's first {{appearance of the}} season was sensational and the rest was disappointment. In Somerset's first match, against Yorkshire at Taunton, he took eight wickets for 46 runs in the first innings, plus the only wicket that fell in Yorkshire's second innings: the innings return <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> his career. The fall-off in performance, though, was even more marked than in 1906 and he lost {{his place in the}} side well {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E

He won his blue, scoring 17 in his only visit to the crease as Cambridge beat Oxford by an innings. He passed fifty eight times in his 38 innings, although he never managed to go on to three figures; his highest score of the season was the 95 he hit for Cambridge against Warwickshire in June.|$|E
