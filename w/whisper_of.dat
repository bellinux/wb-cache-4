5|$|Studio Ghibli set up its {{headquarters}} in Koganei, Tokyo in August 1992. In November 1992, two television spots directed by Miyazaki were broadcast by Nippon Television Network (NTV): Sora Iro no Tane, a 90-second spot loosely based on the illustrated story The Sky Blue Seed by Reiko Nakagawa and Yuriko Omura, and commissioned to celebrate NTV's fortieth anniversary; and Nandarou, aired as one 15-second and four 5-second spots, centered on an undefinable creature which ultimately became NTV's mascot. Miyazaki designed the storyboards and wrote the screenplay for <b>Whisper</b> <b>of</b> the Heart (1995), directed by Yoshifumi Kondō.|$|E
5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of voices rather than bewitched by the soft <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> a single plea for inaction.|$|E

In Massachusetts, he was regarded with the same reverence as Harriet Beecher Stowe. He tutored with never a <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> scandal.|$|E

500|$|Miyazaki {{began work}} on the initial storyboards for Princess Mononoke in August 1994, based on {{preliminary}} thoughts and sketches from the late 1970s. While experiencing writer's block during production, Miyazaki accepted a request {{for the creation of}} On Your Mark, a music video for the song of the same name by Chage and Aska. In the production of the video, Miyazaki experimented with computer animation to supplement traditional animation, a technique he would soon revisit for Princess Mononoke. On Your Mark premiered as a short before <b>Whisper</b> <b>of</b> the Heart. Despite the video's popularity, Suzuki said that it was not given [...] "100 percent" [...] focus.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{said that}} the album was [...] "refreshing", and that Collins was [...] "adept" [...] at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood. Holden {{described}} [...] "Only You Know and I Know" [...] as an [...] "angry love song" [...] that had some sampling of [...] "Motown" [...] style music mixed in. [...] "In 'One More Night', Mr. Collins's recent number-one hit, a ticking snare drum injects a <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter, tenderer reprise of 'Against All Odds'", says Holden. Holden concluded by saying [...] "On the surface, No Jacket Required, is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes. But beneath its shiny exterior, Mr. Collins's drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive, enigmatic dialogue between heart and mind, obsession and repression." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1921, Lord Birkenhead, the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, {{had opposed}} {{a bill that}} would have criminalised {{lesbianism}} on the grounds that [...] "of every thousand women... 999 have never even heard a <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> these practices". In reality, awareness of lesbianism had been gradually increasing since World War I, but it was still a subject most people had never heard of, or perhaps just preferred to ignore. The Well of Loneliness made sexual inversion a subject of household conversation for the first time. The banning of the book drew so much attention to the very subject it was intended to suppress that it left British authorities wary of further attempts to censor books for lesbian content. In 1935, after a complaint about a health book entitled The Single Woman and Her Emotional Problems, a Home Office memo noted: [...] "It is notorious that the prosecution of the Well Of Loneliness resulted in infinitely greater publicity about lesbianism than if there had been no prosecution." ...|$|E
500|$|Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer {{gave it a}} 4.5 out of 5, {{describing}} it as [...] "painfully intimate and touchingly sentimental" [...] and [...] "the single most beautiful animated film ever created". Despite the film's length, Storm was impressed that Shinkai was able to connect his audience with his characters faster and more effectively than full-length films. He worried that some viewers might miss the subtle message of the film and {{view it as a}} [...] "by-the-books love story that can feel cliche or even trite". Curtis Stone of Geekenstein gave it a 5 out of 5 and rated it #1 in his top five list of anime for 2013. He praised not only the art and music, but especially the voice acting, which he felt was perfect for the final scene. Lindsay Nelson at Midnight Eye compared the film to <b>Whisper</b> <b>of</b> the Heart by Studio Ghibli for its poetic use of [...] "seemingly bland and uninteresting locations". She was impressed with both the sound and art, and particularly the sweeping view of the Docomo tower with the sunset in the background. However, she criticized it for its [...] "tearfully over-the-top climax", [...] "treacly" [...] pop theme song, and lack of reflective silence.|$|E
500|$|... "It's You" [...] {{was highly}} {{received}} by several music critics. Tim Sendra of AllMusic picked the track {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that [...] "his soaring falsetto on 'iT's YoU' is breathtaking." [...] Zach Frydenlund of Complex called it an emotional ballad that [...] "showcas his tremendous vocal abilities, which weren't on display like this previously." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent was also complimentary of his vocals and selected it {{as one of the}} tracks to download, writing that [...] "the drawn-out, melismatic title hook of 'It’s You' soars over the organ drone and piano." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine praised the [...] "Malik's surprisingly mournful vocals on the haunting" [...] song. Amy Davidson, writing for Digital Spy, named it [...] "a slice of slick R," [...] observing that [...] "the stripped back production lets his airy falsetto come through nicely, and the whole thing sits as perfectly stylised as his glorious quiff." [...] Lewis Corner of the same publication opined that, [...] "It's the most vulnerable Zayn sounds on the entire record, while his spire-scaling 'oooohs' are poignantly doleful." [...] Kate Solomon of Drowned in Sound was also positive to what she called [...] "his dreamy falsetto underpinned by a melancholy organ line and coupled madly with Top Gun guitars and Disney film strings." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as [...] "an elegant <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> a love song, part mellow soul burner and part post-Coldplay melancholia." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} theatrically with <b>Whisper</b> <b>of</b> the Heart on July 15, 1995. Chage & Aska {{also used the}} film in concerts. The first official screening took place at their fan club concert, held at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba, on June 29, 1995. Beginning July 5, 1995, the video was shown {{for the performance of}} the song during the Super Best 3 Mission Impossible tour. Featuring the same melody but different lyrics than On Your Mark, Castles in the Air was included on the English-language album One Voice: The Songs of Chage & Aska. Because of popular demand, On Your Mark was re-released separately in Japan on VHS and Laserdisc, on July 25, 1997. [...] On November 15, 2005, the film was released on the All Things Ghibli Special Short Short DVD with the video set to play the original [...] "On Your Mark" [...] or [...] "Castles in the Air" [...] songs. After Aska (Shigeaki Miyazaki) of the musical duo Chage and Aska was arrested for drug possession, Walt Disney Studios Japan removed On Your Mark from the upcoming DVD/Blu-ray box set containing Hayao Miyazaki's works and ceased shipments of All Things Ghibli Special Short Short. On October 27, 2014, Studio Ghibli's Toshio Suzuki announced on the company's web page that they had re-considered the situation and would be sending out Blu-ray discs to purchasers of the Hayao Miyazaki box set, as long as they could provide proof of purchase.|$|E

[...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a <b>whisper</b> <b>of</b> fear. I however was convinced that I was going to forget everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E
