5|$|Death (McKinney) is a grim reaper {{assigned}} to collects souls from Shuckton. He has personal vendetta against Ricky – <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aborted {{before he was}} born, but who survived the procedure because Death was late to collect his soul. When off duty, he hangs out at the tavern, drinking owl's blood and flirting with voluptuous red-headed women.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits {{what appears to be the}} visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E

25|$|Don Revie had {{recommended}} Johnny Giles as his replacement; however, the Leeds board instead appointed one of England's most successful and outspoken managers, Brian Clough, who had guided Derby County {{to the league}} championship in 1972. However, Clough arrived without his key assistant Peter Taylor, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{part of the deal}} agreed by Leeds chairman Manny Cussins, but instead decided to remain at Brighton. Clough was an outspoken critic of Revie and his team; in addition, his management style was in complete contrast to Revie's close relationship with his players and his methodical attention to detail.|$|E
25|$|After {{the normal}} lords was the tánaise ríg, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{heir to the}} throne. He had higher {{property}} qualifications than the aire forgill, but his prime claim to higher status {{was that he would}} one day be king. Kings held the highest status that the laws describe. The basic king had an honour price of seven cumals, and higher kings had yet a higher status. Having the highest status, the king especially was expected to be careful to keep his honour. Cowardice, as demonstrated in flight from battle, as well as taking up manual labour might cost him his honour-price.|$|E

25|$|Many reports erroneously {{stated that}} Borel's room {{was full of}} Nazi-insignia, and rumors he was sympathizing with fascist {{ideologies}} were spurred even more {{by the fact that}} his stepfather had attended several meetings of the Front National in 1989. But besides a picture of Adolf Hitler cut out from a newspaper, graffiti displaying a swastika on his door, a few books on World War II, as well as a documentary about David Koresh and the Waco siege, no evidence was found after his death that he was interested in any kind of politics. Also, a girl from Cuers spread the story that Eric had told her about his relationship with his half-sister Caroline, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his pregnant girlfriend. However, the sister in question did not exist, nor was it true that his father had died of cancer shortly before his rampage.|$|E
500|$|Novelist Salman Rushdie {{joined the}} band {{on stage in}} London's Wembley Stadium on 11 August 1993, despite the death fatwā against the author {{and the risk of}} {{violence}} arising from his controversial novel The Satanic Verses. In reference to the novel's satanic references, Rushdie, when confronted by Bono's MacPhisto character, observed that [...] "real devils don't wear horns". In 2010, Clayton recalled that [...] "Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [...] tell from Larry's face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible. For a man <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in hiding, it was remarkably easy to see him around the place." ...|$|E

As stars in space disappear and The Darkness approaches, Timmy arrives back on Earth and tracks his godparents down in Las Vegas, where the Middle-Aged Rock Festival (M.A.R.F.) is held. The M.A.R.F. features the rock band [...] Kiss, who reveal to Timmy that they are the galactic protectors of the white wand, which is their star-shaped guitar. The Darkness and Eliminators arrive at the venue, and the fairies arrive to defeat Eliminators while Timmy defeats The Darkness with a rock solo performance on the white wand.

McNichol described Bryan's win in the [...] "very good" [...] opener as memorable and [...] "a great way to inspire the crowd, who would become so important during the night". He said of the Orton–Christian match, [...] "Christian’s character development was excellent" [...] and that while the audience were initially [...] "pro-Christian, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing the heel" [...] (a villainous character), they eventually cheered Orton's post-match beatdown of Christian. McNichol described the main event as [...] "professional wrestling at [...] finest" [...] and [...] "probably the most gripping angle in wrestling this century". He said the audience's [...] "astonishing" [...] reception to the main event was as good as [...] "any major match you have ever seen or cared about in history", and the match itself [...] "was methodical, played to both wrestlers' strengths, and was beautifully paced".|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} {{begins with the}} {{introduction}} of two new cases: a bus accident that kills several of Veronica's classmates, and the death of PCH biker gang member Felix Toombs. A school bus carrying six Neptune High students and a teacher plunges off a cliff, killing all but one passenger. Veronica, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the bus, makes it her mission to discover why the bus crashed and who is responsible. Logan picks a fight with Weevil and the PCHers and ends up accused of killing Felix (a charge he denies). Partway through the season, Weevil becomes convinced of Logan's innocence and they team up to find the real killer. This season shows Veronica's life returning to much the way it had been before Lilly's death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the '09ers. However, her private-eye sideline and tough persona keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd. '09ers Dick Casablancas and Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas deal with a gold-digging stepmother, Kendall Casablancas, with whom they are left when their father flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive, and takes a romantic interest in Jackie Cook, the daughter of baseball legend Terrence Cook who is investigated for the bus accident. Veronica discovers that the town mayor, who years ago coached a little league baseball team, sexually molested several team members, including Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas. In the finale, it is discovered that Beaver is responsible for the bus accident and Veronica's rape, as well as a plane crash that kills the mayor (Veronica's dad was supposed to be on the plane, so she thinks he is dead). Veronica confronts Beaver {{on the roof of the}} Neptune Grand hotel, where he tries to kill her. Logan saves her, but Beaver commits suicide by jumping off the roof.|$|E
