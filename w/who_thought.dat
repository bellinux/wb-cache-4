5|$|As a child, Tolkien was {{bitten by}} a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, {{although}} he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his kraal to show him off, returning him the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles. These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (Christmas Shadows, 1850), Horatio Alger (Job Warner's Christmas, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man– or some <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> Dickens had got it wrong {{and needed to be}} corrected.|$|E
5|$|The 1930s road follows Telford's road {{as far as}} Bridge of Orchy, then runs to {{the east}} of Loch Tulla, while the old road runs to the other side. The project was criticised over spoiling the natural beauty of Glen Coe, but was defended by the Ministry of Transport <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> it would provide better {{transport}} links to Argyllshire and Inverness-shire.|$|E

5|$|Veronica Nicholson, {{a friend}} with {{connections}} in the publishing trade, persuaded David to continue writing, with the aim that she write a book. She showed some of David's work to Anne Scott-James, {{the editor of the}} British magazine Harper's Bazaar, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> the writing showed a widely travelled person with an independent mind. She offered David a contract, and David's work began appearing in the publication from March 1949.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants to keep them.|$|E

5|$|Another copy of {{the same}} book was put into auction on November 2016. It was {{auctioned}} for £ 368,750 on 12 December 2016. The book was auctioned by Sotheby in London. The book is a leather bound manuscript decorated with Rhodochrosite (A precious stone) and a silver skull. The copy does have a note by Rowling to Mr. Cunningham as follows “To Barry, the man <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> an overlong novel about a boy wizard in glasses might just sell … THANK YOU.” She has also added a note about the stone as “traditionally associated with love, balance and joy in daily life”.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the band's {{specific}} {{legal issues}} and {{insight into the}} making of the new album, the film also examines the state of the modern music industry as a whole, focusing on the complex relationships between major labels and their artists. Other musicians give their first-hand accounts of their own experiences in the business. The logistics and economics of how a record company works are explained by music industry insiders, including former EMI employees, music producers and music journalists. They trace the impact of the growing American economic recession on the industry, wherein many companies were taken over by larger groups <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> they could save them. In this instance, Terra Firma Capital Partners sought to rescue EMI despite having little experience in music management.|$|E
5|$|Carty and Brown were, {{according}} to Brown, childhood friends <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> {{of each other}} as cousins. Carty lived with his grandparents in Burrows Road, Kensal Green, and Brown {{lived with his mother}} in Rosebank Avenue, Sudbury, northwest London. Carty had one conviction for assaulting a police officer when he was 16 years old, and a caution for possessing cannabis. Brown had no previous convictions. The pair were members of a violent gang calling itself the KG Tribe, taking part in the unlawful wounding of two commuters in December 2005 as well as other robberies. At {{the time of the murder}} of Pryce, Carty and Brown were 18 and 17 respectively.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's success {{continued}} in the NFL in 1950, silencing skeptics <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> the team stood out {{only because of the}} poor quality of competition in the AAFC. After beating the defending NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles in {{the first game of the}} season, the Browns advanced to the championship game, where they beat the Los Angeles Rams 30–28 on a last-second Lou Groza field goal. Speedie had 548 receiving yards during the season and was selected for the NFL's first-ever Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E
5|$|Cotto's first {{fight of}} 2004, was a fourth-round {{knockout}} {{victory over the}} former world title contender Victoriano Sosa. This was after an eventful week prior to the fight, which included Cotto having to wait four hours for his luggage to arrive (after a 2 a.m. local time arrival) at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, and almost being removed from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the fight was held, by a security guard <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> he was an unaccompanied minor.|$|E

5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings {{that it was too}} dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|Ellqvist, on {{the other}} hand, had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life {{that could only be}} found in towns or cities. She wanted to settle down in a {{comfortable}} place with a husband and have children. Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support. When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E
5|$|First called Agaricus cinerellus by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1879, he {{transferred}} {{it to the}} genus Mycena that same year. In his 1936 Flora Agaricina Danica (Agaric flora of Denmark) Jakob Emanuel Lange referred it to the genus Omphalia; Omphalia cinerea (P. Karst.) J.E. Lange is now a synonym. Mycena cineroides was named and described as a new species distinct from M.cinerella by Hintikka in 1963, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> it to be unique due to its narrowly acute cap that lacked brownish or yellowish tones, decurrent gills, and two-spored basidia. However, intermediate forms of it have been found, and some authorities, like Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus, believe it {{should be treated as}} a synonym of M.cinerella.|$|E
