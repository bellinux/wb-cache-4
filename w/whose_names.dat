5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with nihonium (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Beonna was {{the first}} of the East Anglian kings whose coinage named both the ruler and his title. His coins are larger than the earlier sceattas, but are small when {{compared}} with the pennies produced in Anglo-Saxon England several decades later. As a whole, they provide an important dateable runic corpus and may reflect a distinctive East Anglian preference for runic lettering. Beonna had three moneyers <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> are known: Werferth, Efe and Wilred. The coins struck by Werferth are considered to be the earliest. His coins and those struck under the authority of Eadberht of Northumbria both contained 70% silver and were similar in type and detail, which suggests the possibility of producing a chronology for Beonna's coins, using the established sequence for the Northumbrian coins of Eadberht. However, as Eadberht's reign began in 738, several years before Beonna became king in East Anglia, the coins cannot be related to each other closely enough to construct a reliable chronology.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Marsh's rival Edward Drinker Cope {{also had}} {{unearthed}} several specimens {{of the large}} North American pterosaur. Based on these specimens, Cope named two new species, Ornithochirus umbrosus and Ornithochirus harpyia, {{in an attempt to}} assign them to the large European genus Ornithocheirus, though he misspelled the name (forgetting the 'e'). Cope's paper naming his species was published in 1872, just five days after Marsh's paper. This resulted in a dispute, fought in the published literature, over <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> had priority in what obviously were the same species. Cope conceded in 1875 that Marsh's names did have priority over his, but maintained that Pterodactylus umbrosus was a distinct species (but not genus) from any that Marsh had named previously. Re-evaluation by later scientists has supported Marsh's case, and found that Cope's assertion that P. umbrosus was a larger, distinct species were incorrect.|$|E

5|$|Though John Cole and the Carrs {{were among}} the first major music {{publishers}} in Baltimore, the city was home to a vibrant publishing tradition in the 19th century, aided by the presence of A.

Other prominent music publishers in Baltimore in this era included George Willig, Arthur Clifton, Frederick Benteen, James Boswell, Miller and Beecham, W. C. Peters, Samuel Carusi and G. Fred Kranz. Peters was well known nationally, but first established a Baltimore-based firm in 1849, with partners <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> remain unknown. His sons eventually joined the field, and the company, then known as W. C.

5|$|When he was18, Buxton {{returned}} to work with his old master, James Heap, as a journeyman. Heap often took Buxton on country walks in his spare time. The two collected herbs for diet drinks, either for Heap's use or to share with his neighbours. They often found plants of <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> they were ignorant, and so Buxton bought a copy of Culpeper's Complete Herbal. However, as he found the supposedly medicinal properties of the plants fanciful and the descriptions inaccurate, he soon became dissatisfied with it. In 1808 he procured {{a copy of the}} superior Meyrick's Herbal, from which he learned the first principles of the Linnaean system. Buxton soon outgrew this book, and began to borrow or buy as many books on botany as he could. Botanical practice at the time was to collect and dry plants, but as he disliked dead plants and preferred not to remove specimens that could be enjoyed by others, his botanical studies were confined to making observations.|$|E
5|$|Chris Stamper {{was born}} in 1958. He had a long-standing {{interest}} in electronics, and built an oscilloscope in his youth. While at university, he built a kit computer with an 8-bit processor and taught himself how to program by creating traffic light signalling software. He attended Loughborough University of Technology {{with the intent of}} earning degrees in electronics and physics, but left the university in 1981 to pursue computer programming full-time. Chris worked with arcade machine electronics, resolving software bugs and converting Space Invaders into Galaxian machines. He persuaded his brother Tim, two years younger (b. February 1961) to join him. The brothers worked as game designers at the arcade game company Associated Leisure with a college friend, John Lathbury. They followed the company's director when he started his own business, Zilec Electronics, which worked on arcade conversions. They worked on 12 arcade games, including Gyruss and Blue Print, and others <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> were kept secret and sold to other arcade manufacturers, including Konami and Sega. The job included international travel to Japan, where the brothers became acquainted with the Japanese game industry. During this time, Chris purchased, studied, and taught himself to program the new ZX80 processor within two years.|$|E
