5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E
5|$|In May2010, Brulé donated $10,000 to a fund {{assisting}} an Edmonton boy {{suffering from}} lymphatic cystic hydroma. The money was allocated to a costly surgery {{to be performed}} in New York, which doctors in Canada were unable to perform. Brulé received further media attention a year later for picking {{up a pair of}} hitchhikers <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Irish rock band U2 frontman Bono and his assistant in a West Vancouver neighbourhood on May31,2011. In return, Brulé was given backstage passes for him and his mother, for U2's concert in Edmonton on the next day. During the show, Bono thanked Brulé for the ride.|$|E
5|$|The event {{consisted}} of ten professional wrestling matches. The preliminary matches included a title defense by Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man against a surprise challenger, <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> The Ultimate Warrior. The Ultimate Warrior won the match in just 31 seconds to end Honky Tonk's 14 month title reign, the longest Intercontinental Championship reign in history. The main event was a match pitting The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage) against their long-time rivals, The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant). Hogan and Savage won the match after Miss Elizabeth, Savage's manager, distracted André and DiBiase, by removing her skirt {{to reveal a}} bikini bottom.|$|E

5|$|Nadanian {{was born}} on 19 September 1972 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, which then {{was part of the}} Soviet Union, to Sergei and Irina, both hairdressers. He was taught to play chess by his father when he was seven. His early coach was Rafael Sarkisov, who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku. In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects, that when he was nine or ten there were almost no chess tournaments in which young players could play with seniors and {{therefore}} he often went to the park near his house to play chess with older chess lovers. He remembers that in one of these park-battles he played against a mysterious, silent stranger <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov. In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under-sixteen Azerbaijani championship. With the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia.|$|E
5|$|While {{his work}} with Ziegfeld {{encompassed}} {{the majority of his}} working life, Stamper and Gene Buck worked for other producers as well. He had songs in two plays - When Claudia Smiles (1914) and Broadway and Buttermilk (1916) prior to traveling to London with Buck to write songs for Zig Zag! which ran for 648 performances at the London Hippodrome. Stamper returned to London in 1918 to write songs for another review Box O' Tricks with Frederick Chapelle, which ran for 625 performances. During his first trip to London, Buck befriended a man <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a German spy. Two results of this event were fellow passenger Eddie Rickenbacker deciding to enlist to fly, and Dave Stamper having to prove to British police and a Judge that his pages covered with numbers were sheet music rather than a code.|$|E
5|$|Cage {{fought for}} the NWA Championship once again at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 14, 2007 against Abyss and Sting, this time in a Three Way Elimination match. Cage prevailed this time around by pinning Sting after Abyss was already {{eliminated}} to win the championship. After Final Resolution, Cage prepared for his title defense against the new number one contender Kurt Angle, who had defeated Samoa Joe in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Final Resolution to gain the opportunity. Heading into their encounter at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 11, 2007, Cage announced on the January 17, 2007 episode of Impact! that he had hired a special consultant to assist him in training for his bout with Angle. This consultant was revealed on the February 8, 2007 episode of Impact!, <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Scott Steiner after he attacked Angle following a match pitting the team of Angle and Joe against Cage and A.J. Styles. Cage went on to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Angle at Against All Odds with Joe as the unofficial special outside enforcer.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom {{was in a state of}} high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E

25|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 1958 {{in a game}} against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he stepped from the batter's box swung his bat violently in anger.

He was an off-and-on student at Texas Tech University from 1974 to 1980 but eventually dropped out. In 1975 he went to Los Angeles in the hope of becoming a songwriter. His efforts were unsuccessful, and he wrote to his parents with tales of misfortune and pleas for money. He also spoke of a girlfriend, Lynn Collins, <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fabrication. In September 1976, he returned to his parents' home in Evergreen.|$|E
25|$|Beebe was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of the Revolution. One night he organized a public meeting at his house {{to talk about the}} Revolution. While he was addressing the people, gunfire was heard and fires were seen in the distance as if the British were coming. Beebe suspected this was a trick. So, he sent a small party by a back road to check it out and to cut off the retreat of this scouting party. They captured the culprits, <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> young men from the town who had burned some cornstalks and were playing a joke on the people at the meeting to test their patriotism.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 9 November, Lord Eldon was {{anchored}} off the Needles, and almost home. A brig approached her in the dark and the fog; seeing her, the crew fled below deck as they feared she was an English naval vessel come to try and press them. Actually, the brig was a French privateer, and the lack of a deck crew made it easy for the privateer’s men to board. Captain Young heard unusual sounds, went on deck, and raised the alarm. The crew returned to the deck and killed five privateers. Young himself then with a single blow of his sword, beheaded one man who was at the helm, <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the privateer’s boatswain. In the confusion the privateer escaped.|$|E

Lorna had gone behind the scenes at Felicia's talk show and {{switched}} the live footage with a pornographic videotape that Lucas and Felicia's adoptive daughter, Jenna Norris (Alla Korot), had unwittingly made. Felicia and Lucas ended up repairing their relationship with Lorna, but their time as a family was short-lived when Lucas was murdered. Meanwhile, Jenna found true love with rocker Dean Frame (Ricky Paull Goldin). Their happiness, and Dean's success as a rock star, was chronicled in the nighttime special, Summer Desire.|$|E
25|$|Louis' {{second wife}} Clementia was {{pregnant}} {{at the time}} of his death, leaving the succession in doubt. A son would have primacy over Louis' daughter, Joan. A daughter, however, would have a weaker claim to the throne, and would need to compete with Joan's own claims – although suspicions hung over Joan's parentage following the scandal in 1314. As a result, Louis' brother Philip was appointed regent for the five months remaining until the birth of his brother's child. The baby, <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> male, lived only five days, until 20 November 1316—an extremely short reign for Louis's posthumous son, John I. Louis' brother Philip then succeeded in pressing his claims to the crowns of France and Navarre.|$|E
25|$|Richard Perry and {{the other}} members of The Escorts were college students. When the summer concert season ended, Genya and Ginger began to look for a pianist and soon {{recruited}} Carol O’ Grady. Finding a female guitarist turned out to be much harder. Various ad-hoc recruits filled in as and when required, but when they accompanied Chubby Checker on his 1962 concert tour of West Germany and Switzerland, they performed without a guitarist. Organist Margo Lewis, <b>who</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the group's third permanent member, replaced Carol O'Grady and performed with the group on the Chubby Checker tour. The following year, Goldie and the Gingerbreads found guitarist and vocalist Carol MacDonald, who at the time was signed to Atlantic/Atco Records, and she joined Genya, Ginger and Margo and became the fourth permanent band member.|$|E
