6000|$|Japh. [...] To die! {{in youth}} to die! [...] And happier in that doom, [...] Than to behold the {{universal}} tomb, [...] Which I [...] Am thus condemned to weep above in vain. [...] Why, when all perish, <b>why</b> <b>must</b> <b>I</b> <b>remain?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Tow. I {{have some}} reasons, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> refuse the honour you intend me.|$|R
5000|$|From Is this My Destiny?: At night I toss {{and wonder}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> live while others die ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care <b>why!</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> {{write down}} what {{happened}} between Midwinter and me to-night, because <b>I</b> <b>must.</b> There's a reason that nobody can answer--myself included." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How strange!" [...] murmured Helen. [...] "But {{that could}} never bind ME. <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> live and fulfil my mission, my work in the civilized world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it can't be postponed," [...] he answered. [...] "If I {{could see}} you alone I could soon {{explain that to}} you. There are certain reasons <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> speak now." ...|$|R
60|$|Did I say, that thou mayst require justly {{an endless}} {{life in an}} earthly paradise? <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> add to that saying this proviso, If thou continuest in the law, and in the righteousness thereof; else not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't, upon my life. There's nothing I {{should like}} better, but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> {{with these two}} fellows. We are all three off {{together}} tomorrow morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must see," [...] he told her, {{after the}} moment they had looked into each other's faces, [...] "that this {{is the main reason}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> stay at St. John's, in the Church, if I conscientiously can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear me," [...] {{at last he}} said, {{when she}} had for the seventh time wildly proffered her hand and her kingdom in marriage, [...] "and know once and forever <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> decline your {{flattering}} proposal. I love another." ...|$|R
60|$|Never could I {{return to}} my native land. To {{the end of my}} days <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> in exile. Yet even these {{thoughts}} failed to dampen my ardor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is the bunda, mother?" [...] {{she asked}} eagerly. [...] "I'll {{see to it}} at once. And if the moths are in it, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> just patch the places up so that they don't show. Where is the bunda, mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|All this I said to Uncle 'Rasmus, {{striving to}} make him {{understand}} clearly <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> go on {{even though it was}} against my inclination, and when I was finally come to an end the old man said in a tone of resignation: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have found}} out who my patron is. It is not a {{fortunate}} discovery, and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune, anything. There are reasons <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> say no more of that. It is not my secret, but another's." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ronald {{shook his}} head. [...] "It {{is a matter}} in which I am {{personally}} concerned, sir, and I do {{not in any way}} exaggerate it. <b>I</b> repeat, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> in my present position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> on duty at the hotel. But {{perhaps the}} young lady is now safe at home, and we've been {{borrowing}} trouble. In case she's been stolen, however, you'd better see Fogerty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{she cried}} out, [...] "that is impossible. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> here. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> {{wait until they}} come back to me. I can't go now, and you must not desert me," [...] she ended, and in her voice was {{something}} very pitiful.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{we can do}} nothing. We {{can only}} wait. If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You {{can do what you}} will, but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> on guard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Officially, I {{have nothing}} to do with it. Until I have found that last link in my chain, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish <b>must</b> think <b>I</b> am working for her husband, not against him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he muttered, [...] "until {{the hour}} strikes, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> {{to you as}} to the world, alone or in a crowd--Everard Dominey. There is one way and one way only of {{carrying}} through my appointed task." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is not practical," [...] he declared. [...] "Think! I am as I {{have been}} {{addressed}} here, and as <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> yet for months to come--Everard Dominey, an Englishman {{and the owner of}} this house--the husband of Lady Dominey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It may all be true, {{lies and}} stink and all,' he said. 'But Hermione's spiritual {{intimacy}} is no rottener than your emotional-jealous intimacy. One can preserve the decencies, even to one's enemies: for one's own sake. Hermione is my enemy--to her last breath! That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> bow {{her off the}} field.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Foolish little woman!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Do {{you think}} that I am likely to forget? <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> have shared your supper nearly every night for a month, while I was walking about trying to find {{something}} to do. People don't forget who have lived through that sort of times, Ruth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do trust you," [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "I {{will tell you}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> refuse Ralph. <b>I</b> am nobody; I haven't even a name; the name I call myself is a lie. Ralph is a noble man. I love him with all my heart, but I can never be his." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well {{they are}} gone, and here <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> [...] This lime-tree, [...] . hill-top edge [...] Delighted wander, and look down, perchance, [...] On that same rifted dell, where the wet ash [...] Twists its wild limbs above, [...] . who hast pin'd ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Humph!' {{said the}} insinuating traveller, whose manner shrunk, and whose voice dropped {{when he was}} left alone. 'If they all go to bed, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> go. They are in a devil of a hurry. One would think the night would be long enough, in this {{freezing}} silence and solitude, if one went to bed two hours hence.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was your}} fault that I admired you,' {{returned}} her husband, {{with a look}} of pride in her, 'and why not your fault that he admired you? But, I jealous on that account? <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> go distracted for life, if I turned jealous of every one who used to find my wife beautiful and winning!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so must I--fight for my country," [...] he declared. [...] "That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> {{leave you}} {{for an hour}} now while I make some calls. I shall be back to luncheon. Directly {{afterwards}} we <b>must</b> start. <b>I</b> have many things to arrange first, though. Life {{is not going to}} be very easy for the next few days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure. My {{bones are}} all made of stick candy and my flesh is marshmallow. That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> keep myself covered with {{powdered}} sugar; otherwise I would melt or stick to everything I touched. My wife {{is made in}} the same way, and we are very proud to know we are very pure and wholesome." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. My companions {{will come}} here {{expecting to find}} me if they escape. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain,</b> {{whatever}} befalls. If the soldiers come, I will see them before they arrive, {{and give them the}} slip. If they give chase they will find it troublesome to catch me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then, Alf, do {{you carry}} the reel away fifty yards or so, and pay out the line as you go. Make {{a dozen of}} the Eskimos hold on with you till I come and {{regulate}} the pull. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> here to set it off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady, I {{would fly}} {{with you as}} willingly as bird ever fled from cage, but my doing so would {{occasion}} instant discovery and pursuit. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain,</b> and use means to disguise the truth for some time. May Heaven pardon the falsehood, because of the necessity!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>must</b> {{leave you}} now," [...] he remarked, as they drew near to this spot. [...] "I have to preach at Abbot's-Cernel at six this evening, and my way lies {{across to the}} right from here. And you upset me {{somewhat}} too, Tessy--I cannot, will not, say <b>why.</b> <b>I</b> <b>must</b> go away and get strength. ... How {{is it that you}} speak so fluently now? Who has taught you such good English?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>must</b> beg {{you to tell}} {{me which}} you mean to do. If you gave her half of all that is coming to you, of course <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>remain</b> here because you could not live here without me. Your income would be quite insufficient. But you do owe it to me to tell me at once what I am to do." ...|$|R
