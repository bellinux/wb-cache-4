5|$|According to Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, European {{hunters and}} Arctic explorers found <b>walrus</b> meat not {{particularly}} tasty, and only ate it {{in case of}} necessity; however <b>walrus</b> tongue was a delicacy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>walrus</b> (Odobenus rosmarus) {{is a large}} flippered {{marine mammal}} with a {{discontinuous}} distribution about the North Pole in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. The <b>walrus</b> is the only living species in the family Odobenidae and genus Odobenus. This species is subdivided into three subspecies: the Atlantic <b>walrus</b> (O. r. rosmarus) which lives in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific <b>walrus</b> (O. r. divergens) which lives in the Pacific Ocean, and O. r. laptevi, which lives in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Two {{subspecies}} of <b>walrus</b> {{are widely}} recognized: the Atlantic <b>walrus,</b> O. r. rosmarus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the Pacific <b>walrus,</b> O. r. divergens (Illiger, 1815). Fixed genetic {{differences between the}} Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow, but relatively recent separation, estimated at 500,000 and 785,000 years ago. These dates coincide with the hypothesis derived from fossils that the <b>walrus</b> evolved from a tropical or subtropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic. From there, it presumably recolonized the North Pacific Ocean during high glaciation periods in the Pleistocene via the Central American Seaway.|$|E

5000|$|Adult <b>walruses</b> {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by their prominent tusks, whiskers, and bulkiness. Adult {{males in the}} Pacific can weigh more than 2000 kg and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals. <b>Walruses</b> live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant amounts of {{their lives on the}} sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat. <b>Walruses</b> are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a [...] "keystone species" [...] in the Arctic marine regions.|$|R
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, the <b>walrus</b> {{was heavily}} {{exploited}} by American and European sealers and whalers, {{leading to the}} near extirpation of the Atlantic population. Commercial <b>walrus</b> harvesting is now outlawed throughout its range, although Chukchi, Yupik and Inuit peoples are permitted to kill small numbers {{towards the end of}} each summer.|$|E
5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern <b>walrus.</b> This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the <b>walrus</b> relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the <b>walrus</b> lacks external ear flaps. Walruses have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Sydney {{was fitted}} with a , cordite-powered {{revolving}} catapult between the two funnels, which was used to launch a Supermarine <b>Walrus</b> (sometimes described as a Seagull V) amphibious aircraft. The <b>Walrus</b> was operated by Royal Australian Air Force personnel from No. 5 Squadron RAAF (which was redesignated No. 9 Squadron RAAF in 1939). The 7-ton electric crane used to recover the aircraft also served to deploy most of the ship's boats.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. All known {{terrestrial}} haul-out {{sites for}} <b>walruses</b> in Svalbard (n = 79) were surveyed {{during the period}} 1 – 3 August 2006, and sites that were in use (n = 17) were documented using digital photography. A total of 657 <b>walruses</b> were counted on land in the resultant images. An extensive behavioural data set from <b>walruses</b> equipped with satellite relay data loggers, covering August 2002 to August 2005, was used to account for <b>walruses</b> {{that were in the}} water. The proportion of <b>walruses</b> at sea during the survey was calculated to be 0. 750 on the basis of 28 thirty-day periods from 23 male <b>walruses.</b> Time of day and wind chill did not significantly affect haul-out behaviour. However, a logistic regression model revealed both a correlation among haul-out patterns of individuals within years, and a year effect (χ 2 = 6. 42, df = 2, p = 0. 04). Because the survey was not flown in a year when satellite tags were deployed, the interannual variance was retained in a model (with no other explanatory variables). The over-dispersion parameter from this model was 2. 02 (deviance = 28. 33, df = 14). Thus, variance in proportions of time individuals spent at sea was multiplied by this parameter to achieve a corrected SE around the estimate. The 95 % CI based on this SE corresponded to a proportion of <b>walruses</b> at sea during the survey between 0. 717 and 0. 781, resulting in an estimated total number of walruse...|$|R

5|$|The {{scenes of}} <b>walrus,</b> bowhead whale, and caribou hunting are all real. Because the hunting season for caribou, polar bear, <b>walrus,</b> and whale {{occur at the}} same time, the {{production}} was forced {{to spend more than}} a year in the Arctic (covering two hunting seasons) {{in order to get the}} necessary footage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>walrus</b> has {{a diverse}} and {{opportunistic}} diet, feeding {{on more than}} 60 genera of marine organisms, including shrimp, crabs, tube worms, soft corals, tunicates, sea cucumbers, various mollusks, and even parts of other pinnipeds. However, it prefers benthic bivalve mollusks, especially clams, for which it forages by grazing along the sea bottom, searching and identifying prey with its sensitive vibrissae and clearing the murky bottoms with jets of water and active flipper movements. The <b>walrus</b> sucks the meat out by sealing its powerful lips to the organism and withdrawing its piston-like tongue rapidly into its mouth, creating a vacuum. The <b>walrus</b> palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>walrus</b> {{has played}} a {{prominent}} role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the <b>walrus</b> for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, walruses were widely hunted and killed for their blubber, <b>walrus</b> ivory, and meat. The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region. Their population has rebounded somewhat since then, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolated}} {{population of}} Laptev <b>walruses</b> is confined year-round {{to the central}} and western regions of the Laptev Sea, the eastmost regions of the Kara Sea, and the westmost regions of the East Siberian Sea. The current population of these <b>walruses</b> has been estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000.|$|R

5|$|The <b>walrus</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a <b>walrus</b> – possibly the original <b>walrus.</b> According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids. This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a <b>walrus</b> head.|$|E
5|$|Banjo and Kazooie are {{occasionally}} {{aided by}} their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a <b>walrus,</b> and a crocodile. These transformations {{have their own}} special features and allow the player to access areas that were previously inaccessible. For instance, the <b>walrus</b> can resist the effects of icy-cold water. Mumbo Tokens that are scattered throughout the game allow the transformation process. The game also includes cheats that the player can unlock by finding Gruntilda's spellbook, Cheato.|$|E

5|$|The archaic English {{word for}} walrus—morse—is widely {{thought to have}} come from the Slavic languages, which in turn {{borrowed}} it from Finno-Ugric languages. Compare морж (morž) in Russian, mursu in Finnish, morša in Northern Saami, and morse in French. Olaus Magnus, who depicted the <b>walrus</b> in the Carta Marina in 1539, first referred to the <b>walrus</b> as the ros marus, probably a Latinization of morž, and this was adopted by Linnaeus in his binomial nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|Traditional hunters {{used all}} parts of the <b>walrus.</b> The meat, often preserved, is an {{important}} winter nutrition source; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools, as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for warmth and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas. While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, <b>walrus</b> meat remains an important part of local diets, and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} consumed by the <b>walrus,</b> its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E
