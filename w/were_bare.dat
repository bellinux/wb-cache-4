5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Most of the plotting tables <b>were</b> <b>bare,</b> save for a few plots indicating German reconnaissance machines. Most of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) were relaxing, in spite of Churchill’s presence (he had ordered that they not behave any differently). However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet <b>were</b> <b>bare,</b> and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E

60|$|Oliver {{looked across}} the brook, and saw there, upon a bank, under some trees, a spot which <b>was</b> <b>bare.</b> The reason why it <b>was</b> <b>bare</b> <b>was,</b> that the snow had nearly all blown off during the storms; and then the sun, which had been shining for some days so pleasantly, had melted away what there had been left; and now the ground <b>was</b> <b>bare,</b> and almost dry. But the {{difficulty}} was to get to it; for it was upon {{the other side of}} the stream, and the bed of the stream was filled with water and ice.|$|R

25|$|The first prototypes <b>were</b> <b>bare</b> chassis with {{rudimentary}} controls, {{seating and}} roof; test drivers wore leather flying suits, {{of the type}} used in contemporary open biplanes. By the end of 1937 20 TPV experimental prototypes had been built and tested. The prototypes had only one headlight, all that was required by French law at the time. At the end of 1937 Pierre Michelin {{was killed in a}} car crash; Boulanger became president of Citroën.|$|E
25|$|No {{suitable}} engines {{were available}} to give a sufficient advantage over the British Napier Lion, so the simplest possible chassis was constructed and three war-surplus Liberty aero engines were squeezed into it. The vehicle was simple, with no clutch or gearbox and only a single fixed ratio. Once running by a push start, it had to keep rolling. Driver comforts were minimal: the forward engine was sheathed in a crude attempt at streamlining, the two side-by-side behind it <b>were</b> <b>bare,</b> with the driver perched {{between them and the}} one in front.|$|E
25|$|Gillemont and Ginchy lay on spurs, which {{constricted}} the British {{right flank}} and commanded {{the ground to}} the south, in the French Sixth Army area. During {{the time when the}} German third line and intermediate lines and redoubts, were being completed on the rear slopes of Bazentin Ridge, Allied attacks had become smaller and periods of wet weather, the terrain, supply and ammunition difficulties, combined with the German policy of unyielding defence and the reinforcements reaching the German 1st and 2nd armies, slowed the Anglo-French advance, particularly south of the Somme. The German second line ran north-west, from the French sector near Maurepas to Wedge Wood, behind Arrow Head Copse, in front of Guillemont, past the station and thence to Delville Wood and Longueval, before turning sharply west. The approaches to the village <b>were</b> <b>bare</b> and overlooked by German posts in Leuze Wood. A quarry west of the village and the ground to the south, from Maltzhorn Farm to Angle Wood and Falfemont Farm had been fortified.|$|E

Ammunition was in short supply because some had been ruined by the rain and river. Rations were exhausted, clothing was soaked, and swollen feet became a problem. Counting only men from the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, 188 men <b>were</b> <b>bare</b> footed after having to cut off their boots. About [...] of their return trip was made dismounted as the force took small obscure trails through the mountains.

500|$|As it happens, a Frenchman named Victor Tissot {{happened}} to be in Berdichev when Goldfaden's company was there. He saw two plays – Di Rekruten, first premiered in Botoşani, and the later Di Shvebleh (Matches), a play of intrigue. Tissot's account of what he saw gives an interesting picture of the theaters and audiences Goldfaden's troupe encountered outside of the big cities. [...] "Berdichev," [...] he begins, [...] "has not one cafe, not one restaurant. Berdichev, which is a boring and sad city, nonetheless has a theatrical hall, a big building made of rough boards, where theater troupes passing through now and then put on a play." [...] Although there was a proper stage with a curtain, the cheap seats <b>were</b> <b>bare</b> benches, the more expensive ones were benches covered in red percale. Although there were many full beards, [...] "there were no long caftans, no skullcaps." [...] Some of the audience were quite poor, but these were assimilated Jews, basically secular. The audience also included Russian officers with their wives or girlfriends.|$|E

500|$|Law {{found the}} soil poor, {{since it had}} been farmed for a half-century. The fields <b>were</b> <b>bare,</b> and cows gave poor-quality milk: [...] "I had to begin {{at the bottom and}} repair the waste of fifty years." [...] He {{improved}} the soil's fertility by arranging for manure from New York City streets and stables to be regularly brought to his farm; for four years, twenty carloads of manure a week were spread on the land. As a result, the farm's hay yield increased from two to five tons. Law also decided to improve the area's roads, giving them a base layer of large, closely packed stones and layers of top gravel. He developed his herd; at first the farm had weak cattle (many afflicted with tuberculosis) and [...] "ordinary milk", but after Law's development the farm had strong cattle, healthy calves and an abundance of rich milk. Law hired Leonard Pearson (a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Pennsylvania) to check each cow every six months for tuberculosis and other diseases, exceeding New York City Board of Health standards.|$|E
500|$|In October 1942 at {{the rank}} of brigadier general, he {{returned}} to India where he organized and commanded the India Air Task Force (IATF) of the Tenth Air Force under General Clayton Bissell. In Bissell's re-organization, five commanders reported to him: Haynes ran the IATF, Chennault ran the CATF, Robert F. Tate ran the India–China Ferry Command, Robert C. Oliver ran the Tenth's service arm and Francis M. Brady operated the large air base at Karachi. Haynes's task force assembled three bomber groups: the 7th BG Heavy, the 51st Fighter Group and the 341st BG (Medium). On paper were more squadrons not yet prepared for war—some had no aircraft, some had too little training and some <b>were</b> <b>bare</b> cadres. Haynes used what few aircraft were available, mostly war-weary medium bombers. The bombing missions often included in their payloads some of the [...] "Compliments of" [...] leaflets as {{a continuation of the}} defiant response to Tokyo Rose. Men under Haynes noted that the general was never flown by others—he always did his own flying. He emphasized operational preparedness and self-motivation, yet his personal style put people at their ease. Sergeant John Boyd observed that Haynes was [...] "not a desk general but a field and operations commander who believed in getting things done." [...] One of the earliest offensive efforts made by the new task force was a multi-stage [...] voyage from the main base at Karachi, through various Chinese airfields with the ultimate goal of attacking the docks of Hong Kong and returning. During this attack, Life journalist Theodore H. White rode in one of the bombers, and wrote a story about the experience for the magazine. On October 25, ten B-25 Mitchells led by Haynes took off on the final leg from an advance airfield at Kunming, accompanied by seven P-40s commanded by Scott. The small force destroyed a transport ship, bombed Hong Kong's vital Kowloon Harbor and claimed 27 enemy aircraft for the loss of one bomber and one fighter. Haynes asked Bissell for more Norden bombsights—the Mitchell mediums shared only two between all the squadrons, and their supplied D-8 bombsights were ones Haynes considered to be of no value.|$|E

After much correspondence with the Education Dept. the Palm Beach School No. 4458 opened 1929. The renaming of the town occurred in 1930. Despite a few very small land subdivisions for housing, Somers has not seen any major development since the 1920s and has retained much of its remnant bush land on the foreshore.

2500|$|Additionally, Frank Bernhard {{criticizes the}} metaphors Shakespeare used to {{describe}} the passage of time, be it the coming of death or simply the loss of youth. [...] Though lyrical, they are logically off and quite cliché, being the overused themes of seasonal change, sunset, and burn. [...] In fact, the only notably original line is the one concerning leaves, stating that [...] "when yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang, upon those boughs". [...] Logic would require that few should proceed none; in fact, if the boughs <b>were</b> <b>bare,</b> no leaves would hang. [...] Bernhard argues that Shakespeare did this on purpose, evoking sympathy from the reader as they [...] "wish to nurse and cherish what little is left", taking him through the logic of pathos – ruefulness, to resignation, to sympathy. [...] This logic, Bernhard asserts, dictates the entire sonnet. [...] Instead of moving from hour, to day, to year with fire, then sunset, then seasons, Shakespeare moves backwards. [...] By making time shorter and shorter, the reader's fleeting mortality comes into focus, while sympathy for the speaker grows. [...] This logic of pathos {{can be seen in the}} images in the [...] sonnet's three quatrains. [...] Bernhard explains: ...|$|E
