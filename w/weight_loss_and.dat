5|$|A {{number of}} factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to {{experience}} menstrual irregularities due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, anovulatory cycles can occur {{as a result of}} adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E
5|$|Cats are obligate carnivores: their {{physiology}} {{has evolved}} to efficiently process meat, {{and they have}} difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> can be rapidly fatal. Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing macular degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible blindness.|$|E
5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E

5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> jaundice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia {{and other}} muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity is high and the primary care setting enables treatment to be offered to large numbers of people. This thesis investigates behavioural weight management interventions in primary care. A noninferiority {{analysis was used to}} examine whether four behavioural weight management programmes differed in <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> at three <b>and</b> 12 months. Commercial programmes resulted in similar <b>weight</b> <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> the NHS programme was inferior at three months, with an inconclusive result at 12 months. GPs can refer patients to commercial weight management programmes, however not all people use these types of programmes. There is a need to find simple effective interventions that can be offered in primary care. Self-weighing may be one such strategy for weight loss; a randomised controlled trial investigated this. There {{were no significant differences in}} <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> between baseline <b>and</b> three months. Self-weighing may be more effective for <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> maintenance as people have developed skills to manage their weight. A quasi randomised controlled trial was used to investigate this and found encouragement to self-weigh prevented 0. 7 kg weight regain. A systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effect of self-weighing. Overall, self-weighing as part a multicomponent <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> intervention resulted in greater <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> but isolated there was no evidence of effectiveness. In conclusion commercial weight management programmes result in similar <b>weight</b> <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> patients could be referred to such programmes by primary care. Self-weighing may be an effective strategy that primary care practitioners could advise patients to use combined with other behavioural strategies...|$|R
5|$|The most {{characteristic}} initial {{physical symptoms}} are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction {{by at least}} three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain {{that is responsible for}} movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> a decrease in meat quality.|$|E
