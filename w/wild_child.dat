We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a <b>wild</b> <b>child.</b> He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Isobel" [...] was filmed {{for two days}} in a forest in Dolgellau, near Llangollen, Wales. The crew used a Mitchell S35 camera with varispeed {{to be able to}} rewind the camera and do superimpositions and masks, {{inspired}} by Georges Méliès' work. The final music video was projected in 35mm for the crew in a cinema in London; with its varying exposures, lighting effects and monochromatic scheme, it resembles an early film. [...] "Isobel" [...] represents the story of the title character Björk envisioned with Sjón. It tells the story of [...] "a <b>wild</b> <b>child</b> discovering urban culture through installations of toy fighter planes", over lush superimposed imagery. Like in the lyrics, where Björk takes the role of narrator and protagonist, she plays two different parts in the music video: Björk is seen as the Isobel who [...] "weaves and composes this world and this story on her organ", and as the Isobel who inhabits this primal world. Water is the primary feature of her world, Gondry using it as a dreamy transition tool between scenes. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine included the video in his list of the Top 10 Björk Music Videos, describing it as [...] "surreal [...] visually striking". Ed Gonzalez of the same publication described it as [...] "Jean Epstein-ian kabuki horror." [...] The music video for [...] "Hyperballad" [...] has been described as [...] "a techno-dream visual story full of flashing lights, buzzing static, and holograms." [...] It shows Björk as [...] "a character running through a landscape that simulates that of a computer game, only to throw herself off a cliff." [...] The clip is an attempt to reflect the song's story, so Gondry depicted Björk lying down as a dead body, with a holographic image of her singing superimposed on her. Rick Poynor writes, [...] "White metamorphosed her head, using cyberscan data, into a stone." [...] The video demonstrated the musician's [...] " [...] the computer's shape-shifting powers." [...] Music writer Carol Vernallis felt Gondry developed texture with an aesthetic that does not become [...] "too coy or sickly sweet" [...] by incorporating [...] "a whiff of death"; pointing out that in the video, [...] "Björk's head resembles a death mask". Henry Keazor and Thorsten Wübbena considered that the clip [...] " [...] taught us that electronic bodies are rather intangible, dematerialized, purer in a certain way." [...] The music video, with its play on the boundaries between real and virtual, has been absorbed by club culture, {{as a representative of the}} scene's visual forms of expression.|$|E
