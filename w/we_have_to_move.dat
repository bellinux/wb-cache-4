I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa' and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for us to look at our past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward at all.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regards to}} his {{contract}} issues with Liverpool, Gerrard {{told the press}} after the final, [...] "How can I leave after a night like this?" [...] but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005, after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea, Gerrard's agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer. Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard, saying, [...] "Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on. We have done our best, but he {{has made it clear}} he wants to go and I think it looks pretty final." [...] The next day, Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides. Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one premier league medal than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by the Three Rocks Research website that, in fact, [...] "Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)" [...] betrays Woody Guthrie's lack of understanding regarding the Bracero Program. [...] (Though arguably this is addressed in the lines [...] "Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted, Our work contract's out and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on.") The program {{was a series of}} laws and diplomatic agreements created by the U.S. Congress in 1942, that permitted Mexican farm laborers (or braceros) to work in the United States due to the severe labor shortages caused by World War II. [...] Under the terms of the program, the labor contractors were expected to provide transportation to and from the Mexican border, with the U.S. Immigration Service being required to repatriate the Mexican citizens if the contractor defaulted. [...] As such, the [...] "deportation" [...] of braceros in this fashion was simply a way of meeting the obligations of the program—although some newspapers, e.g., the New York Times, did refer to the braceros as [...] "deportees". [...] However, {{it could be argued that}} Guthrie's song is less about the Bracero Program itself and more a comment on the attitude of American society and the media towards the Mexican farm laborers.|$|E

Sam moved the boat again. We worked up the flat nearer where the little mangroves, scarce a foot high, lifted a few leaves out of the water.
