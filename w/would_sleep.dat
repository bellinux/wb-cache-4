5|$|Aciu Widjaja, now President-Director of Air Asia, {{described}} Chrisye as {{a simple}} man and said that one time, when he, Chrisye, and several others had gone overseas Chrisye {{was the only one}} who did not look for brand-name clothing or world-class restaurants; instead he ate at a food court and bought what he felt was comfortable. In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E
5|$|According to Dickens {{specialist}} Trey Philpotts, {{the newest}} arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner {{who was living}} alone. A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> in the tap room or find another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor side of the building, near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.|$|E
5|$|The Portishead line again saw {{a rise in}} {{use during}} the Second World War, as Bristolians {{evacuated}} to the more rural areas of Pill and Portishead commuted in to work, many alighting at Clifton Bridge and walking across the Cumberland Basin bridges, the Rownham Ferry now obsolete. During air raids, people <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> aboard carriages in the station sidings, or in Clifton Bridge No. 1 tunnel north of the station. The station was also used during the war for timber traffic from the local woodlands, loaded onto trains {{by members of the}} Women's Land Army. Other freight traffic included goods from the Ashton Containers factory and a local firm dealing in herbal medicine.|$|E

Therefore, Lieutenant Nately, who is madly in love with her, cannot convince her to engage in a meaningful relationship with him. She engages him sexually, but it is cold and mechanical, for she refuses to spend any time with Nately without pay.

25|$|Days later, Mulder {{repeated}} her allegations, {{this time}} to a weekly magazine in an interview conducted in her Paris apartment. Within hours of the interview, her sister Saskia arrived and took her to Villa Montsouris, a psychiatric hospital specializing in such disorders as depression, anxiety, and delirium, where she stayed for five months. The stay reportedly was paid for by Elite models president Gérald Marie, {{an old friend of}} hers and one of the accused. (It came after the BBC caught Marie on hidden camera trying to give a 15-year-old model £300 for sex, and bragging about Elite Model Look competitors he <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> with that year.|$|E
25|$|The Seiryo-den sits to {{the west}} of the Shishin-den, facing east. It, too, has a hipped and gabled roof, and is {{primarily}} cypress wood. Originally a place where the Emperor would conduct his own personal affairs, the Seiryo-den was later used for various gatherings and meetings as well. In the centre is an area where the Emperor would rest, and on the east side of the hall, an area of two tatami was set aside for dignitaries and aristocrats to sit. Here was where the Emperor could conduct formal affairs. On the north side of the hall was an enclosed area where the Emperor <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> at night; later, Emperors began to use the official residence. The west side was set aside for the Emperor's breakfasts, and also contained the lavatories, while the south side was used by the keeper of the Imperial Archives. This area contained paintings by the masters of the Tosa school, and just outside, various rare bamboos were planted.|$|E
25|$|A morning {{market is}} {{held on the}} central square during weekends. These are the only days when the {{residents}} of Thimphu can buy fresh fruit and vegetables. The inhabitants rely on the supermarkets for other provisions throughout the week. The market also sells yak butter, cheese, wooden bowls and fabrics. A number of cheap souvenirs from Nepal are also sold at the market. Behind the open market, several shops sell Chinese and Bangladeshi crockery, appliances, shoes, silks and carpets. For many years merchants {{would come to the}} central square from all over Bhutan and market their goods and <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> in the open air. However, in 1986, platforms were erected and in 1989 covered market halls were built over the platforms. A special building for meat products was constructed {{on the north side of}} the market. In 2006, the handicrafts section was moved to the new stalls on the other side of the new bridge, built in the traditional style in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Flight day six {{was devoted}} to {{transfer}} operations, and the two crews worked through the morning to complete all the rack transfers. Magnus and Chamitoff successfully installed the two crew quarters racks into the Harmony node, and installed a rack with equipment {{to be returned to}} Earth into the MPLM. During the Mission Status briefing, Lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that all the racks were now on station, and about 25% of the cargo transfers had been completed, which was slightly ahead of schedule. The two crews also began working on activating the Water Recovery System, so that samples of water from two areas could be taken and returned to Earth with Endeavour. The system's initial checkout was initiated, and water samples would be taken after several days of operation. Later in the day, the two crews reviewed procedures for the mission's second EVA, and Stefanyshyn-Piper and Kimbrough <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> in the station's airlock as part of the pre-EVA campout procedure.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco was popular, {{both for}} {{personal}} use, and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Each person brought {{at least two}} changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred {{once or twice a}} month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel. Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.|$|E
25|$|Women {{were the}} primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and {{everyday}} life. Fears that collectivization {{would result in the}} socialization of children, the export of women’s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm “under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.” Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away with a lot more.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to making}} Kill the Irishman, Reid did {{research}} on Greene's life and organized crime in Cleveland. He spoke with Sister Barbara Eppich, a nun, who helped raise Greene during his childhood. Sister Eppich told Reid of how Greene was abandoned during childhood and {{was raised by}} his grandfather. Because his grandfather worked nights, Greene was left to walk the streets. He would go to school dirty on a regular basis, so Sister Eppich would have to wash him. She also stated that Greene <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> all the time, but was a [...] "phenomenal athlete".|$|E

500|$|In about 1780 a water-powered cotton mill {{was built}} for Robert Peel on the River Irwell near Radcliffe; the mill {{employed}} child labour bought from workhouses in Birmingham and London. Children were unpaid and bound apprentice until they were 21. [...] They boarded on an upper floor of the building, and were locked in. [...] Shifts were typically 10–10.5hours in length (i.e. 12 hours after allowing for meal breaks), and the apprentices 'hot bunked' : a child who had just finished his shift <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> in a bed only just vacated by a child now just starting his shift.

500|$|Richard Elfman {{had never}} gone to film school when {{production}} started, and [...] "I didn't know what I was getting into." [...] The production, {{from its original}} 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members <b>would</b> <b>sleep</b> on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film's cast {{was made up of}} non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of [...] "Bim Bam Boom", but when he was put in front of the camera, he stood there as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright's lips over the actor's face. Another scene featured homeless men.|$|E
