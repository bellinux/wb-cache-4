40|$|Subject {{of study}} {{is the effect of}} {{additives}} on the structure formation of cement. Improvement of the re-sistance to aggressive media of materials for <b>wet</b> <b>rooms.</b> Objective is to develop a scientifically grounded composition of a plaster dry construction mix with increased water resistance and funginertness, with the use of locally available materials and man-made waste. The study was carried out by standard methods of research using XRF and DTA. The hydrophobic fungicidal additive based on the polymer residue of turpentine production and fly ash with the ratio by weight ZU: PO = 1. 15 : 1 was developed. It has been established that while adding the de-veloped additive in an amount of 2. 5 % of the mass of cement, the rate of hydration of cement minerals and resistibility of the sand-cement mortar decrease in early strength with medium workability concrete mix. This creates conditions for the formation of a dense structure with increased resistance to aggressive envi-ronments. Using new hydrophobic fungicidal additive, a dry plaster mortar for <b>wet</b> <b>rooms</b> has been developed. It has increased water resistance values corresponding to the W 8 grade and funginertness especially with respect to A. Niger, the pathogen and widespread decomposer. The additive is effective; it is developed on the basis of industrial wastes and recycled materials. Its use in the composition of materials with increased requirements for watertightness and biostability makes it pos-sible to reduce their cost and environmental stress, to increase the efficiency of the use of natural re-sources. The use of the developed plaster mixture will increase the resistance of walls of <b>wet</b> <b>rooms</b> to aggressive environments...|$|R

40|$|The Wisconsin Department of Transportation WISDOT) has {{sponsored}} investigations on {{the causes of}} freeze-thaw scaling damage on Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) roadways within the state that are coated with membrane forming curing compounds (MFCCs). Several studies have identified excess bleed water {{at the time of}} curing compound application as a potential cause of reduced scaling resistance of concrete pavements. Increasing the delay between concrete finishing steps and MFC application should serve to lessen scaling damage. However, there is currently no literature that sought to quantify a possible linkage between MFCC application time and the scaling resistance. The primary goal of this research was to evaluate the influence of MFCC application time on the freeze-thaw scaling damage resistance of roadway concrete made with materials native to Wisconsin. A factorial experiment was designed to probe the effect of MFCC application time on scaling damage as measured by ASTM C 672. Three emulsion-based curing compounds, Linseed Oil, Wax, and Poly-alpha-methyl-styrene (PAMS) were evaluated at three application times on concrete specimens prepared with one of two sources of coarse aggregate and one of three cementitious materials. An Acrylic solvent-based sealing compound was evaluated at two application times with respect to concrete scaling resistance. Untreated specimens from each mix type were cured in a <b>wet</b> <b>room</b> and tested as controls. A secondary goal of this project was to evaluate a new method for determining the presence of bleed water on a concrete surface by constructing a device to detect changes in the relative humidity of the air above the concrete surface over time to more reliably determine the cessation of the bleeding than current methods. To achieve this goal, a device was built and its operational capability was tested during the study. ii Concrete mixes were designed and specimens were prepared according to WISDOT procedures to provide a good representation of the pavements within Wisconsin. Freeze-thaw scaling damage testing was performed on all specimens and data was recorded following the appropriate testing standard. Properties such as fresh concrete slump, air content, 28 -day compressive strength, and curing compound application rates were measured and recorded to ensure compliance with WISDOT standards. Results in this study indicate that the influence of MFCC application time on the scaling resistance of concrete is dependent upon the compound chosen. The Linseed Oil and Acrylic formulations displayed significantly increased scaling resistance with an increase in application time. The Wax and PAMS formulations did not display significant increases in scaling resistance with an increase in application time. Results from the untreated <b>wet</b> <b>room</b> cured specimens indicate that curing compounds do not promote scaling resistance levels that compare favorably to the humidity control method <b>wet</b> <b>room</b> curing. Scaling resistance was also found to be dependent upon composition of the concrete, especially with respect to the coarse aggregate and cementitious material choice. Elevated levels of ambient relative humidity at the time of specimen manufacture appeared to decrease the scaling resistance, regardless of application time. The device was found not to be reliable for monitoring the presence of bleed water in its current design. Analysis of the data collected by the device showed that future modifications could be made improve its operational capability...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTested super sulfated cements (SSC) are {{composed}} of various amounts of ground granulated blast furnace slag, gypsum or activated gypsum and Portland cement. Our initial results on the optimization of the composition and of the curing conditions of such cements are presented herein. Tests are conducted {{on the basis of}} standard mortar with two different water/binder ratios according to old and new standards for SSC. Four types of curing are used: laboratory, <b>wet</b> <b>room</b> and immersion at 20 °C or 40 °C. Mechanical performances are assessed at 2, 7, 28, 60 and 90 days on standard mortar samples (binder/sand mass ratio = 1 / 3). This study shows that thanks to an optimization of the Portland cement content, it is possible to obtain super sulfated cement with a strength class 32. 5 N (for samples immersed in water at 20 °C). These samples are always in conformity with the new European standard. For a given SSC formulation, it is noticeable that the origin of the calcium sulfate addition affects the setting and hardening phenomena. The use of heat-activated gypsum as a sulfate activator appears preferable...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{ventilation}} is {{to guarantee}} a good indoor air quality, related to the energy consumed for heating and fan(s). Active or passive heat recovery systems seem {{to focus on the}} reduction of heating consumption at the expense of fan electricity consumption and maintenance. In this study, demandcontrolled mechanical extract ventilation systems of Renson (DCV 1 and DCV 2), based on natural supply in the habitable rooms and mechanical extraction in the <b>wet</b> <b>rooms</b> (or even the bedrooms), was analysed for one year by means of multi-zone Contam simulations on a reference detached house and compared with standard MEV and mechanical extract ventilation systems with heat recovery (MVHR). To this end, IAQ, total energy consumption, CO 2 emissions and total cost of the systems are determined. The results show that DCV systems with increased supply air flow rates or direct mechanical extract from bedrooms can significantly improve IAQ, while reducing total energy consumption compared to MEV. Applying DCV reduces primary heating energy consumption and yearly fan electricity consumption at most by 65 % to 50 % compared to MEV. Total operational energy costs and CO 2 emissions of DCV are similar when compared to MVHR. Total costs of DCV systems over 15 years are smaller when compared to MVHR due to lower investment and maintenance costs...|$|R

40|$|MONICAIR - MONItoring & Control of Air {{quality in}} Individual Rooms - is a pre-competitive field {{research}} project {{of a broad}} consortium of Dutch ventilation unit manufacturers and research institutes, supported by the Dutch government. The first aim of the project is to investigate and compare the indoor air quality (IAQ) performance and energy characteristics during the heating season of ten different mechanical ventilation solutions in dwellings that meet strict air-tightness standards and comply with current building regulations. The second goal is to further improve the ventilation systems on their IAQ-performance while minimizing their energy consumption. Over a full year 62 residential dwellings were monitored with, in each habitable room, sensors for occupancy, CO 2, relative humidity and air temperature. Power consumption of the mechanical ventilation units was also continuously monitored. The ventilation solutions included traditional mechanical exhaust ventilation or MEV systems (systems with mechanical exhaust in the <b>wet</b> <b>rooms),</b> state-of-the-art MEV systems (systems with mechanical exhaust in all rooms), {{as well as local}} and central balanced systems with heat recovery (MVHR-systems), with various types of controls. Although all systems under investigation comply with building codes, the data show that huge differences occur in both the IAQ and energy performance. CO 2 excess dose (above 1200 ppm) may vary per dwelling from 10 to 850 kppmh per person per heating season, resulting in a situation in which respectively 1 to approximately 85 % of the time spent at home, the ventilation is not sufficient in the room that one occupies.
