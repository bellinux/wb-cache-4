25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms have to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly {{take account of the}} role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to {{be the best way to}} start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
500|$|Jason Cowley, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} The Guardian, felt that Outliers was an argument between Gladwell and himself, referring to the many times that he uses the word [...] "we" [...] when defining his position, {{such as in the}} example: [...] "There is something profoundly wrong <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> look at success. [...] We cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that {{the world in which we}} grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all." [...] He also believed that there was a [...] "certain one-dimensional Americanness at work", observing that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States, particularly in New York City. In an article about the book for The New York Times, Steven Pinker wrote, [...] "The reasoning in 'Outliers,' which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle." [...] In a review in The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner called the final chapter of Outliers [...] "impervious to all forms of critical thinking".|$|E
500|$|Over {{several days}} in December 1986, U2 {{travelled}} with Corbijn and Averill on a bus around the Mojave Desert for a photo shoot. The group stayed in small hotels and shot in the desert landscape, beginning at Reno, Nevada, before moving to locations in California such as the ghost town of Bodie, the Harmony Hotel in Twentynine Palms, Zabriskie Point, Death Valley Junction, and other sites in Death Valley. Corbijn rented a panoramic camera to capture more of the desert landscapes, but having no prior experience with the camera, he was unfamiliar with how to focus it. This led to him focusing on the background and leaving the band slightly out of focus. Corbijn said, [...] "Fortunately {{there was a lot}} of light." [...] Averill filmed portions of the trip with an 8 mm film camera. The photo shoots took place in the mornings and evenings, with mid-days spent travelling and on preparation. Corbijn later recounted that the main idea of the shoot was to juxtapose [...] "man and environment, the Irish in America". Averill said of their photographic approach, [...] "What I was trying to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> shot the pictures and framed the cover was to suggest the landscape vision and cinematic approach that was taken to the recording." ...|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Wimbledon. Wright after six minutes gave Arsenal the lead, only for Vinnie Jones to {{head in the}} equaliser, close to half time. Merson scored Arsenal's second, but Marcus Gayle replied immediately, [...] "bund the ball past (David) Seaman". An own goal by Nigel Winterburn against Manchester United ended the champions run of three matches without a win and {{extended}} a barren run of Arsenal failing to score at Old Trafford since {{the creation of the}} Premier League. Wenger told the press he was not despondent about his first defeat as Arsenal manager: [...] "Obviously, the way we lost was difficult to accept, but I'm happy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> played. Our organisation was excellent, we kept fighting and I am very optimistic for the future." [...] Attention soon turned to the North London derby, where Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur on 24 November 1996. Arsenal had not beaten their neighbours in over three years and Tottenham were unbeaten at Highbury since September 1991. The match had ramifications in the league: a win potentially placed Arsenal in a position to move into first spot, if other results went in their favour. In the match, Wright put Arsenal into the lead through a penalty, but after 57 minutes, Sol Campbell headed on a long throw for Tottenham and the ball fell to Andy Sinton, whose shot [...] "cannoned off the inside of the near post, then hit Lukic on the head and rebounded into the net". Two minutes before the 90-minute mark, Tony Adams scored the winner and in injury time, Bergkamp added a third: he controlled a high ball with his left foot and evaded his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to shoot. A 2–1 win against title challengers Newcastle United, having played three-quarters of the match with ten men, moved Arsenal back {{to the top of the}} table.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter what— sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she could come out of that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E

Mofaz later admitted that the limitations imposed on the media were a mistake. Head of the Operations Directorate, General Dan Harel, said: [...] "Today, I would send a reporter in every APC". IDF Spokeswoman, Miri Eisen, said {{the decision not to}} allow reporters into the camp was a difficult one: [...] "The press people said 'Listen, the journalists aren't going to like it' and the operational people said 'We don't care about the journalists right now and about our image, we don't want them inside.' It had to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> were working operationally inside the camp.

60|$|Apart {{from the}} special doctrines {{advocated}} by Kant, it is very common among philosophers to regard what is a priori as in some sense mental, as concerned rather <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> must think than with any fact of the outer world. We noted in the preceding chapter the three principles commonly called 'laws of thought'. The view which led to their being so named is a natural one, but there are strong reasons for thinking that it is erroneous. Let us take as an illustration the law of contradiction. This is commonly stated in the form 'Nothing can both be and not be', which is intended to express the fact that nothing can at once have and not have a given quality. Thus, for example, if a tree is a beech it cannot also be not a beech; if my table is rectangular it cannot also be not rectangular, and so on.|$|E

Its length, indeed, we made a shift to fathom out; but who was {{to tell us how}} that length {{compared}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> had to go? Day after day, there would be always some of us stolen out to the Devil's Elbow and making estimates of the descent, whether by a bare guess or the dropping of stones. A private of pioneers remembered the formula for that--or else remembered part of it and obligingly invented the remainder. I had never any real confidence in that formula; and even had we got it from a book, there were difficulties {{in the way of the}} application that might have daunted Archimedes. We durst not drop any considerable pebble lest the sentinels should hear, and those that we dropped we could not hear ourselves. We had never a watch--or none that had a second-hand; and though every one of us could guess a second to a nicety, all somehow guessed it differently. In short, if any two set forth upon this enterprise, they invariably returned with two opinions and often with a black eye in the bargain. I looked on upon these proceedings, although not without laughter, yet with impatience and disgust. I am one that cannot bear to see things botched or gone upon with ignorance; and the thought that some poor devil was to hazard his bones upon such premises revolted me. Had I guessed the name of that unhappy first adventurer, my sentiments might have been livelier still.|$|E
