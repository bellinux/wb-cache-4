Germany also made use of gas against Russia on the Eastern Front, where the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in deaths of over 56,000 Russians, while Britain experimented with gas in Palestine during the Second Battle of Gaza. Russia began manufacturing chlorine gas in 1916, with phosgene being produced later in the year. However, most of the manufactured gas was never used.|$|E

50|$|The first {{method of}} {{employing}} gas in World War I was by releasing {{it from a}} cylinder when the wind was favourable. Such an approach was obviously prone to miscarry if {{the direction of the}} wind was misjudged.

40|$|The first {{large-scale}} use of {{a traditional}} {{weapon of mass destruction}} (chemical, biological, or nuclear) involved the successful deployment of chemical weapons during World War I (1914 – 1918). Historians now refer to the Great War as the chemist’s war because of the scientific and engineering mobilization efforts by the major belligerents. The development, production, and deployment of <b>war</b> <b>gases</b> such as chlorine, phosgene, and mustard created a new and complex public health threat that endangered not only soldiers and civilians on the battlefield but also chemical workers on the home front involved in the large-scale manufacturing processes. The story of chemical weapons research and development during that war provides useful insights for current public health practitioners faced with a possible chemical weapons attack against civilian or military populations...|$|R

50|$|The Prairie View Co-eds also {{engaged in}} rather extreme tours {{during the summer}} months. They were {{constant}} professionals and worked with the Moe Gale Agency, Gale being {{the owner of the}} Savoy Ballroom. Touring was difficult during this time period as many problems were encountered with the rationing that occurred because of the <b>war.</b> <b>Gas</b> and rubber for tires were rationed, and oftentimes the only reason the Co-eds had access to ration coupons for these items was because of their work with the USO. Touring seemed to be worth it though, as the Prairie View Co-eds were lucky enough to play such places as the Apollo Theater. The fact that they were listed as Co-eds was important too, as it confirmed them as symbols of educated African Americans, as well as being youthful and attractive.|$|E
50|$|Artillery {{dominated}} the battlefields of trench warfare. An infantry attack was rarely successful if it advanced beyond {{the range of}} its supporting artillery. In addition to bombarding the enemy infantry in the trenches, the artillery {{could be used to}} precede infantry advances with a creeping barrage, or engage in counter-battery duels to try to destroy the enemy's guns. Artillery mainly fired fragmentation, high explosive, or, later in the <b>war,</b> <b>gas</b> shells. The British experimented with firing thermite incendiary shells to set trees and ruins alight. However, all armies had experienced shell shortages during the first year or two of World War I, due to underestimating their usage under intensive combat. This knowledge had been gained by the combatant nations in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 when daily artillery fire consumed ten times more than daily factory output but had not been capitalised on.|$|E

5000|$|In a war which {{broke out}} on Earth, it is presumed that Germany and Russia formed a large empire {{stretching}} from Asia to Central Europe and ended {{the war by}} entering into an unstable alliance with the Southers. The ruling political party of the Norts, the Nordland Party, urged their armies to colonise the various planets deep in Souther space, including Nu-Earth. The early Nort colonists lived in the desert and tamed its wild animals. Years later, when {{it was discovered that}} the black hole near the planet led {{to other parts of the}} Galaxy, the Norts declared war and launched a preemptive attack on Fort Neuropa, starting the [...] "Nu-Earth Future war".

50|$|Before {{their use}} in chemotherapy, alkylating agents were better known for their use as sulfur mustard, ("mustard gas") and related {{chemical}} weapons in World War I. The nitrogen mustards were the first alkylating agents used medically, {{as well as the}} first modern cancer chemotherapies. Goodman, Gilman, and others at Yale began studying nitrogen mustards at Yale in 1942, and, following the sometimes dramatic but highly variable responses of experimental tumors in mice to treatment, these agents were first tested in humans late that year. Use of methyl bis (B-chloroethyl)emine hydrochloride (mechlorethamine, mustine) and tris (B-chloroethy) amine hydrochloride for Hodgkin's disease lymphosarcoma, leukemia, and other malignancies resulted in striking but temporary dissolution of tumor masses. Because of secrecy surrounding the <b>war</b> <b>gas</b> program, these results were not published until 1946. These publications spurred rapid advancement in the previously non-existent field of cancer chemotherapy, and a wealth of new alkylating agents with therapeutic effect were discovered over the following two decades.|$|E
50|$|Turpinite, {{also called}} Turpenite, is a fictional <b>war</b> <b>gas</b> {{allegedly}} {{developed by the}} French chemist Eugène Turpin and deployed against the attacking German army during {{the first months of}} World War I. According to contemporary accounts, Turpinite, delivered by artillery shells, silently and suddenly killed any person within 400 yd of impact with its fumes. Survivors of Turpinite barrages reported a strong chemical smell after an attack. In reality, this smell was a side effect of the explosives used by the French and British militaries during the war. The widespread, sudden deaths caused by artillery were in many cases caused by concussion, which leaves no mark on the victim. After the war, German scientist Fritz Haber, who pioneered German gas attacks at the Second Battle of Ypres, said German soldiers had reported a strong chemical smell attributed to turpenite. Haber and others investigated, finding the smell was due to incomplete combustion of the picric acid used in British artillery shells. The belief that the French used chemical weapons in 1914 may have contributed to later German use of such weapons.|$|E
50|$|The 1915 Battle of Ypres, {{the first}} {{engagement}} of Canadian {{forces in the}} Great War, changed the Canadian perspective on war. Ypres exposed Canadian soldiers and their commanders to modern war. They had already experienced the effects of shellfire and developed a reputation for aggressive trench raiding despite their lack of formal training and generally inferior equipment. They were equipped with the frequently malfunctioning Ross rifle, the older, lighter and less reliable Colt machine gun and an inferior Canadian copy of British webbing equipment that rotted quickly and fell apart in the wet of the trenches. In April 1915, they were introduced to yet another facet of modern <b>war,</b> <b>gas.</b> The Germans employed chlorine gas to create {{a hole in the}} French lines adjacent to the Canadian force and poured troops into the gap. The Canadians, operating for the most part in small groups and under local commanders, fired into the flanks of the German advance, forcing it to turn its attention onto the Canadian sector. For three days, Canadian and reinforcing British units fought to contain the penetration with a series of confused and suicidally brave counter-attacks while using handkerchiefs soaked in urine to neutralize effects of the gas. What the Canadians lacked in expertise, they made up for in sheer guts and determination. One in every three of them became a casualty. The senior Canadian officers did not exactly shine during this time; they were inexperienced and lacked communications with most of their troops, but they learned. Notable among these was Arthur Currie, a brigade commander who was later to become the commander of the Canadian Corps and who was to appoint as his divisional commanders only those who had fought well in this engagement. The battle cost the British Expeditionary Force - BEF (of which the Canadian Corps was a part of) 59, 275 men and the Canadian Expeditionary Force over 6000. The Canadians developed a great respect for gas and over the duration of the war, they became particularly adept in its use.|$|E
25|$|World <b>War</b> II <b>gas</b> masks {{contained}} {{blue asbestos}} in their filters. It is unknown how long for certain {{the material was}} used in filters.

50|$|Early World <b>War</b> I <b>gases</b> were unreliable, as {{they could}} easily be blown back on the troops that {{deployed}} them. There were three main agents used: mustard gas, chlorine, and phosgene. This prompted the use of gas masks. Early on, improvised gas masks were made by urinating on a handkerchief and putting it over their nose and mouth so the urea would disable the poison.|$|R
