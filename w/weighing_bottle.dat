40|$|The {{theory of}} the {{coagulation}} of particles in laminar shear flow was applied {{in a study of}} the aggregation of red blood cells. The theory predicts that in a system of initially dispersed particles the total particle concentration would decay (because of aggregation) logarithmically with time with the decay rate, depending on the adhesiveness of the particles. The applicability of this theory was tested at 4 different shear rates (G = 5 - 0 s" 1, 12 - 6 a" 1, 15 - 7 s" 1 and 23 - 3 s" 1) for normal red blood cells in plasma. At every shear rate it was found that an equilibrium condition was approached after 10 - 20 min, suggesting that the equation is valid only during the first 10 - 20 min of the aggregation process. Having established the time period over which the theory is valid, values for the stability ratio of red blood cells were computed. The stability ratio, which is essentially a measure of the adhesiveness of the cell*, is defined as the ratio of the number of effective collisions (collisions resulting in adhesion) to the total number of collisions. A very simple shearing technique was used. The suspension of red blood cells was placed in a small <b>weighing</b> <b>bottle</b> and the shearing force was provided by a small magnetic stirring rod, whose rotational frequency could be controlled.

The densities of these objects have been obtained from the volume as determined by high-precision hydrostatic weighing and by measurements of the dimensions and from the mass as determined by weighing in an actual vacuum (2 ̆ 2 vacuum <b>weighing</b> <b>bottle</b> 2 ̆ 2). The density of air obtained by weighing this 2 ̆ 2 absolute density cylinder 2 ̆ 2 and counterweight has been compared to the density calculated from measurements of the atmosphere, made at the same time in a constant temperature room ((+OR-) 0. 075 (DEGREES)) and with high-precision instruments, of the barometric pressure and temperature and gravimetric determination of water and carbon dioxide contents. The density of air determined by the cylinder was 3. 4 parts per thousand greater than that calculated from the prevailing conditions. Possible explanations for the discrepancy have been examined with particular reference to the oxygen content of the atmosphere; the discrepancy is left unexplained but it is recommended that for the high-precision measurement of mass that the density of air be measured with a cylinder such as the one described;A method has been proposed for the high-precision determination of the oxygen content of the atmosphere;Modifications of the Mettler single-pan balances have been described to increase capacity and sensitivity and eliminate electrostatic effects;It has been proposed to replace the International Kilogram with a kilogram mass of a corrosion-resistant stainless steel the surface of which has been rendered nonpolar by chemical treatment and to subdivide the kilogram in an actual vacuum using a set of weights constructed on the basis of the Fibonacci sequence.

40|$|Authors: Hongbao Xin, Rui Xu & Baojun Li ### Abstract The {{protocol}} {{reported here}} describes an optical method for flexible manipulation of particles and cells. Using a tapered optical fibre probe launched with a laser at 980 -nm wavelength, particles and cells can be stably trapped, targeted driven to designated positions, and flexibly arranged into desired patterns. This method provides a highly potential avenue for highly flexible and precise manipulation of biological objects. ### Introduction The ability of manipulating mesoscopic particles and cells with high precision and flexibility {{is extremely important}} {{for a wide variety}} of fields from physics, biochemistry, to biomedicine. Particularly, the ability of arranging particles and cells into desired patterns precisely is a challenge for numerous physical and biological applications. Conventional optical tweezers (COTs) based on standard microscopes by focusing free space light beams using high-numerical-aperture objectives, have been widely used for manipulate objects ranging in size from tens of nanometers such as proteins and DNA molecules, to tens of micrometers such as colloidal particles (1), and are constantly delivering new insights and discoveries (2 - 4). However, the relatively bulky structure of the focusing objective and optical system make it lacking of flexibility in move and manipulation. In addition, to arrange objects into desired patterns, complicated assistant methods, such as holographic elements (5) and lithographic surface plasmon substrates (6) are needed in COTs, making it difficult for arranging particles with any desired configurations. This protocol reports an optical method for flexible manipulation (stable trapping, targeted driving, and flexible arrangement) of particles and cells using a single tapered fibre probe. ### Reagents 1. Particle sample (silica particles, diameter: 3 and 0. 7 μm, Sphere Scientific Co., Ltd, China). - Cell sample (yeast cells, average diameter: 4 µm; Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, rod-shaped, about 0. 7 × 2 µm). - Deionized water. ### Equipment **Equipment for tapered fibre probe (TFP) fabrication:** 1. Commercial single-mode optical fibre (connector type: FC/PC, core diameter: 9 µm, cladding diameter: 125 µm, Corning Inc.) (key part of the TFP). - A fibre stripper for stripping off the polymer jacket of the fibre. - An alcohol lamp for heating the fibre. - Tweezers to hold up the fibre. - Glass capillary (inner diameter: ~ 0. 9 mm, wall thickness: ~ 0. 1 mm, length: ~ 120 mm) to sheathe the fibre. **Equipment for sample preparation:** 1. <b>Weighing</b> <b>bottle</b> (25 × 25 mm). - Microcentrifuge tube (1. 5 mL). - Ultrasonic instrument (CD- 820, CODYSON, China). - Glass slide (25. 4 × 76. 2 mm, 1 ~ 1. 2 mm thick). - Micro-syringe (1 mL). **Experimental setup for optical manipulation (Fig. 1 a) :** 1. A personal computer interfaced microscope with a charge-coupled device (CCD) is used for real-time monitoring and image capture. The microscope (Union, Hisomet II) consists of a series of objectives. The specifications of objective, including magnification, numerical aperture (NA) and working distance (WD), are × 5 (NA = 0. 10, WD = 19. 0 mm), × 10 (NA = 0. 20, WD = 16. 4 mm), × 20 (NA = 0. 40, WD = 11. 2 mm), × 40 (NA = 0. 50, WD = 10. 0 mm), × 50 (NA = 0. 75, WD = 1. 5 mm), and × 100 (NA = 0. 73, WD = 1. 0 mm). A translation stage (50 nm in resolution) is equipped with the microscope for holding and manipulation the sample. - A laser source (laser wavelength: 980 nm, LU 0980 M 330, Lumics, Germany) is used for optical power supply. - An optical splitter (10 % : 90 %), the 10 % end is connected to an optical power meter, and the 90 % end is used for optical manipulation. - An optical power meter (OMM- 6810 B, ILX Lightwave, USA) is used for measuring optical power. - A six-axis manipulator (Kohzu Precision Co., Ltd., 50 nm in resolution) is used for fixing and manipulating the TFP. ### Procedure **Preparation of sample suspensions:** 1. Dilute the particles (3 -μm-diameter) with deionized water in a <b>weighing</b> <b>bottle,</b> the concentration (weight ratio of particles to water) is about 1 : 2, 000. The method for preparing 0. 7 -μm-diameter particle suspension is the same as that for the 3 -μm-diameter particle suspension. - Put the <b>weighing</b> <b>bottle</b> with particle suspension into an ultrasonic instrument, turn on the instrument and treat it with about 10 minutes to get a monodisperse particle suspension. - Dilute the yeast cells with deionized water in a microcentrifuge tube. The density of the cell is about 1. 0 × 10 e 8 #/mL. To ensure the cells in dispersed state, the suspension is kept in a static state for about 10 minutes. - Dilute the E. coli bacteria with deionized water in a microcentrifuge tube, The density of E. coli bacteria is about 1. 2 × 10 e 8 #/mL. To ensure the bacteria in dispersed state, the suspension is kept in a static state for about 10 minutes. **Fabrication of TFP:** 1. Strip off the polymer jacket of the single-mode optical fibre with a fibre stripper, fabricate a bare fibre of 160 -mm in length and 125 -μm in diameter. - Sheathe the bare fibre with a glass capillary. - Light the alcohol lamp, seize the left and right parts of the bare fibre outside the capillary with left hand and the tweezers, respectively, make sure the bare fibre being heated by the outer flame of the alcohol lamp with a heating zone of about 2 ~ 3 mm. After heating about 1 minute, draw the fibre with a speed at about 0. 3 mm/s for about 30 seconds. The fibre diameter is decreased from 125 to 10 μm with a length of about 2 mm. Then draw the fibre with a high speed at about 2 mm/s until the fibre broke with a sharply tapered end. Finally, a TFP is fabricated. - Fix the TFP on the six-axis manipulator, and observe it under the microscope with different objectives. The image is displayed on the screen of the computer (see Fig. 1 b). **Manipulation of particles and cells:** 1. Connect the laser source, optical splitter, optical power meter, and TFP as shown in Fig. 1 a. - Place a clean glass slide on the translation stage of the microscope, pipette a droplet of particle (3 -μm-diameter silica) suspension (0. 1 mL) on the glass slide with a micro-syringe. Adjust the six-axis manipulator to move the TFP inside the suspension and adjust the microscope until the TFP and particles appear inside the field of view. Change the objectives from × 5 to × 100 to have a clear view of the TFP and particles. Move the TFP to get close to particles by adjusting the six-axis manipulator. - Turn on the laser source, tune the knob on the laser source until the optical power displayed on the optical power meter is 2 mW. The particles beside the TFP axis will be trapped to the axis by the transverse optical gradient force as shown in Fig. 2 a-c. - Increase the optical power displayed on the power meter to 4. 5 mW. The particles along the TFP axis will be trapped and/or driven away by the dominant optical gradient force and scattering force, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 d,e. - Move the TFP in different directions, the trapped and driven particles can be manipulated flexibly in different directions, as shown in Fig. 2 f. - Keep the optical power displayed on the power meter at 4. 5 mW, and move the TFP until the particles are along the TFP axis but with different distances. You will see single particle being trapped or driven away (see Supplementary Video 1 and Video 2). Different manipulation distances (DM) for particles with different axial working distances (DA) and optical powers launched into the TFP are shown in Fig. 3 a and b, respectively. - Tune the optical power displayed on the power meter at 2. 8 mW, move the TFP to trap and pick up individual particles and deliver them to designated positions to form desired patterns (see Supplementary Video 3). - Tune the optical power displayed on the optical power meter at 3. 9 mW, move the TFP to drive particles to designated positions to form desired patterns (see Supplementary Video 4). - Combine the abilities of trapping and driving, different patterns can be arranged as shown in Fig. 4. - To manipulate sub-micron sized particles, using another clean glass slide and pipette a droplet of particle (0. 7 -μm-diameter silica) suspension (0. 1 mL) on the slide, follow the procedure as described in 2) of section Manipulation of particles and cells. - Turn on the laser source, tune the knob on the laser source until the optical power displayed on the power meter is 3. 3 mW. The particle near the TFP tip will be trapped by the dominant optical gradient force as shown in Fig. 5 aI. For those particles with a larger distance to the TFP tip, they will be driven away by the dominant optical scattering force as shown in Fig. 5 aII. - To manipulate cells, using another clean glass slide and pipette a droplet of yeast cell suspension (0. 1 mL) on the slide, follow the procedures as described in 2) of section Manipulation of particles and cells. - Turn on the laser source, tune the knob on the laser source until the optical power displayed on the power meter is 2. 8 mW, the yeast cell near the TFP tip will be trapped by the dominant optical gradient force as shown in Fig. 5 bI. For those cells with a larger distance to the TFP tip, they will be driven away by the dominant optical scattering force as shown in Fig. 5 bII. - Change a new glass slide for manipulation of E. coli bacteria. - Follow the method for manipulation of yeast cells, the power displayed on the meter is also 2. 8 mW, the trapping and driving of E. coli bacteria are shown in Fig. 5 cI and cII, respectively. - After finishing manipulation of each kind of particles and cells, remember to turn off the laser. ### Timing - Preparing each sample: about 15 minutes - Fabrication a TFP: about 3 minutes - Manipulation of each particle sample: depending on the manipulation types (trapping, driving, moving, and arrangement), it may take about 1 to 10 minutes. ### Troubleshooting The bare fibre breaks easily, therefore, much attention should be paid on your safety avoiding the broken fibre segments to prick into your hands. ### References 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Concentration of {{microorganisms}} in blood {{is low in}} bacteremia from extravascular sources. The best yield from blood cultures is achieved by culturing a minimum of 10 - 20 ml, although in some processing blood culture systems such as Bactec NR- 860, smaller volume is used. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to establish the frequency in which inadequate small blood volumes are employed for culturing and to analyze the relation between the cultured blood volume in Bactec 6 A bottles and the yield achieved. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We weighed 2000 Bactec 6 A bottles pertaining to consecutive blood cultures obtained from untreated patients with clinical suspicion of Infection. The cultured blood volume was estimated subtracting the mean empty bottle weight. RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered from 251 bottles (12. 5 %). One hundred and thirty one (6. 8 %) isolates were considered as clinically significant and 115 (5. 7 %) as contaminant. The inoculated blood volume in both significant (5. 532 +/- 1. 587 ml) and non-significant (5. 471 +/- 1. 563 ml) recoveries was superior than that of bottles without microbiologic growth (5. 209 +/- 1. 575 ml, p = 0. 016 and p = 0. 06, respectively). A linear positive trend was found between the cultivated blood volume and the rate of recoveries (p = 0. 008). Within the range of 1 up to 10 ml, the rate of recoveries increased 2. 28 % for each additional ml of cultivated blood (r = 0. 953, p < 0. 0001). Out of the 2, 000 <b>weighed</b> <b>bottles</b> 127 (6. 3 %) contained less than 3 ml of blood and 576 (29 %) between 3 and 5 ml. CONCLUSIONS: We have proved that the rate of recoveries from Bactec 6 A bottles increased with the volume of cultured blood.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that urea is nontoxic {{and that even}} the high concentrations present in uremia are innocuous and do {{not contribute to the}} symptoms encountered in this condition. In sup-port of this assumption {{is the fact that the}} blood in the elasmobranch fishes contains 330 to 440 mM (about 2 per cent) of urea per L. The origi-nal purpose of the present study was to utilize this assumed inertness of urea in order to determine the effect of the presence of one molecular species in high concentration on the electrolyte and water composition of the body. However, it soon became apparent that urea in high concentrations, con-trary to the generally accepted notion, was lethal and that many of the abnormalities noted in ure-mia could be elicited by this substance. METHODS General procedure. Intermittent peritoneal lavage, as described elsewhere (1), was utilized to maintain the de-sired level of urea in the extracellular fluid of the nephrec-tomized dog. The kidneys were removed under ether anesthesia through the dorsolumbar approach with an in-terval of 7 to 14 days between the two operations. Sterile solutions available commercially (Peridial®) 1 or prepared as described previously (1) were utilized for the peritoneal exchanges. One L. of the solution, the electrolyte and water composition of which approximated normal extracellular fluid, was injected intraperitoneally and exchanged, twice daily (2). Varying amounts of urea (5 to 30 Gm. per L.) were added to these solutions in order to maintain the concentration at the desired level. The animals were killed by exsanguination after 4 to 10 days, at a time when they manifested severe symptoms of uremia. Analytical procedures.

The study reported in this thesis was designed {{to examine the relationship}} of cord blood leptin and ghrelin with milk intake over the first week of life, and with infant growth up to twelve weeks of age. One hundred term formula fed newborns were recruited at birth. Leptin and ghrelin were measured in cord blood by radioimmunoassay. Milk intake was measured by <b>weighing</b> of <b>bottles</b> of formula milk before and after feeding. Measurements of weight, length and head circumference were taken at birth, seven days and at twelve weeks of age. A number of control variables were also measured. Birthweight {{was a significant predictor of}} mean milk intake, which rose significantly from days 1 to 7, with no difference between males and females. Weight gain or loss in the early neonatal period was a direct and significant consequence of milk intake consumed over that period. There was no relationship between cord blood leptin or ghrelin (controlling for birthweight) on the infants' milk intake over the first 24 hours of life or on their mean milk intake over the first week of life. Weight gain was significantly correlated with birthweight, with higher birthweight associated with lower weight gain. There was no relationship between cord leptin and weight gain to three months of age after adjusting for birthweight; but lower cord ghrelin levels were significantly associated with slower weight gain...|$|R
40|$|In 1961, Dubos and Schaedler (1) {{reported}} {{a reduction in}} water intake in animals treated with bacterial endotoxin. Mice were raised in a pathogen-free environment and subsequently tested with one of several toxins. Alteration in daily water intake was found to occur at doses well below the LDs 0. Because of the long-standing interest in this laboratory in drive states, their behavioral consequences, and physiological basis (2), this property of endotoxin was explored in the albino rat. Our animals were not raised in a pathogen-free environment. Using fairly large doses of toxin, {{we were able to}} confirm the findings of Dubos and Schaedler, and, in addition, demonstrate a profound toxin effect on food intake and body temperature. Using behavioral and physiological techniques, we made exploratory studies of resistance and sensitization to toxin and of its possible site of action. Materials and Methods Animals. [...] AU the animals were male Sprague-Dawley albino rats, 90 to 120 days old, weighing 300 gm or more. They were housed in individual wire cages in a temperature-controlled room, and were fed Purina lab chow and tap water. Water intakes were measured by making water bottles available for 30 minutes every day and <b>weighing</b> the <b>bottles</b> before and after consumption. After several "familiarization " days the rats would drink a fairly standard amount each day. Food intake was measured by weighing the food in the cages every 24 hours, the food being continuously available. Animals on food-intake measurement were given water ad lib and those on water-intake measurement were given food ad lib. Temperatures were taken with an ordinary rectal thermometer, lubricated and inserted almost its entire length. The animals showed no unusual distress and tolerated the procedure day after day. Thermometers were left in place 3 to 5 minutes and then read. Thermometem that dropped out were replaced for 3 additional minutes. A paper towel on the cage floor facilitated recovery of lost thermometers. Toxin. [...] A eommerdally prepared lipopolysaccharide extract of Eschericlda coli was use...|$|R
40|$|This degree {{project has}} been carried out in {{cooperation}} with Gedevelop in Helsingborg. Gedevelop has developed a camera that can calculate the weight of a liquid glass mass. Because of the density and viscosity changes in the glass, the weight information is sometimes incorrect given. Glass industry is today addressing the problem by an operator performing a manual weighing of a few bottles which, in turn, calibrates the camera system. The project aimed to develop an automated system to control the <b>weighing</b> of glass <b>bottles</b> for glass industries. This system must be so flexible that it can be easily mounted on plants with different production equipment around the world. The project includes design and construction of equipment that meets the requirements formulated together with Gedevelop. Work has been done both in Halmstad and Helsingborg and has included both calculations and review of the theory to understand the forces that influence the design of different construction parts. A prototype was produced that meets the operating requirements for the design and can be used in testing features. However, the design does not meet the requirements to be set up at a production line because it does not pass the temperature appearing in glass industry. This can easily be remedied by further modification of the design in terms of protection of stainless steel...|$|R
40|$|SummaryHand hygiene is a {{critical}} element of patient care, which needs to be learned and reinforced to become an autonomous behavior. Previous studies have explored aspects of hand hygiene behavior in the clinical workplace, but not in controlled learning environments with health professional students. Development of good hand hygiene behavior requires a multi-faceted approach, including education, reinforcement, feedback and audit. Our study aimed to identify the effect of unannounced hand hygiene reminder signs {{on the use of}} antimicrobial hand gel in a clinical skills center. Year 2 MBChB students received practical learning regarding hand hygiene in their clinical skills sessions. Baseline hand gel use was measured using before and after <b>weighing</b> of the <b>bottles.</b> An A 5 sign was created to remind the students to hand cleanse and was used as an unannounced intervention. In semester 2 (2012), the student groups were randomly allocated as intervention (signs) or control (no signs). Hand gel use at all sessions was measured. Data were compared between groups and over time. In total, 237 students attended the skills sessions twice during the study. Hand gel use was not significantly different between the two study arms. Overall use was low, typically 1 – 2 hand gel pumps per student per session. In addition, hand gel use fell over time. A visual reminder to cleanse hands did not appear to have any effect on behavior. These findings may have implications for their value in a clinical setting. Low overall use of hand gel may be context-dependent. Students are in a simulated environment and examine ‘healthy’ peers or actors. There may have been inconsistent tutor role-modeling or problems with the educational approach to the skill. Analysis {{at the level of the}} group, and not the individual, may have also limited our study...|$|R
