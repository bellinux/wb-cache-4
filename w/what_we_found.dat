2500|$|Kant {{argued that}} the {{structures}} of logic which organize, interpret and abstract observations were built into the human mind and were true and valid a priori. Mill, on the contrary, said that we believe them to be true because we have enough individual instances of their truth to generalize: in his words, [...] "From instances we have observed, we feel warranted in concluding that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> true in those instances holds in all similar ones, past, present and future, however numerous they may be". Although the psychological or epistemological specifics given by Mill through which we build our logical apparatus may not be completely warranted, his explanation still nonetheless manages to demonstrate {{that there is no}} way around Kant's a priori logic. To recant Mill's original idea in an empiricist twist: [...] "Indeed, the very principles of logical deduction are true because we observe that using them leads to true conclusions", which is itself an a priori presupposition.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the tragedy}} was keenly felt in Cornwall, its {{national}} impact, given the heavy loss of life, was relatively small, {{perhaps because it}} occurred during the post World Cup euphoria when public attention and headlines were directed elsewhere. [...] No clues {{to the fate of}} the Darlwyne emerged for decades. In July 2016, divers working with a BBC documentary team investigating the [...] tragedy [...] examined seabed locations closer to Dodman Point than the original searches. According to local fishermen, debris had been recovered from this area in the 1980s, including a wooden transom bearing the name Darlwyne. After several searches that revealed nothing, the 2016 divers found artefacts including [...] an anchor, a winch, items of ballast, and [...] the remains of a davit. No other recent wrecks or disappearances had been recorded in the area. [...] "Taking everything into account", the divers reported, [...] "it’s likely that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> was {{what was left of the}} Darlwyne".

Brian writes the essay and leaves it in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. As the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and Bender. Allison rips Andrew's state champion patch from his letterman jacket to keep, and Claire gives Bender one of her diamond earrings, which he attaches to his earlobe. Vernon reads the essay (read by Brian in voice-over), in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are, using simple definitions and stereotypes. One by one, the five students' voices add, [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> out is that {{each one of us}} is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal."

On the table he had placed a paper which contained a full confession of his having murdered Jeremy Buggam fifty years before. The circumstances of the murder had rendered it easy for him to fasten the crime upon Sir Duggam, already insensible from drink. A few minutes with the ouija board enabled us to get a full corroboration from Sir Duggam. He promised, moreover, now that his name was cleared, to go away from the premises for ever.|$|E
