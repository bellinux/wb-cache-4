5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by {{the last}} ice age, box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to {{be as many as}} 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, which would make it the oldest <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family, and the type species of the genus Clathrus. It is {{commonly}} known as the latticed stinkhorn, the basket stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or latticed branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on garden soil, grassy places, or on woodchip garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C.ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes northern Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. The species was illustrated in the scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.|$|E

25|$|Secondary growth {{encompasses}} all {{growth in}} diameter, {{a major component}} of <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> tissues and many nonwoody plants. For example, storage roots of sweet potato have secondary growth but are not woody. Secondary growth occurs at the lateral meristems, namely the vascular cambium and cork cambium. The former forms secondary xylem and secondary phloem, while the latter forms the periderm.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} grass by grazing affects the <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> {{component}} of woodland systems in two major ways. Grasses compete with woody plants for {{water in the}} topsoil and removal by grazing reduces this competitive effect, potentially boosting tree growth. In addition to this effect, the removal of fuel reduces both the intensity {{and the frequency of}} fires which may control <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species. Grazing animals can have a more direct effect on woody plants by the browsing of palatable woody species. There is evidence that unpalatable woody plants have increased under grazing in savannas. Grazing also promotes the spread of weeds in savannas by the removal or reduction of the plants which would normally compete with potential weeds and hinder establishment. In addition to this, cattle and horses are implicated in the spread of the seeds of weed species such as Prickly Acacia (Acacia nilotica) and Stylo (Stylosanthes spp.). Alterations in savanna species composition brought about by grazing can alter ecosystem function, and are exacerbated by overgrazing and poor land management practices.|$|E
25|$|Pastoralists {{often use}} their herds to affect their environment. Grazing herds on savannas can ensure the {{biodiversity}} of the savannas and {{prevent them from}} evolving into scrubland. Pastoralists may also use fire to make ecosystems more suitable for their food animals. For instance, the Turkana people of northwest Kenya use fire to prevent {{the invasion of the}} savanna by <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species. Biomass of the domesticated and wild animals was increased by a higher quality of grass.|$|E

25|$|Human induced {{climate change}} {{resulting}} from the greenhouse effect may result in an alteration of the structure and function of savannas. Some authors have suggested that savannas and grasslands may become even more susceptible to <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> encroachment {{as a result of}} greenhouse induced climate change. However, a recent case described a savanna increasing its range at the expense of forest in response to climate variation, and potential exists for similar rapid, dramatic shifts in vegetation distribution as a result of global climate change, particularly at ecotones such as savannas so often represent.|$|E
25|$|M. drewseni nests {{typically}} have one main comb {{and tend to}} be, on average, 14 cells in diameter. Each cell is hexagonal and about 4.75mm in diameter. These cells can be built by members of any caste within the colony, {{and all of the}} cells look alike. These single combs can be suspended by a narrow stem, which is typically 10mm in diameter. Usually, nests are constructed out of <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> fiber. Pulp is utilized, as well, and can come from fence rails, planks, and dried cortex from stems from Verbenaceae, an herb plant. Sometimes, dried bark can be used.|$|E
25|$|Clearing {{is carried}} out by the grazing {{industry}} in an attempt to increase {{the quality and quantity of}} feed available for stock and to improve the management of livestock. The removal of trees from savanna land removes the competition for water from the grasses present, and can lead to a two to fourfold increase in pasture production, as well as improving the quality of the feed available. Since stock carrying capacity is strongly correlated with herbage yield, there can be major financial benefits from the removal of trees, such as assisting with grazing management: regions of dense tree and shrub cover harbors predators, leading to increased stock losses, for example, while <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> cover hinders mustering in both sheep and cattle areas.|$|E

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the didactic use of <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> in {{teaching}} at the secondary level of elementary schools and in the corresponding years of grammar schools. The purpose is to appropriately use trees and other <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> that are close to schools and are available for teaching. The theoretical part deals with basic curricular documents, methods of teaching possibly used in science or biology that have been briefly characterized, and the representation of the topic of <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> and their method of processing in commonly available textbooks. The following chapter provides a description of the <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> used in the process of making of the practical materials. The research of the thesis includes a questionnaire survey done among teachers of science or biology at chosen elementary and grammar schools in Pilsen and surrounding towns. The research investigated the teaching methods and the actual use of <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> in lessons and was evaluated afterwards. Based on the survey, a motivational teaching material was created and it was verified in practice with pupils of a specific grammar school.

25|$|There is {{currently}} about 30 hectares of Myall woodland in Yanga National Park located north of Yanga Lake. The community consists of low woodland, with a tree layer of mostly weeping Myall or boree (Acacia pendula) {{as the dominant}} species. The understorey includes an open layer of chenopod shrubs and other <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species and an open to continuous groundcover of grasses and herbs. In the past land clearing and overgrazing by feral and domestic animals were the major threats to this ecological community within Yanga National Park. Since {{the purchase of the}} property in 2005, the threat of further land clearing has been diminished, however grazing by feral and domestic animals such as kangaroos and rabbits still poses a risk to the community.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} exotic plants {{species have been}} {{introduced}} to the savannas around the world. Amongst the <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species are serious environmental weeds such as Prickly Acacia (Acacia nilotica), Rubbervine (Cryptostegia grandiflora), Mesquite (Prosopis spp.), Lantana (Lantana camara and L. montevidensis) and Prickly Pear (Opuntia spp.) A range of herbaceous species have also been introduced to these woodlands, either deliberately or accidentally including Rhodes grass and other Chloris species, Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), Giant rat's tail grass (Sporobolus pyramidalis) parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus) and stylos (Stylosanthes spp.) and other legumes. These introductions {{have the potential to}} significantly alter the structure and composition of savannas worldwide, and have already done so in many areas through a number of processes including altering the fire regime, increasing grazing pressure, competing with native vegetation and occupying previously vacant ecological niches.|$|E
500|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the park}} is classified into two distinctive groups, [...] of wet patana (Sinhalese for [...] "montane grasslands") and [...] of subtropical montane evergreen forests. Nearly 750 species of plants belonging to 20 families have been recorded from the park. The forest canopy reaches the height of [...] and features Calophyllum walkeri, forming communities with varieties of Myrtaceae species such as Syzygium rotundifolium, and S. sclerophyllum, and Lauraceae members including Litsea, Cinnamomum, and Actinodaphne speciosa. The undergrowth layer is characterised [...] by Strobilanthes spp. The thickness of the Strobilanthes vegetation hinders {{the development of a}} herb layer. Dwarf bamboo species such Indocalamus and Ochlandra also found in the undergrowth layer. Rhodomyrtus tomentosa bushes specially grow in forest margin and near the mountain peaks. Species such as Gordonia and Rhododendron arboreum have spread to Sri Lanka, along the Western Ghats of South India from the Himalayas and are now common. Nearly 54 <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species have been recorded from the park, of which 27 (50%) are endemic to Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|<b>Woody</b> <b>plants</b> survive {{freezing}} temperatures by {{suppressing the}} formation of ice in living cells or by allowing water to freeze in plant parts that are not affected by ice formation. The common mechanism for <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> to survive up to -40 °C (-40 °F) is supercooling. <b>Woody</b> <b>plants</b> that survive lower temperatures are dehydrating their cells, allowing water to freeze between cell walls and the cells to survive. Plants normally considered hardy may not survive freezing {{if they are not}} readily acclimated, which renders them unable to use these mechanisms.|$|R

500|$|Box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, so single plants cannot reproduce sexually. Instead, {{they form}} colonies which spread by vegetative reproduction along rootstocks. A colony of G.brachycera at Losh Run, Pennsylvania {{was found to}} be [...] long when surveyed. If this colony grew clonally from a seed deposited along the Juniata River at the rate of [...] per year, it would be about 13,000 years old, the oldest living organism in the United States and second oldest in the world, eclipsed only by Lomatia tasmanica. However, this is believed now to be an overestimate on climatic grounds. At that time, the site was covered by a boreal forest thought to be too cold for the box huckleberry to survive; the current forest did not begin to appear at the site until about 8,000 years ago. This age would still make it the oldest <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> in North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Recent studies have attempted to determine whether, in fact, the reproduction of the colony (since heavily damaged by a forest fire in 1963 and road construction in the 1970s) has been entirely clonal. Two genotypes were found in samples taken from the colony, but they are thought to have arisen through somatic mutation rather than sexual reproduction. Unfortunately, the destruction of about 80% of the colony by fire and construction makes it impossible to definitively settle the question.|$|E

2500|$|Mischocyttarus drewseni, {{which is}} {{sometimes}} spelled [...] "drewsenii", {{is a social}} wasp in the Vespidae family. It is commonly found in Neotropical regions of South America, including Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia and Paraguay. This mid-sized wasp is about 1.5-1.8cm and is typically dark brown or black in color. This species makes their nests out of <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> fibers and create single combed nests with hexagonal cells which are typically found in low lying grass habitats or semi-urban environments. The colony cycle for this species is initiated by the queen who starts building the nest cell by cell. The nest construction process is highly elaborate and involves foraging for materials, creating cells, and heightening cell walls. It feeds on arthropods, plant nectar, and honeydew, and the species is very protective of its brood {{when it comes to}} defending them from their predators. The life cycle of this species has several stages with varying lengths, including egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. As a social wasp species, there are several castes within the colony and different castes perform different specialized jobs with differing dominance and reproductive behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the past}} few years, {{researchers}} have indeed begun looking at non-model, [...] "non-conventional" [...] organisms using modern genetic tools. One {{example of this is}} the Floral Genome Project, which envisages to study the evolution of the current patterns in the genetic architecture of the flower through comparative genetic analyses, with a focus on EST sequences. Like the FGP, there are several such ongoing projects that aim to find out conserved and diverse patterns in evolution of the plant shape. Expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences of quite a few non-model plants like sugarcane, apple, lotus, barley, cycas, coffee, to name a few, are available freely online. The Cycad Genomics Project, for example, aims to understand the differences in structure and function of genes between gymnosperms and angiosperms through sampling in the order Cycadales. In the process, it intends to make available information for the study of evolution of structures like seeds, cones and evolution of life cycle patterns. Presently the most important sequenced genomes from an evo-devo point of view include those of A. thaliana (a flowering plant), poplar (a <b>woody</b> <b>plant),</b> Physcomitrella patens (a bryophyte), Maize (extensive genetic information), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a green alga). The impact of such a vast amount of information on understanding common underlying developmental mechanisms can easily be realised.|$|E
