50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1984, when company founder Matthew Bond, trained in physics and electronics theory, was {{looking for ways to}} improve the performance of audio components and the wire used within an audio system. As early as the mid 1970s and early 1980s, Matthew Bond had experimented with solid core conductors of different diameters. He hypothesized that an 'optimum diameter' of 18 AWG (American <b>Wire</b> <b>Gage)</b> or 1 millimeter was ideal for audio frequencies because there was minimal high frequency attenuation caused by the principles known as skin effect. Matthew Bond's work was corroborated by research work from the NBS or National Bureau of Standards in the 1930s and confirmed later by Stereophile Magazine in July 1988 in a table presented as the DC to AC resistance ratio versus frequency, in wires of different diameters. Matthew Bond is credited with the invention of solid-core wires for audio use, because his work predates Dennis Morecroft (1984) and any of the early solid-core wires developed for use in audio in England at the time.|$|E

A modified JT 12 D combustor was operated in a jet burner test stand while subjected simultaneously to both systems of instrumentation, i. e., Kanthal A- 1 <b>wire</b> strain <b>gages</b> and laser speckle photography.

The fabrication process was aimed at producing proper bonding of the sensor wire to the substrate surface, without causing excessive surface waviness.

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the construction of}} two long-span, high-strength composite prestressed bridge girders to investigate their structural behavior and the adequacy of American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 1993 provisions for their design. The scope of the research included examining prestress losses, transfer length, cyclic load response, and ultimate flexural strength. The research revealed that prestress losses could not be determined solely from strain gage instrumentation. Foil strain gages attached to the strand cannot measure losses caused by relaxation and drift over time. Vibrating wire strain gages embedded in the concrete cannot account for losses in the prestressing strand before the concrete hardens. Researchers used vibrating <b>wire</b> <b>gage</b> data to measure the prestress losses incurred {{since the time of}} strand release. To back-calculate the losses that occur before release, researchers used total prestress losses determined from flexural cracking and crack reopening loads. The measured prestress losses were found to be much higher than those predicted by analytical methods. Prestress losses predicted by AASHTO not only ignore concrete stress before release but also overestimate the high-strength concrete modulus, leading to lower initial losses, and overpredict the creep and shrinkage, leading to higher long-term losses.

40|$|Conventional {{resistance}} {{strain gage}} technology uses "bonded" strain gages. These foil or wire gages are bonded {{onto the surface}} of the test article with glue, ceramic cements, or flame-sprayed ceramics. These bonding agents can, in some instances, limit both the degree of strain transmission from the test structure to the gage and the maximum working temperature of the gage. Also, the bulky, bonded gage normally disrupts aerodynamic gas flow {{on the surface of the}} test structure because of its intrusive character. To respond to the urgent needs in aeronautic and aerospace research where stress and temperature gradients are high, aerodynamic effects need to be minimized, and higher operational temperatures are required, the NASA Lewis Research Center developed a thin film strain gage. This gage, a vacuum-deposited thin film formed directly on the surface of a test structure, operates at much higher temperatures than commercially available gages do and with minimal disruption of the aerodynamic flow. The gage uses an alloy, palladium- 13 wt % chromium (hereafter, PdCr), which was developed by United Technologies Research Center under a NASA contract. PdCr is structurally stable and oxidation resistant up to at least 1100 C (2000 F); its temperature-induced resistance change is linear, repeatable, and not sensitive to the rates of heating and cooling. An early strain gage, which was made of 25 -micrometer-diameter PdCr wire and demonstrated to be useable to 800 C, won an R&D 100 award in 1991. By further improving the purity of the material and by developing gage fabrication techniques that use sputter-deposition, photolithography patterning, and chemical etching, we have made an 8 - to 10 -m PdCr thin-film strain gage that can measure dynamic and static strain to at least 1100 C. For static strain measurements, a 5 -m-thick Pt element serves as a temperature compensator to further minimize the temperature effect of the gage. These thin-film gages provide the advantage of minimally intrusive surface strain measurements and give highly repeatable readings with low drift at temperatures from ambient to 1100 C. This is a 300 C advance in operating temperature over the PdCr <b>wire</b> <b>gage</b> and a 500 C advance over commercially available gages made of other materials...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Field and {{laboratory}} scale studies of geosynthetic behavior typically re-quire {{an assessment of}} strain across a region of the geosynthetic material. Measure-ments of strain, or displacement, are typically provided by attaching electronic sensors directly to the geosynthetic specimen. Of interest and concern, is the comparison be-tween the measured strain and the true (global) strain experienced by the geosynthetic. The measured strain, {{is influenced by the}} structure of the geosynthetic, the size of the sensor, the attachment technique used for the sensor and the type of load applied. A large wide-width strip tension apparatus was constructed to assess the differences be-tween the global andmeasured strain for four types of strain sensors attached to geogrid and geotextile specimens. The four sensors used were vibrating <b>wire</b> displacement <b>gages,</b> vibrating <b>wire</b> strain <b>gages,</b> linear variable differential transformers, and bonded resistance foil strain gages.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose a method of strain {{measurements}} under multi-axial stress condition. By adopting the cube specimen, we can apply the load different from each other in three directions. At the triaxial test, six steel brushes covered the specimen, and there was no space to put <b>wire</b> strain <b>gages</b> or displacement devices on the surfaces of the specimen. Therefore, the cube specimen with chamfered edges was selected to measure strains by utilizing the chamfered edges. Six pairs of displacement measuring devices were set on the chamfered edges of the specimen in three directions (α, β, γ) as shown in Fig. 2. The deformation in a specific direction was measured as the sum of the outputs from a pair of displacement devices placed in the diagonal and opposite edges in the same direction of the specimen. The strains, ε_X, Ε_Y and E_Z in X, Y and Z directions can be written in the equation (10), as the terms higher than the second order are negligibly small.
