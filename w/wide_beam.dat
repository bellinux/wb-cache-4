5|$|The {{ships were}} very stable, {{primarily}} because of their <b>wide</b> <b>beam.</b> The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Bismarck and Tirpitz were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of manoeuvring with rudder deflections as small as 5°. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3°, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when travelling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one launch, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E

25|$|In {{directional}} terms, {{the beam}} was sharp {{enough that the}} edges of the arc were quite strong - the target would appear in the beam and then disappear with little or no difference in brightness at the edges. This meant that in spite of the relatively <b>wide</b> <b>beam,</b> the arcs were quite sharp and even small angles would cause the signals to disappear at some point and create a gap in the return. With targets near the centre this was quite easy to see as the ring would develop a gap, allowing measurements as accurate as about one degree. However, targets further from the centre displayed much shorter arcs, making it more difficult to see small changes in their length.|$|E

500|$|Amundsen {{consulted}} Nansen, {{who insisted}} that Fram was the only vessel fit for such an undertaking. Fram had been designed and built in 1891–93 by Colin Archer, Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect, in accordance with Nansen's exacting specifications, as a vessel that would withstand prolonged exposure to the harshest of Arctic conditions. The ship's most distinctive feature was its rounded hull which, according to Nansen, enabled the vessel to [...] "slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice". For extra strength the hull was sheathed in South American greenheart, the hardest timber available, and crossbeams and braces were fitted throughout its length. The ship's <b>wide</b> <b>beam</b> of [...] in relation to its overall length of [...] gave it a markedly stubby appearance. This shape improved its strength in the ice but affected its performance in the open sea, where it moved sluggishly and was inclined to roll most uncomfortably. However, its looks, speed, and sailing qualities were secondary to the provision of a secure and warm shelter for the crew during a voyage that might extend over several years.|$|E

2500|$|A {{catamaran}} (...) (informally, a [...] "cat") is a multi-hulled watercraft featuring {{two parallel}} hulls of equal size. It is a geometry-stabilized craft, deriving its stability from its <b>wide</b> <b>beam,</b> {{rather than from}} a ballasted keel as with a monohull sailboat. [...] Catamaran is a Tamil word Kattumaram (கட்டுமரம்) - logs tied together - [...] which is used from ancient times to ship heavy shipment over shallow water bodies. Hundred of elephant fleets were shipped by Tamil kings with Catamaran to conquer East Asian countries in 10th century BC. Catamaran is hull free and therefore lighter than a monohull, catamarans often have a shallower draft (draught) than comparably-sized monohulls. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamaran's wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull, and can give reduced wakes.|$|E
2500|$|Symmetric {{parabolic}} antennas {{produce a}} narrow [...] "pencil" [...] beam {{in both the}} X and Y dimensions and consequently have a higher gain. The NEXRAD Pulse-Doppler weather radar uses a symmetric antenna to perform detailed volumetric scans of the atmosphere. Spoiled parabolic antennas produce a narrow beam in one dimension and a relatively <b>wide</b> <b>beam</b> in the other. This feature is useful if target detection {{over a wide range}} of angles is more important than target location in three dimensions. [...] Most 2D surveillance radars use a spoiled parabolic antenna with a narrow azimuthal beamwidth and wide vertical beamwidth. This beam configuration allows the radar operator to detect an aircraft at a specific azimuth but at an indeterminate height. Conversely, so-called [...] "nodder" [...] height finding radars use a dish with a narrow vertical beamwidth and wide azimuthal beamwidth to detect an aircraft at a specific height but with low azimuthal precision.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe shear {{behavior}} of reinforced concrete <b>wide</b> <b>beams</b> was investigated. The experimental program consisted of nine beams of 29 MPa concrete strength tested with a shear span-depth ratio equal to 3. 0. One of the tested beams had no web reinforcement {{as a control}} specimen. The flexure mode of failure was secured {{for all of the}} specimens to allow for shear mode of failure. The key parameters covered in this investigation are the effect of the existence, spacing, amount and yield stress of the vertical stirrups on the shear capacity and ductility of the tested <b>wide</b> <b>beams.</b> The study shows that the contribution of web reinforcement to the shear capacity is significant and directly proportional to the amount and spacing of the shear reinforcement. The increase in the shear capacity ranged from 32 % to 132 % for the range of the tested beams compared with the control beam. High grade steel was more effective in the contribution of the shear strength of <b>wide</b> <b>beams.</b> Also, test results demonstrate that the shear reinforcement significantly enhances the ductility of the <b>wide</b> <b>beams.</b> In addition, shear resistances at failure recorded in this study are compared to the analytical strengths calculated according to the current Egyptian Code and the available international codes. The current study highlights the need to include the contribution of shear reinforcement in the Egyptian Code requirements for shear capacity of <b>wide</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} number of short-to-mid height RC buildings with <b>wide</b> <b>beams</b> have been constructed in areas of moderate seismicity of Spain, mainly for housing and administrative use. The buildings have a framed structure with one-way slabs; the <b>wide</b> <b>beams</b> constitute the distinctive characteristic, their depth being {{equal to that of}} the rest of the slab, thus providing a flat lower surface, convenient for construction and the layout of facilities. Seismic behavior in the direction of the <b>wide</b> <b>beams</b> appears to be deficient because of: (i) low lateral strength, mainly because of the small effective depth of the beams, (ii) inherent low ductility of the <b>wide</b> <b>beams,</b> generated by high amount of reinforcement, (iii) the big strut compressive forces developed inside the column-beam connections due to the low height of the beams, and (iv) the fact that the <b>wide</b> <b>beams</b> are <b>wider</b> than the columns, meaning that the contribution of the outer zones to the resistance of the beam-column joints is unreliable because there is no torsion reinforcement. In the orthogonal direction, the behavior is worse since the only members of the slabs that contribute to the lateral resistance are the joists and the façade beams. Moreover, these buildings were designed with codes that did not include ductility requirements and required only a low lateral resistance; indeed, in many cases, seismic action was not considered at all. Consequently, the seismic capacity of these structures is not reliable. The objective of this research is to assess numerically this capability, whereas further research will aim to propose retrofit strategies. The research approach consists of: (i) selecting a number of 3 -story and 6 -story buildings that represent the vast majority of the existing ones and (ii) evaluating their vulnerability through three types of analyses, namely: code-type, push-over and nonlinear dynamic analysis. Given the low lateral resistance of the main frames, the cooperation of the masonry infill walls is accounted for; for each representative building, three wall densities are considered. The results of the analyses show that the buildings in question exhibit inadequate seismic behavior in most of the examined situations. In general, the relative performance is less deficient for Target Drift CP (Collapse Prevention) than for IO (Immediate Occupancy). Since these buildings are selected to be representative of the vast majority of buildings with <b>wide</b> <b>beams</b> that were constructed in Spain without accounting for any seismic consideration, our conclusions can be extrapolated to a broader scenario...|$|R
