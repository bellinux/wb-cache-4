5|$|In 1929, Brown {{traveled}} to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert Carl Raswan {{in search of}} desertbred horses. According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not get along well, and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow {{never made it to}} America. Following that trip, Brown wrote The Horse of the Desert, still considered {{to be one of the}} best works <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Arabian horse.|$|E
5|$|Much is <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{different}} {{factors that}} threaten the painted turtle, {{but they are}} unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E

Auður Þórunn Rögnvaldsdóttir, Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson, Kristín Bjarnadóttir, and Sigrún Helgadóttir are experimenting on the {{possibilities}} of using Torbjörn Lager’s m-TBL program to build a PoS tagger for Icelandic.

5|$|Zinc was {{distinctly}} {{recognized as}} a metal under the designation of Yasada or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> year 1374. Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India. The Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much has been <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling {{it on her}} chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp {{to keep it from}} floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Narayan {{published}} his first mythological work, Gods, Demons and Others, {{a collection of}} rewritten and translated short stories from Hindu epics. Like many of his other works, this book was illustrated by his younger brother R. K. Laxman. The stories included were a selective list, chosen {{on the basis of}} powerful protagonists, so that the impact would be lasting, irrespective of the reader's contextual knowledge. Once again, after the book launch, Narayan took to travelling abroad. In an earlier essay, he had <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Americans wanting to understand spirituality from him, and during this visit, Swedish-American actress Greta Garbo accosted him on the topic, despite his denial of any knowledge.|$|E

5|$|James Fleming has <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of {{the postmodern}} {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; {{as a means to}} respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the book}} has {{influenced}} a number of non-fiction books including The Song of the Dodo by David Quammen (1997), which discussed Wallace's contributions {{to the field of}} island biogeography; The Spice Islands Voyage by Tim Severin (1997) that retraced Wallace's travels; and Archipelago: The Islands of Indonesia, by Gavan Daws (1999), which compared the environment described by Wallace with the modern state of the archipelago. The Malay Archipelago is considered {{to be one of the}} most influential books ever <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian islands. It remains a resource for modern authors of works about the region such as the 2014 book Indonesia Etc, which contains multiple quotations from Wallace's book as well as recommending it as further reading on the geography of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Puw's works include {{pieces for}} unusual {{combinations}} of instruments, {{such as a}} tuba quartet or a trio consisting of harp, cello and double-bass, {{as well as more}} traditional forces such as solo baritone and piano, choir or orchestra. He was associated with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales as its Resident Composer, the first holder of this title, from 2006 to 2010. Puw wrote an Oboe concerto as part of this association, and his latest composition for the orchestra was premiered at the 2007 Proms. Puw's own Welsh identity is a recurrent theme in his music: some of his pieces set Welsh-language poetry to music and one of his pieces, Reservoirs, is <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> flooding of Welsh valleys to provide water for England.|$|E

5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} {{stories of the}} birth of The Satanic Bible. In the introduction to the 2005–present edition, High Priest Peter H. Gilmore describes LaVey as having compiled The Satanic Bible on his own from monographs he had <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Church of Satan and its rituals. Gilmore lists {{a number of people who}} influenced LaVey's writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, John Milton, and Lord Byron.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, the exact opposite occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were <b>written</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} long-term consequences in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was ineffective in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally ineffective in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E
