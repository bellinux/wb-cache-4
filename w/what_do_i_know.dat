About halfway through the script it started to make sense why they chose me. In my films I've been trying to mix social satire and family drama. I {{realised}} that all along I had been trying to do Jane Austen without knowing it. Jane Austen was my destiny. I just had to overcome the cultural barrier."Because Thompson and Doran had worked on the screenplay for so long, Lee described himself at the time as a [...] "director for hire", as he was unsure of his role and position. He spent six months in England [...] "learn how to make this movie, how to do a period film, culturally... and how to adapt to the major league film industry." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> for instance, about {{striking}} a top-gallant-mast, and sending {{it down on}} deck in a gale of wind? Could I have turned in a dead-eye, or in the approved nautical style have clapt a seizing on the main-stay? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of [...] "passing a gammoning," [...] "reiving a Burton," [...] "strapping a shoe-block," [...] "clearing a foul hawse," [...] and innumerable other intricacies? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Listen {{to me for}} a moment, uncle George. I {{think you}} are hard on my father, and {{certainly}} hard on me. When I went to Wilkinson's, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of who paid the bill?" ...|$|R

6000|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS [impetuously]. In your imagination. I came alone. I am alone. Hundreds of {{officers}} travel {{every day from}} Hakonsburg to Potterdam. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about them? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then--ah! <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> Who {{can tell}} how far malice can go? And there are towers and bastilles where hope never enters. Moreover, your {{researches}} underground are known.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surprised? No! What would I be {{surprised}} about? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about petrifactions--following the sea? Petrifaction!

6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> The deed was {{not then}} accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those {{circumstances}} even, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates {{me with his}} finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me!

6000|$|It {{sometimes}} {{seemed to}} me that the culmination of this world-sickness had been brought about by the success of my play--my first play, as every one knows. But it had been such a success that it raised the doubt in my own mind, just as the success of my several volumes of verse had raised doubts. Was the public right? Were the critics right?

6000|$|Almost {{coincident}} {{with these}} quickenings of which I have spoken was {{the consciousness of}} a hunger stronger than the craving for bread and meat, and I began to meditate on my ignorance, on the utter inadequacy and insufficiency of my early education, on my neglect of the new learning during the years that had passed since I left Harvard. And I remembered Krebs's words--that we must [...] "reeducate ourselves." [...] <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> A system of law, inherited from another social order, that was utterly unable {{to cope with the}} complexities and miseries and injustices of a modern industrial world. I had spent my days in mastering an inadequate and archaic code--why? in order that I might learn how to evade it? This in itself condemned it. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of life? of the shining universe that surrounded me? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of the insect and the flower, of the laws that moved the planets and made incandescent the suns? of the human body, of the human soul and its instincts? Was this knowledge acquired at such cost of labour and life and love by my fellow-men of so little worth to me that I could ignore it? declare that it had no significance for me? no bearing on my life and conduct? If I were to rise and go forward--and I now felt something like a continued impulse, in spite of relaxations and revolts--I must master this knowledge, it must be my guide, form the basis of my creed. I--who never had had a creed, never felt the need of one! For lack of one I had been rudely jolted out of the frail shell I had thought so secure, and stood, as it were, naked and shivering to the storms, staring at a world that was no function of me, after all. My problem, indeed, was how to become a function of it....|$|R
60|$|Because of my heart's Beating like sobs, I come to myself, {{and stand}} In the street spilled over splendidly With wet, flat lights. <b>What</b> I've <b>done</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not, my soul is in strife.|$|R
6000|$|Again she paused, {{then going}} back in her thoughts. [...] "No! There was no harm in that letter. It was simply foolish. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of life then? Nothing. But Mrs Fyne ought to have known better. She {{wrote a letter to}} her brother, a little later. Years {{afterwards}} Roderick allowed me to glance at it. I found in it this sentence: `For years I tried to make a friend of that girl; but I warn you once more that she has the nature of a heartless adventuress' ... `Adventuress!' repeated Flora slowly. `So be it. I have had a fine adventure.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean what}} I say. What is it but {{plotting}} when three folk--you {{and she and}} this Raffles Haw--whisper and arrange and have meetings without a word to me about it? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of your plans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{might also}} tell you a {{thousand}} lies. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about your tears? I am not a susceptible idiot. It all depends upon the cause. There are tears of quiet happiness. Peeling onions also will bring tears.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of Xenophon? That was Pertinax--after he {{had shot}} his first mountain-hare with an arrow--by chance!

It was their business in life. Mother and grandmother, {{all the way back}} they had married. It was my business in life to marry George Castner. Uncle Robert said so in his wisdom, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> he was very wise. And I went to live with my husband in the grey house at Nahala.|$|R

5000|$|I {{loved her}} in a strange post-adolescent-pre-adult way, but then so did {{quite a lot of}} other people. She loved them too and gave them good return for their money.

The fact is, this song is not about one woman…but a compilation of thrills and disappointments, and such a package can only be called Nancy. I grew up fast…the innocence died and, in the category…My Woman… all claims were relinquished.|$|R
2500|$|Shodhan also {{hinted at}} the same : [...] "All I {{can tell you is}} that no youngster could hope to play for long at that time because he had to ally himself to one camp or the other.

He always had his way... I would have loved to play on. But then Hazare called quits and Mankad became captain. I made myself unavailable for the tour to Pakistan in 1954/55. It is unlikely that I would have been chosen".|$|R
