5000|$|Certain {{identification}} to species {{depends on}} details like {{the length of}} the nasal groove and scaling on the tarsus. Birds in breeding plumage can also (with some experience) be identified by the underside pattern: the grey-tailed tattler has fine barring on throat, breast and flanks only, which appear light grey from a distance; the rest of the underside is pure white. The <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler</b> has a coarser barring, still visible from quite far away, {{all the way from the}} throat to the undertail coverts. In non-breeding plumage, observers with much experience will note that the <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler</b> is an overall darker bird with very weak supercilia, whereas the grey-tailed tattler is lighter [...] - [...] particularly on the face, due to their stronger supercilia. Their normal calls also differ strongly; the grey-tailed tattler has a disyllabic whistle, whereas the <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler</b> has a rippling trill. But when they flee from the observer or are otherwise startled or excited, both species alike give a variety of longer or shorter alarm calls.|$|E

50|$|The grey-tailed tattler {{is closely}} related to its North American counterpart, the <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler</b> (T. incana) and is {{difficult}} to distinguish from that species. Both tattlers are unique among the species of Tringa for having unpatterned, greyish wings and back, and a scaly breast pattern extending more or less onto the belly in breeding plumage, in which both also have a rather prominent supercilium.|$|E

50|$|The <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler</b> (Tringa incana) (formerly Heteroscelus incanus: Pereira & Baker, 2005; Banks et al., 2006), is a {{medium-sized}} wading bird. It {{is similar in}} appearance to the closely related gray-tailed tattler, T. brevipes. The tattlers are unique among the species of Tringa for having unpatterned, greyish wings and backs, and a scaly breast pattern extending more or less onto the belly in breeding plumage, in which both also have a rather prominent supercilium.|$|E
50|$|The Denali Highway is an {{important}} birding destination. It offers road access to alpine terrain - not that common in Alaska - and, in the brief birding season there, good viewing {{of a number of}} alpine breeders, including Arctic Warbler, Smith's Longspur, Long-tailed Jaeger, Whimbrel, Surfbird, Lapland Longspur, Horned Lark, Short-eared Owl, <b>Wandering</b> <b>Tattler,</b> Gyrfalcon and much more. A walk north along The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Maclaren Summit Trail (MP 39) can be very productive. There are also trumpeter swans and various other waterfowl in the lakes and ponds along the route.|$|E

50|$|For {{reasons not}} fully known, Clarión {{seems to be}} more {{attractive}} to shorebirds and other vagrant or migrant birds than Socorro; perhaps {{this is due to the}} presence of red-tailed hawks on the latter island. Great blue heron, snowy egret, white-faced ibis, Pacific and possibly American golden plover, spotted sandpiper, <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler,</b> ruddy turnstone, black-necked stilt, western gull and barn swallow are examples of the species that can be encountered on Clarión with some regularity; most of the shorebirds congregate in the sheltered shallows of Sulphur Bay. Others, such as blue-winged teal, western sandpiper, least sandpiper, short-eared owl, belted kingfisher, northern mockingbird and brown-headed cowbird have only been recorded on very few occasions, sometimes only once.|$|E
50|$|About 300 {{species of}} fish have been {{recorded}} from the reefs and inshore waters of the atoll. It is also visited by green turtles and Hawaiian monk seals. Seabird species recorded as breeding on the atoll include Bulwer's petrel, wedge-tailed shearwater, Christmas shearwater, white-tailed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, brown booby, red-footed booby, masked booby, great frigatebird, spectacled tern, sooty tern, brown noddy, black noddy and white tern. It is visited by migratory shorebirds, including the Pacific golden plover, <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler,</b> bristle-thighed curlew, ruddy turnstone and sanderling. Possibilities of humpback whales using the waters as breeding ground has been suggested albeit in small numbers and irregular occurrences so far. Many other cetaceans possibly migrate through the area, but the species being most notably confirmed is Cuvier's beaked whales.|$|E
50|$|Non-endemic landbirds and {{shorebirds}} occur {{mostly as}} vagrants {{or use the}} island as a stopover during migration; the northern mockingbird became established in the late 20th century. Among those that are recorded not infrequently are great blue heron, Hudsonian curlew, spotted sandpiper and <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler.</b> Unlike the situation on smaller and more isolated Clarión, wind-blown or vagrant birds seem to constititute {{the bulk of the}} recorded species, including brown pelican, osprey, peregrine falcon, semipalmated plover, willet, sanderling, belted kingfisher and buff-bellied pipit. It may be that this puzzling observation is due to the presence of the red-tailed hawks and cats, which has at least made the local Urosaurus more wary than its relative on Clarión, and might deter passing birds from stopping on Socorro.|$|E
50|$|Kahana State Park {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of birds and fish. Oopu naniha (Stenogobius hawaiiensis), a native freshwater fish, {{can be found in the}} streams of the lower valley. Amaama (flathead mullet, Mugil cephalus) and milkfish (Chanos chanos) are common in the Huilua Fishpond. Bird species that can be found in the lower valley include Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), sanderling (Calidris alba), <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler</b> (Tringa incana), aukuu (black-crowned night heron, Nycticorax nycticorax), alae keokeo (Hawaiian coot, Fulica alai), and alae ula (Hawaiian gallinule, Gallinula chloropus sandvicensis). The last two species are endangered. In the upper valley are many native species of songbirds, such as the apapane (Himatione sanguinea) and Oahu amakihi (Hemignathus flavus), along with non-native species of mynah, cardinal, dove and ricebird.|$|E
50|$|There are an {{enormous}} number of birds on the island. white-capped noddy terns nest in abundance in the Pisonia trees whilst bridled terns, black-naped terns and silver gulls nest on the ground in more open areas nearer the beach. The carcasses of noddy tern chicks that fall out of nests or adults that become tangled in the sticky Pisonia seeds are quickly devoured by centipedes and the nutrients eventually returned to the soil. From December to May, migratory wedge-tailed shearwaters, colloquially known as 'mutton birds', nest in burrows in the interior of the island and their mournful wails can be heard at night. These birds are readily seen along the forest walk at night and precaution must be taken to not stray from the path as the burrows easily collapse under the weight of a person. From September to March, migratory shorebirds such as ruddy turnstone, grey-tailed tattler, <b>wandering</b> <b>tattler,</b> bar-tailed godwit, Pacific golden plover and lesser sand plover can be seen foraging on the reef flat at low tide. Buff-banded rails, white and grey phases of the eastern reef egret, pied oystercatchers, sooty oystercatchers and Capricorn silvereyes are resident on the island year-round.|$|E

40|$|Shorebirds often feed in multispecies {{groups that}} display {{interesting}} niche dynamics. On Moorea, French Polynesia, the <b>Wandering</b> <b>Tattler</b> (Tringa incana) and Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva) are the dominant shorebird species during the northern winter. These species’ feeding behavior {{was observed at}} the Temae estuary on the northeast side of the island. Relative abundance of the two species was determined using transect counts at the estuary and an adjacent beach. T. incana displayed more striking and sprinting behavior, while P. fulva displayed more picking and walking behavior. T. incana also consumed more crabs than P. fulva. The two species existed in relatively equal abundance in the estuary; T. incana was more common on the beach.
