25|$|Kugel {{reported}} that the Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein found no pig bones in hilltop sites starting in the Iron I period (roughly 1200–1000 BCE) and continuing through Iron II, while before that, in Bronze Age sites, pig bones abounded.

25|$|There {{are four}} {{reasons why the}} Cynics are so named. First because of the {{indifference}} of their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>for</b> they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second {{reason is that the}} dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.|$|E

500|$|Mary's erotic {{relationships}} with both Ann and Henry challenge traditional {{conceptions of the}} marriage plot. Most of Mary's positive attributes, such as her rationality, her ability to reject convention, and her sexuality would have been read in the 18th century as masculine traits. Eliza, Ann, and Henry embody the feminine weakness and passivity, often associated with sentimentality, that Wollstonecraft was criticizing. Although the novel critiques sentimentality, the text appears, in the end, to be unable to resist those very conventions as Mary begins to pine for Henry. Furthermore, the book does not present an alternative <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> women—it offers only death. Yet, at the same time, the last few lines of the novel hold out {{the promise of a}} better world [...] "where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's).|$|E

500|$|In September 1982 the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, {{travelled}} to Beijing {{to negotiate}} with the Chinese government, on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong. Under the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, Hong Kong Island itself had been ceded to Britain in perpetuity, {{but the vast majority of}} the colony was constituted by the New Territories, which had been acquired under a 99-year lease in 1898, due to expire in 1997. Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China. A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong would become a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, maintaining its <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> at least 50 years.

500|$|The term [...] "new age", {{along with}} related terms like [...] "new era" [...] and [...] "new world", long predate the {{emergence}} of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> humanity is dawning. It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the Great Seal of the United States, designed in 1782, proclaims a [...] "new order of ages", while in the 1980s the Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev proclaimed that [...] "all mankind is entering a new age". The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward. [...] In 1864 the American Swedenborgian Warren Felt Evans published The New Age and its Message, while in 1907 Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson began editing a weekly journal of Christian liberalism and socialism titled The New Age. The concept of a coming [...] "new age" [...] that would be inaugurated by the [...] return to Earth of Jesus Christ was a theme in the poetry of Wellesley Tudor Pole and Johanna Brandt, and then also appeared {{in the work of the}} American Theosophist Alice Bailey, who used the term prominently in such titles as Disciplineship in the New Age (1944) and Education in the New Age (1954).|$|E
