500|$|During Goodwin's work on Team of Rivals, a {{plagiarism}} scandal erupted over unmarked quotations in Goodwin's 1987 book The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys. Goodwin {{stated that}} {{in dealing with}} the scandal, during which she had to apologize and make an out-of-court settlement to author Lynne McTaggart, she found Lincoln a consolation, particularly his philosophy [...] "not to waste precious energies on recriminations about the past". In a 2012 interview, Goodwin cited early 20th-century muckraker Ida Tarbell on the pleasures of writing about Lincoln: [...] "Somebody asked her, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> many people write about Lincoln? And she said, because he’s so companionable. And I think somehow that's been true for me." ...|$|E

While the BBC wanted the series to match the success of Cold Feet, producer Rob Bullock stressed that [...] "Cold Feet is about a different period of life. It's about people in their early thirties. Mutual Friends moves things on—what's happening to our characters as they approach 40 is very different. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> many lives fall apart at 40? Because things haven't worked out how we hoped and we've had to turn to Plan B. The drama {{is all about the}} crisis caused by things not turning out as the characters planned." [...] Later in 2008, ITV commissioned Married Single Other, a comedy drama executive-produced by Andy Harries and directed by Declan Lowney, about three contemporary couples living in Leeds.|$|E

2500|$|The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern commented, [...] "'Knight and Day' {{woke me up}} to {{just how}} awful some summer {{entertainments}} have become. It isn't that the film is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, {{but that it is}} truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert rated the movie 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, [...] "'Knight and Day' aspires to the light charm of a romantic action comedy like 'Charade' or 'Romancing the Stone,' but would come closer if it dialed down the relentless action. The romance part goes without saying after a Meet Cute contrived in an airport, and the comedy seems to generate naturally between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> many summer movies find it obligatory to inflict us with CGI overkill? I'd sorta rather see Diaz and Cruise in action scenes on a human scale, rather than have it rubbed in that for long stretches, they're essentially replaced by animation." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle." [...] Writing for the Associated Press, Christy Lemire commented, [...] "Cruise's presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action – and the story itself – spin ridiculously out of control." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic observed, [...] "Mangold, working from a script by Patrick O'Neill, accelerates events {{in a way that is}} either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything that's wrong with movies today. Maybe it's both." [...] Joshua Starnes of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 6.5 out of 10, and concluded his review, [...] "Instead of watching it, you're better off putting [...] "Knight and Day" [...] in a time capsule and singing some Don McLean, 'cause this is the day the movie star died." [...] In a subsequent [...] "mini review", Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, and concluded, [...] "The entertainment comes from how much fun it is watching [...] on screen together and that's what separates Knight and Day from previous attempts at mixing romance, comedy, and action." [...] In a review for CNN, Tom Charity commented, [...] "there's a creeping anxiety about this project, a tendency to over-compensate that speaks to underlying inadequacies." ...|$|E

Philosophers, worthy of the name, will flock to your States; thinkers will crowd round that throne, as the skilfulest artisans do to the city where their art is in request.

6000|$|Oh! my friends, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> few love Christ? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> few live {{as those}} who are not their own, but bought with the price of His {{precious}} blood and bound to devote themselves, body and soul, to His cause? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> many struggle against their sins, while yet they cannot break off those sins, but go struggling and sinning on, hating their sins and yet unable to break through their sins, like birds beating themselves to death against the wires of their cage? Why? Because they do not know Christ. And how can they know Him, unless they read their Bibles with simple, childlike hearts, determined to let the Bible tell its own story: believing that those who walked with Christ on earth, must know best what He was like? Why? Because they will not ask Christ to come and show Himself to them, and make them see Him, and love Him, and admire Him, whether they will or not. Oh! remember, if Christ be the Son of God, the Lord of heaven and earth, we cannot go to Him, poor, weak, ignorant creatures as we are. We cannot ascend up into heaven to bring Christ down. He must come down out of His own great love and condescension, and dwell in our hearts as He has promised to do, if we do but love Him. He must come down and show Himself to us. Oh! read your Bibles--read the story of Christ, and if that does not stir up in you some love for Him, you must have hearts of stone, not flesh and blood. And then go to Him; pray to Him, whether you believe in Him altogether or not, upon the mere chance of His being able to hear you and help you. You would not throw away a chance on earth; will you throw away such a chance in heaven as having the Son of God to help you? Oh, cry to Him; say out of the depths of your heart: [...] "Thou most blessed and glorious Being who ever walked this earth, who hast gone blameless through all sorrow and temptation that man can feel; if Thou dost love anyone, if Thou canst hear anyone, hear me! If thou canst not help me, no one can. I have a hundred puzzling questions which I cannot answer for myself, a hundred temptations which I cannot conquer for myself, a hundred bad habits which I cannot shake off of myself; and they tell me that Thou canst teach me, Thou canst guide me, Thou canst strengthen me, Thou canst take out of my heart this shame and gnawing of an evil conscience. If Thou be the Son of God, make me clean! If it be true that Thou lovest all men, show Thy love to me! If it be true that Thou canst teach all men, teach me! If it be true that Thou canst help all men, help my unbelief, for if Thou dost not, there is no help for me in heaven or earth!" [...] You, who are sinful, distracted, puzzled, broken-hearted, cry to Christ in that way, if you have no better way, and see if He does not hear you. He is not one to break the bruised reed, or quench the smoking flax. He will hear you, for He has heard all who have ever called on Him. Cry to Him from the bottom of your hearts. Tell Him that you do NOT love Him, and that yet you LONG to love Him. And see if you do not find it true that those who come to Christ, He will in no wise cast out. He may not seem to answer you the first time, or the tenth time, or for years; for Christ has His own deep, loving, wise ways of teaching each man, and for each man a different way. But try to learn all you can of Him. Try to know Him. Pray to know, and understand Him, and love Him. And sooner or later you will find His words come true, [...] "If a man love me, I and my Father will come to him, and take up our abode with him." [...] And then you will feel arise in you a hungering and a thirsting after righteousness, a spirit of love, and a desire of doing good, which will carry you up and on, above all that man can say or do against you--above all the laziness, and wilfulness, and selfishness, and cowardice which dwells in the heart of everyone. You will be able to trample it all under foot for the sake of being good and doing good, in the strength of that one glorious thought, [...] "Christ lived and died for me, and, so help me God, I will live and die for Christ." ...|$|E
6000|$|And yet, what {{is there}} to say except that war puts a strain on human nature that breaks down the better half of it, and makes the worse half a diabolical virtue? Better, for us if it broke it down altogether, for then the warlike way out of our {{difficulties}} would be barred to us, and we should take greater care not to get into them. In truth, it is, as Byron said, [...] "not difficult to die," [...] and enormously difficult to live: that explains why, at bottom, peace is not only better than war, but infinitely more arduous. Did any hero of the war face the glorious risk of death more bravely than the traitor Bolo faced the ignominious certainty of it? Bolo taught us all how to die: can we say that he taught us all how to live? Hardly a week passes now without some soldier who braved death in the field so recklessly that he was decorated or specially commended for it, being haled before our magistrates for having failed to resist the paltriest temptations of peace, with no better excuse than the old one that [...] "a man must live." [...] Strange that one who, sooner than do honest work, will sell his honor for a bottle of wine, a visit to the theatre, and an hour with a strange woman, all obtained by passing a worthless cheque, could yet stake his life on the most desperate chances of the battle-field! Does it not seem as if, after all, the glory of death were cheaper than the glory of life? If it is not easier to attain, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> many more men attain it? At all events {{it is clear that the}} kingdom of the Prince of Peace has not yet become the kingdom of this world. His attempts at invasion have been resisted far more fiercely than the Kaiser's. Successful as that resistance has been, it has piled up a sort of National Debt that is not the less oppressive because we have no figures for it and do not intend to pay it. A blockade that cuts off [...] "the grace of our Lord" [...] is in the long run less bearable than the blockades which merely cut off raw materials; and against that blockade our Armada is impotent. In the blockader's house, he has assured us, there are many mansions; but I am afraid they do not include either Heartbreak House or Horseback Hall.|$|E
