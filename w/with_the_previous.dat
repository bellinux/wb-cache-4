5|$|As <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> {{novels in}} the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: {{the visit to}} the health clinic was {{inspired}} by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E

The king's position was more pathetically composed and expressive and it agreed more with the change of emphasis that had taken place during the evolution of the work after Larsson's decision that the sacrifice was voluntary.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that firms {{established}} by experienced founders have higher survival rates and employment growth, but the potential effect of pre-entry experiences on innovation remains unclear.

Apart from entrepreneurial experiences, the results suggest no effect of pre-entry experiences. Continued contacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> founder's <b>previous</b> employer appear to limit the firm's innovative performance, but firms do benefit from being established near <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> workplace.
