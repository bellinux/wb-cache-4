Members of women's organisations lit candles in her memory and protested against exploitation of women. University students and others organised a candlelight march at the bus stand in South Delhi where Nirbhaya and her friend, Pandey, boarded the bus in which the rape and beatings took place. At a commemorative prayer meeting political leaders resolved to increase efforts to improve women's security. Speaking with the victim's mother, former chief minister Sheila Dikshit said that Delhi's society and the various authorities will work together to build a permanent legacy to her daughter: [...] "...whatever you will want in her memory, we will try to fulfill. And we will try with a conviction that such an incident is not repeated <b>with</b> <b>anybody</b> else in the future". [...] The victim's parents spoke at a memorial saying that they were proud of the courage that their daughter showed, which they believe [...] "has spurred more women to speak out instead of hiding the crimes committed against them".|$|E

500|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 26, 1910. The film likely saw a wide national release, advertisements in theaters are known in Indiana, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave the most detailed review of the trade publications by summing up the scenario and approving of the plot and the good acting in the production. The reviewer concluded, [...] "Not only are the leading roles well portrayed, but the minor parts are quite well done in the picture - the dismissed stenographer and the old landlady actually look and act their parts. There is a pleasing, symmetrical competence in the whole cast." [...] The production was reviewed positively by The Moving Picture World and concludes with the statement, [...] "The story ends there without a suspicion of anybody falling in love <b>with</b> <b>anybody</b> else, a restraint which will be duly appreciated." [...] Bower's notes that many Thanhouser plots conclude with the romance and the reviewer noted this change was a welcome one for this production. The previous film A Dainty Politician concluded with romance and the next release An Assisted Elopement took the romance element further with two sets of parents {{trying to get their}} children to marry each other.|$|E
500|$|To {{create a}} more urban record, Milian had a list of {{producers}} {{that she wanted to}} work with for So Amazin. She said that in most cases, even when she had R producers, most songs would end up being pop instead of R L.A. Reid suggested to Milian that she should work with Cool & Dre, with whom she ended up working with as the first people to start off the album. Although Milian was originally supposed to work with several different music producers, she felt that the chemistry they had in the first week was so [...] "instant and real" [...] that she felt she could not get a better [...] "vibe" [...] <b>with</b> <b>anybody</b> else other than them. Together, they produced four songs in the first few days, which prompted Milian to ask her label if she could continue working with the duo. At the same time, Cool & Dre called their managers to ask if they could continue working with Milian. Milian felt that it was [...] "just the perfect connection", and that working with them [...] "just felt so original". The singer described Cool & Dre as [...] "beat makers", rather than just hip-hop producers, and believed that she was really able to express herself lyrically through their music.|$|E

[...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E
