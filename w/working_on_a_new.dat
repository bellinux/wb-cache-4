5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the question was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine {{is the only one who}} never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book.

5|$|In 2011, Hideo Kojima and {{his studio}} Kojima Productions were <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Metal Gear game {{focused on one}} of its main {{characters}} Raiden, a ninja equipped with swords.
