6000|$|Mrs. Glass <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> at her cousin's {{reluctance}} to stir abroad, and her {{indifference to the}} fine sights of London.

60|$|One day, the {{two friends}} {{returned}} to camp after being away for some time watching what was going on. On entering their tent, Albert, {{who was the first}} to enter, gave a shout of surprise and pleasure. Edgar pushed in to see what could have thus excited his friend, and so moved him from his usual quiet manner. He, too, <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised,</b> and almost equally pleased, when he saw Albert standing with his hand clasped in that of his father.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Jane <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> and gratified. The {{return of}} the check for a hundred dollars was very pleasant. She had drawn a similar check for each of her three nieces, believing {{that it would be}} {{necessary}} for her to meet their expenses, and she had considered the expenditure in the nature of a business transaction. But Patricia had flung one check in her face, practically, and now Louise had voluntarily returned another, because she did not need the money. Really, Jane Merrick was accomplishing her purpose for less money than she had expected, and she had hoarded her wealth for so many years that she disliked to spend any of it foolishly.|$|E
60|$|Clowes <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised,</b> {{but for a}} {{different}} reason. It {{was not so much}} the enormity of Ruthven's proceedings that took him aback. He believed him, with that cheerful intolerance which a certain type of mind affects, capable of anything. What surprised him was the fact that Ruthven had had the ingenuity and even the daring to conduct a campaign of this description. Cribbing in examinations he would have thought the limit of his crimes. Something backboneless and underhand of that kind would not have surprised him in the least. He would have said that it was just about what he had expected all along. But that Ruthven should blossom out suddenly as quite an ingenious and capable criminal in this way, was a complete surprise.|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} {{surprised}} that I, an ignorant boy or youth on the pampas, had ventured to criticise such a work. I, on my side, had <b>been</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> at his quiet way of reasoning with me, {{with none of}} the old scornful spirit flaming out. He was gentle with me, knowing that I had suffered much, and was not free yet.|$|R
60|$|They <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised,</b> {{though on}} another account. They all {{told me they}} were neighbors; that they had heard any one might take them; that they were nobody's goods; and the like. I talked big to them at first; went back to the gate and took out the key, so that they were all my prisoners; {{threatened}} to lock them all into the warehouse, and go and fetch my lord mayor's officers for them.|$|R
50|$|Balaraju's granddaughter Satya {{comes back}} from Hyderabad. Abhiram is {{surprised}} to see Satya's cultured behaviour and traditional attire, as Bunny and Abhiram previously met her in a pub in Hyderabad. She <b>is</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> to see him; his cell phone contains photos showing how she spent her time at the pub. Abhiram blackmails Satya with the photos,but she then asks Bangari to get Abhiram's cell phone by telling him that Abhiram is blackmailing her. Their collective efforts fail, and Baachi is also dragged into the affair.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} the king ape had stood {{motionless}} with surprise. He had expected no such rash action upon {{the part of}} either of the intruders. Akut <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised.</b> Now he shouted excitedly for Korak to come back, for he knew that in the sacred arena the other bulls {{might be expected to}} come to the assistance of their king against an outsider, though there was small likelihood that the king would need assistance. Once those mighty jaws closed upon the boy's soft neck the end would come quickly. To leap to his rescue would mean death for Akut, too; but the brave old ape never hesitated. Bristling and growling, he dropped to the sward just as the king ape charged.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, Miss Keene's eyes {{occasionally}} wandered {{from the}} charming prospect towards the companion-ladder. Presently she became ominously and ostentatiously {{interested in the}} view again, {{and at the same}} moment a young man's head and shoulders appeared above the companionway. With a bound he was on the slanting deck, moving with the agility and adaptability of youth, and approached the group. He was quite surprised to find Miss Keene there so early, and Miss Keene <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> at his appearance, notwithstanding the phenomenon had occurred with singular regularity for the last three weeks. The two spectators of this gentle comedy received it as they had often received it before, with a mixture of apparent astonishment and patronizing unconsciousness, and, after a decent interval, moved away together, leaving the young people alone.|$|E
60|$|Before {{ordering}} horses, {{to proceed}} on his journey, General Browne made inquiries concerning {{the proprietor of}} the chateau which had so attracted his admiration, and <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> and pleased at hearing in reply a nobleman named, whom we shall call Lord Woodville. How fortunate! Much of Browne's early recollections, both at school and at college, had been connected with young Woodville, whom, by a few questions, he now ascertained {{to be the same}} with the owner of this fair domain. He had been raised to the peerage by the decease of his father a few months before, and, as the General learned from the landlord, the term of mourning being ended, was now taking possession of his paternal estate in the jovial season of merry, autumn, accompanied by a select party of friends, to enjoy the sports of a country famous for game.|$|E
60|$|The Marquis did {{not wish}} to see his son exactly at this minute; but Lord St. George was, of course, admitted. This meeting at the lawyer's {{chambers}} was altogether fortuitous, and father and son <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised.</b> But so great was the anger and dismay and general perturbation of the Marquis at the time, that he could not stop to ask any question. St. George must, of course, know what had happened, and it was quite as well that he should be told at once.|$|R

6000|$|MY EVER DEAR OLD ACQUAINTANCE,--I <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> {{and pleased}} at your letter, though I dare {{say you will}} think, by my delaying so long to write to you, that I am so drowned in the intovirarion of good fortune as to be {{indifferent}} to old, and once dear connections. The truth is, I was determined to write a good letter, full of argument, amplification, erudition, and, as Bayes says, all that. I thought of it, and thought of it, and, by my soul, I could not; and, lest you should mistake the cause of my silence, I just sit down to tell you so. Don't give yourself credit, though, that the strength of your logic scares me; the truth is, I never mean to meet you on that ground at all. You have shown me one thing {{which was to be}} demonstrated: that strong pride of reasoning, with a little affectation of singularity, may mislead the best of hearts. I likewise, since you and I were first acquainted, in the pride of despising old women's stories, ventured in [...] "the daring path Spinosa trod;" [...] but experience of the weakness, not the strength of human powers, made me glad to grasp at revealed religion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the slightest; it {{was light}} enough {{to see that they}} were dark, but from the time the boat came along the blanket was over my head, and except when they gave me the water I had no chance of seeing any of their features. Still, if I had gone {{straight}} to the town I saw and reported the matter to the authorities and sent mounted men to all the ports to warn them not to let any colored men embark, I might have given them a lot of trouble, but I don't suppose any of them would ever have been caught. After the craft they had shown in the whole matter, it is certain that they would have laid their plans for escape so well that the law would never have laid hands upon them. I put my hand mechanically to my watch to see the time, and to my astonishment discovered that I still had it in my pocket, and <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> to find that the money in my trousers' pockets was also untouched. The watch had, of course, stopped. I first of all went down to the water and had a good wash; then I proceeded to the town, and, going to a hotel, ordered breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|Since then, I {{am glad to}} say, it {{has become}} a popular and common pursuit, owing, I doubt not, to the impulse given to it by the many authors whose works I then {{recommend}}ed. I recommend them still; though a swarm of other manuals and popular works have appeared since, excellent in their way, and almost beyond counting. But all honour to those, and above all to Mr. Gosse and Mr. Johns, who first opened people's eyes to the wonders around them all day long. [...] Now, we have, in addition to amusing books on special subjects, serials on Natural History more or less profound, and suited to every kind of student and every grade of knowledge. I mention the names of none. For first, they happily need no advertisement from me; and next, I fear to be unjust to any one of them by inadvertently omitting its name. Let me add, that in the advertising columns of those serials, will be found notices of all the new manuals, and of all apparatus, and other matters, needed by amateur naturalists, and of many who are more than amateurs. [...] Microscopy, meanwhile, and the whole study of [...] "The Wonders of the Little," [...] have made vast strides in the last twenty years; and I <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> and pleased, to find, three years ago, in each of two towns of a few thousand inhabitants, perhaps a dozen good microscopes, all but hidden away from the public, worked by men who knew how to handle them, and who knew what they were looking at; but who modestly refrained from telling anybody what they were doing so well. And it was this very discovery of unsuspected microscopists which made me more desirous than ever to see - as I see now in many places - scientific societies, by means of which the few, who otherwise would work apart, may communicate their knowledge to each other, and to the many. These [...] "Microscopic," [...] "Naturalist," [...] "Geological," [...] or other societies, and the [...] "Field Clubs" [...] for excursions into the country, which are usually connected with them, form a most pleasant and hopeful new feature in English Society; bringing together, as they do, almost all ranks, all shades of opinion; and it has given me deep pleasure to see, in the case at least of the Country Clubs with which I am acquainted, the clergy of the Church of England taking an active, and often a leading, interest in their practical work. The town clergy are, for the most part, too utterly overworked to follow the example of their country brethren. But I have reason to know that they regard such societies, and Natural History in general, with no unfriendly eyes; and that there is less fear than ever that the clergy of the Church of England should have to relinquish their ancient boast - that since the formation of the Royal Society in the seventeenth century, they have done more for sound physical science than any other priesthood or ministry in the world. Let me advise anyone who may do me the honour of reading these pages, to discover whether such a Club or Society exists in his neighbourhood, and to join it forthwith, certain that - if his experience be at all like mine - he will gain most pleasant information and most pleasant acquaintances, and pass most pleasant days and evenings, among people whom he will be glad to know, and whom he never would have known save for the new - and now, I hope, rapidly spreading - freemasonry of Natural History.|$|E

Hooks, had put all his resources and energies in making the town self-sufficient. His efforts were not lost on the townsfolk and at a secret meeting it was decided to show their appreciation with a special gesture, as a party was arranged in Hooks' honor. His daughter Donna, living in Beaumont, was invited to attend. When Mr. Hooks arrived at the railroad station to pick up his daughter he was amazed to see a sign hung {{at the side of the}} rails, reading [...] "Welcome to the town of Donna".

Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an easy one. Wellington's superiors <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to hear about the}} defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.|$|R
