40|$|The {{controversy}} between Shuichi Katsuta and Satoru Umene {{took place}} in 1952,facing a crisis of dividing of social studies. At that time, Katsuta {{was the leader of}} the Kyokaken (the Conference-group of Educational Science), and Umene was the vice-chairman of the Koaren (Core-Curriculum League). After the controversy, Kyokaken has come to acquire greater influence over educational circles than the Koaren. Examining the following two points, in this paper, I try to read out a problem over the theory of Seikatsu-Kyoiku (Education for Life) in Japan after W. W. II, from the controversy. First, Umene insisted that his theory about social studies has developed from Shakai-Kenkyuka (Social Research Subject) -the idea shaped by Kiyoo Toneoka. However, no one has pointed out the connection between the two, though they argued about the same educational theory. Secondly, Tomeoka proposed Shakai-Kenkyu-ka, when he criticized Seikatsu-Tsuzurikata. Later, both Katsuta and Umene evaluated Yamabiko-Gakko or Seikatsu-Tsuzurikata. I try to examine those evaluation and criticism, comparing their characteristic of Seikatsu-Kyoiku. After of all, I want to define <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> on the theory of Seikatsu-Kyoiku before and after the W. W. II...|$|E

40|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem?</b> Sibuyan Island is {{the second}} largest island of the Province of Romblon located {{in the center of}} the Philippine Archipelago. It is home to around 330 {{indigenous}} Sibuyan Mangyan families dependent on swidden agriculture (temporary plots produced by cutting and burning off vegetative cover), hunting, and gathering of forest products. Over time, intact forests have been cleared to make way for new swidden farms, while the need for cash income has led some to resort to cutting and hauling timber for lowland traders. Since 1976, the 5, 500 hectare forest has shrunk by 16 %. With forest loss, two of the vital watersheds, and their services – Cantigas and Palangcalan- could potentially disappear. The San Fernando town depends on these two watersheds for drinking, irrigation, ecotourism, riparian fishing and to supply the needs of a mini hydro electric plant. A study by WWF estimated that if the current trend in population growth and livelihood activities continues, it would have serious consequences to the water quality. The total erosion rate would increase by 28 percent in 25 years from the present rate of 293, 267 tons per year for both watersheds (Evangelista 2007). The water quality from the Cantinga...|$|E
40|$|This paper reconsiders {{the unified}} {{probabilistic}} {{model of information}} retrieval, proposed by the author with M. E. Maron and W. S. Cooper in 1982, as a reconciliation of the Maron & Kuhns and Robertson & Sparck Jones models. Some basic concepts of the unified model, such as documents, user needs, and terms as properties of these, are discussed and reformulated {{in the light of}} later work. The issue of the event space underlying the model is also re-assessed. An event space consisting of a Cartesian product of four random variables is proposed: two observed, the texts of the document and query, and two hidden, the models assumed to underly the texts. Relevance is seen as a derived random variable within this space. The product space should not, however, be flattened: its structure is important and must be retained. In this paper I will revisit some work done over 20 years ago, with M. E. (Bill) Maron and W. S. (Bill) Cooper (Robertson, Maron and Cooper, 1982; Robertson, Maron and Cooper, 1983). I will also consider some more recent developments. The two central, related issues are: (1) how we construe the basic objects of the IR space, their properties and relationships; and (2) how we interpret the notion of event space in this context, for the purpose of statistical models and experiments. 1 <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> under consideration? Why was {{government}} intervention necessary? The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) {{was required to}} transpose into UK law EU Directive 95 / 46 /EC ("the Directive"). In turn, the Directive was needed to establish coherent minimum standards amongst EU Member States, the lack of which had acted {{as a barrier to}} the free flow of personal data across the EU. Before this, and in response to an increase in the use of computerised records, standards which would protect personal data were enshrined in the Council of Europe Data Protection Convention (Convention 108). In the context of extending the safeguards for individuals ' right to the respect for privacy, Convention 108 established rights related to the growing use of computerised data and created certain rights for individuals in relation to the data which are held about them. What were the policy objectives and the intended effects? The aims of the Directive were to establish minimum data protection standards throughout the EU; to protect individuals ' rights and freedoms, and in particular their right to privacy with regard to the processing of personal data; and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the EU in the interests of improving the operation of the single market. The DPA was enacted to give effect to the Directive, whilst maintaining the rights for individuals and responsibilities of organisations in relation to the processing of personal dat...|$|E

40|$|In this {{presentation}} we {{look for}} answers to questions: <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> solved with the relativity theory, and, did the theory solve the right problem? Newtonian physics is local by its nature. No local frame is in a special position in space. There are no overall limits to space or to physical quantities. Newtonian space is Euclidean until infinity, and velocities in Newtonian space grow linearly {{as long as there}} is constant force acting on an object. Observations on the properties of the propagation of light in late 19 th century showed contradiction with the unlimited, linear Newtonian space. Relativity theory broke the linearity and the Euclidean appearance of Newtonian space by redefining the coordinate quantities, time and distance. In the redefined coordinates, the growth of velocities is limited to the velocity of light, which was defined as a natural constant. The local nature of Newtonian physics remains in relativistic space, justified by the relativity principle claiming the same formulation of the laws of nature for any observer. In a holistic perspective, the finiteness of velocities can be seen as a consequence of the finiteness of total energy in space. In such an approach relativity appears primarily as relativity of the local to the whole, and is expressed in terms of the locally available share of total energy. Postulation of the finiteness of the total energy in space allows universal coordinate quantities, time and distance, and links the velocity of light to the energetic state of the universe.

40|$|We {{present the}} TSW system (TestSystem Web), a web-based {{environment}} currently {{developed at the}} Rome 1 University, for the delivery of C programming exercises and their automatic correction. The core of the correction system automatically tests the student’s programs by applying unit-tests and/or by comparing the behaviour of the student’s code to a reference implementation. Care is taken to avoid error propagation from a function to other functionally depending procedures by redirecting the failing calls to the corresponding reference implementation. The system “instruments” the student’s code by using a code analyser and rewriter to handle instruction tracing and function calls redirection. The rewriter can be easily extended to develop other analysis instruments. As an example, we have developed: a code coverage tool that reports {{how much of the}} student’s code has been visited during the test, a cyclomatic complexity evaluator to compare the number of different logic paths in the code, a tracker for stack depth usage to check for proper implementation of recursive functions, a function/loop execution counter for the evaluation of the execution complexity. Additional care is taken to capture disruptive errors that would abort the program: “segmentation faults” caused by wrong pointer dereferentiation, and time-out caused by run-away processes. With these tools, the teacher can write rich unit tests that can either compare the behaviour of the function under analysis with a reference implementation (e. g. by generating random input and comparing the results), or by submitting well-crafted special inputs to elicit special cases or by comparing the complexity and/or stack depth counters. Each test applied will then explain to the student <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> found. TSW is the core component of a future larger social knowledge project, in which students will cooperatively/competitively participate to the definition and test of each-other’s programs, sharing ideas and learning from each other...|$|E
40|$|Despite growing {{academic}} {{interest in}} the human–animal relationship, {{little research has been}} directed toward the political regulation of animal treatment. Even less attention has been accorded to the emergence of the long dominant paradigm in this policy area, namely, the ideology of animal welfare. This book attempts to address this gap by chronicling the early history of animal politics in Sweden with the aim of producing a critical, deconstructive genealogy of animal cruelty and animal welfare. The study ranges from the first political debates about animal cruelty in 1844 to the institution of Sweden’s first comprehensive animal protection act in 1944. Taking a post-Marxist and psychoanalytically informed approach to discourse analysis, the study focuses on how the “problem” of animal cruelty was articulated in the parliamentary debates and government documents throughout the period: <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of animal (mis) treatment represented to be? What kinds of animal (ab) use were rendered uncontroversial? What kind of affective investments and ideological fantasies underpinned these discursive constructions, and how did the problematizations change over time? The book contains six empirical chapters that deal with the most important legal revisions in the period as well as the parallel debates about animal experimentation and slaughter. Two major discursive regimes—an early “anti-cruelty regime” and a later “animal welfare regime”—are identified in the material, and the transition between them is theorized in terms of discursive antagonism and dislocation. Focusing on the conflict between competing discursive logics, the study charts a century of ideological struggles through which our modern attitudes toward animals were born. The book also offers a critical reinterpretation of the success story of animal welfare. Against the assumption that modern animal welfarism progressively grew out of the preceding anti-cruelty regime, the central claim of this book is that the “welfarist turn” {{that took place in the}} 1930 s and 1940 s also functioned to re-entrench society’s speciesist values and de-problematize the exploitation of animals for human purposes...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} about what occupation is but little discussion about why occupation became so important during the Progressive Era (1890 - 1914) during which time occupational therapy became organized and recognized. In other words, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> to which occupation was the solution? This presentation proposes that the problem was idleness. Idleness according dictionaries involves not working, not being active, not spending of filling time with activities, not keeping busy, habitually doing nothing or avoiding work, lazy, not of real worth or importance, meaningless, loitering, and aimless. Herbert Hall, M. D. states that “idleness too long continued is as deadening to the spirit as it is disabling to the body [...] . Idleness [...] . which is forced upon us in long illness or in delayed convalescence, too often means degeneration, and in the end, increased suffering. ” Some popular quotes of the time period were “trouble springs from idleness, and grievous toil from needless ease (Benjamin Franklin). The way to be nothing is to do nothing (Nathaniel Howe). Evil thought often come from idleness (Gaelic Proverb). Idleness is the devil’s workshop (old proverb). Several themes emerge from {{the authors of the}} early twentieth century. Health and how to better attain and maintain it was one. So was getting work done at institutions for the insane and tuberculosis as cheaply as possible. Another problem was finding a way for poor people to pay for their stay in the institution. In addition there was a need for manpower (person power) to work in an economy that was heating up due to World War I that required “all hands on deck. ” As the war progressed and ended there was another concern that disabled soldiers and sailors would not return to paying jobs and drain the economy to pay pensions. Occupation was often seen as the solution. Making idleness “the bad guy” was a popular message. The message was carried in a variety of ways: creating jobs for the handicapped (disabled), supporting job training and working conditions, encouraging voluntarism, infusing the idea of the work ethic into religious messages, publishing essays and editorials in the popular press lauding work and publishing articles in professional journals. Each of these communication approaches will be explored and discussed in the presentation...|$|E
