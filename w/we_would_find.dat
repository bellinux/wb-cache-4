From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States.
