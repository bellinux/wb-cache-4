500|$|Nielsen {{himself was}} {{ambiguous}} about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He {{wrote to the}} Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 [...] "I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> songs sung in unison? We must go back... to the pure and the clear." [...] On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 [...] "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does... and {{it is impossible to}} deliver national music on request." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I {{got a call from}} John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives. Because for me, I genuinely missed his friendship, and same with Shaun [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E
