5|$|Relapsing-remitting MS is {{characterized}} by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease.

5|$|A person <b>with</b> <b>MS</b> {{can have}} almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|An {{elevated}} core temperature, {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person <b>with</b> <b>MS</b> {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E

5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people <b>with</b> <b>MS</b> but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people <b>with</b> <b>MS.</b> The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundMycobacterium abscessus {{complex is}} the second most common {{organism}} isolated from patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease in South Korea. This study aimed to compare clinical features and treatment outcomes of M. abscessus and Mycobacterium massiliense lung disease. MethodsWe retrospectively identified stored clinical isolates of M. abscessus complex as either M. abscessus or M. massiliense and reviewed medical records to compare clinical characteristics and treatment responses. All patients were treated empirically over several months with multidrug regimens, including a macrolide and one or more parenteral agents. ResultsOf the 249 patient isolates tested, 128 (59 <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> abscessus and 69 <b>with</b> <b>M.</b>  massiliense) met the American Thoracic Society diagnostic criteria for NTM pulmonary disease, and treatment outcomes were analyzed in 48 patients (26 <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> abscessus and 22 <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> massiliense). The clinical and radiologic findings were similar between the two groups. Although the durations of parenteral and total treatment were significantly shorter in patients <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> massiliense than in those <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> abscessus (4. 7 months vs 7. 4 months, P = . 006, and 12. 1 months vs 16. 3 months, P = . 043), the treatment success rate was significantly higher in patients <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> massiliense (95. 5 %) than in M. abscessus cases (42. 3 %, P < . 001). ConclusionPatients <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> massiliense pulmonary infection responded better to this antibiotic strategy than those <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> abscessus infection.

The spleen cells of mice immunized <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> vaccae proliferate and secrete gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in response to challenge <b>with</b> live <b>M.</b> tuberculosis in vitro. Immunization <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> vaccae results in the generation of CD 8 + T cells which kill syngeneic macrophages infected <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> tuberculosis. These effector cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are detectable in the spleen at 2 weeks after immunization <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> vaccae but cannot be found in splenocytes 3 to 6 weeks postimmunization.
