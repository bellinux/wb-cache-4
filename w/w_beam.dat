40|$|A {{practical}} {{geometric optics}} method for derivation of the optical forces from light rays was described. By this method, the forces from a G. P. W. (Gaussian Plane Wave) {{and a general}} TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam were calculated and studied. For a G. P. <b>W.</b> <b>beam,</b> there were two forces which acted on small particles located inside the electromagnetic field; one, called the scattering force, directed in the beam propagation direction, pushed particles axially. The other, called the gradient force, due to the non-uniformity of the electromagnetic field, acted like an optical well and confined the particles of the beam axis. The forces from a general TEM$ sb infty$ beam behaved differently due to {{the profile of the}} beam. It was shown that axial confinement was also possible for a highly focused TEM$ sb infty$ beam, therefore providing the possibility of single beam trapping. The relationship between the forces and the profile of a TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam was investigated comprehensively. Three experimental stations were designed and built. Both upward and downward accelerating experiments were constructed to confirm the existences of the scattering force and the gradient force in a G. P. <b>W.</b> <b>beam.</b> Furthermore, the scattering force was studied quantitatively. A single beam trapping experiment was designed to verify the possibility of axial constraint of small particles by a higher focused TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam.

This paper describes the proposed extraction scheme and gives estimations of the stretcher performance in terms of duty factor, emittance and energy spread of the stretched beam. 1 THE ELFE@DESY PROJECT ELFE (Electron Laboratory For Europe) is proposed as a 15 - 25 GeV, 30 A c. w. electron beam facility for nuclear physics experiments[1]. In the past different approaches have been studied to provide such a beam, e. g., a polytron or a recirculating linac[2]. A new approach has been proposed during the concep-tual design studies of a DESY linear collider[3]. If a 500 GeV linear collider linac will be installed at DESY, the first section of this linac could be used to inject a 15 to 25 GeV beam into the HERA electron ring. The ring would then act as a stretcher for the short linac pulses (in the case of TESLA the pulses are 800 s long at a repetition rate of 10 Hz) to create a quasi-continuous beam.

For both experiments, this enhancement was ascribed to the screening effect of the electrons of the metallic lattice where the reactions take place. In [3], the contribution to the d/d reaction rate enhancement, of an attractive Yukawa type of potential, acting between nucleons, was evaluated. The combined effect of this potential and of the screening of the lattice electrons was shown not to be sufficient to explain the whole enhancement observed for both experiments [1] and [2]. A coupling between the deuterons in the target with the incident deuteron beam was thus invoked [3] to explain the enhancement observed, by fusion reactions taking place between the deuterons already trapped in the target. Using the model developed in [3], the energy production resulting from the interaction of a 1 <b>W</b> <b>beam</b> of deuterons with a metallic target loaded with deuterium (1 mmole d), was evaluated {{as a function of the}} incident deuteron energy. 3 zones of interest were identified: a zone corresponding to hot fusion (deuteron energy round 100 000 eV), a zone corresponding to Cold Fusion (SPAWAR experiments- deuteron energy round 10 eV) and a potentially interesting intermediate zone (deuteron energy between 500 and 1000 eV) were sizeable and industrially significant amounts of energy production can be expected.

This paper presents a methodology {{for the design of}} a micromachined force gauge under uncertainty, in which the measured force and the maximum stress in the beams in the gauge are related to five uncertain design parameters representing the dimensions of the beam, the material property and the deflection of the beam under the force being measured. A deterministic large-deflection beam model is combined with a sampling-based stochastic model to obtain the distributions of the measured force and the maximum stress corresponding to the interactive influence of the uncertainty in the five design parameters. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the force measurement accuracy subject to a constraint on the maximum allowable stress. On the basis of the optimization results, design windows for the deflection and the force that maximize the accuracy are derived as functions of the uncertainties in the design parameters. The results provide directly usable information on the optimum geometric design of the force gauge for given uncertainties in the manufacturing and operation of the device.

40|$|Abstract. The {{visible light}} {{diagnostic}} beam line at SPEAR 3 utilizes dipole radiation extracted through an ID exit port to evaluate electron beam properties {{at a variety}} of diagnostic end-stations. The unfocused SR light is collected 17 m from the source point by a 150 mm diameter, f= 2 m lens and optically relayed to the appropriate station. For transverse imaging, an image-intensified PiMax camera with 2 ns gate allows measurement of fast beam dynamics for either the stored beam or the injected beam. For these applications the visible light is switched into either a standard symmetric-lens transport line or a beam-shaping transport line equipped with cylindrical lenses and a rotating mirror to sweep the beam image across the camera photocathode. A separate two slit stellar-interferometer branch line can resolve the diffraction-limited vertical beam height down to about 10 m. For longitudinal charge profile measurements, the light is switched to a Hamamatsu C 5680 streak camera with net system resolution of ~ 2. 5 ps rms. In this paper we outline the main photon beam transport line, review the SR beam properties and describe measurement capabilities at each diagnostic station. TRANSPORT LINE AND PHOTON BEAM PROPERTIES The SPEAR 3 light source features a 10 nm-rad emittance electron beam with up to 500 mA circulating current. The visible light diagnostic beam line takes dipole radiation ~ 10 mrad into a standard, 1. 27 T dipole magnet where the source point dimensions are 150 x 20 m and the critical photon energy is 7. 6 keV. At 500 mA the total radiated power into the 3. 5 x 6 mrad beam line acceptance is 245 W. To reduce beam power on the first Rh-coated Si mirror (M 0), the x-ray component is intercepted by a ± 0. 47 mrad GlidCop „cold finger ‟ extending horizontally across the core of the beam. Hence, as illustrated in Figure 1, both the upper and lower portions of the beam are accessible for observation. This configuration yields the maximum photon flux and the opportunity for transverse beam coherence measurements. The remaining 5 <b>W</b> <b>beam</b> power past the cold finger strike...|$|E

The TEF-P {{is used for the}} experiments for subcritical system coupled with a spallation neutron target bombarded with 600 -MeV proton beam accelerated by the LINAC. To limit the maximum thermal power less than 500 W at the TEF-P, an incident beam power should be less than 10 W. On the contrary, at the TEF-E, high power beam of 200 kW is requested. Both high and low power beams are demanded for the transmutation facilities. It is difficult to deliver a low power beam to the TEF-P. Conventional beam extraction technique with a thin foil, is not desirable because the scattering of the beam at the foil requires the massive shield. Therefore, we study a new technique to extract {{a small portion of the}} beam precisely from the high intensity beam by using a laser beam. By a laser beam, H sup - in the beam from LINAC is partially changed to H sup 0 beam so that a low current H sup 0 beam can be obtained. As the cross section of the charge exchange reaction for H sup - ions has a peak around at a wave length of 1 mu m for photons, YAG laser is suitable for this charge exchange because of its 1. 06 mu m wave length. It is derived that 10 <b>W</b> <b>beam</b> for 600 -MeV proton can be extracted by the YAG laser with power of 2 J for each pulse of 25 Hz. By this technique, the pulse width for the extracted beam can be controlled by changing the time width of laser irradiation. When a charge exchanger having the beam collide point existing in straight section, a background beam current of projectile, however, will be increased due to the interaction with the residual gas in the beam duct. Thus, a charge exchanger is devised having the beam collide point in a by changing this charge exchanger, it is demonstrated that the possibility of the charge exchange due to interactions with residual gas can be drastically decrease. By the above studies, it is recognized that feasibility of the technique of beam extraction with the laser...|$|E

Similarly, the inclusion of Kin+, or Kix'p final states in the $p [...] + Kip data is estimated to be,< 2 %. Corrections have been applied for small azimuthal losses (< 8 %), for scanning losses (- 84 /o), for neutral decay modes of the KS " and A', and for losses resulting from finite Ki and A 0 decay volumes (average correc-tion factors vary from w 1. 05 to w 1. 10 for g decays and from w 1. 05 to 1. 85 for A " decays between 1. 0 and 7. 5 GeV/c). The quoted cross sectionuncertainties include in quadrature the uncertainties in the beam momentum spectrum (,< 4 %), in the azimuthal loss correction (,< 2 $), and in the scanning efficiency (5 2 %). An overall normalization uncertainty of 'V 10 % has not been included. The 90 ' differential cross sections for our Fop-+,'A', ff"p + n'~" and-+ Kip data are shown in fig. 1. For comparison, cross sections for the reaction fir-p-+ non [7] are also plotted in this figure. Numerical values for our data are recorded in table 1. The striking feature of all four cross sections in fig. 1 is their rapid decrease in magnitude with increasing energy. Parameterizing the cross sections with the power law form...|$|E
