5|$|The Sultanates to {{the north}} of Vijayanagara united and {{attacked}} Aliya Rama Raya's army, in January 1565, in a war known as the Battle of Talikota.

The generals captured Aliya Rama Raya and beheaded him on the spot, with Sultan Hussain on the Sultanates side joining them for the execution and stuffing of severed head with straw for display. The beheading of Aliya Rama Raya created confusion and havoc in the still loyal portions of the Vijayanagara army, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied.|$|E
5|$|The presidential {{elections}} of May 1989 were marred by fraud and violence. COLINA, a pro-military coalition {{led by the}} PRD, named Carlos Duque, a former business partner of Noriega as its candidate. ADOC, an opposition coalition, nominated Guillermo Endara, a member of Arias' Panameñista Party, and two other prominent oppositionists, Ricardo Arias Calderón and Guillermo Ford, as vice-presidential candidates. Anticipating fraud, the opposition tracked ballot counts at local precincts {{on the day of}} the election (local ballot counts were done in public). As an exit poll made it clear that the opposition slate <b>was</b> <b>winning</b> by a wide margin, reports of missing tally sheets and seizures of ballot boxes by PDF soon emerged. In the afternoon of the day after the election, the Catholic Bishops conference announced that a quick count of public tallies at polling centers showed the opposition slate winning 3-to-1. Official tallies the day after that, however, had Duque winning by a 2–1 margin.|$|E
5|$|Bath Rugby is a rugby union {{team in the}} Aviva Premiership league. It {{plays in}} black, blue and white kit at the Recreation Ground in the city, {{where it has been}} since the late 19th century, {{following}} its establishment in 1865. The team's first major honour <b>was</b> <b>winning</b> the John Player Cup, now sponsored as the LV Cup and also known as the Anglo-Welsh Cup, four years consecutively from 1984 until 1987. The team then led the Courage league in six seasons in eight years between 1988–89 and 1995–96, during which time it also won the renamed Pilkington Cup in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996. It finally won the Heineken Cup in the 1997–98 season, and topped the Zürich Premiership (now Aviva Premiership) in 2003–04. The team's squad includes several members who also play, or have played in the English national team, including Lee Mears, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, Nick Abendanon and Matt Banahan. Colston's School, Bristol, has had a large input in the team over the past decade, providing several current 1st XV squad members. The former England Rugby Team Manager and former Scotland national coach Andy Robinson used to play for Bath Rugby team and was captain and later coach. Both of Robinson's predecessors, Clive Woodward and Jack Rowell, as well as his successor Brian Ashton, were also former Bath coaches and managers.|$|E

5|$|Club {{competition}} {{paused in}} the last week of March, resuming over the first weekend of April. Benfica's first game was a visit to nearby Estádio da Reboleira to meet Estrela da Amadora. Referee Hugo Miguel called three penalties in the first half-hour: two for Benfica and one for Estrela. Cardozo converted both (in the fifth and 16th minutes), and Silvestre Varela scored for Estrela in a 2–1 final result. Sánchez Flores said that although Benfica played poorly, winning was what mattered. On 11 April, Benfica hosted Académica in another home loss; a 23rd-minute goal by William Tiero secured Académica's second consecutive away win against Benfica. The loss ended any hope of winning the title, since Porto had an eight-point lead. The race for second place (and a UEFA Champions League spot) also experienced a setback, since Sporting now had a four-point lead. The fans turned on Sánchez Flores, waving white handkerchiefs in the traditional request for resignation. The Spaniard realised that winning the Primeira Liga was nearly impossible, and Benfica should focus on qualifying for the Champions League. The club rebounded with an away win against Vitória de Setúbal. They started strong, scoring three goals in the first half for a final score of 4–0. Cardozo and Nuno Gomes scored two goals apiece. A week after Setúbal, Benfica hosted Marítimo for April's final match. By the 38th minute, the club <b>was</b> <b>winning</b> 3–0. Marítimo reacted, cutting Benfica's lead to 3–2 in the 60th minute, but the club defended their lead. Although Sánchez Flores was happy with the three points, he said that Benfica should have better controlled the game.|$|E
5|$|Crosby went on {{to compete}} in two World Junior Championships with Team Canada's under-20 team. When he {{was named to the}} team in December 2003, he became the fifth sixteen-year-old to {{represent}} Canada at the tournament, following Jay Bouwmeester, Jason Spezza, Eric Lindros, and Wayne Gretzky. Competing in the 2004 World Junior Championships in Helsinki, he then became the youngest player to score a goal {{in the history of the}} tournament at 16years, 4months, and 21days when he scored against Switzerland in a 7–2 win. This record would last until the 2012 World Juniors, when Aleksander Barkov of Finland scored a goal aged 16years, 4months. Crosby finished the tournament with 2 goals and 3 assists in 6 games, helping Canada to a silver medal finish. The following year, he returned for Team Canada at the 2005 World Junior Championships in Grand Forks. He improved to 6 goals and 3 assists as Canada earned gold. Crosby stated the following year that his most memorable hockey moment <b>was</b> <b>winning</b> his World Junior gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Nansouty's cavalry {{took part}} in several actions, {{beginning}} with the Battle of Engen, where the commander was noted for his able and daring manoeuvres, subsequently leading a successful charge against enemy infantry, whom he chased {{through the streets of}} the nearby city of Stockach, the locale of the French Army of the Danube's defeat a year earlier. He patrolled the Tyrol and there repulsed Prince Reuss-Plauen's forces in an action fought on 14 June 1800, the day when First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte <b>was</b> <b>winning</b> at Marengo further to the south. Nansouty served as a commander of an autonomous unit in the Tyrol {{until the end of the}} War of the Second Coalition, then under the successive command of Generals Molitor and Gudin. Nansouty's command included as many as five regiments, after the 6th and 8th Hussars were attached to his force. During this time, he enhanced his solid reputation as an able and adept cavalry commander; General Lecourbe stated that he wanted nobody else at the helm of his cavalry.|$|E

5|$|The French advance {{drove in}} the British skirmishers {{and reached the}} sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line {{formation}} for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way {{under the pressure of}} numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French 45e Ligne burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon <b>was</b> <b>winning</b> the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
