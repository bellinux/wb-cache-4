5|$|Early August 8, 1840, the Comanches {{surrounded}} the small port of Linnville, Texas, {{which was the}} second largest port in the Republic of Texas at the time, and began pillaging the stores and houses. Linnville, which is now a ghost town, was located 3.5 miles northeast of present-day Port Lavaca. The Comanches reportedly killed three whites, including customs officer Hugh Oran Watts, who had delayed his escape to retrieve a gold watch at his home (reportedly a family heirloom). After killing Watts, the Comanche captured his wife of only three weeks, the former Juliet Constance, and a black <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1836 {{architect}} John Harper {{arranged a}} small exhibition in York {{of works by}} modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of Venus and her Doves, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did {{take the opportunity to}} buy Etty's A Family of the Forest (also known as Flowers of the Forest), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. A Family of the Forest illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem Theogony, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man looking away from the <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} melodrama {{focuses on}} a young working man named John Bailey (alternatively Jack). His {{alcoholism}} had caused much strife in his home and his wife, May, prays and pleads for him to stop drinking. One night he returns home in a drunken state and strikes her. His wife decides to leave with their child, Marie and goes {{out into the world}} without help. They wander in the snow and become exhausted and fall asleep. They are saved from certain death by a cripple newspaper boy named Jim Sands. He brings them back to his home and they take refuge with Jim's poor family. Realizing his mistake, John searches for his wife and child in vain until he sees a newspaper story (claimed to be two weeks later) about the death of a <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> in the storm. Believing May and Marie are dead, he decides to commit suicide by drowning himself. He is saved by Jim, a member of the Salvation Army and decides that he has to atone for his sins. Jim learns of John and May's relation and reunites family again.|$|E

5|$|The Joes {{locate the}} secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads three {{missiles}} with nanowarheads, which are aimed for Beijing, Moscow, and Washington, DC, the world's {{three most important}} cities. He intends {{to do this to}} strike fear into the hearts of every man, <b>woman,</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> on the planet, after which they will turn to the person with the most power in the world, the President of the United States. After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, Ripcord destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered Doctor Mindbender (Kevin J. O'Connor) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned, so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back; when the Doctor activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to conduct an {{analysis}} of international law in relation to trafficking in <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> {{from the perspective of}} various sources of law as well as various approaches used to deal with the issue. The question of the existence of a rule on the level of international customary law consisting in the prohibition of trafficking in <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> is especially significant. The problem of trafficking in <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> is a multi- dimensional issue encompassing more subsystems of international law, which gives rise to a question of the relation of the respective subsystems. The human rights law and criminal law approach complement each other in international legal instruments which deal with trafficking in <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> when their deficiencies are compensated for by the strengths of the other subsystem. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part presents the introduction into the problem of trafficking in <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> This part explains the relation between the analysed problem and related phenomenon, clarifies key words used in the thesis, defines actors engaged in the process of trafficking in <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> finally deals with factors which exercise influence on the enormous rise of trafficking in <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> in the present-day [...] ...|$|R
25|$|One {{well-known}} {{example of}} this process is Kane's painting Flathead <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> in which he combined a sketch of a Chinookan baby having its head flattened by being strapped to a cradle board with a later field portrait of a Cowlitz woman living in a different region. Another example of how Kane elaborated his sketches can be seen in his painting Indian encampment on Lake Huron, which is based on a sketch taken in summer 1845 during his first trip to Sault Ste. Marie. The painting has a distinct romantic flair accentuated by the lighting and the dramatic clouds, while the scene of the camp life depicted is reminiscent of a European idealized rural peasant scene.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{successful}} tactics employed by the Mongols was to wipe out urban populations that refused to surrender. In the Mongol invasion of Rus', almost all major cities were destroyed. If they chose to submit, the people were generally spared, though this was not guaranteed. For example, the city of Hamadan in modern-day Iran was destroyed and every man, <b>woman,</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> executed by Mongol general Subadai, after surrendering to him but failing to have enough provisions for his Mongol scouting force. Several days after the initial razing of the city, Subadai sent a force back to the burning ruins and {{the site of the}} massacre to kill any inhabitants of the city who had been away {{at the time of the}} initial slaughter and had returned in the meantime. Mongolian armies made use of local peoples and their soldiers, often incorporating them into their armies. Prisoners of war sometimes were given the choice between death and becoming part of the Mongol army to aid in future conquests. In addition to intimidation tactics, the rapid expansion of the empire was facilitated by military hardiness (especially during bitterly cold winters), military skill, meritocracy, and discipline.|$|E

25|$|In this outdoor hunting {{scene the}} horizon line is almost {{on top of}} the canvas. Seven people are present, along with {{numerous}} animals. A man with a hunting horn (Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur) {{can be seen in the}} foreground, his back turned to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension is in the air as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds a gun in the background with a <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The faceting however does not partake in the size-distance relation, as one would expect. The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The hunting horn in the foreground is almost identical in size and in faceting to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads. This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} impact of adjustment policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the vulnerability of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> to HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. A conceptual framework, composed of five different pathways of causation, is used for the evaluation. These five pathways connect changes at the macro level (e. g. removal of food subsidies) with effects at the meso (e. g. higher food prices) and micro levels (e. g. exposure of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> to commercial sex) that influence the vulnerability of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> to HIV/AIDS. Published literature on adjustment policies and socioeconomic determinants of HIV/AIDS among <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> in sub-Saharan Africa was reviewed to explore the cause-effect relationships included in the theoretical framework. Evidence suggests that adjustment policies may inadvertently produce conditions facilitating the exposure of <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> to HIV/AIDS. Complex research designs are needed to further investigate this relationship. A shift in emphasis from an individual approach to a socioeconomic approach in the study of HIV infection among <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> in the developing world is suggested. Given the potential for adjustment policies to exacerbate the AIDS pandemic among <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> a careful examination of the effects of these policies on maternal <b>and</b> <b>child</b> welfare is urgently needed...|$|R
