His reign lasted for 46 years, longer than any Norwegian king since Harald I. Haakon was born into the troubled civil <b>war</b> <b>era</b> in Norway, but his reign eventually managed {{to put an end}} to the internal conflicts. At the start of his reign, during his minority, his later rival Earl Skule Bårdsson served as regent. As a king of the birkebeiner faction, Haakon defeated the uprising of the final bagler royal pretender, Sigurd Ribbung, in 1227. He put a definitive end to the civil <b>war</b> <b>era</b> when he had Skule Bårdsson killed in 1240, a year after he had himself proclaimed king in opposition to Haakon. Haakon thereafter formally appointed his own son as his co-regent.|$|E

5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported.

The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the Australians.
