5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by aspect code. The implementation of the aspect then specifies whether the related code should be added before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> have been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E
5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER {{can also help}} detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually {{involves}} {{the addition of a}} hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Galloways have a thick {{double-layered}} {{coat that}} is wavy or curly. This thick coat of hair insulates their bodies {{so well that}} they have a minimal outer layer of fat on their bodies, which <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> create waste at slaughter. This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates. Despite the animal's usual use in beef production, there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production.|$|E
5|$|Governments and {{conservation}} groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet.|$|E

It presents a German adaptation of the recitatives and written out embellishments for the da capo arias as well as numerous cuts. The B flat fugue G 37 appears as an act II overture along with other instrumental music.|$|E
5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified the chronology and content {{of some of the}} materials, and is thus chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> have been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or sea squirts from growing {{on or near}} them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space. One of many examples includes ageliferin.|$|E
50|$|Some {{economists are}} {{concerned}} about potential inflationary effects driven by increased demand engendered by a fiscal stimulus. In theory, fiscal stimulus does not cause inflation when it uses resources that <b>would</b> have <b>otherwise</b> been idle. For instance, if a fiscal stimulus employs a worker who <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have been unemployed, there is no inflationary effect; however, if the stimulus employs a worker who <b>otherwise</b> <b>would</b> have had a job, the stimulus is increasing labor demand while labor supply remains fixed, leading to wage inflation and therefore price inflation.|$|R

5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|Small {{ships are}} {{built in a}} ship yard while the larger ships require a space dock for construction. Ships range from the small Scoutship (used to {{discover}} new asteroids), to the gigantic Command Cruiser (which is used for transporting combat fleets over vast distances that they <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> be unable to travel without refueling).|$|E
5|$|Some trees {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with Frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they <b>would</b> <b>otherwise</b> be unable to thrive. The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.|$|E
