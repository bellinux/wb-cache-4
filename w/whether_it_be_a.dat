5|$|<b>Whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{depression}} in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough. Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, {{the lack of a}} surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10m/s (20kn, 33ft/s) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development. Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the Westerlies, and a second towards the equator.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{research}} done, it is {{concluded that}} children exposed to extensive vocabulary and complex grammatical structures more quickly develop language and also have a more accurate syntax than children raised in environments without complex grammar exposed to them. With motherese, the mother talks to the child and responds back to the child, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> babble the child made or a short sentence.

Indeed, raising of the forelegs appears to have this 'stop-sign' effect even in encounters between congenerics of the three Phidippus species. Drees, working with female Salticus scenicus, was able to initiate hunting behavior by moving a black dot along a white wall, and to stop the pursuing spider by moving wires projecting {{from the side of}} the model through an angle that imitated the waving of the forelegs.|$|E
25|$|For marching band, schools {{compete against}} other {{schools in the}} same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into seven areas for Class 5A and 6A schools, and five areas for Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A schools. All schools of all classes compete in region {{competition}} annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Class 4A and Class 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 5A can advance from region to area and state. In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, {{they need to get}} an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs {{to make it to the}} Area Final competition AND make it to the top 3-5 bands to get to State. The Area and State winner is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.|$|E

[...] The Columbia Democrat also objected to the new draft laws. When Samuel F. Pealer, a draft officer, attempted to recruit four men in Stillwater, {{one of the men}} threatened to [...] "knock [...] brains out". Unrest increased still further after a costly military campaign in Virginia in early 1864. By June of that year, opposition to the draft was made clear when 75 percent of all people drafted in Columbia County failed to show up. Tension was especially high in the community of Mifflinville, where many people in the county accused one another of conspiracy. The accusations became exaggerated, leading to the rumors of a fort in the mountains at the headwaters of Fishing Creek. Some people even claimed to have seen the fort and the trails along which cannons were supposedly dragged.|$|E
500|$|The {{types of}} fish seen in Abzû {{were based on}} real-life creatures from the oceans of Earth, and to fit them into the game each species was {{distilled}} down to its most distinctive traits. The team had [...] "tens of thousands" [...] of fish within the game. Their swimming styles were directly modeled on the behavior and physics of real fish movements. The number of fish presented problems with running the game, but the programming staff developed a method of simplifying each fish's animation without compromising the game's visuals, which [...] "multiplied the number of fish possible on screens by 10". Each fish species had its own unique artificial intelligence that had cascading levels of awareness and interaction with other species and objects in the environment. The team started with getting the fish to swim without clipping through walls, then built upon that with further expansion on fish behavior and interaction. Their most challenging task was creating realistic bait balling effects for shoals of small fish, which was only achieved and finalized {{near the end of}} development. The developers did take liberties by grouping together types of fish from different parts of the globe which would normally not be able to interact, though this fell in line with the game's overall theme and the myths it referenced. Despite this, the developers emulated the zones that each fish would be found in, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coral reef or the deep ocean where sunlight does not reach. The amount of work and the team's dedication to creating a realistic and vibrant experience meant they were creating fish until development finished.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} central doctrines of Hume's philosophy, stated {{in the very first}} lines of the Treatise, is his notion that the mind {{consists}} of its mental perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: impressions and ideas. Hume's Treatise thus opens with the words: 'All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call IMPRESSIONS and IDEAS." [...] Hume states that [...] "I believe it will not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction" [...] and commentators have generally taken Hume to mean the distinction between feeling and thinking. Controversially, Hume may regard the difference as in some sense a matter of degree, as he takes [...] "impressions" [...] to be distinguished from ideas, {{on the basis of their}} force, liveliness, and vivacity, or what Henry Allison calls the [...] "FLV criterion" [...] in his book on Hume. Ideas are therefore [...] "faint" [...] impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching the handle of a hot pan is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan. [...] According to Hume, impressions are meant to be the original form of all our ideas, and Don Garret has thus coined the term [...] "the copy principle" [...] to refer to Hume's doctrine that all ideas are ultimately all copied from some original impression, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> passion or sensation, from which they derive.|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary sociolinguistic {{studies suggest}} that styles are learned, rather than {{assigned}} {{at the time of}} birth. With that said, identities emerge in a time series of social practice, through the combined effects of structure and agency. Because social identities are not static, the speech community model, which was traditionally employed as a sociolinguistic framework in the study of language and gender, is not as reliable as the community of practice model, the new framework emerged from practice theory. Also because social identities are not static, speech styles are actively subject to change, such that one's speech styles have different social meanings across time. Similarly, it is possible for an individual to engage in multiple identity practices simultaneously, and move from one identity to another unconsciously and automatically, and thus the term polyphonous identity. Podesva (2004) is a paper that studies recordings of a gay medical student, whom he called [...] "Heath", as he moved through different situations {{in the course of his}} everyday life. The fact that Heath's pronunciation of the voiceless alveolar stop, /t/, varies when he deals with different groups of people suggest not only some of gay people's speech features, but also the multiplicity of a person's social identity. Furthermore, Podesva also examined the relationship between the California Vowel Shift (CVS) and the gay identity, again by investigating intra-speaker patterns in a single individual, Regan, as opposed to inter-speaker variation, and found that Regan, who is a self-identified gay Asian American, realized CVS differently depending on the context, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "boys' night out," [...] "dinner with friend," [...] or [...] "meeting with supervisor". This cross-situational patterns are critical in the sense that an individual's speech styles can change not only across time, but also across space, depending on which social identity the individual is attempting to engage in under a given situation. Over-generalizations of social identity, however, overlook this intra-speaker variability.|$|E
