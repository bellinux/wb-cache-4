50|$|The {{aircraft}} was inspected by a maintenance crew {{on the evening}} before the flight. While the aircraft passed inspection, it was {{found out that the}} aircraft's antiskid system on the right hand landing gear was inoperative. This had previously been an issue--a problem with the system was detected on 27 September 2002 and it had been replaced. However, on 24 October 2002, the same antiskid system was inoperative again. Despite changing the outboard <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor,</b> the system remained inoperative. On 5 November 2002, one day before the accident, the problem was solved by replacing the inboard <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work exposes {{a largely}} {{unexplored}} vector of physical-layer at-tacks with demonstrated consequences in automobiles. By modifying the physi-cal environment around analog sensors such as Antilock Braking Systems (ABS), we exploit weaknesses in <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> {{so that a}} malicious attacker can inject arbitrary measurements to the ABS computer which in turn can cause life-threatening situations. In this paper, we describe {{the development of a}} prototype ABS spoofer to enable such attacks and the potential consequences of remaining vulnerable to these attacks. The class of sensors sensitive to these attacks de-pends on the physics of the sensors themselves. ABS relies on magnetic–based <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> which are exposed to an external attacker from underneath the body of a vehicle. By placing a thin electromagnetic actuator near the ABS <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensors,</b> we demonstrate one way in which an attacker can inject magnetic fields to both cancel the true measured signal and inject a malicious signal, thus spoofing the measured <b>wheel</b> <b>speeds.</b> The mounted attack is of a non-invasive nature, requiring no tampering with ABS hardware and making it harde...|$|R

50|$|In land vehicles, an IMU can be {{integrated}} into GPS based automotive navigation systems or vehicle tracking systems, giving the system a dead reckoning capability {{and the ability to}} gather as much accurate data as possible about the vehicle's current speed, turn rate, heading, inclination and acceleration, in combination with the vehicle's <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> output and, if available, reverse gear signal, for purposes such as better traffic collision analysis.|$|E
50|$|Examination of the <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> {{date from}} the {{locomotive}} {{at the head of}} train 8151 revealed that the train appeared to have been travelling at between 70 km/h and 75 km/h all the way from Milan Rogoredo, except for a brief slowdown near Pavia. The train's speed had not diminished even upon arrival at Voghera, except during the nine seconds immediately before the collision, when it had fallen sharply from 72 km/h to about 60 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The {{cruise control}} takes its speed signal from a {{rotating}} driveshaft, speedometer cable, <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> from the engine's RPM, or from internal speed pulses produced electronically by the vehicle. Most systems {{do not allow}} {{the use of the}} cruise control below a certain speed - typically around 25 mph. The vehicle will maintain the desired speed by pulling the throttle cable with a solenoid, a vacuum driven servomechanism, or by using the electronic systems built into the vehicle (fully electronic) if it uses a 'drive-by-wire' system.|$|E

This is implemented and evaluated in a natural driving environment against a reference systems and against two simple base line systems; one using only IMU and <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensors,</b> the other also adding basic GNSS.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a prototype energy harvesting autonomous sensor, called the Autonomous <b>Wheel</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Sensor</b> (AWSS), that is targeted for {{operation in the}} Electronic Braking System (EBS) of vehicles. In order to monitor the rotational state of a wheel, the EBS currently uses a passive <b>Wheel</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Sensor</b> (WSS) which is a variable reluctance electromagnetic transducer. In the existing EBS setup, one WSS is used per wheel, {{each of which is}} connected to the EBS system using extensive cabling. This project presents the first successful attempt at converting the WSS into an energy harvesting wireless <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> or in other words an Autonomous <b>Wheel</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Sensor</b> (AWSS), which provides information about the rotational state of the wheel to the EBS system over a wireless link. Unlike most wireless sensors which use batteries, the AWSS employs energy harvesting to power itself by simultaneously using the WSS electromagnetic transducer as an energy harvester as well as a sensor. By thus making an autonomous WSS, the amount of cables in the existing WSS assembly can be reduced, leading to savings in material, assembly and maintenance costs. The self-powered prototype AWSS successfully implements periodic wireless transmission of the wheel speed along with near real-time wheel lock detection, at a duty cycle of less than Th...|$|E

The driver can modify the parameters of the controller pushing few buttons even driving the motorcycle. The microcontroller stores information on a 1 [*]Mbyte flash memory with the purpose of monitoring the performances of the control system. A display is placed in the motorcycle to allow the driver to verify in real time the status of the controller. An RS 232 interface is used to communicate with an external PC when the motorcycle is parking.|$|E

40|$|The In-Wheel {{technology}} {{is emerging as}} the dominant drive system for electric vehicles. The existence of an electric motor at each wheel provides opportunities for development of efficient intelligent brakes for In-Wheel cars. This paper considers the practical realization of a sensorless ABS for In-Wheel Electric Vehicles. In the proposed braking system, the wheel speed is estimated from the back EMF of the In-Wheel motor, which makes the conventional <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> redundant. The paper also introduces an effective denoising method using the wavelet packet technique, to increase {{the accuracy of the}} wheel speed measurement by the back EMF signal of the In-Wheel motor. The proposed strategy has also been implanted on a conventional ABS braking test rig. The experimental results showed that the proposed system can adequately replace the conventional ABS <b>wheel</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor...</b>|$|E

Furthermore, the signals of both ECUs are collected at the ACC ECU via CAN (Control Area Network). The transmissions between the Millimeter Wave Radar and the ACC ECU are carried out via CAN. In addition, when brake control is performed, ACC controls the relay between the brake pedal switch and the brake lamp in order {{to turn on the}} brake lamps.|$|E

50|$|In a {{brake-by-wire}} car, some sensors are safety-critical components, {{and their}} failure will disrupt the vehicle function and endanger human lives.
