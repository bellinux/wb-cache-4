500|$|... "Danke Schoen" [...] {{is one of}} the {{recurring}} motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the [...] "most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream,</b> claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E
500|$|Papps {{revealed}} {{to a reporter}} from TV Life {{that he would never}} marry as young as Frank did. While he told Eithne Power of TVTimes that he thought Frank and Bobby rushed into marriage without any [...] "proper understanding of each other". Frank thinks that marriage is a partnership where he will be [...] "strong, the big provider and the breadwinner". Papps said that it was a [...] "chauvinist view" [...] but due to his childhood he wants the option of security. Papps said that Bobby wants the same because of her bad childhood, but they both [...] "approach marriage from different angles. Dickson agreed and admitted that there were times she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> at Bobby and tell her to [...] "get her act together" [...] where their marriage is concerned. Frank later decides to comfort Roo when Brett blackmails her to get access to Martha. Bobby becomes jealous and paranoid. Dickson said that [...] "Bobby has caught Frank on the rebound, and she knows it. Frank is the closest thing poor Bobby has ever had". Tom thinks that their marriage was a mistake, Dickson said that [...] "deep down" [...] Bobby knows that is too young, but she is a character [...] "who can't be told".|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> out loud, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E

5000|$|Architect Pierluigi Serraino {{described}} Hillmer's architecture as [...] "assertive, but it's always benevolent. It's {{always very}} delicate {{in the way}} it fits onto the site. It's not architecture that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream,</b> but it has its own monumentality." ...|$|R
50|$|During 1992, Santa Cruz {{took off}} some time from acting on screen, but he {{returned}} in 1993, {{acting in a}} film named Yo Quiero Gritar Que te Amo ("I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Scream</b> That I Love You"), where he acted alongside Andrea Del Boca.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be so nervous!" [...] Una <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> at him, and {{she wanted}} to add, [...] "You didn't ask my permission!" [...] when he absently fumbled in a cigarette-box.|$|E
60|$|Dull! She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> out her joy. She {{felt like}} racing {{to the big}} black team to throw her arms about their necks. Dull! There was no other spot {{in all the world}} so exalting as this small town and its over-peering peaks.|$|E
60|$|Ursula {{tried to}} get her {{attention}} back to the class. The boy gave her a little horror, and she was at the same time hot with pity for him. She felt she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream.</b> She was responsible for the boy's punishment. Mr. Harby was looking at her handwriting on the board. He turned to the class.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{easy to be}} {{good when}} one is sick," [...] said Jill, thoughtfully. [...] "I fret dreadfully, I get so tired of being still. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> sometimes, but I don't, because it would scare Mammy, so I cry. Do you cry, Jack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pat {{would knock}} or ring, and papa would speak, {{so that we}} might not be scared. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream,</b> but I won't till I see {{that it really is}} some one," [...] thought Gwen, while her heart beat fast and her eyes were fixed on the door, {{straining}} to see through the gloom.|$|R
5000|$|Rumors {{were spread}} that Shadows {{had lost his}} ability <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> due <b>to</b> throat surgery needed after Warped Tour 2003. However, {{producer}} Andrew Murdock put down these rumors by saying: [...] "When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet… Matt handed me the CD, {{and he said to}} me, 'This record's screaming. The record we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make is going to be half-screaming and half-singing. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> anymore… the record after {{that is going to be}} all singing.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{advise you}} to call out," [...] said Mr. Harby. He would have a {{pleasant}} voice, full and musical, but for the detestable menace that always tailed in it. He stood unmoved, his eyes twinkling under his bushy black eyebrows, watching the class. There was something fascinating in him, as he stood, and again she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream.</b> She was all jarred, {{she did not know}} what she felt.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was not at}} all a young woman, {{and many}} things had come and gone in her life that ought to have {{fortified}} her against surprise; but she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> like a little frightened girl as Dan Mavering stepped out of the parlour door toward her. The habit of not screaming, however, prevailed, and she made a tolerably successful effort to treat him with decent composure. She gave him a rigid hand. [...] "Where in the world did you come from? Did you get my telegram?" ...|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{had risen}} like an {{automaton}} from her chair. She {{felt that she}} could no longer sit still, she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> out {{at the top of her}} voice, all the horror she felt for this dastardly plot, which surely must have had its origin in the brain of devils. She could not understand Percy. This was one of those awful moments, which she had been destined to experience once or twice before, when the whole personality of her husband seemed to become shadowy before her, to slip, as it were, past her comprehension, leaving her indescribably lonely and wretched, trusting yet terrified.|$|E
40|$|Frankly, {{this debate}} {{just makes me}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream.</b> The clock is moving. They are {{slashing}} and burning and cutting the forests of the world. It may be a quarter of global warming {{and we can get}} the rate to two per cent simply by inventing a preservation credit and making that forest have value in other ways. Who loses when we do that?...|$|R
5000|$|G.H. is {{appalled by}} the sight, but she is trapped in the room by the irresistible fascination of the dying insect. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream,</b> but she knows it is already too late: [...] "If I raised the alarm at being alive, voiceless and hard they would drag me away since they drag away those who depart the {{possible}} world, the exceptional being is dragged away, the screaming being.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! An you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream,</b> I pray you {{question}} me not, for what I say {{is bound to}} startle you. Sue is my wife. I married her, having obtained a special license {{to do so in}} the name of Prince Amédé Henri d'Orléans, and all the rest of the romantic paraphernalia. She is my wife, and therefore, her money and fortune are mine, every penny of it, without question or demur." ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{eyes now}} {{centered}} on Dorn and Glidden. Lenore, seeing clearly {{for the first}} time, suffered a strange, hot paroxysm of emotion never before experienced by her. It left her weak. It seemed to stultify the cry that {{had been trying to}} escape her. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> that Dorn must not kill the man. Yet there was a ferocity in her that froze the cry. Glidden's coat and blouse were half torn off; blood covered him; he strained and flung himself weakly in that iron clutch. He was beaten and bent back. His tongue hung out, bloody, fluttering with strangled cries. A ghastly face, appalling in its fear of death! ...|$|E
60|$|Sammy Jay was {{bubbling}} {{over with}} excitement as he flew about through the Green Forest, following Lightfoot the Deer. He {{was so excited}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream.</b> But he didn't. He kept his tongue still. You see, he didn't want Lightfoot {{to know that he}} was being followed. Under that pointed cap of Sammy Jay's are quick wits. It didn't take him long to discover that the big stranger whom Lightfoot was seeking was doing his best to keep out of Lightfoot's way and that he was having no difficulty in doing so because of the reckless way in which Lightfoot was searching for him. Lightfoot made so much noise that it was quite easy to know just where he was and so keep out of his sight.|$|E
60|$|But now Marcella's {{courage and}} hopefulness {{had gone out}} like a spent candle. She was late at the store, and that meant a fine; her head ached, and her feet felt like lead as she {{climbed the stairs to}} her department--a hot, dark, stuffy corner behind the shirtwaist counter. It was warm and close at any time, but today it was stifling, and there was already a crowd of customers, for it was the day of a bargain sale. The heat and noise and chatter got on Marcella's {{tortured}} nerves. She felt that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream,</b> but instead she turned calmly to a waiting customer--a big, handsome, richly dressed woman. Marcella noted with an ever-increasing bitterness that the woman wore a lace collar the price of which would have kept Patty in the country for a year.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Algie!' said Lady Wetherby, tensely. 'I don't {{know what}} you've come here for, and I don't {{remember}} {{asking you to}} sit down and put your elbows on that table, but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> begin by saying that I will not be called Pauline. My name's Polly. You've got a way of saying Pauline, {{as if it were a}} gentlemanly cuss-word, that makes me <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream.</b> And while you're about it, why don't you say how-d'you-do to Claire? You ought to remember her, she was my bridesmaid.' ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{receiving}} the Album of the Year award {{at the first}} Alternative Press Music Awards in 2014, Sykes revealed a history of addiction and abuse of the drug Ketamine. Addressing the crowd, he said [...] "My band <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> kill me, my parents <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> kill me, my fucking brother <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> kill me," [...] and also admitted, [...] "I went to rehab for a month, and you guys were sending me texts and e-mails. When I got out of that rehab, I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> anymore, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sing from the fucking rooftops." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{exploring}} the house, she discovers [...] "The Swan Room" [...] {{that belonged to}} Malcolm’s mother, which has been kept as a shrine to her and contains a very large, ornate bed carved {{into the shape of}} a swan. When Malcolm discovers her in the room, they finally consummate their marriage, an act that could be considered more of an attack than an act of love, with Malcolm saying his mother's name the entire time. Olivia <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> but doesn't, trying to hide her humiliation from the servants.|$|R
60|$|The wild {{note of the}} hound manifestly stirred Bo to irrepressible action. Snatching up Dale's lighter rifle, {{she shoved}} it into her saddle-sheath, and, leaping on the mustang, she ran him over brush and brook, {{straight}} down the park toward the place Pedro was climbing. For an instant Helen stood amazed beyond speech. When Bo sailed over a big log, like a steeple-chaser, then Helen answered to further unconsidered impulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened. Without coat or hat she mounted. The nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the saddle. A strange, trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> for Bo to wait. Bo was out of sight, but the deep, muddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded Helen an easy trail to follow. In fact, her horse needed no guiding. He ran {{in and out of}} the straggling spruces along the edge of the park, and suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang standing still. Bo was looking up and listening.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} they {{got the idea that}} what the public wanted was not {{anything}} instructive but something light and amusing. Mullins said that people loved to laugh. He said that if {{you get a lot of}} people all together and get them laughing you can do anything you like with them. Once they start to laugh they are lost. So they got Mr. Dreery, the English Literature teacher at the high school, to give an evening of readings from the Great Humorists from Chaucer to Adam Smith. They came mighty near to making a barrel of money out of that. If the people had once started laughing it would have been all over with them. As it was I heard a lot of them say that they simply <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> with laughter: they said they just felt like bursting into peals of laughter all the time. Even when, in the more subtle parts, they didn't feel like bursting out laughing, they said they had all they could do to keep from smiling. They said they never had such a hard struggle in their lives not to smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm running on. I want to know, Stephen, why you've {{got nothing}} to say about all this. It must have been staring you in the face ever since I spent my very {{considerable}} superfluous energies in wrecking your career. Because you know I wrecked it, Stephen. I knew I was wrecking it and I wrecked it. I knew exactly what I was doing all the time. I had meant to be so fine a thing for you, a mothering friend, to have that dear consecutive kindly mind of yours steadying mine, to have seen you grow to power over men, me helping, me admiring. It was to have been so fine. So fine! Didn't I urge you to marry Rachel, make you talk of her. Don't you remember that? And one day when I saw you thinking of Rachel, saw a kind of pride in your eyes!--suddenly I couldn't stand it. I went to my room after you had gone and thought of you and her until I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream.</b> I couldn't bear it. It was intolerable. I was violent to my toilet things. I broke a hand-glass. Your dignified, selfish, self-controlled Mary smashed a silver hand-mirror. I never told you that. You know what followed. I pounced on you and took you. Wasn't I--a soft and scented hawk? Was either of us better than some creature of instinct that does what it does because it must? It was like a gust of madness--and I cared, I found, no more for your career than I cared for any other little thing, for honor, for Rachel, for Justin, that stood between us....|$|E
50|$|Having {{passed the}} British censors in September 1974, the film wasnt {{released}} until 9 May 1975, {{when it opened}} in London at the small cinema Studio Two in Oxford Street. The Times film critic David Robinson didnt like it (All Creatures Great and Small is so wholesome and warmhearted it makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream.</b> not on account of these qualities in themselves, but because of the directors (Claude Whatham) inability to give them any more depth or meaning than a television series), but acknowledged that Anthony Hopkins and Simon Wards playing made their characters somewhat believable.|$|R
5000|$|The Archaic Course is Borknagar's third studio {{album and}} their first to feature ICS Vortex (Simen Hestnæs) on vocals {{replacing}} Garm (who, according to Øystein Brun, [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> anymore"), {{along with the}} addition of guitarist Jens F. Ryland. The album also features guest contributions from Enslaved guitarist Ivar Bjørnson, although he was not listed as part of the band in the credits. This is also the last album to feature the original drummer and {{one of the founders of}} the band, Erik [...] "Grim" [...] Brødreskift, before he died from a drug overdose.|$|R

As founder of Deep Waters Dance Theater, she creates choreographic work rooted in ritual and exploring issues facing people of color and the environment. Her 2011 work Our Daily Bread - which explored what and how we eat - included live cooking and eating and was described as [...] "a theatrically cogent, emotionally rich piece of dance theater that made us laugh at ourselves and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> at the end." ...|$|R
5000|$|Clarissa at TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a very {{positive}} review, particularly regarding Jennifer Love Hewitt's acting: [...] "Her pain and fear is palpable through every moment of this scene. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> and cry in the scene where she begs her rapist to forgive her for getting the police involved because she’s afraid for her life. In other words, Jennifer Love Hewitt knocked this {{one out of the}} park." [...] She adds, [...] "It’s episodes like this that remind me why I’ve watched SVU for a number of years." ...|$|E
5000|$|The film premiered on June 5, 2009, {{receiving}} a limited release in Lancaster, California, Austin, Texas, North Aurora, Illinois, and Rochester, New York. Among the audience members who attended these screenings, a viewer in Rochester called the film [...] "amazingly bad", while a viewer in Austin {{stated that it}} was [...] "a total mindfuck. It can really {{only be described as}} a lesson in self control because at first, I wanted to leave, then I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> at the movie, then it became funny, and then it reached that level where it crawls under your skin and agitates you with the questions that rise from having been witness to it".|$|E

5000|$|Milk Chocolate Girl {{was written}} by Hadise herself along with Yves Jongen. The song came about when Hadise was working on her debut album Sweat. She daily enjoyed a piece of {{chocolate}} to regain her strength, when one day she turned round to her producer and said [...] "Chocolate is so delicious. I really couldn’t do without it", her producer then replied [...] "What’s this infatuation women have with chocolate?"

5000|$|Blurt Magazine {{had this}} to say: [...] "Watching Dolce’s slip into the abyss is {{somewhat}} like watching a car stranded on the tracks as a train barrels towards it. You really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> help, <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> “Get out of the way!” but deep inside we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see what happens next. Broken Side of Time {{is a look at}} a journey and a destination, a glimpse at what happens when you give all yourself to something and are used, tossed aside in return. Dolce is a train wreck personified and I could not stop watching." ...|$|R
2500|$|On March 29, 2015, on the {{red carpet}} of the 2nd iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles, Azalea {{confirmed}} [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] would be featured on Spears's upcoming album during an interview with MTV News and explained the song's evolution mentioning its final version being a true duet with her also joining Spears on the chorus instead of a typical rap guest appearance. When describing the song in an interview with USA Today, Azalea said, [...] "It's just a lot of fun. It's a classic, girly (song) you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>scream</b> <b>to</b> each other when you're getting ready". Although the collaboration was finished in the fall of 2014, Azalea didn't meet Spears in person until January 2015, when she invited Spears to her house for lunch.|$|R
