5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, 11 German dreadnoughts, {{including}} Rheinland, {{engaged and}} opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire, which was soon checked. Some ten minutes later Rheinland again opened fire on the British cruisers, targeting <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely , though without success. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed, with Rheinland third from the front, behind Westfalen and Nassau. At 21:22, crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen, the two leading ships in the German line, spotted two torpedo tracks {{that turned out to be}} imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness. After flashing a challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them.|$|E

25|$|Cuba {{developed}} slowly and, {{unlike the}} plantation {{islands of the}} Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture.

Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission said about the edition: “Sure it's important, but when they asked Jesus <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> important, he said, 'Love your God, and love your neighbor as yourself.'

25|$|The site {{contains}} many fine stone buildings {{in various states}} of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob.). Archaeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions from the city. Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> easily available in the area. The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|Despite those controversies and the {{apparent}} {{lessons learned from}} the Vietnam War, some theorists recognized a significant problem with Huntington's theory insofar as it appears to question the notion of a separate, apolitical professional military. While there is little argument that separate civilian and military worlds exist, there is significant debate about the proper interaction between the two. As discussed above, Huntington proposed that the ideal arrangement was one whereby civilian political leaders provided objective control to the military leadership and then stepped back to permit the experts in violence to do <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> effective. He further stated that the most dangerous arrangement was one whereby civilian leaders intruded extensively in the military world, creating a situation whereby the military leadership was not politically neutral and security of the nation was thus threatened both by an ineffective military and by provoking the military to avoid taking orders.|$|E
25|$|Four {{accounts}} of Berti's experiment exist, but a simple model of his experiment consisted of filling with water a long tube that had both ends plugged, then standing the tube in a basin already full of water. The bottom {{end of the}} tube was opened, and water that had been inside of it poured out into the basin. However, {{only part of the}} water in the tube flowed out, and the level of the water inside the tube stayed at an exact level, which happened to be 10.3m, the same height Baliani and Galileo had observed that was limited by the siphon. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. This seemed to suggest the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water.|$|E

Not long after starting practices in Moscow, Team Canada players Vic Hadfield, Rick Martin and Jocelyn Guevremont left the team and went home for what they felt {{was a lack of}} playing time. Team Canada used its practice-time in the Dvoretz Sporta to learn the differences of the Soviet rinks. While there had been concern about the wider ice surface, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> strange to the Canadian players was the fish-netting draped at the ends of the rink above the boards instead of glass.

500|$|In the 1980s, Gowing {{served as}} a trustee of the Science Museum, London, and the Imperial War Museum but, remembering her own childhood, she [...] {{resigned}} from the latter in protest at the introduction of entry fees. She was also a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1978 to 1992. She began suffering from <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely Alzheimer's disease, and retired from Oxford in 1986, {{two years before the}} official retirement age. Although she had worked in the Civil Service and Academia for 45 years, only 27 of them counted, so she was not eligible for a full pension; her son Nik supported her.

500|$|King Philip {{probably}} shadowed Richard's army, as {{the latter}} moved through the Loire Valley, in an attempt at constraining the Engish army's ability to manouevre. [...] However, Richard doubled-back on the French, in which pursuit [...] the English king's horse was killed. It remains uncertain whether, {{despite the fact that}} contemporaries described the encounter as a battle, the two forces ever made contact. It is possibe that the rear portion of the French force engaged with that of the English. However, as part of a war in which skirmishing was the usual form of encounter, Fréteval was no different, and, it has been said, it 'does not deserve the label of a battle.' In <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely an ambush by the English, Philip appears to have abandoned his baggage train in a wood as Richard approached, and escaped to a Saint-Hilaire chapel on Whitsun Eve. Philip's 'sudden departure', wrote historian John Gillingham, was 'the last straw for his troops, already demoralized by the threat to their supplies.' Richard proceeded to harry the retreating French soldiers, before entering Verneuil in triumph. The engagement at Fréteval has been described as 'a minor disaster' for the Philip, although probably more in political terms than military.|$|E

500|$|Archie's {{murder was}} {{compared}} to that of Den Watts in EastEnders in 2005 by Polly Hudson of the Daily Mirror, while Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian called it a rip-off of Citizen Kane. Andrew Grimes from Manchester Evening News said the Christmas Day episode was [...] "in every sense compelling, and to my utter astonishment, a complete and utter joy", and John Gibson of Edinburgh Evening News gave the murder discovery episode on 26 December 2009 a negative review, saying [...] "Hard to tell <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> horrific... the murder, which was bloody, the acting, which was dire, or the script, which was torture." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times called the revelation of Stacey as Archie's killer a [...] "genuine surprise", while Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable". The storyline was nominated in the Killer Secret category at the 2010 All About Soap Bubble Awards. It also received a nomination in the Best Storyline category at the 2010 British Soap Awards and the Best Soap Storyline category at the 2010 TVChoice Awards. Real life police detectives criticised the portrayal of detectives in the show, saying that viewers who see them talking to residents about the case and accepting bribes may believe they operate that way in reality. The BBC insisted that a police consultant was used, adding that [...] "this is heightened fiction {{and all the things that}} we show might not always represent real life." [...] The storyline was referenced by Prime Minister Gordon Brown when referring to allegations of bullying, saying [...] "The only thing I haven't been accused of is murdering that guy Archie Mitchell in EastEnders." ...|$|E
