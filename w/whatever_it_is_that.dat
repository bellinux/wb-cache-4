500|$|In {{his book}} The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins {{states that he}} agrees with Robert Hinde's Why Good is Good, Michael Shermer's The Science of Good and Evil, Robert Buckman's Can We Be Good Without God? and Marc Hauser's Moral Minds, that our {{sense of right and}} wrong can be derived from our Darwinian past. Christopher Hitchens in God is Not Great has argued that [...] "Modern vernacular {{describes}} conscience—not too badly—as <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> makes us behave well when nobody is looking... Those who believe that the existence of conscience is a proof of a godly design are advancing an argument that simply cannot be disproved because there is no evidence for or against it." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is {{the only}} element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's {{popularity}} {{can be attributed to}} his being a [...] "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he [...] "lives for himself and the freedom to do <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade." [...] In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of Entertainment Weekly 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{observes the}} Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) from a [...] "fly on the wall" [...] perspective, without narration, scene titles, or {{interviews}} with the main subjects. The first portion of the film shows the band rehearsing on a sound stage at Twickenham Film Studios. The songs are works in progress, with discussions among the band members about ways to improve them. At one point, McCartney and Harrison have an uncomfortable exchange, with McCartney criticising a guitar riff played by Harrison on [...] "Two of Us". Harrison responds: [...] "I'll play whatever {{you want me to}} play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> will please you, I'll do it." [...] Also appearing are Mal Evans, providing the hammer blows on [...] "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", and Yoko Ono, dancing with Lennon.|$|E

6000|$|... "Before his accident, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{made him}} lose his memory, {{he was an}} unusual man, a man of {{exceptional}} ability. You know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|I.--If I {{were in your}} place, I {{would not}} take it for granted; I [...] would try.... <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> a man applies himself to, nature [...] meant him for it.|$|R

6000|$|CAPT. G. I'm {{afraid you}} wouldn't, Pussy--Don't {{you think that}} jam will burn, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> jam does when it's not looked after by a clever little housekeeper? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be careful," [...] Bella warned him. [...] "It's {{safer to}} avoid these details. Besides, you're leaving {{something}} out; I don't mean the nerve-cells, but the inner personality, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> commands them." ...|$|E
60|$|Ramiro {{looked at}} him, {{and by his}} glance <b>it</b> <b>was</b> plain {{to see that the}} words had jarred his temper. <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Vitelli wrote to Ramiro, this gentleman was not minded to divulge it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> {{could only}} <b>be</b> so extraordinary, her meaning, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> the need in him <b>that</b> would--whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> again!--meet <b>it</b> most {{absolutely}} formed the syllables {{on his lips}} as: [...] "Will you be very, very kind to me?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{attitude}} so far {{won their}} confidence that before we parted at our last meeting, after most solemn vows {{of faith and}} secrecy, they took me into the secret. This was, however, {{only to the extent}} of teaching me the code and method; they still withheld from me rigidly the fact or political secret, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the mainspring of their united action.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Whatever it is," [...] I said, [...] "he {{has taken}} hold of it. Now {{we must find}} out <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he has taken hold of, for that will be his fortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{round and}} soft he is!" [...] thought Kate. [...] "How I {{should like to}} pat him. I wonder when he'll find <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he's looking for! What a cunning little tail!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another thing," [...] went on Kirk. [...] "If {{this man}} Milbank--I still can't place him--is such a thug, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{he happens to}} be, how did he come to be at your house the night you say I met him?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "the act {{of writing}} Company K, in effect reliving his very painful memories, was itself an act of {{tremendous}} courage, {{equal to or greater}} than <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross and French Croix de Guerre".|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as you say, Clem," [...] {{her father}} assented. [...] "Why not Brother Osson, he'a?" [...] he {{suggested}} with a {{pleasure in the}} joke, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> the minister's relation to Clementina involved. [...] "I guess he can put off his visit to Boston long enough." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped in}} his stride. The girl {{glanced up at}} him {{in a kind of}} dull, {{questioning}} way. Their eyes {{met for the first time}} that afternoon, and it seemed to Constable Plimmer <b>that</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> interfering with the inside of his throat had grown larger, and more unmanageable.|$|R
60|$|Volumnia {{wishes of}} all things {{to know what is}} doing? Whether they are going to convict, or <b>{{whatever}}</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> dreadful soldier? Whether he had any accomplices, or whatever the thing is called in the law? And a great deal more to the like artless purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush it up?" [...] {{retorted}} my aunt. [...] "If you'd {{heard the}} row, you wouldn't {{sit there and}} talk like a fool. And if you'll take my advice," [...] added my aunt, [...] "you'll set {{to work on this}} 'training,' or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> has got to be done to the dog, before any human life is lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Svensk!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Swenson, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{natives of}} Sweden exclaim {{in moments of}} justifiable annoyance. He resented the advent of this newcomer. He had been getting along fine and had had the {{situation}} well in hand. To him Sam Marlowe represented Competition, and Mr. Swenson desired no competitors in his treasure-seeking enterprise. He travels, thought Mr. Swenson, the fastest who travels alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{he found}} {{on the other side}} of the path it grew under the ground, and he stuck his head down as far as he could get it, and bent up his back, as if he were about to try to turn a somersault, or to stand on his head.|$|R
60|$|There came a gap. He {{remained}} downcast, {{trying to}} find a way towards <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> in his mind to say. Conceivably, he did not clearly know what <b>that</b> might <b>be</b> until he came to it. The Sea Lady abandoned an attempt to understand him in favour of a more urgent topic.|$|R
6000|$|First comes Easter, pagan {{goddess of}} spring. Here his fancy may have free play. A {{beautiful}} maiden with decorative {{hair and the}} proper number of toes will fill the bill. Miss Clarice St. Vavasour, the well-known model, will pose {{for it in the}} [...] "Lethergogallagher," [...] or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Trilby called <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Baas, your reverend father, the Predikant, is now {{wise enough}} to know all about Spirits {{and that there are}} some who come into black witch-doctors though they turn up their noses at white men and leave them alone. However, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> makes Goroko speak, got hold of him so that his lips said, though he remembered nothing of it afterwards, that soon this place would be red with blood--that there would be a great killing here, Baas. That is all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never hear}} me," [...] the oyster might say, [...] "howling round camps and villages, making night hideous, {{frightening}} quiet folk {{out of their}} lives. Why don't {{you go to bed}} early, as I do? I never prowl round the oyster-bed, fighting other gentlemen oysters, making love to lady oysters already married. I never kill antelopes or missionaries. Why can't you live as I do on salt water and germs, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I do live on? Why don't you try to be more like me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I assure you, yes. Positively. A gray gloom {{had settled}} upon us. We pictured you {{in all sorts}} of horrid situations. I was just going to call for volunteers to scour the country, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one does in such circumstances. I used to read about it in books, but I have {{forgotten}} the technical term. I am relieved to find that you are not even dusty, though it would have been more romantic if you could have managed a little dust here and there. But don't consider my feelings, Miss McEachern, please." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{encouraged}} him, Captain Anthony {{stuck to}} Flora de Barral {{in a manner}} which in a timid man might have been called heroic if <b>it</b> had not <b>been</b> so simple. Whether policy, diplomacy, simplicity, or just inspiration, he kept up his talk, rather deliberate, with very few pauses. Then suddenly as if recollecting himself: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{chief officer}} ordered {{a good many}} of the sails to be taken in, for they were only uselessly {{straining}} the masts, but there were enough left to move her in case the power of the current, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> stopped her, had slackened, and she steadily kept her position with the breeze abaft.|$|R
60|$|The {{fisherman}} {{reached down}} his hand, and there felt {{the back of}} something rough and hairy. He flung his leg over it, and whisk! whizz! off he shot through {{the air like a}} sky-rocket. Nothing was left for him to do but grip tightly with hands and feet and to hold fast. On they went, and on they went, until, after a great while, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> carrying him lit upon the ground, and there the fisherman found himself standing, for that which had brought him had gone.|$|R
60|$|Hume points out, {{that the}} nature of the {{phenomena}} we consider can {{have nothing to do with}} the origin of the conception that they are connected by the relation of cause and effect. For that relation is nothing but an order of succession, which, so far as our experience goes, is invariable; and it is obvious {{that the nature}} of phenomena has nothing to do with their order. <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> leads us to seek for a cause for every event, in the case of the phenomena of the external world, compels us, with equal cogency, to seek it in that of the mind.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was as if}} I {{could see}} through his dim face a sort of {{gratitude}} for my making all this out to him. [...] "I don't know that it's anything that she may do to me." [...] He could make {{it out in a}} manner for himself. [...] "It's as if something might happen to her. It's what I told you--that she may break down. If you ask me how, or in what," [...] he continued, [...] "how can I tell you? In <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she's trying to do. I don't understand it." [...] Then he wound up with a sigh that, in spite of its softness, he imperfectly stifled. [...] "But it's something or other!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have done}} {{me a great}} service,' she said. 'You have cut the painter for me when I have been trying for months to muster {{up the courage to}} cut it for myself. I don't suppose {{you know what it is}} to get into a groove and long to get out of it and not have the pluck. My brother has been writing to me for a long time to join him in Canada. And I hadn't the courage, or the energy, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> takes people out of grooves. I knew I was wasting my life, but I was fairly happy--at least, not unhappy; so--well, there it was. I suppose women are like that.' ...|$|E
60|$|And, with a {{characteristic}} shrug, he dismissed <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> worrying {{him from his}} mind. I could have told him {{from the beginning that}} this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley, but I restrained my tongue.

6000|$|Our heroine thought, recollected there <b>was</b> something, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> {{she knew}} after all {{much more of}} than Mrs. Jordan.

[...] "Oh there was nothing public." ...|$|R
50|$|In one of Charlemagne’s {{documents}} from 28 July 782, the king named Schornsheim’s church and estate as his property. The “estate” {{at that time}} meant {{the whole of the}} kingly holdings or a part thereof.
