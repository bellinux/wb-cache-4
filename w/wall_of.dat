5|$|Some medieval rabbis {{claimed that}} today's Western Wall is a {{surviving}} <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest {{they enter the}} Temple precincts {{in a state of}} impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness. Most secular scholars believe however that these traditions originally pertained to a western <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the Temple itself, and since the 1500s, were gradually applied to the surviving retaining Western <b>Wall</b> <b>of</b> the Mount.|$|E

5|$|An {{earthquake}} in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar {{and a number}} of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs (princes) of the Sultanate and the head of the army, Amir Salar, who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars. Seven years later a dedicated school, the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya, was built along the northwest <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the mosque. Portions of the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the mosque were removed to accommodate the new building. Construction of another school, the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya began in 1332–1333. This building, which was completed in 1339-1340, would also impact the structure of the mosque as it was built over the site of the mida'a, the fountain for ablution. Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al-Azhar, with separate entrances and prayer halls.|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} <b>of</b> {{the cell}} <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> strains of Histoplasma capsulatum that were reactive in the complement-fixation test and that reacted with fluorescein-tagged specific anti-H. capsulatum serum {{were compared with}} the cell <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> H. capsulatum and Histoplasma duboisii that did not react in these serological tests. The cell <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the serologically reactive strains of H. capsulatum were much more susceptible to the action of proteinases and to chitinase than were the serologically nonreactive strains, but were less susceptible to hydrolysis by 3 % NaOH or 2 n H 2 SO 4. The <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the serologically reactive strains had higher chitin, amino acid, and hexosamine contents, but they were lower in a “lactic acid” component that was released by alkaline hydrolysis of the nonreactive strains. The cell <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> strains of H. duboisii were similar to the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the serologically nonreactive strains of H. capsulatum. Chemical analyses <b>of</b> the cell <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the various strains clearly support the serological typing of H. capsulatum and H. duboisii strains reported by Kaufman and Blumer...|$|R

5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
