25|$|The {{situation}} {{continued to}} escalate as a superior {{court ruled that}} neither Alonzo or Robertson should be seated until situation was resolved. They then forwarded {{the case to the}} Indiana Supreme Court who ruled in favor of Robertson. On the morning of February 24, Robertson entered the Senate chamber to take his seat, but as soon as he <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> he was attacked by several Democratic Senators who rushed him and beat him to the floor. The Senate leader ordered him removed from the chamber by guards, who then locked him out. The Republicans immediately went wild, attacking their nearest Democrat. The fight continued for several minutes until one Democrat pulled a gun and fired it into the ceiling threatening to start killing Republicans, ending the fight but making the rest of the building aware of it. The brawl soon spread to the House of Representatives and throughout the building as Republicans began to attack Democrats. Unlike the Senate, the rest of the building had a strong Republican majority, and the Democrats were soon overwhelmed. Six-hundred Republicans then beat down the door of the Senate Chamber and dragged out the Democratic Senators, threatening to kill them. Gray ordered police and other officials to break up the fight, which ended after nearly a full four hours of fighting.|$|E

2500|$|The actress Lucy Speed – {{seventeen}} at {{the time}} – was chosen to play the part. Speed claims that she was cast due to her “cranky” attitude during her audition. She comments “I showed up there with an attitude, not giving ‘a stuff’ whether I got the damn part and they responded to that. They liked it, liked my feistiness, {{they thought it was}} the quality they were looking for…Natalie was a pretty gloomy kid, not a sunny show-biz kid which is all they'd been seeing until I <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> So I got the part.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Wright's unit called {{themselves}} the [...] "Brat pack". The nickname [...] "King Rat" [...] was first given to Wright by the Mid-Ulster UDA commander Robert John Kerr {{as a form}} of pub bantering. According to journalist and author Paul Larkin, Kerr sat inside a pub and jokingly bestowed a nickname on each patron as they entered. When Wright <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Kerr gave him the soubriquet of [...] "King Rat". Sunday World journalist Martin O'Hagan picked up on it and satirically named them the [...] "rat pack"; he also used the name [...] "King Rat" [...] to identify Wright. Much to Wright's annoyance, the name became popular with the media. In response, Wright had the newspaper's offices bombed and issued a death threat to O'Hagan and anyone who worked for the paper.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just because I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and I knew it would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he a member?" [...] said {{someone in}} the background, and {{somebody}} else suggested calling a policeman. I perceived that only a prompt retreat would save {{the whole story of}} our quarrel from the newspapers. So far as I could see nobody knew me there except Philip. I had to take the risks of his behavior; manifestly I couldn't control it. I made no further attempt to explain anything to anybody. Everyone was a little too perplexed for prompt action, and so the advantage in that matter lay with me. I <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and with what I imagined to be an appearance of the utmost serenity down the steps. I noted an ascending member glance at me with an expression of exceptional interest, but it was only after I had traversed the length of Pall Mall that I realized that my lip and the corner of my nostril were both bleeding profusely. I called a cab when I discovered my handkerchief scarlet, and retreated to my flat and cold ablutions. Then I sat down to write a letter to Tarvrille, with a clamorous [...] "Urgent, Please forward if away" [...] above the address, and tell him at least to suppress Philip. But within the club that blockhead, thinking of nothing but the appearances of our fight and his own credit, was varying his assertion that he had thrashed me, with denunciations of me as a [...] "blackguard," [...] and giving half a dozen men a highly colored, improvised, and altogether improbable account of my relentless pursuit and persecution of Lady Mary Justin, and how she had left London to avoid me. They listened, no doubt, with extreme avidity. The matrimonial relations of the Justins had long been a matter for speculative minds.|$|E
