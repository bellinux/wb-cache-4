30|$|Lumber drying {{is one of}} {{the most}} time- and energy-consuming {{processes}} in producing lumber products. As the main purpose <b>of</b> <b>lumber</b> drying is to reduce moisture content (MC) to a specific target value, the final MC that is measured at the end of drying is a primary consideration. In general, a large number <b>of</b> <b>lumber</b> are dried simultaneously in a batch kiln, and in such a condition, considerable variability in the final MC occurs [1]. Consequently, after kiln-drying, a batch may contain an unacceptable number <b>of</b> <b>lumber</b> pieces that do not meet the requirement of the appropriate moisture specification [2]. This outcome can lead to increased costs and the lower rates <b>of</b> <b>lumber</b> recovery.|$|R

30|$|Cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels {{consist of}} several layers <b>of</b> <b>lumber</b> stacked {{crosswise}} and glued together on their faces.

On the basis of above tests, bending stiffness and moment carrying capacity were predicted by Monte Carlo method. MOE <b>of</b> <b>lumber</b> was measured by using grading machine and tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>lumber</b> {{was assumed to be}} 60  % of bending strength based on the obtained bending test. Bending stiffness EI of CLT panels could be estimated by adopting composite theory and equivalent section area. Experimental moment carrying capacity showed 12  % higher value than the calculated moment carrying capacity by average lumber failure method, and also showed 45  % higher value than the calculated moment carrying capacity by minimum lumber failure method due to the reinforcement of the outer layer by the neighboring cross layer.|$|R
