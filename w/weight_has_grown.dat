40|$|Tourism {{is one of}} the Portuguese economy’s key sectors, and its {{relative}} <b>weight</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> over recent years. The Algarve region is particularly focused on attracting foreign tourists and has built over the years a large offer of diversified hotel units. In this paper we present multivariate time series approach to forecast the number of overnight stays in hotel units (hotels, guesthouses or hostels, and tourist apartments) in Algarve. We adjust a seasonal vector autoregressive and moving averages model (SVARMA) to monthly data between 2006 and 2016. The forecast values were compared with the actual values of the overnight stays in Algarve in 2016 and led to a MAPE of 15. 1 % and RMSE= 53847. 28. The MAPE for the Hotel series was merely 4. 56 %. These forecast values can be used by a hotel manager to predict their occupancy and to determine the best pricing policy. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{transit vehicle}} <b>weight</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> {{significantly}} {{over the last}} 20 years penalizing the road infrastructure, fuel consumption and environmental signature. Increased use of lightweight, high-strength and new sustainable composites for mass transit vehicle components is a promising avenue to explore since weight reduction {{is one of the}} few ways Canadian mass transit vehicle manufacturers can influence fuel consumption and hence help reduce greenhouse gases emissions. Weight saving opportunities could possibly be obtained by the use of natural fiber and hybrid composites as compared to 2 ̆ 01 ctraditional 2 ̆ 01 d glass fiber based composites. The use of nanocomposites to improve the property of resins without any significant increase in density could also be a possible avenue to obtain the high performance composite with weight saving. In this paper, the role of nanoparticles on the performance improvement of natural fibers thermoset composites was investigated. Different nanoparticles such as Cloisite Na+, 10 A, 20 A and 30 B, Perkalite G 100, Nanocryl C 140 were first dispersed in a thermoset resin before performing the impregnation of the natural fiber fabric. Natural fiber composites were prepared by hand lay-up followed by a vacuum step and by infusion. The quality of dispersion and intercalation/exfoliation was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mechanical performance and fire resistance of nanoreinforced thermoset resin and natural fiber composites were also evaluated. The results obtained demonstrate that the presence of nanoparticles can improve the the tensile strength, tensile modulus and fire resistance performance of the resin and of the natural fiber composites. The levels of improvement of the properties were seen to vary with the type of nanoparticles used. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

50|$|The main {{train in}} both {{directions}} in the mid-1950s was hauled by a Britannia 4-6-2 and Stratford adopted a policy of allocating 70000 Britannia whenever possible. The locomotive was allocated to and maintained by Stratford but was driven by a Parkeston crew.

50|$|The {{only major}} {{problem with the}} LRC to come up during {{development}} was a continued weight increase of the locomotives. The prototype locomotive weighted 236000 lb, about 14000 lb less than a conventional low-speed loco. However, while development turned into production the weight grew to 245000 lb, eliminating any difference. By 1980, the National Research Council published a report noting that the <b>weight</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> so much that service above 100 mph would cause unacceptable wear on the Corridor, thereby limiting the new LRC to the same speeds of the Turbo {{it was meant to}} replace. Alcan and TDC were also highly critical of Bombardier's management of the MLW portion of the program, suggesting that their mid-level management lacked the know-how to conclude the project rapidly.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{contractors}} claimed {{their designs}} were below the 70-84 tons expectation {{of what the}} GCV will weigh. BAE's vehicle weighed 60-70 tons, based on modular armor package, and a 20 percent margin for weight increase the Army had planned for future upgrades would bring it up to 84 tons. General Dynamic's vehicle with a diesel engine weighed 62 tons in its most heavily armored configuration, which increased to 76 tons with the 20 percent future upgrade margin. Removing protection for easier air transportation would have reduced it to 56 tons. The Army's consideration {{to slow down the}} GCV development program gave time to the companies to refine their designs and reduce weight. One way would have been to reduce squad size. A nine-man squad has been identified as best for being able to fight with the possibility of taking casualties with single-vehicle transportability. With a three-man crew, the GCV had to carry 12 men. A greater number of lighter IFVs that carry fewer soldiers would have similar carrying capacity and combined costs and weight to planned GCV numbers. Another way would be an advance in armor designs. Lighter and stronger armor materials had not made radical progressions in recent history, and domestic active protection intercept systems were not yet mature. Foreign systems like the Israeli [...] Trophy had seen combat but cannot yet intercept tank shells. The GCV program originally included an APS, but was then delayed as a feature for later upgrades. The last effort to replace the Bradley was with Future Combat Systems, which developed a vehicle that relied on sensors to avoid danger and an APS in place of heavy armor.

A follow-up survey was conducted in 2011 and sent to all NICUs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. RESULTS on delivery room management were compared to the first survey.

Given the obesity epidemic and the efficacy of surgical treatment, the number of surgical <b>weight</b> loss procedures <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> in recent years. Nevertheless, there is little consensus regarding the extent of preoperative investigations required prior to patients undergoing surgery. This article aims to discuss the available evidence on which preoperative tests are useful for the detection and treatment of conditions such as venous thromboembolism, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and Helicobacter pylori-positive gastritis prior to an operation. The present literature suggests that only a few preoperative investigations are essential, but that preoperative multidisciplinary care is beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Globally, bariatric surgery, {{commonly}} known as <b>weight</b> loss surgery, <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> in popularity among obese individuals {{as a means to}} addressing their weight-related negative health when more traditional weight loss programs, such as diet and exercise, fail to elicit long term sustained weight loss. In Canada, however, complex barriers related to social, administrative, and other structural factors restrict access to care domestically, leaving some patients turning to surgical options abroad through the practice of medical tourism. In light of this, {{it is important that we}} understand the implications the practice of ‘bariatric tourism’ may hold for Canadians. Using an interview-based approach with former Canadian bariatric tourists, this study examines the patient experience of bariatric tourism. The analyses highlight specific barriers that are motivating patients to seek care internationally and challenges experienced in care obtainment both internationally and domestically that appear to heighten the health and safety risks these patients undertake...|$|R

He continued to smoke heavily, and, although placed on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to it only in fits and starts. Meanwhile, he began experiencing severe abdominal pains. Doctors diagnosed this problem through X-rays as diverticulosis—pouches of tissue forming on the intestine. His condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended, so Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Dr. Michael DeBakey. DeBakey discovered that even though two of the former President's coronary arteries were critically damaged, the overall condition of his heart was so poor that even attempting a bypass surgery would likely result in fatal complications.|$|R
