40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Oils, greases, {{and grit}} which collect on an {{aircraft}} during flight are removed on the U. S. Air Force washracks using an alkaline, water-base cleaner. Waste-flows from these washracks may include {{in addition to}} free oils, emulsified oils, and alkaline, water-base cleaners several other constituents such as acid skin brightners, paint stripping solvents, paint scrapings, and volatile cleaning solvents. A study of aircraft <b>washrack</b> waste characteristics and treatment methods is presented in this thesis. The first section is a review of available literature including past experimental analysis. A survey of current <b>washrack</b> installations and treatment facilities at 65 Air Force bases in the United States forms the second section. The final section of this thesis contains an experimental analysis of the <b>washrack</b> wastes and the treatment facility at Portland AFB, Oregon. Oil concentration, five-day BOD., suspended solids, total solids, and effluent over-flow are {{used to measure the}} waste characteristics and flow and to determine the efficiency of a gravity oil separator at the Portland base. A testing procedure for determining oil concentrations is developed. Tests of the inflow and outflow of the gravity oil separator showed the following ranges. Waste Characteristics: 5 -day BOD. (mg/ 1), Oil Content (mg/ 1), Suspended Solids (mg/ 1), Total Solids (mg/ 1) Influent: 530 - 3, 300, 1, 450 - 6, 400, 34 - 270, 690 - 2, 400 Effluent: 350 - 1, 250, 240 - 1, 130, 28 - 80, 500 - 2, 070 The conclusions drawn from the test results are as follows: 1. An acclimated seed was required for the five-day BOD. test of aircraft <b>washrack</b> wastes. 2. For oil concentrations in <b>washrack</b> wastes, the testing procedure presented in this thesis measured oil concentrations with an error of less than four percent. 3. The gravity oil separator at the Portland AFB provided an average BOD. reduction of 37 percent and an oil removal of 70 percent. 4. The effluent from the gravity oil separator contained only emulsified oils. 5. The average oil content of the treated effluent was 589 ppm. This value greatly exceeded the general limit of 30 ppm, established by states which had oil concentration standards. 6. An average of 410 gallons of water was required to wash a C- 119 aircraft at Portland AFB...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} two commercial off-theshelf <b>washrack</b> wastewater recycle treatment systems (a Landa and an RGF) {{to determine}} their applicability at Army facilities. The evaluation assessed the resource requirements for installation, operation, maintenance and repair, and also assessed {{the effectiveness of the}} treatment. The two systems were found to use somewhat similar treatment processes. After a 3 -month evaluation for each system, the results of the evaluations were also similar. Both systems required significant resources for in-house labor and for service. When operating correctly, both systems provided adequate treatment...|$|E
