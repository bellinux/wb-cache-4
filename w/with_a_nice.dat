Rashvin Bedi, writing for Malaysian newspaper The Star, praised the album, saying that [...] "Connie sings with ease and manages the high notes admirably", but asked whether [...] "people would buy an album of the same songs sung by a 20-year-old".|$|E
500|$|Ian Christie, {{writing in}} the Daily Express, {{said that it was}} not [...] "much of a plot, but it has a touch of {{credibility}} which is a welcome change from some of its predecessors." [...] Overall, Christie thought, For Your Eyes Only was [...] "one of the better Bonds, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> balance between humour and excitement and the usual bevy of beautiful girls." [...] Christie's colleague in the Sunday Express, Richard Barkley praised the film, saying that For Your Eyes Only [...] "is {{one of the most exciting}} yet". Barkley describes Moore's Bond as having an [...] "accustomed debonair calm and quiet authority". All told, Barkley thought [...] "this Bond movie is smashing entertainment." ...|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Kvar i min bil", {{written and}} {{performed}} by Per Gessle, resonates repeatedly through the film. Originally an outtake from Gessle's solo album En händig man, {{the song was}} specially provided for the film, to resemble the sound of popular 1980s pop group Gyllene Tider. Gessle has described the song as a [...] "bluesy tune <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guitar hook”. Other songs in the film include [...] "Försonade" [...] from 1968, written and performed by future ABBA member Agnetha Fältskog, [...] "Flash in the Night" [...] from 1981, written by Tim Norell and Björn Håkansson and performed by Secret Service, and [...] "Dags å välja sida" [...] by Peps Blodsband.|$|E
500|$|The season's first episode, [...] "It Came {{from the}} Nightosphere" [...] was largely well {{received}} by critics. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called it [...] "a pretty decent example {{of all the}} notes the show can hit." [...] He was particularly pleased with the way [...] "the rift between Marceline and her dad is handled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> seriousness that fits right in alongside absurd gags about penguins". He also noted that [...] "any episode that includes a song is a plus in my book." [...] It was also called the [...] "real highlight" [...] of the eponymous DVD release by Charles Webb of MTV Geek. IGN writer Matt Fowler later referred to the episode as a [...] "classic". The episode was later nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program, although it did not win.|$|E
500|$|Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India {{gave the}} film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "You cannot {{appreciate}} the smarts {{in the script}} has been written, and how humorously it all gets translated onscreen without getting unduly melodramatic. Since this is ANR's last film, the cumulative nostalgia and feel goodness of the movie might just paper over the structural issues. It's definitely worth a watch". Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle also gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Vikram Kumar has come out <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> story and screenplay and created a classic masterpiece. Though there are past life regressions and rebirths, the director’s intelligent screenplay makes you to see more comfortably without any confusion. Manam is a good film to watch and a fitting tribute to Akkineni Nageswara Rao." ...|$|E

500|$|Buddy TV {{senior writer}} Oscar Dahl remarked, [...] "It didn't {{make me laugh}} out loud and, yet, I still loved it." [...] He shed a {{negative}} light on Andy's behavior towards Dwight, calling it [...] "annoying and not that funny." [...] Dahl hoped Dwight would be reappearing soon, and concluded [...] "Overall, a crucial story episode <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> cliffhanger. Even if wasn't as funny as last week or even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode as I did watching this one. If the performances in this particular one don't garner the actors in this show a plethora of Emmys, {{there ought to be}} an investigation." [...] Sciannamea continued that he believed it was Steve Carell's best series performance thus far because he [...] "displayed the full range of his personality—jokester, arrogant jerk, charming salesman, sensitive soul, and added a new one—anger." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the episodes {{featured}} on The Simpsons Gone Wild, PopMatters critic Stephen Haag wrote that [...] "none of these episodes will end up in the Simpsons Hall of Fame", and that [...] "The Mansion Family" [...] is [...] "hardly a classic episode, but Lord knows there are plenty worse from season 11 (paging 'Bart to the Future')." [...] He further commented that [...] "if anything, this episode {{should be included in the}} 'batshit-crazy endings' DVD," [...] referring to the ending scenes with the Chinese pirates. David Packard of DVD Verdict was more positive in his review of The Simpsons Gone Wild, writing that [...] "The Mansion Family" [...] is [...] "another all-around hilarious episode, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> swipe at the Grammy Awards, the Simpsons family running amok in the mansion and enjoying all it has to offer, and Burns' various tests at the Mayo Clinic (my favorite gag is when Burns is slid into an MRI machine, only to hear the thing grind to a halt with an error message reading 'Clear body jam in Area 1.')" ...|$|E

IGN writer Matt Fowler later referred to the episode as a [...] "classic". In a separate review, he later wrote that the episode [...] "has come to represent the best of Adventure Time, and Marceline's , with her angst-y anti-daddy song and her Freddy Krueger-esque sweater has launched a thousand cosplays." [...] Writers of Spin ranked [...] "The Fry Song" [...] as the forty-fourth best original song performed by fictional characters in any medium. James Grebey called its subject matter deep and from a place of uncontrolled emotion, mature but also eccentric.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{municipalities}} {{have used}} an explicit [...] "view tax" [...] since 2003, itemizing {{the view from}} a property as a separate line item <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dollar amount. But the New Hampshire Assessing Standards Board has held that the view is merely one factor in determining the fair market value of a property; as <b>a</b> property <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nicer</b> view will command a higher market price, an assessor should consider the view, like any other desirable amenity. This implies that a [...] "view tax" [...] {{would be at least}} an implicit component of all property taxes in New Hampshire.|$|R

500|$|The studio {{originally}} dismissed The Lion King as a risk because, at the time, it {{was believed}} that the greatest films starred people. Concerned about the novelty of the film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to divide the studio into two separate animated films, The Lion King and Pocahontas, the latter of which was dubbed [...] "the home run" [...] because it was expected to be the more successful of the two projects. Naturally, Disney's more seasoned and experienced animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while the studio's newer animators were relegated to working on The Lion King, dubbing themselves the [...] "B-team". However, Allers received Katzenberg's decision positively as an opportunity for [...] "newer animators ... to step up to leadership roles", among them Andreas Deja, who became Scar's supervising animator. Well known for animating several Disney villains, Deja summarized the experience as [...] "more fun than drawing heroes" [...] because [...] "You have so much more to work with in terms of expressions and acting and drawing-wise than you would have <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> princess or a prince ... where you have to be ever so careful with the draftsmanship".|$|E
500|$|The CP+B {{produced}} Coq Roq advertisements {{followed a}} pattern of controversy for the company, as previous advertisements produced by CP+B had come under fire for perceived or overt sexual innuendo. An earlier example {{of this type of}} advertisement was a promotion for a LTO version of Burger King's TenderCrisp sandwich which featured Darius Rucker in a commercial singing a variant of Burger King's Have It Your Way jingle that featured a line about [...] "a train of ladies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> caboose," [...] where caboose was not referring to the last car of a train, but the buttocks of the actresses featured in the commercial. The issues raised by public interest groups in this instance came from complaints over the double entendres and sexual innuendo on the Coq Roq website. Pictures of scantily clad women posing as groupies of the band were featured in one section of the site and sported comments such as [...] "groupies love the Coq" [...] and [...] "Groupies love Coq". Protests from the public over the sexual innuendo of the comments forced BK to request CB+P to have content be changed to something more appropriate for a family oriented restaurant.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Peter Travers {{awarded the}} film 3.5 out of 4 stars, commending the film for being [...] "emotionally truthful, painfully funny and vibrantly alive" [...] and {{labeling}} it [...] "a near-perfect road movie". Stephen Holden of The New York Times believed that [...] "Much {{of the dialogue}} is so quirky it sounds overheard instead of scripted" [...] and called the cast [...] "correspondingly spontaneous". New York magazine's chief film critic David Edelstein praised Hynes' [...] "talent for deadpan jaw-droppers that aren't self-consciously quirky", and thought that [...] "In The Go-Getter, filmmaking itself feels like Manifest Destiny." [...] Todd McCarthy, writing for Variety, was impressed by Pucci's performance and Shah's cinematography, calling the film [...] "an unusually fresh-feeling indie <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> sense of style". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote that The Go-Getter [...] "breathes new life [...] into the overworked indie road-movie formula", labeling Pucci as [...] "charming" [...] and the cinematography as [...] "unusually nice". The New York Presss Mark Peikert thought that Deschanel made the film's flaws [...] "almost forgivable", and that the film was [...] "a feature-length audition reel for Deschanel to finally get the roles she deserves". New York Daily News critic Elizabeth Weitzman called Pucci [...] "one of the best, and most overlooked, young actors around" [...] and giving the film 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E

500|$|James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch {{felt that}} Chris Sabin and Shocker versus Simon Diamond and Mikey Batts was [...] "solid wrestling" [...] and a [...] "nice opening match" [...] for the tournament. When {{it came to}} the second match of the tournament, [...] B.G. James and Cassidy Reilly versus Ron Killings and Sonjay Dutt, Caldwell felt that James and Killings [...] "undermined the spirit of the Candido tournament" [...] by dancing mid-way through their encounter. Caldwell commented on the pairing of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman for the tournament, saying they were a [...] "natural fit working together" [...] and expressing hope that they would be a {{permanent}} fixture after the tournament concluded. Regarding the semifinal matches, Caldwell thought Sabin and Shocker versus Dutt and Killings was a [...] "solid match <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> mini-storyline involving Sabin and Shocker having a miscommunication before settling their differences to win the match." [...] As for the finals, Caldwell stated that Shelley and Waltman versus Sabin and Shocker was a [...] "standard tag match" [...] but it was [...] "effective in telling the story of Waltman and Shelley doing whatever it takes to win while Shocker and Sabin continued to have differences that finally caused Shocker to go off." [...] Caldwell concluded by saying that [...] "Waltman and Shelley have impressed as a legit tag team since their first round match in the tournament," [...] going on to say that he hoped for a Waltman and Shelley victory at Unbreakable to [...] "give the tag division a fresh team to build around." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{began to}} write during a {{blizzard}} in February 1979 while housebound with her two small boys. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten she had little else to do. While writing down her ideas for the first time, {{she fell in love}} with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts. She submitted her manuscripts to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says, [...] "I got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done.

2500|$|The easily {{obtainable}} {{credit that}} had helped create and engorge the real-estate bubble {{continued to be}} a problem for several years to come, and as late as 1997, banks were still making loans that had a low guarantee of being repaid. Loan Officers and Investment staff had a hard time finding anything to invest in that would return a profit. Meanwhile, the extremely low interest rate offered for deposits, such as 0.1%, meant that ordinary Japanese savers were just as inclined to put their money under their beds as they were to put it in savings accounts. Correcting the credit problem became even more difficult as the government began to subsidize failing banks and businesses, creating many so-called [...] "zombie businesses". Eventually a carry trade developed in which money was borrowed from Japan, invested for returns elsewhere and then the Japanese were paid back, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> profit for the trader.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his release}} from San Quentin in 1960, Haggard started digging ditches for his brother's {{electrical}} contracting company. Soon, he was performing again, and later began recording with Tally Records. The Bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced honky tonk of the Nashville sound. Haggard's first record for Tally was [...] "Singing My Heart Out" [...] backed by [...] "Skid Row"; {{it was not a}} success, and only 200 copies were pressed. In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a Wynn Stewart show in Las Vegas and heard Wynn's [...] "Sing a Sad Song." [...] He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with [...] "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers," [...] written by Liz Anderson, mother of country singer Lynn Anderson, and his career was off and running. Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson—a woman he did not know—at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. [...] "If there was anything I didn't wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman's house and listen to her cute little songs. But I went anyway. She was a pleasant enough lady, pretty, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> smile, but I was all set to be bored to death, even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ....
