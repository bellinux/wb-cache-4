5|$|The Judge {{was always}} {{headline}} news. He {{was a great}} showman, theatrical in appearance, with his sharp jaw and shock of <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> and people always crowded into his courtroom, knowing there would be something going on. There were few dull moments.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Thomas {{was praised}} for his learning, his {{encouragement}} {{of education in}} his diocese, and his generosity. He was an excellent singer and composed hymns. In his youth, he was known for having a sturdy build, and in his old age he had a ruddy complexion and snow <b>white</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> coat. Gray horses, {{including}} Lipizzans, are born darkusually bay or blackand become lighter each {{year as the}} graying process takes place, with the process being complete at between 6 and 10 years of age. Lipizzans are not actually true white horses, {{but this is a}} common misconception. A white horse is born white and has unpigmented skin.|$|E
50|$|Rabicano, {{sometimes}} called white ticking, is a horse coat color characterized by limited roaning {{in a specific}} pattern: its most minimal form is expressed by <b>white</b> <b>hairs</b> {{at the top of}} a horse's tail, often is expressed by additional interspersed <b>white</b> <b>hairs</b> seen first at the flank, then other parts of the body radiating out from the flank, where the <b>white</b> <b>hairs</b> will be most pronounced. Rabicano is distinct from true roan, which causes evenly interspersed <b>white</b> <b>hairs</b> throughout the body, except for solid-colored head and legs.|$|R

5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus <b>white</b> <b>hair.</b> Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings).|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is {{introduced}} in Part I as a young, spiky black-haired teenager {{who wears a}} blue shirt, with a fan representing his clan on his back. He also wears short white pants and the customary Konohagakure head band. Early in the series, a man named Orochimaru brands Sasuke with a cursed seal that causes black marks to cover his body, and later grants him new Cursed Seal powers, which give him gray skin, <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> and claw-like wings. In Part II, he usually appears wearing a white kimono with black pants. While skilled {{in the use of}} shurikens, in Part II Sasuke wields a chokutō sword which he calls Kusanagi. Besides using Kusanagi for Kenjutsu, Sasuke can additionally combine it with lightning-based techniques to increase the range of his attacks.|$|E
5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not believe in The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E
50|$|Perennial, {{dioecious}} climber. Shoot length up to 5 m, {{more or less}} densely {{covered with}} <b>white</b> <b>hairs.</b> Leaves are alternate with 1.5-14.0 cm long petiole, lamina 7.5-12.0 × 6.5-12.0 cm, often cordate to profoundly 3- or 5-lobate. If lobate, then the central lobe is dominating and has a sharp tip. Upper lamina glabrous with clear to whitish pustules, sometimes with <b>white</b> <b>hairs.</b> Lower lamina paler than upper lamina, with <b>white</b> <b>hairs,</b> that can appear wart-like when broken off. Tendrils simple. Probracts up to 3 mm long.|$|R

5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{creative}} team {{did not want}} the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor Roy Thomas suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, originally designed as a male, into the woman of the group. Cockrum liked the idea, and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat's costume, a cape, and a new haircut with <b>white</b> <b>hair.</b> His collaborators feared that Storm’s <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> would make her look like a grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young, insisted on this aspect of her appearance.|$|E
