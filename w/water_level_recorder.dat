Recent hurricane strikes along the Gulf Coast of the United States have impacted wetland integrity in some areas and hastened the need to understand how and to what degree coastal forested wetlands confer protection by reducing the height of peak <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> In recent years, U. S. Geological Survey Gulf Coast research projects in Florida have instrumented mangrove sites with continuous <b>water</b> <b>level</b> <b>recorders.</b> Our ad hoc network of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> <b>recorders</b> documented the rise, peak, and fall of <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> (6 0. 5 hr) from two hurricane events in 2004 and 2005. Reduction of peak <b>water</b> <b>level</b> heights from relatively in-line gages associated with one storm surge event indicated that mangrove wetlands can reduce <b>water</b> <b>level</b> height by as much as 9. 4 cm/km inland over intact, relatively unchannelized expanses. During the other event, reductions were slightly less for mangroves along a river corridor.

50|$|The dyke was {{constructed}} in the 25 hectare farm of Krishi Vigyan Kendra Kannur in 2007 {{to solve the problem}} of water scarcity. The experience of KVK indicated that subsurface dyke was an efficient barrier to arrest the subsurface flow of water and conserve ground water. The rate of depletion of drainable water in the catchment area due to the typical undulating topography could be efficiently arrested by the dyke. The dyke resulted in the maintenance of higher water table in the catchment area for a longer period of time. There is an existing dug out pond with top length of 12 m, width 8m a depth 5m in the upstream side of the dyke. The pond is the only source of water in the KVK farm. The pond, which usually gets dried up in the summer is now maintaining a high water table throughout the year as the dyke ensures an incessant supply of water to the pond. Weekly data on the ground water level were recorded using <b>water</b> <b>level</b> <b>recorder.</b> The data showed that significantly higher level of water table was maintained in the catchment area (upstream area) compared to down stream area. Taking into account the mean depth of soil as 2 m the catchment area as 1.5ha (the actual area is 15 ha) and the drainable porosity as 10%, the total water storage capacity of the dyke would be 3000 m3. The crops cultivated in the catchment area would be benefited by way of constant capillary feeding of the rhizosphere. Kerala receives, on an average, more than 3000mm of rainfall per annum which is concentrated to the months of June to October. Due to the typical undulating topography of the state, the excess rain received is mostly lost through runoff. Immediately on cessation of rains subsurface water drains off along the slope resulting in poor retention of water in the catchment area. In spite of the heavy rainfall received in Kerala, the state experiences severe drought during summer months due to inefficient utilisation of rain water. In a state like Kerala, where the pressure on land is very high surface storage of water in large reservoirs with their adverse ecological impact is not an economic proposition. Alternatively, structures like subsurface dyke are most ideal for in situ conservation of rainfall received in a watershed.|$|E

Preliminary analysis of the discharge and sediment data collected was made.

30|$|The aquifer {{response}} to recharge–discharge phenomenon of hard rock aquifers {{has been investigated}} by analyzing over 250 well hydrographs, collected from eight States of Peninsular India. The true hydrographs are based on continuous (six hourly) time series data recorded {{with the help of}} digital automatic <b>water</b> <b>level</b> <b>recorders</b> fitted in purpose-built piezometers. Due to the high heterogeneity of hard rock aquifers each well/piezometer produces a hydrograph that is unique and does not match with hydrographs of other wells. However, the successive annual curves of the hydrograph of a well remain nearly similar in shape though the magnitude of fluctuation varies based on the quantum of recharge–discharge and its pattern. This clearly reflects that the shape of the hydrograph is controlled by aquifer characteristic and its response and does not entirely depend on recharge–discharge quantum and pattern. The combination of rising and recession limbs produces different crest and trough shapes. Similarity in crest and trough shape represents similarity in aquifer characteristics. As found during this research shapes of the crests and troughs of the true hydrographs can form a basis for devising a genetic classification of the aquifers. Three crest types namely ‘point’, ‘rounded’ and ‘flat top’ crest and three trough types viz. V shape, U shape and S shape have been identified in hard rocks of Peninsular India. The V type curve indicates quick dissipation; U type indicates initial quick adjustment and then slow dissemination whereas the S type curves are indicative of poor response of the aquifer. The U shape indicates relatively better sustained diffusivity of the aquifers. Confined and unconfined aquifers can be differentiated based on the apparent line thickness. Thin line denotes unconfined and thick line denotes confined aquifer. Intermittent apparent thickness of line corresponds to semi-confined aquifer. Fluctuation produced by pumping of well can be segregated based on the fluctuation pattern.|$|R

3000|$|The {{continuous}} {{groundwater level}} data emanating from a high-frequency automatic <b>water</b> <b>level</b> <b>recorder</b> {{installed in a}} purpose-built piezometer provides a true hydrograph. Analyses of such hydrographs fairly reflect the aquifer character {{and can be used}} to draw inference for genetic classification of hard rock aquifers. The signature shape of annual water level fluctuation curve (annual cycle) of a piezometer is due to the specific character of the aquifer and the way it responds to the recharge–discharge phenomenon. The pattern of annual cycle remains identical year after year, although its magnitude may vary with the annual quantum of recharge–discharge. Lithology of the aquifer does not control the shape of the curve. Based on the crest and trough shape, the hard rock aquifers of Peninsular India, where the monsoonal pattern of rainfall occurs, have been classified into genetic groups. It is also found that the nature of the aquifer can be determined by visual comparison of apparent line thickness of the hydrograph, where thin lines denote unconfined aquifer and the apparently thicker lines correspond to confining condition. The response of an aquifer to a pumping event can be identified and separated by its pattern. Thus, the aquifer classification can be automated by adopting the proposed classification scheme.|$|E

Historical rainfall data spanning over the years 1995 – 2004 of the rain gauge stations (viz., Belpahari, Jhargram and Phekoghat) located in the basin (Fig.  1) {{were collected}} from the Dept. of Agriculture, GoWB. The discharge and flow velocity data at the Phekoghat gauging site (where stage is measured by <b>water</b> <b>level</b> stage <b>recorder</b> and flow velocity is measured by current meter) were collected for 1995 – 2004 from Central Water Commission, Govt of India, Bhubaneswar. The direct runoff which was estimated from the observed runoff data after deducting the baseflow was used to evaluate the Ф-index. The effective rainfall intensity was computed using this Ф-index. Sixteen isolated storm events (encompassing variety of sizes) were selected for study.|$|R

A loud noise is produced, and as the sound dies away the trace on the <b>level</b> <b>recorder</b> will show a distinct slope. Analysis of this slope reveals the measured {{reverberation time}}. Some modern digital sound level meters can carry out this analysis automatically.|$|R
