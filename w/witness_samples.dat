After stretching the curd, before being turned in forms, this was divided into four portions. Three commercial proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes (Accelase® AM 250 M, PromodTM 215 P and LipomodTM 166 P) were added to the first three portions of stretched cheese, and the last one was left without treatment and served as a control. Pasta filata cheese samples were taken periodically, when fresh and after 8, 15, 30 days of ripening, for analysis. The changes in titratable acidity, pH value, dry matter, content ofsalt and moisture, proteic content as well as the dynamics of proteolysis were studied. Examination of the data revealed that the addition of enzymes had nosignificant effect on dry matter, fat, total nitrogen, salt contents of obtained cheeses.

The Mir space station provides an excellent opportunity for such experiments due to the long exposure that some of the modules have experienced.

40|$|In such {{fields as}} {{cleanroom}} technology for space applications, semiconductor and optics, the {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) in these controlled environments need to be assessed {{for the presence of}} molecular organic contaminants (MOC) in order to permit clean device surfaces during the entire construction and assembly period. Especially high boiling MOC such as phthalates, organic esters, siloxanes and hydrocarbons may emit constantly from building and construction materials and later condense on critical surfaces. Therefore, extensive MOC material emission screening measurements of different types of cleanroom building products according to a new standard ISO/WD 14644 - 15 were performed. All obtained surface specific emission rates are entered into a public available database in order to enable a material selection already in the planning phase of a low-emission controlled environment. Therefore, a simulation model for cleanroom settings predicts the expected level of MOC of the environment to be constructed. New cleanroom settings for space applications and research with a very high IAQ regarding MOC are planned and built based on a targeted material selection using the database values and the simulation tool. The presence of critical condensables was quantified on selected cleanroom settings using especially designed condensation <b>witness</b> <b>samples</b> which are later analysed by transmission Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) purged with ultrapure VOC-filtered air based on EN 16602 - 70 - 05. As a result, a condensation rate is calculated for the individual sampling sites. A more detailed species analysis of the collected condensables is done by thermal extraction of <b>witness</b> <b>samples</b> in a micro emission chamber and subsequent analysis using automated thermodesorption coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (ATD-GC/MS) based on a slightly adapted method described in ISO 16000 - 25.

The resulting samples {{have been investigated}} using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), micro-Raman spectroscopy (mu-R) and, finally, low temperature photoluminescence (LTPL) spectroscopy. From SIMS measurements we find Ga concentrations {{in the range of}} 10 (18) cm(- 3), systematically accompanied by high nitrogen content. In good agreement with these findings, the mu-R spectra show that the Ga-doped samples are n-type, with electron concentrations close to 2 x 10 (18) cm(- 3). As expected, the LTPL spectra are dominated by strong N-Ga donor-acceptor pair (DAP) transitions. In one sample, a weak additional N-Al DAP recombination spectrum is also observed, showing the possibility to have accidental codoping with Ga and Al simultaneously. This was confirmed on a non-intentionally doped 3 C-SiC (<b>witness)</b> <b>sample</b> on which, apart of the usual N and Al bound exciton lines, a small feature resolved at 2. 35 eV comings from neutral Ga bound excitons.

A ferroelectric ceramic has an electric field-dependent dielectric permittivity that can be altered by applying a bias voltage. Ferroelectric materials offer significant benefits for linear collider applications, in particular, for switching and control elements where a very short response time of < 10 nsec is required. The measurement results presented here show that the new BST(M) ceramic exhibits a high tunability factor: a bias field of 40 - 50 kV/cm reduces the permittivity by a factor of 1. 3 - 1. 5. The recently developed technology of gold biasing contact deposition on large diameter (110 cm) thin wall ferroelectric rings allowed ~few nsec switching times in <b>witness</b> <b>sample</b> experiments.

The oxide's surface morphology was similar on both substrates, but was smoothest on c -plane GaN as determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Circular capacitors (50 - 300 μm diameter) with Ni/Au (20 / 100 nm) metal contacts {{on top of the}} oxide were created by standard photolithography and e-beam evaporation methods to form metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors (MOSCAPs).

Thepatients were divided into two samples: study sample A, with 40 patients who completed a specialized rehabilitationprogram for a minimum of 30 days and control sample B, made of 17 patients with cu THA, but who did not followsuch a program. For the evaluation, I have used the pedometer Omron Walking Stayl Pro, which calculates the averagevelocity of motion, the distance, and the number of steps per time unit. The testing took 2 minutes per subject, itoccurred in the preoperative and postoperative stage, as well as 30 and 90 days after the intervention. The experimentalmethod used in gait rehabilitation for the THA patients was the proprioceptive re-education of the support at theplantar level with the help of the stabilometric platform GPS 400; this method re-educates the degree of articulatoryload. The outcomes of this study statistically underline a better evolution of all parameters measured for the studysample compared to the <b>witness</b> <b>sample.</b> The final conclusion of this study emphasises on the fact that earlyintervention with therapeutic programs that include exercises with the stabilometric platform does lead to much moreeffective gait rehabilitation...|$|R
50|$|The {{teenagers}} in the Kashmere Stage Band produced a sound {{equal to that}} of the contemporary funk bands the JBs and the Bar-Kays. Although lost for decades, since 2003 the KSB recordings have been released, some for the first time, on both vinyl record and CD and have become prized by hip-hop artists and DJs for their inimitable sound. A notable sampling occurs on the Handsome Boy Modeling School album So... How's Your Girl?; DJ Shadow’s track “Holy Calamity (Bear <b>Witness</b> II)” <b>samples</b> “Kashmere” from the album Kashmere Stage Band Plays Originals. Stones Throw Records imprint label Now-Again Records released a compilation of KSB material in 2006.|$|R

The public is invited to <b>witness</b> the <b>sampling</b> at Big Trees Park. The plan has been developed by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) scientists with guidance from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Radiologic Health and Environmental Health Investigations Branches of the California Health Services Department (CDHS-RHB and CDHS-EHIB), and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Input from citizens and community organizations was also received during an over- 70 -day public comment period...|$|R
