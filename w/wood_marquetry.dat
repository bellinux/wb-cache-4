50|$|Straw {{marquetry}} is a craft {{very similar}} to that of <b>wood</b> <b>marquetry,</b> except that straw replaces the wood veneer. It is thought to have first been practised in the East; examples were brought to England in the 17th century.|$|E

Around it a Louis XIV elm flooring inlaid with olive-root and other prized <b>wood</b> <b>marquetry.</b> The following year Mengozzi Colonna intervenes also on the central hall (portego) designing the beautiful Venetian terrazzo pavings.|$|E

The church has had many reconstructions and most recently restored in 2001. It features two naves and retains an altar in <b>wood</b> <b>marquetry</b> and pyrography. Under the altar is the crypt the tomb of St Nicandro was discovered, a spring called [...] "Manna of St. Nicandro" [...] also appears in the crypt.|$|E

5000|$|Lath art {{has a lot}} {{in common}} with {{marquetry}} and intarsia. They are all woodworking hobbies to make pictures out of sections of <b>wood,</b> but <b>marquetry</b> and intarsia use the wood grain as a design element, and lath art uses the direction of the lath stick and the colors of the stains as a design element.|$|R
50|$|Hayes {{has worked}} on many shows at the Metropolitan Museum. For several years, he {{recorded}} instances when {{the staff of the}} Metropolitan were interviewed on television including the Director Philippe de Montebello’s Sunday show on PBS and made DVDs for the Watson Library at the Metropolitan. Marvin helped curator Wolfram Koeppe and devised a way to show the furniture of David and Abraham Roentgen which is beautiful <b>wood</b> inlay <b>marquetry</b> with secret compartments, sliding panels, rolltop desks, clocks, thermostats, and in some cases opened like beautiful butterflies. The viewers were able to see actual videos of the pieces being opened and displayed showing all of its secret compartments and sliding panels and mechanical innerworkings. A video clip from the 2012 show of the Berlin cabinet went viral on YouTube with over thirteen million hits (Now at 11/22/2016) Use this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKikHxKeodA The technique of using monitors to enhance, enlarge, and illustrate objects such as furniture, sculpture, pottery, and jewelry has become a standard since Marvin first suggest it.|$|R
5000|$|No {{examples}} of Florentine sets of spalliere with inset paintings have survived intact. At {{the most expensive}} level, all four walls of a room {{seem to have had}} panels fitted, which were richly decorated with carved <b>wood,</b> <b>marquetry,</b> and sometimes paintings inset into the wood. These paintings were usually much wider than tall, like the painted panels on cassoni. They seem often to have been made to celebrate a wedding, and fitted to the marital bedroom, though other important rooms also had them.|$|E
5000|$|The Wallace Collection holds one of {{the most}} {{important}} collections of French furniture in the UK, and ranks alongside the Musée du Louvre, the Royal Collection, Waddesdon Manor, the collections of the Duke of Buccleuch, the Getty Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art as {{one of the}} greatest and most celebrated in the world. Totalling more than five hundred pieces, the collection consists largely of eighteenth-century French furniture but also includes some significant pieces of nineteenth-century French furniture, as well as interesting Italian furniture and a few English and German pieces. The collection ranges from cabinet furniture, much of which is veneered with brass and turtleshell marquetry (commonly known as [...] "Boulle" [...] marquetry) or with <b>wood</b> <b>marquetry,</b> to seat furniture, clocks and barometers, gilt-bronze items including mounted porcelain and hardstones, mantelpieces, mirrors, boxes and pedestals. One highlight of the collection is the major collection of furniture attributed to André-Charles Boulle (1642-1732), perhaps the best-known cabinet-maker ever to have lived.|$|E
50|$|Techniques of <b>wood</b> <b>marquetry</b> were {{developed}} in Antwerp and other Flemish centers of luxury cabinet-making during the early 16th century. The craft was imported full-blown to France after the mid-seventeenth century, to create furniture of unprecedented luxury being made at the royal manufactory of the Gobelins, charged with providing furnishings to decorate Versailles and the other royal residences of Louis XIV. Early masters of French marquetry were the Fleming Pierre Golle and his son-in-law, André-Charles Boulle, who founded a dynasty of royal and Parisian cabinet-makers (ébénistes) and gave his name to a technique of marquetry employing tortoiseshell and brass with pewter in arabesque or intricately foliate designs. Boulle marquetry dropped out of favor in the 1720s, but was revived in the 1780s. In the decades between, carefully matched quarter-sawn veneers sawn from the same piece of timber were arranged symmetrically on case pieces and contrasted with gilt-bronze mounts. Floral marquetry came into favor in Parisian furniture in the 1750s, employed by cabinet-makers like Bernard van Risenbergh, Jean-Pierre Latz and Simon-François Oeben. The most famous royal French furniture veneered with marquetry are the pieces delivered by Jean Henri Riesener in the 1770s and 1780s. The Bureau du Roi was the most famous amongst these famous masterpieces.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was much}} {{mechanical}} arrangement {{at this time}} about the furniture, which, although to be regretted for its tendency toward instability, had some reason for its being, {{in the use of}} bedrooms for sitting rooms, writing rooms, and for the reception of favored guests; tables that opened if a portion were lifted; desks that transformed themselves; chairs, sofas, and wardrobes that answered two purposes. Lions' heads and feet and eagles' talons, although an old ornament, were now everywhere to be found again. There were claw-footed loo tables, and bedsteads and chairs resting on feet where the claws clutched a ball; certain tall secretaires, whose glass doors were sashed and latticed, were a nearly universal article; and there were charming light chairs of satin <b>wood</b> and <b>marquetry</b> [...] - [...] for satin wood had come in with the last as mahogany had with {{the first quarter of the}} century, and it would be difficult to imagine woods capable of producing more beauty than the creamy richness of the one or the wine-dark depths of the other, especially when ornamented, as frequently was the case, with medallions painted by Angelica Kauffman and by Giovanni Cipriani.|$|R
50|$|From 1 to 500 AD the Greeks and Romans {{made great}} {{contributions}} {{to the development of}} adhesives. <b>Wood</b> veneering and <b>marquetry</b> were developed, the production of animal and fish glues refined, and other materials utilized. Egg-based pastes were used to bond gold leaves incorporated various natural ingredients such as blood, bone, hide, milk, cheese, vegetables, and grains. The Greeks began the use of slaked lime as mortar while the Romans furthered mortar development by mixing lime with volcanic ash and sand. This material, known as pozzolanic cement, was used {{in the construction of the}} Roman Colosseum and Pantheon. The Romans were also the first people known to have used tar and beeswax as caulk and sealant between the wooden planks of their boats and ships.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inventory}} of his workshop and {{stock in trade}} taken after his death following a long illness gives a snapshot of his current style; one of the appraisers was the ébéniste Martin Carlin, to whom Joseph owed 113 livres. As might be expected in 1772, some of the furniture was in Louis XV style (contournée, [...] "serpentine" [...] in shape) while entries for other pieces revealed their Louis XVI character, such as a table with legs [...] "a gaine avec des Canelures", that is, with straight, fluted tapering legs. Most of the refined furniture bearing his stamp is in Louis XV style, employing crossbanded veneers of tropical <b>woods</b> rather than <b>marquetry,</b> and with sensitively-integrated gilt-bronze mounts that betoken close collaboration with the fondeurs-ciseleurs who made them, rather than purchases of stock mounts on the wholesale market.|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} an anatomical survey of Sapindaceae species {{growing on the}} private property that supplies liana fragments to the Adere (Association for the Development and Recovery for the Intellectually Disabled), {{one of the major}} producer of art <b>wood</b> <b>marquetry</b> made from the lianas from Sao Paulo. Based on species identification, we carried out both morphological and microscopic analyses of the transversal section of lianas stems, with the aim of separating the species based on wood characters. Only one of the seven analyzed species had no cambial variant (Paullinia trigonia Vell.); the rest presented cambial variant of the compound vascular cylinder type. Also, the six remaining species belong to the following genera: Serjania (Serjania caracasana (Jacq.) Willd., Serjania lethalis A. St. -Hill., Serjania laruotteana Cambess., and Serjania multiflora Cambess.) These genera could be distinguished by pith configuration, arrangement and quantity of peripheral vascular cylinders, as well as two statistically significant quantitative features: the diameter and frequency of vessel elements. In this work, a key for species identification and illustrations are presented, in addition to comments about the extractivism carried out by Adere...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} using fungal-colored wood (spalted <b>wood)</b> for <b>marquetry</b> and {{intarsia}} woodworks in Italy and Germany was very popular from the 1400 – 1600 s, with some instances continuing {{as late as}} the 1800 s. While spalted marquetry in these countries is relatively well documented, less is known about its use in other parts of Europe. One of the primary reasons for this lack of knowledge is the difficulty in identifying spalted wood, especially the blue-green variety produced from Chlorociboria species, from wood dyed with copper-based compounds or other synthetics. The most reliable testing method involves destructive sampling, where a small piece is taken from the work, the pigment extracted, and an analysis performed. Such sampling is simply not feasible, nor often allowed, on ancient artwork. To make a reliable, non-destructive identification of spalted wood, a visual method based on anatomical characteristics of spalted wood was developed to differentiate spalted wood from dyed wood. High-resolution pictures were taken from wooden artifacts containing blue-green colored wood in collections at the National Museum of Decorative Arts (MNAD), the Royal Site Monastery El Escorial and the Bilbao Museum of Fine Arts in Spain. The concentration of pigment in the rays, the color distribution, the size of the piece and the date of production, were analyzed. With the use of this new visual method, it was possible to determine that intarsia artifacts, held in Spain but of Augsburg origin from the 1500 – 1600 s, contained spalted wood details. Meanwhile, Spanish and Italian intarsia artifacts from the 1800 s were found to only contain dyed wood...|$|R
5000|$|The medieval Veste Coburg, one of {{the biggest}} castles in Germany, built {{starting}} in 1225 (upon the site of an 11th-century chapel). It was mostly rebuilt in the 19th century. It has a triple line of walls with numerous towers. Today the Veste Coburg is home to three museums. One is the Fürstenbau (ducal palace), with many furnished rooms of the Dukes of Coburg, including the apartment where Martin Luther lived in 1530. Probably the most notable room in the castle (unique in all of Germany) is the Jagdzimmer (hunting room) of 1632, which is entirely made of <b>marquetry</b> <b>wood</b> inlay, done up with over 60 marquetry panels, deeply coffered marquetry ceilings and a wood paneled floor. Another museum is the Rüstkammer (armory), containing the largest collection of medieval armour and weaponry in Germany, with over 10,500 items. The third is the Kunstsammlungen, which contains a collection of 300,000 copperplate engravings (Kupferstich-Kabinett), a 20,000 piece coin collection (Münzkabinett), a 7,000 piece documentation collection (Briefe & Urkunden), and a 3,500 piece glassware collection (Gläser-Sammlung).|$|R
