5|$|The obverse of {{the dime}} depicts President Roosevelt, with the {{inscriptions}} LIBERTY and IN GOD <b>WE</b> <b>TRUST.</b> Sinnock's initials, JS, are {{found by the}} cutoff of the bust, {{to the left of}} the date. The reverse shows a torch in the center, representing liberty, flanked by an olive sprig representing peace, and one of oak symbolizing strength and independence. The inscription E PLURIBUS UNUM (out of many, one) stretches across the field. The name of the country and the value of the coin are the legends that surround the reverse design, which is symbolic of the victorious end of World War II.|$|E

25|$|In a March 6, 1889 {{obituary}} Franklin B.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the prescribed elements on U.S. coins—LIBERTY and the date—the motto In God <b>We</b> <b>Trust</b> appeared {{for the first time}} on a coin of this denomination. The United States Congress passed the Act of March 3, 1865, authorizing the use of this motto on U.S. coins, during Lincoln's tenure in office.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Black Flag {{debuted in}} Los Angeles, Dead Kennedys were formed in San Francisco. While the band's early {{releases}} were {{played in a}} style closer to traditional punk rock, In God <b>We</b> <b>Trust,</b> Inc. (1981) marked a shift into hardcore. Similar to Black Flag and Youth Brigade, Dead Kennedys released their albums on their own label, which in DK's case was Alternative Tentacles. While not {{as large as the}} scene in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area hardcore scene of the 1980s included a number of noteworthy bands, including Crucifix, Flipper, and Whipping Boy.|$|E

On 28 February 2012, further changes were announced. Greg James and Scott Mills swapped shows and Jameela Jamil, Gemma Cairney and Danny Howard joined the station. The new line-up of DJs for In New DJs <b>We</b> <b>Trust</b> was also announced with B.Traits, Mosca, Jordan Suckley and Julio Bashmore hosting shows on a four weekly rotation. This new schedule took effect on Monday, 2 April 2012.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern {{societies}}, it was {{the elders}} who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on expert systems. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. Even if <b>we</b> <b>trust</b> them, we know that something could go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, {{there is always a}} heightened sense of uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a 'juggernaut': modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space.|$|E

60|$|Captain Nicholl and {{the surgeon}} were good men and honest. Often enough, when {{two of us}} slept, the one awake and {{steering}} could have stolen from the meat.

25|$|A {{report in}} the Torquay and Tor Directory on 21 May 1847 {{accepted}} that 'the high price of provisions' had provoked the disturbances, but displayed little magnanimity in claiming that 'steps had been taken for relieving the sufferings {{of the poor and}} it will be far more grateful to the right-minded poor to know that the relief which <b>we</b> <b>trust</b> will shortly be afforded to them was not exacted by intimidation, but voluntarily determined upon before'. A handbill circulated at the same time, headed 'To The Poor of Tor and Torquay', informed them that the crop failures were down to His hand, and that they should put their faith in 'God's Providence'.|$|E
25|$|The 24 {{stars on}} the reverse convey the same message that the 2★4 on the obverse of some {{specimens}} does—that Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union. The name SEDALIA, the first state capital and site of the centennial exposition, appears in exergue. Aitken's stylized monogram, RA, is near the rifle butt. The Missouri piece, and the Columbian half dollar of 1892–1893, are the only U.S. commemorative half dollars to bear none of the patriotic mottoes usually found on U.S. coinage, that is LIBERTY, IN GOD <b>WE</b> <b>TRUST</b> and E PLURIBUS UNUM. The design was liked {{at the time of}} issue; several specimens were shown and admired at the 1921 American Numismatic Association convention at Boston in August, soon after the coin's release.|$|E

We each {{have good reason}} to mislead rather than make bullshit assertions, but to make bullshit assertions rather than lie.

25|$|Shepherd wrote {{a series}} of humorous short stories {{about growing up in}} {{northwest}} Indiana and its steel towns, many of which were first told by him on his programs and then published in Playboy. The stories were later assembled into books titled In God <b>We</b> <b>Trust,</b> All Others Pay Cash, Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories: and Other Disasters, The Ferrari in the Bedroom, and A Fistful of Fig Newtons. Some of those situations were incorporated into his movies and television fictional stories. He also wrote a column for the early Village Voice, a column for Car and Driver, numerous individual articles for diverse publications, including Mad Magazine ("The Night People vs. Creeping Meatballism", March/April 1957), and introductions for books such as The America of George Ade, American Snapshots, and the 1970 reprint of the 1929 Johnson Smith Catalogue.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should <b>we</b> <b>trust</b> any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
