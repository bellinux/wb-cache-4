On the other hand, the secondary school teachers possessed high level of <b>working</b> <b>patterns</b> in terms of organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behaviour and teaching job satisfaction.

40|$|Background: The greater {{participation}} {{of women in}} medicine in recent years, and recent trends showing that doctors of both sexes work fewer hours than in the past, present challenges for medical workforce planning. In this study, we provide {{a detailed analysis of}} the characteristics of doctors who choose to work less-than-full-time (LTFT). We aimed to determine the influence of these characteristics on the probability of working LTFT. Methods: We used data on <b>working</b> <b>patterns</b> obtained from long-term surveys of 10, 866 UK-trained doctors. We analysed <b>working</b> <b>patterns</b> at 10 years post-graduation for doctors of five graduating cohorts, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2002 (i. e. in the years 2003, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2012, respectively). We used multivariable binary logistic regression models to examine the influence of a number of personal and professional characteristics on the likelihood of working LTFT in male and female doctors. Results: Across all cohorts, 42 % of women and 7 % of men worked LTFT. For female doctors, having children significantly increased the likelihood of working LTFT, with greater effects observed for greater numbers of children and for female doctors in non-primary care specialties (non-GPs). While > 40 % of female GPs with children worked LTFT, only 10 % of female surgeons with children did so. Conversely, the presence of children had no effect on male <b>working</b> <b>patterns.</b> Living with a partner increased the odds of LTFT working in women doctors, but decreased the odds of LTFT working in men (independently of children). Women without children were no more likely to work LTFT than were men (with or without children). For both women and men, the highest rates of LTFT working were observed among GPs (~ 10 and 6 times greater than non-GPs, respectively), and among those not in training or senior positions. Conclusions: Family circumstances (children and partner status) affect the <b>working</b> <b>patterns</b> of women and men differently, but both sexes respond similarly to the constraints of their clinical specialty and seniority. Thus, although women doctors comprise the bulk of LTFT workers, gender is just one of several determinants of doctors’ <b>working</b> <b>patterns,</b> and wanting to work LTFT is evidently not solely an issue for working mothers...|$|R

However, if only one <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> is used, network lifetime equals to the time duration until the first node dies. However, due to spatial redundancy of sensors, lifetime can be prolonged by switching among different working patterns subject to energy constraints.

30|$|The results {{indicate}} that the working state of the S-TENG can be separated into two working patterns, based on the quantity of water vapor absorbed by the starch paper. The concept of charge transfer is illustrated, using the state shown in Fig.  2 cII as an example. As shown in Fig.  2 a, in <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> 1, a water film is initially formed around the electrode side of the paper. Nevertheless, the charges are still partly trapped in the irregular water film, forming a potential barrier that hampers the movement of carriers.

A large number of users with these mobile devices promote the formation of the Mobile Crowdsourcing Systems (MCSs). Within a MCS, each mobile device can contribute to the crowdsourcing platform and get rewards from it. In order to achieve better performance, it is important to design a mechanism that can attract enough participants with mobile devices and then allocate the tasks among participants efficiently. In this paper, we are interested in the investigation of tasks allocation and price determination in MCSs. Two truthful auction mechanisms are proposed for different working patterns. A Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) -based auction mechanism is proposed to the continuous <b>working</b> <b>pattern,</b> and a suboptimal auction mechanism is introduced for the discontinuous <b>working</b> <b>pattern.</b> Further analysis shows that the proposed mechanisms have the properties of individual rationality and computational efficiencies.

40|$|The {{patterns}} of paid and unpaid work adopted by migrants {{families with dependent}} children are more or less similar to that of prevailing <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> of men and women of Australian born couples. A case study with 28 couple families, 14 husbands and 14 wives who migrated from Nepal under "skill" or "professional" category and the literature review on paid and unpaid work of couple {{families with dependent children}} show that in both families the trend of change of <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> in paid and unpaid work is similar. With the increased participation of married women in the paid labour force, men increased participation in household work. There is increased household work for both husbands and wives, but women tend to do more household "inside" and childcare work than men. In the mean time, men tend to do more work in the "masculine" sphere of "outside" work in house maintenance, repair and car care. The only factor that differentiates <b>working</b> <b>pattern</b> of migrant families with Australian born families is the experience of migration and the category that they migrated. The change of working practice of paid and unpaid work of migrant families are affected by the change of family type from extended family to two generational family and their education and previous work experience that they brought along with them. Professional migrants who migrated family as a "unit" migrated spouse and dependent children together and they made their own decision to migrate, unlike other categories of migrants who migrated from political or economic pressure. One of the important experiences of migrant families is that there are new opportunity, new lifestyle, new intimacy and companionship and new sharing of work between husbands and wives after migration. At the same time, there are losses of extended family relatives, close friends and cultural event which affects their day to day lives. There are Australian based friends who provided support in the initial period of migration but these families do not provide regular assistance or support which family relatives provided in Nepal...|$|E
