5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and {{projecting}} out from the gate to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The gates themselves were normally wooden <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises. Postern gates were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|E
5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood.
