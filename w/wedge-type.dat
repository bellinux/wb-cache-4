50|$|Wedges {{can also}} be used to hold objects in place, such as engine parts (poppet valves), bicycle parts (stems and {{eccentric}} bottom brackets), and doors. A <b>wedge-type</b> door stop (door wedge) functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door and the wedge, and the wedge and the floor (or other surface).|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the head of a Kuchi dog can vary from a <b>wedge-type</b> head, to brick-type, or bear-type skull, the last one being {{associated}} mainly with the dogs of the mountain variety. Their tails are usually docked by about one-third of their length, and usually point straight up or at a slight angle. Traditionally, their ears are cropped, almost to the very base.|$|E
50|$|The DANA's primary {{weapon is}} a 152 mm {{howitzer}} with a monolithic barrel (with a fixed rifling pitch) {{equipped with a}} single expansion chamber. The howitzer has a semi-automatic, vertically-sliding <b>wedge-type</b> breech which opens to the left side. The recoil assembly consists of a hydraulic buffer, two pneumatic return cylinders and a controlling plunger which governs the displacement of the buffering system. The gun laying is carried out by an electro-hydraulic drive system or an emergency manual control.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, American {{inventor}} Jacob Rabinow {{developed a}} light-sensitive automatic {{mechanism for the}} <b>wedge-type</b> day/night mirror. Several Chrysler Corporation cars offered these automatic mirrors as optional equipment as early as 1959, but few customers ordered them for their cars and the item was soon withdrawn from the option lists. Several automakers began offering rear-view mirrors with automatic dimming again in 1983, {{and it was in}} the late 1980s that they began to catch on in popularity.|$|E
5000|$|Some state {{agencies}} recommend an installation technique called [...] "static slicing" [...] as an improved method for ensuring effectiveness and longevity of a silt fence system on a construction site. The technique involves inserting a narrow blade {{into the soil}} with a <b>wedge-type</b> point on its tip to slightly disrupt the soil upward, while simultaneously inserting the silt fence fabric into the slot with a moving pivot, while the machine is moving forward. This step is followed by mechanical soil compaction, setting of fence posts, and attaching the fabric.|$|E
50|$|Whereas the RE used {{a complex}} stepped frame on bus variants. Seddon {{decided to use}} a {{straight}} frame using 8in channel longitudinals and mainly tubular cross-members which was oriented to rise from front to rear at about 5 degrees from the horizontal. Wheelbases offered were either 16 ft 6in for 33 ft coachwork or 18 ft 6in for 36 ft bodies. Instead of the complex drive-line arrangement of the RE a straightforward T-drive layout was employed. The rear end of the 10.45-litre Gardner 6HLX (the 8.6 litre 6HLW was optional) was mounted below and hard against the rear cross member on the short version, driving directly via a fluid flywheel into a Self-Changing Gears 4 or 5-speed direct-operating epicyclic gearbox, air-operated with electrical control. The Eaton spiral-bevel rear axle, {{to a variety of}} different final drive ratios, was just ahead of the power pack and a very short drive shaft was fitted with resilient rubber-based joints. Originally on the long-wheelbase version a similar arrangement was employed but with the engine further {{from the rear of the}} frame. Conventional leaf springs were used, but the spring shackle-pins were fitted with polyurethane bushes, which would not require greasing and so reduce maintenance costs. The braking was full air-operated using Girling <b>wedge-type</b> drum brakes. A spring operated air parking-brake was employed, power steering for the Seddon-designed front-axle was optionally available. Unlike the RE and the Leyland Panther the radiator was not carried at the front but hung from the offside of the chassis in mid-wheelbase, ahead of the rear axle. A combined saloon heating and ventilation system with a thermostatically-controlled heat-exchanger and reversible fan drive was announced but this was never made available to customers.|$|E

30|$|The anti-warp {{performance}} of a bogie equipped with a <b>wedge-type</b> damper was poor and would worsen after wedge wear, which {{would result in a}} poor riding index and damping force reliability [13]. The normal force of the friction pair of the <b>wedge-type</b> bogie is equal to that of the lever-type bogie with the same φ, where the width of {{the upper end of the}} lever is the same as the wedge.

30|$|To {{overcome}} defects {{caused by}} the complex structure and unstable damping performance of the <b>wedge-type</b> damper, a new lever-type friction damper has been developed for use in freight bogies; the design allows the advantages of traditional three-piece bogies to be retained. A {{detailed description of the}} structure and mechanism of the lever-type damper is provided, followed by a stress analysis using the finite element method. Dynamic performance characteristics of the lever-type damper and the <b>wedge-type</b> damper are compared in terms of the nonlinear critical speed, riding index, and curve negotiation. The results indicate that the maximum stress of the lever remains below its yield limit. The lever-type car has higher running performance reliability, and achieves similar nonlinear critical speed, riding index, and curve negotiation when compared with the <b>wedge-type</b> car.|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 66 A high efficiency, {{single-stage}} pipeline centrifugal gas compressor, {{originally designed}} with a <b>wedge-type</b> vaned diffuser, was retrofitted with a vaneless diffuser {{along with two}} low solidity diffuser configurations {{in order to improve}} the operating flow range. The low solidity diffuser configurations included a flat-plate design and an airfoil-type design. The vaneless and flat-plate low solidity diffusers were derived from the existing <b>wedge-type</b> vaned diffuser, while the airfoil-type low solidity diffuser was designed specifically to match the existing impeller, but within the design envelope available for retrofit purposes. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to establish impeller discharge conditions, analyze candidate diffusers, and provide some guidance as to the expected operating range improvement. Both factory and field testing were conducted to verify the performance of the diffuser configurations. Test results indicated that the airfoiltype low solidity diffuser had the best overall efficiency and operating flow range combination, with one percent and 22 percent improvements, respectively, when compared to the <b>wedge-type</b> vaned diffuser...|$|E
40|$|Siphon {{dredging}} with a float {{tank and}} different siphon suction heads, including the plain-type and <b>wedge-type</b> with/without side holes, through flume experiments {{were used to}} investigate the reservoir sediment removal efficiency. The experiment revealed maximum suction pressure and velocity when {{the distance from the}} suction head to the bed was about 25 % of suction head diameter. Suction pressure decreased rapidly as the distance from the suction head to the bed increased to 50 % and 100 % of suction head diameter. Suction pressure achieved by <b>wedge-type</b> suction head was only 16. 9 - 17. 6 % of that around plain-type suction head, and the velocity around <b>wedge-type</b> suction head was 64. 7 - 68. 4 % of that around plain-type suction head. However the plain-type suction head was easily clogged doe to its long bobbing period. The average bobbing period for the plain-type suction head was about 105 - 263 % that of the <b>wedge-type</b> suction head. The sediment removal efficiency was achieved when float tank diameter was 3 - 4 times that of the suction head. Flow discharge and sediment removal increased as the suction head diameter and side hole diameter increased, respectively. The most efficient side hole area was an area within 15 % of suction head area. Totally, the optimal sediment removal efficiency was the wedge angle of 20 degrees with 3 side holes. The efficiency of sediment dredging by siphon suction with a suction tube passing through the dam bottom was better than that with suction passing {{over the top of the}} dam. The <b>wedge-type</b> siphon suction with a float tank is preferable for sediment dredging in small reservoirs because it is inexpensive and efficient...|$|E

40|$|This is an {{exploratory}} study of jet noise reduction using fan flow deflectors in a nozzle shaped like the exhaust of a separate-flow turbofan engine with bypass ratio 4. 8. The deflectors directed the bypass plume downward and/or sideward {{relative to the}} core plume. Vane-and <b>wedge-type</b> deflectors were tested. The noise reduction achieved by the vane deflector was strong in the downward direction and moderate in the sideline direction. <b>Wedge-type</b> deflectors generated significant attenuation in both directions. Combination of vanes and wedge yielded the best results. The effective perceived noise level was suppressed by 5. 5 dB in flyover mode and 3. 8 dB in sideline mode...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the intensive erosion of tungsten brush-type armour structures that face the plasma in divertor fusion reactors. Surface erosion caused by multiple transient events (ELMs, disruption, etc.) {{could lead to the}} formation of a corrugated <b>wedge-type</b> shape. Our analysis shows that the augmentation of surface roughness increases the electric field at the vicinity of the <b>wedge-type</b> tips, thus enabling the formation of electric arcs. Specifically, under reactor conditions, the breakdown of the sheath potential may trigger unipolar arcs that will strongly contaminate the plasma with the resulting tungsten ions. We show that the erosion caused by arcs is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that caused by DT ion sputtering and comparable with that caused by self-sputtering...|$|E
