5|$|At 02:30 on 26 March, the {{regiment}} {{set out from}} Dier El Belah towards Gaza. The division was to circle the town, cutting off any escape route east and provide a blocking force to stop Turkish reinforcements, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division and a brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division carried out a frontal assault. Positioned at the Humra mound in the east with the 4th and 11th Squadrons, {{the regiment}} was assigned to watch for Turkish reinforcement coming from Huj. The main attack was not progressing well, so the brigade, {{along with the rest}} of the division, was ordered to attack Gaza. Still <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Turkish reinforcements, the regiment was held in reserve. The brigade had made good progress and was inside the town when it was ordered to withdraw. Less the 4th Squadron, which was the division's rearguard, the regiment had returned to Dier El Belah by early the next day.|$|E
5|$|Wrecking Racing {{was meant}} to enable {{a broad range of}} strategies, such as keeping up but <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{destruction}} opportunities, destroying the cars in front, and destroying everything without concern for position. This was hard to balance, but it proved possible to win with each of those strategies. Edmondson came up with Stock Car Racing after watching the Banger World Finals at Arena Essex and noticing that there were some cars simply racing rather than trying to destroy each other. The normal race mode was implemented simply because the engine could support running a traditional race. For Destruction Derby mode, more varied arenas were implemented {{to take advantage of a}} new physics system developed by Reflections. Edmondson decided against implementing features such as speed boosts and collectibles because he did not want the game to feel like an arcade game and wanted the car physics to be as realistic as possible. Destruction Derby 2 was released on the PlayStation in 1996, and a PC version soon followed. The next instalment in the Destruction Derby series, Destruction Derby Raw, was released in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Some {{pistol shrimp}} species share burrows with goby fishes in a {{symbiotic}} relationship. The burrow is built and tended by the pistol shrimp, and the goby provides protection by <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> danger. When both {{are out of}} the burrow, the shrimp maintains contact with the goby using its antennae. The goby, having the better vision, alerts the shrimp of danger using a characteristic tail movement, and then both retreat into the safety of the shared burrow. So far this association has been observed in species that inhabit coral reef habitats.|$|E
25|$|The Safety Patrol (also {{known as}} Road Rangers, and {{currently}} sponsored by State Farm) offers free roadside assistance on Florida's Turnpike mainline and Homestead Extension. Utility trucks patrol one of 12 designated zones looking for stranded motorists {{to provide services}} such as fuel, tire changes, use of a cellular phone; and also <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> crashes and road debris. The Traffic Management Center dispatches them to accidents, debris removal, disabled vehicles, or anything that may potentially affect the traveling public; they also assist the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) with traffic maintenance with incidents involving blockage of lanes.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the big}} {{activities}} is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher {{than some of the}} highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts {{to make it to the}} top of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak time for this is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding another break in the weather, but there is more snow then. Some technology for climbing include crampons, fixed ropes, various cold-weather gear, bottled oxygen, and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical, one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid. In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges like not offending the locals and <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers remain unexpected avalanches (this claimed many in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and that classic climbing danger- falling. For a price, permits are available from China in the Tibet region and from Nepal and there is a multitude of mountaineering firms world over operating on the mountain.|$|E

An acquaintance recommended she send her work to WomaNews, a feminist newspaper, which published her first work in its June 1983 issue. Bechdel gradually moved from her early single-panel drawings to multi-paneled strips. [...] Dykes to <b>Watch</b> <b>Out</b> <b>For</b> began this process, developing {{into a series of}} posters and postcards, allowing for people to have a look into the urban lesbian community. After a year, other outlets began running the strip.|$|R

500|$|The initial premise for {{the series}} was to examine what superheroes would be like [...] "in a credible, real world". As the story became more complex, Moore said Watchmen became about [...] "power and {{about the idea of}} the superman {{manifest}} within society." [...] The title of the series refers to the question [...] "Who watches the watchmen?", famously posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal (as [...] "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until Harlan Ellison informed him. Moore commented in 1987, [...] "In the context of Watchmen, that fits. 'They're <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> us, who's <b>watching</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> them? The writer stated in the introduction to the Graphitti hardcover of Watchmen that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.|$|E
