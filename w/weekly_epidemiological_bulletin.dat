40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} {{the increase in}} cases of malaria in Mozambique. METHODS Cross-sectional study conducted in 2014, in Mozambique with national <b>weekly</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>bulletin</b> data. I analyzed the number of recorded cases in the 2009 - 2013 period, {{which led to the}} creation of an endemic channel using the quartile and C-Sum methods. Monthly incidence rates were calculated for the first half of 2014, making it possible to determine the pattern of endemicity. Months in which the incidence rates exceeded the third quartile or line C-sum were declared as epidemic months. RESULTS The provinces of Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, and Inhambane accounted for 52. 7 % of all cases in the first half of 2014. Also during this period, the provinces of Nampula, Sofala and Tete were responsible for 54. 9 % of the deaths from malaria. The incidence rates of malaria in children, and in all ages, have showed patterns in the epidemic zone. For all ages, the incidence rate has peaked in April (2, 573 cases/ 100, 000 inhabitants). CONCLUSIONS The results suggest the occurrence of an epidemic pattern of malaria in the first half of 2014 in Mozambique. It is strategic to have a more accurate surveillance at all levels (central, provincial and district) to target prevention and control interventions in a timely manner...|$|E
40|$|Background: Timeliness of {{a public}} health {{surveillance}} system (SS) {{is one of its}} most important characteristics. In Europe the epidemiological surveillance of influenza is supported by general practitioners (GP) sentinel networks and, <b>weekly,</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>bulletins</b> are issued between Wednesday and Friday, reporting the previous week observed influenza values, representing a 2 to 4 days reporting delay. Some SS use web interfaces or computer routines that can provide up to date daily data streams accessing the current situation. The process of predicting the present week situation using the available incomplete information from the SS has received the term nowcasting and has high public health interest. Objective: Develop a statistical model to nowcast the influenza epidemic evolution in a weekly basis, by predicting two measures of interest: the current week influenza-like illness (ILI) rate (officially issued in the following week) and the probability that the influenza activity is epidemic. Methods: A two states (epidemic/non-epidemic) non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (HMM) is used, where the current week ILI rate is a function of an early observation of the ILI rate obtained by Friday of this week. The state-transition probabilities are modeled by a logistic function of the Friday ILI rate and of the number of ILI cases tested positive in the previous week. For comparison purposes a homogeneous HMM is also applied to the data. Bayesian inference is used to find estimates of the model parameters and of the nowcasted quantities. The models are applied to data provided by the Portuguese influenza SS for seasons 2008 - 09 up to 2010 - 11 to nowcast in real-time each week of the season 2010 - 11. Results: The non-homogenous HMM presents the best fit and is able to indentify four epidemic waves in the studied period, one in 2008 - 09 and 2010 - 11 and two in the pandemic season. Regarding the nowcast, the weekly ILI rates of season 2010 - 11 are predicted during the same week in a very satisfactory way, given that the estimates start to increase, reach the peak and decrease in synchrony with the observed rate (this reduces the reporting delay in 5 days). The non-homogenous model is able to detect the epidemic start two weeks before the homogeneous one. Conclusion: The present work shows the additional value of the non-homogeneous HMM to nowcast the ILI rate and the influenza activity state...|$|R

We reviewed core health indicators {{in the public domain}} and in-country for Sierra Leone, the African continent and globally. Review objectives included assessing available sources, accessibility and feasibility of obtaining data and informing efforts to monitor program progress. Our search strategy was guided by feasibility considerations targeting mainly national household surveys in Sierra Leone and topic-specific and health statistics reports published annually by WHO. We also included national, regional and worldwide health indicator estimates published with open access in the literature and compared them with cumulative annual indicators from the <b>weekly</b> national <b>epidemiological</b> <b>bulletin</b> distributed by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation. We obtained 70 indicators for Sierra Leone from Internet sources and 2 (maternal mortality and malaria incidence) from the national bulletin. Of the 70 indicators, 14 (20 %) were modified versions of WHO indicators and provided uncertainty intervals. Maternal mortality showed considerable differences between 2 international sources for 2015 and the most recent national bulletin. We were able to obtain the majority of core indicators for Sierra Leone. Some indicators were similar but not identical, uncertainty intervals were limited and estimates differed for the same year between sources. Current efforts to improve health and mortality surveillance in Sierra Leone will improve availability and quality of reporting in the future.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Internet-based biosurveillance {{systems have}} been {{developed}} to detect health threats using information available on the Internet, but system performance has not been assessed relative to end-user needs and perspectives. METHOD AND FINDINGS: Infectious disease events from the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS) <b>weekly</b> international <b>epidemiological</b> <b>bulletin</b> published in 2010 were used to construct the gold-standard official dataset. Data from six biosurveillance systems were used to detect raw signals (infectious disease events from informal Internet sources) : Argus, BioCaster, GPHIN, HealthMap, MedISys and ProMED-mail. Crude detection rates (C-DR), crude sensitivity rates (C-Se) and intrinsic sensitivity rates (I-Se) were calculated from multivariable regressions to evaluate the systems' performance (events detected compared to the gold-standard) 472 raw signals (Internet disease reports) related to the 86 events included in the gold-standard data set were retrieved from the six systems. 84 events were detected before their publication in the gold-standard. The type of sources utilised by the systems varied significantly (p< 0001). I-Se varied significantly from 43 % to 71 % (p= 0001) whereas other indicators were similar (C-DR: p= 020; C-Se, p= 013). I-Se was significantly associated with individual systems, types of system, languages, regions of occurrence, and types of infectious disease. Conversely, no statistical difference of C-DR was observed after adjustment for other variables. CONCLUSION: Although differences could result from a biosurveillance system's conceptual design, findings suggest that the combined expertise amongst systems enhances early detection performance for detection of infectious diseases. While all systems showed similar early detection performance, systems including human moderation were found to have a 53 % higher I-Se (p= 00001) after adjustment for other variables. Overall, the use of moderation, sources, languages, regions of occurrence, and types of cases were found to influence system performance...|$|R

The medians of confirmed cases for dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis and rickettsia were 3, 0 and 14, respectively. The gradual surge of dengue fever was noted since October 2001 and persisted for 7 months. Rickettsia infection had the same tendency and persisted for even five months. Analysis of the run charts revealed that there were no endemic episodes of Japanese encephalitis after Nari. For dengue fever, there were two surges; that is, one being the period from August 2000 to November 2000, the other being the period from October 2001 to April 2002. According to the analysis of the curve, the latter surge was statistically significant. There were also two surges over the observation period for rickettsia infection. The first one was during May 2000 to January 2001, whereas the second one during November 2001 to March 2002. However, neither of the surges met the criteria of significance. In conclusion, the floods due to Nari actually brought the endemic outbreaks of dengue fever. Vector control remains an important issue for post- flood disease surveillance. (Ann.

40|$|Abstract Background: Drugs’ {{pharmacokinetics}} and pharmacodynamics can {{be affected}} by diverse genetic variations, within which simple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common. Genetic variability {{is one of the}} factors that could explain questions like why a given drug does not have the desired effect or why do adverse drug reactions arise. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, literature search limits were set within PubMed database as well as the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>bulletins</b> published by the Mexican Ministry of Health, from Jan 1 st 2001 to Mar 31 st 2017 (16 years). Results: Metabolism of antiparasitic drugs and their interindividual responses are mainly modified by variations in cytochrome P 450 enzymes. These enzymes show high frequencies of polymorphic variability thus affecting the expression of CYP 2 C, CYP 2 A, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 E 6 and CYP 2 A 6 isoforms. Research in this field opens the door to new personalized treatment approaches in medicine. Conclusion: Clinical and pharmacological utility yield by applying pharmacogenetics to antiparasitic treatments is not intended as a mean to improve the prescription process, but to select or exclude patients that could present adverse drug reactions as well as to evaluate genetic alterations which result in a diversity of responses, ultimately seeking to provide a more effective and safe treatment; therefore choosing a proper dose for the appropriate patient and the optimal treatment duration. Furthermore, pharmacogenetics assists in the development of vaccines. In other words, the aim of this discipline is to find therapeutic targets allowing personalized treatments. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{epidemiological}} behavior of dengue {{in the state}} of Ceara and the control of Aedes aegypti. Methods: This is a documentary study that used as data source the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>bulletins</b> published by the Ceara State Department of Health and other complementary documents from 1986 to 2011. A descriptive analysis of the incidence of dengue in this period was carried out according to age, severe forms, deaths and circulation of DEN-V virus. The study analyzed the vector control program and the evolution of infestation and dengue transmission in the same period. Results: It was found that, from 1986 to 2011, Ceara had five dengue epidemics with high incidence rates, and from 2008 to 2010, children were the most affected group. On average, there was Aedes aegypti infestation in 120 municipalities and transmission in 84 of them annually. The circulation of more than one serotype resulted in a large number of deaths almost every year, more than that estimated by the World Health Organization. Conclusion: The epidemiological behavior of dengue in Ceara justifies the classification made by the Ministry of Health that acknowledges the State as a Very High Risk-area with vulnerability to the disease. In recent years, the rate of severe cases has increased, probably because of the simultaneous circulation of three serotypes and the population’s sensitization due to previous infections. This situation is aggravated by the vector presence in nearly the entire State and a deficient vector control policy. doi: 10. 5020 / 18061230. 2013. p 34...|$|R

We formulate a compartmental mathematical model with periodic slow-fast transmission rate to study such recurrent occurrences and fitted the model to cumulative cholera cases and deaths for different provinces of Zimbabwe from the beginning of cholera outbreak in 2008 - 09 to June 2011.

However, no study examines how temporal cycles of the disease vary around the world or reviews its hypothesized causes. This paper reviews {{the literature on the}} seasonality of cholera and describes its temporal cycles by compiling and analyzing 32 years of global cholera data. This paper also provides a detailed literature review on regional patterns and environmental and climatic drivers of cholera patterns. Data, Methods, and Results Cholera data are compiled from 1974 to 2005 from the World Health Organization <b>Weekly</b> <b>Epidemiological</b> Reports, a database that includes all reported cholera cases in 140 countries. The data are analyzed to measure whether season, latitude, and their interaction are significantly associated with the country-level number of outbreaks in each of the 12 preceding months using separate negative binomial regression models for northern, southern, and combined hemispheres. Likelihood ratios tests are used to determine the model of best fit. The results suggest that cholera outbreaks demonstrate seasonal patterns in higher absolute latitudes, but closer to the equator, cholera outbreaks do not follow a clear seasonal pattern. Conclusion The findings suggest that environmental and climatic factors partially control the temporal variability of cholera. These results also indirectly contribute to the growing debate about the effects of climate change and global warming. As climate change threatens to increase global temperature, resulting rises in sea levels and temperatures may influence the temporal fluctuations of cholera, potentially increasing the frequency and duration of cholera outbreaks. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{is little}} {{information}} about influenza disease among the Cambodian population. To {{better understand the}} dynamics of influenza in Cambodia, the Cambodian National Influenza Center (NIC) was established in August 2006. To continuously monitor influenza activity, a hospital based sentinel surveillance system for ILI (influenza like illness) with a weekly reporting and sampling scheme was established in five sites in 2006. In addition, hospital based surveillance of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) cases was established in 2 sites. Methods The sentinel sites collect <b>weekly</b> <b>epidemiological</b> data on ILI patients fulfilling the case definition, and take naso-pharyngeal specimens from a defined number of cases per week. The samples are tested in the Virology Unit at the Institut Pasteur in Phnom Penh. From each sample viral RNA was extracted and amplified by a multiplex RT-PCR detecting simultaneously influenza A and influenza B virus. Influenza A viruses were then subtyped and analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Samples collected by the ALRI system were tested with the same approach. Results From 2006 to 2008, influenza circulation was observed mainly from June to December, with a clear seasonal peak in October shown in the data from 2008. Conclusion Influenza activity in Cambodia occurred during the rainy season, from June to December, and ended before the cool season (extending usually from December to February). Although Cambodia is a tropical country geographically located in the northern hemisphere, influenza activity has a southern hemisphere transmission pattern. Together with the antigenic analysis of the circulating strains, {{it is now possible}} to give better influenza vaccination recommendation for Cambodia. </p...|$|R

A footnote to the WHA resolution explained that elimination was to be defined in this context as a reduction in prevalence below 1 per 10 000. This is important. Prevalence at any point in time (e. g. 31 December) is a function of duration, as well as of incidence, and the primary strategy of the initiative has been to reduce preva-lence by reducing treatment duration through the institution of short-course multiple-drug regimens. It was also hoped that use of these shorter-term and more-effective drug regimens would reduce infection transmission, and thus effectively reduce incidence of infec-tion and ultimately of disease. The programme has had a massive effect on reported prevalence. Accord-ing to data submitted to WHO — the global figures are presented annually in the <b>Weekly</b> <b>Epidemiological</b> Record (WER), most recently in August 2006 — the elimination target was reached globally (using the total human popu-lation as a denominator) in 2000, {{and by the end of}} 2005 all but six countries reported year-end prevalence below 1 per 10 000. That much is a success. However, if one looks closely at the published data, it is not clear what has actually happened...|$|R
40|$|Immunisation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} public health interventions, saving between two and three million lives worldwide annually. In addition, an extra two million lives could be saved with the introduction of vaccines such as meningococcal, pneumoccocal and rotavirus vaccines. Each year, 2. 5 million children worldwide still die of diseases that can be prevented with vaccination [1]. While many new vaccines will soon be on the market, several challenges still remain concerning the existing vaccines and immunisation policies, even in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region where vaccination uptake at the national level is generally high, with rates over 90 % [2]. However, these figures conceal the fact that many vaccinations are not administered in a timely way – i. e. according to the recommended national vaccination schedules – as well as the disparities in vaccination coverage at subnational levels. Both factors increase the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles; and indeed outbreaks of measles have again been occurring in western Europe since 2006 [3]. Regardless of the European country there are pockets of susceptible populations, contributing to an estimated 600, 000 children (based on the coverage rates) in the Region, that miss their routine vaccination annually. These susceptible populations, which include certain ethnic and religious minorities as well as some migrant populations, are not vaccinated because they often lack the knowledge about the importance of immunisation or access to the services. In some extreme cases, the willingness to vaccinate is influenced by an unfounded scepticism among parents [4] about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, fuelled by anti-vaccination movements with dubious motives. These issues were recently pointed out in editorials published in Vaccine [5], the <b>Weekly</b> <b>Epidemiological</b> Record [6] and the European Journal of Public Health [7], which addressed the importance and the future of immunisation in Europe, and clearly stated the need to keep timely immunisation high on the agenda and boost routine immunisation programmes...|$|R
40|$|Typhoid fever, {{caused by}} Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), remains {{a major cause}} of enteric disease and a {{significant}} public health problem, predominantly in children in developing countries. Global estimates of typhoid fever range from 17 to 22 million cases per year with an associated 216, 000 to 600, 000 deaths annually [1, 2]. This lower estimate is based on a conservative case fatality rate of 1 %, (CRF range varies from 1 % to 4 %); yet the number of typhoid-related deaths each year is comparable to that of other diseases that are considered top priorities for disease control in the global health community, including cervical cancer caused by HPV, and is greater than others such as Japanese encephalitis and meningococcal meningitis. The continued high burden of typhoid fever and the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant strains led the World Health Organization (WHO), almost ten years ago, to recommend immunization using the two new-generation vaccines in school-aged children in areas where typhoid fever posed a significant problem and where antibiotic resistant strains were prevalent [3]. Nevertheless, with the exception of certain provinces in China, parts of Vietnam and one state in India, this recommendation has yet to be implemented in typhoid-endemic countries. Several reasons have been given for this lack of uptake of typhoid vaccination in endemic countries, including those gleaned from a survey of policymakers in Asia conducted in 2000 - 2001 [4]. Most critically, many developing countries were uncertain of their true typhoid disease burden, {{due to the lack of}} inexpensive rapid diagnostic tools, infrequency of laboratory testing, poor disease reporting systems, and the fact that the clinical diagnosis of the disease is often confused with other febrile illnesses. In some countries, there has also been political pressure for local government officials not to report typhoid cases, since they are considered an indicator of inadequate or failing water and sanitation systems. There has also been a sense of complacency created by the introduction of relatively inexpensive antibiotics several decades ago, which were effective in substantially reducing typhoid-related deaths, but which have progressively become ineffective due to the acquisition of antibiotic resistance by the bacterium. In addition, with some exceptions, typhoid tends not to cause major epidemics that command the public’s attention, but extracts its toll of morbidity and mortality as an endemic illness. Other barriers to greater public sector use of these vaccines include: the relatively high prices of the vaccines on the world market, although this situation is now changing; a preference among policymakers for water and sanitation improvements over vaccination to control many enteric diseases; a lack of awareness among many policymakers about the new-generation vaccines; and uncertainty of the logistic feasibility of mass vaccination of children outside the infant EPI schedule in their countries. Furthermore, the peak age group for typhoid in many settings is from 5 to 15 years, which falls outside of the under-five year age group that has been the focus of most international public health efforts on vaccines. New data from Asia on the disease and economic burden of typhoid fever, recent trends in antibiotic resistance, and vaccine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, along with the increased availability of typhoid vaccines and sharp reductions in their price, led WHO to review, update and reinforce its recommendations for the use of typhoid vaccines for populations at high risk, so that this disease can truly be controlled in countries where it remains a significant public health problem [5]. Field studies have provided new data on the magnitude of typhoid disease, especially in Asia, including incidence rates, age distribution patterns and trends in antibiotic resistance of S. Typhi, as well as on the economic burden of the disease. Children in poor urban areas in Asia remain at high risk of getting typhoid fever. Prospective disease burden studies in five Asian study sites found annual incidence rates of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever of 180 - 494 / 100, 000 among 5 - 15 year olds in three urban slum areas (North Jakarta, Indonesia; Kolkata, India; and Karachi, Pakistan) [6]. Rates of more than 100 / 100, 000 are considered very high. While these studies confirm that school-aged children are at particularly high risk, pre-school children as young as two years old were shown to also be highly vulnerable with incidence rates that were as high as these. Studies on the incidence and burden of disease of typhoid in Africa are relatively sparse, in large part because of the limited availability of clinical bacteriology laboratories to perform blood cultures, and lack of inexpensive reliable rapid laboratory diagnostic tools. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicate that the disease is prevalent across much of the continent. Data exist from a few population-based surveys and systematic hospital-based studies carried out in Africa, including sub-Sahara Africa. Typhoid has been described as a major health problem in school children in Egypt, Rwanda, Kenya and South Africa. In addition, multidrug resistant strains of S. Typhi have emerged in Africa and are increasing in incidence with 75 - 82 % multidrug resistant strains reported in Kenya. This figure is similar to reports from South Africa, although higher than that reported from Ghana. Nevertheless, MDR strains have been reported from East, West and southern Africa. The three studies examining typhoid fever and invasive salmonellosis in Ethiopia, Malawi and Kenya in this edition are extremely important in bridging this gap in knowledge of typhoid fever in the African continent. The burden of disease of typhoid and non-typhoidal Salmonella is not well understood in the region and further efforts are required to elucidate the epidemiology, burden of disease, and strain variation in Africa of these pathogens. Finally, large vaccine demonstration studies in typhoid-endemic countries of Asia have yielded data on the effectiveness of Vi vaccine; the feasibility, acceptability and costs of large-scale community- or school-based vaccination; and the population demand for new-generation typhoid vaccines. Demonstration projects using Vi vaccine and Ty 21 a have shown large-scale community- and school-based vaccination to be feasible and well accepted by populations in endemic countries. Evidence from China suggests that the programmatic use of Vi vaccine in selected areas largely controlled the disease within a four- to five-year period, reducing incidence to very low levels. Experience in China has also shown that Vi vaccination is equally effective in controlling currently occurring typhoid outbreaks as it is in reducing endemic disease. Typhoid incidence varies considerably within countries, underscoring the fact that typhoid control, including vaccination, can focus on high-risk populations instead of being universally applied within countries. The WHO recommendations for the use of typhoid fever vaccines are described in the recent “Typhoid Vaccines Position Paper” [5]. These include recommendations that in view of the continued high incidence of typhoid fever and increasing antibiotic resistance, and given the safety, efficacy, feasibility and affordability of two licensed vaccines (Vi and Ty 21 a), affected countries should consider programmatic use of typhoid vaccines for controlling endemic disease. In addition, all typhoid vaccination programmes should be implemented in the context of other efforts to control the disease, including health education, water quality and sanitation improvements, and training of health professionals in diagnosis and treatment. Finally, in many countries, the control of the disease will require only vaccination targeted to high-risk groups and populations, as opposed to universal vaccination of the population. Given the importance of information on disease incidence for informing and alerting policy and decision makers, and for targeting vaccination campaigns and assessing impact, priority should be given to strengthening surveillance systems for typhoid fever and to generating robust data on the disease.
