5|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: students were not graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island <b>with</b> <b>students</b> to demonstrate the development of capitalism.
