5|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia. Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba. It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices. For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al. have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and <b>wine</b> <b>tasting</b> is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{historical}} anecdotes that have related to food and wine pairing before modern times. One anecdote often attributed to British wine merchants is [...] "Buy on an apple and sell on cheese" [...] meaning that if a <b>wine</b> <b>tastes</b> good when paired with a raw, uncooked apple it must be truly good and pairing any wine with cheese will make it more palatable to the average consumer and easier to sell. The principles behind this anecdote lies in the food pairing properties of both fruit and cheeses. Fruits that are high in sugar and acidity (such as the malic acid in green apples) can make <b>wines</b> <b>taste</b> metallic and thin bodied. In contrast, hard cheeses such as cheddar can soften the tannins in wines and make them taste fuller and fruitier.|$|R

25|$|Detecting an aroma is {{only part}} of <b>wine</b> <b>tasting.</b> The next step is to {{describe}} or communicate what that aroma is and it is in this step that the subjective nature of <b>wine</b> <b>tasting</b> appears.

Furthermore, there are varying levels of sensitivity and recognition thresholds among humans of some aromatic compounds.

25|$|<b>Wine</b> <b>tasting</b> (often, in wine circles, simply tasting) is {{the sensory}} {{examination}} {{and evaluation of}} wine. While the practice of <b>wine</b> <b>tasting</b> is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology {{which is used to}} describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.|$|E
