2500|$|During {{landfill}} operations a scale or weighbridge may weigh <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{on arrival}} and personnel may inspect loads for wastes {{that do not}} accord with the landfill's waste-acceptance criteria. Afterward, the <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>vehicles</b> use the existing road network {{on their way to}} the tipping face or working front, where they unload their contents. After loads are deposited, compactors or bulldozers can spread and compact the waste on the working face. Before leaving the landfill boundaries, the <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>vehicles</b> may pass through a wheel-cleaning facility. If necessary, they return to the weighbridge for re-weighing without their load. The weighing process can assemble statistics on the daily incoming waste tonnage, which databases can retain for record keeping. In addition to trucks, some landfills may have equipment to handle railroad containers. The use of [...] "rail-haul" [...] permits landfills to be located at more remote sites, without the problems associated with many truck trips.|$|R

40|$|Under {{the current}} waste {{legislation}} in both European Union and Czech Republic, material recovery is preferred over {{other types of}} municipal solid waste treatment. However, <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> systems have negative environmental impacts. This thesis deals with modeling and optimization of <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> routes, which should lower their impact. The model makes use of the ArcGIS software system and operations research to optimize routes. Inputs of the model are {{the amount of waste}} produced in the region, locations of the final facilities, and their capacities. The amount of waste produced per district was estimated to be the portion of total waste produced corresponding to the number of inhabitants of given district. Final facilities are the assorting lines. Distances between districts and final facilities were computed by Network Analyst Extension of ArcGIS. The index method assigns the assorting lines to districts in a way that minimizes total distance traveled by <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>vehicles,</b> while respecting the capacity of the assorting lines. Outputs are <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> routes and the distance, per waste type, traveled by the <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The model allows changing the input data to observe changes in the <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> system.
