5|$|Haynes and {{his wife}} toured the American West after his retirement, indulging {{themselves}} while searching for a permanent residence. Some of the general's friends suggested Wichita Falls, the city of his last military post, but he left to assess the possibility of living in Taos, New Mexico, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> airman son hiked and explored ancient human settlements. Deciding against Taos, Haynes {{and his wife}} continued in their tour, soon finding Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to their liking. There, he bought two adjoining lots on North Carmelo Street with one existing house. Rather than accepting any of the offers he received promising an executive career in the aeronautics industry, he relaxed by hunting and fishing.|$|E
5|$|He {{funded the}} {{formation}} of a Young Men's Christian Association in Kokomo <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> son became active.

5|$|In 1893, Rush {{moved his}} family to Sydney. The Banks Crash reduced many Australian {{businessmen}} to ruin, Rush included. His business was built on credit alone: Rush did not even own the Grafton house <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family lived, having mortgaged it {{from the man who}} sold it to him. He borrowed from local banks, using his store-keeping business as security. In Sydney, Rush took a lease on the York Hotel, at the corner of King and York Streets, which quickly became known as 'Mick Rush's Hotel', a popular venue for meetings of sportsmen. During the next decade, Rush kept several hotels in the city of Sydney, and operated also as a hotel broker.|$|E

5|$|Reubens spent a {{significant}} amount of his childhood in Oneonta, New York. As a child, Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota. The circus's atmosphere sparked Reubens' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy, which made him want to make people laugh. At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> siblings would put on plays.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completing}} his studies, Ravalomanana returned to Manjakandriana District, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family began making and selling homemade yogurts, a common artisanal {{product in the}} highlands region.

He opened his first yogurt and cheese production center in 1977 in Sambaina on land he named Rova-Tiko ("Tiko Palace"), where he would build the first Tiko factory several years later. His wife handled the administrative and accounting {{side of the business}} from Ankadivato, where the storage facility for finished products was located.

5|$|A diabetic, Keenor {{suffered}} from disabilities {{stemming from a}} hard-living lifestyle {{that may have been}} a consequence of his tough upbringing. Following his retirement from football, he found it difficult to find work due to his ill-health and it became increasingly hard to earn money. Supporters of his former club Cardiff City held a collection during one league match to raise money for Keenor and his family and the Football Association of Wales also organised a fund for him as well as donating him some money. After a long spell in hospital for treatment of his diabetes, Keenor moved his family to Lamberhurst <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife ran a corner shop and also raised chickens to be sold at Christmas time. He later volunteered for the Territorial Army, serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, but was discharged in June 1939 due to continuing problems with his diabetes treatment, just months {{before the start of the}} Second World War. Two of his sons, Frederick and Alfred were both killed in action during the conflict. Keenor and his wife later visited the village of Fruges in northern France where Alfred's plane had been shot down.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Indies in early 1942, Oerip {{was held in}} a mixed prisoner of war camp in Cimahi. Upon his release {{three and a half}} months later, Oerip refused an offer to form a new, Japanese-backed police force and returned to KEM, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife rented paddy fields to grow rice while continuing to operate their flower garden. To protect their land, they surrounded their property and home with a high bamboo fence. Although no longer active in the military, Oerip occasionally received former KNIL members, including Abdul Haris Nasution and Sunarmo, who brought news of events outside the village. The couple continued their work, harassed and surveilled by the Japanese and pro-Japanese Indonesians, until the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945 signified that Japan would soon withdraw. It was during this period that Oerip began having heart problems.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Point {{has had a}} {{cultural}} influence on American society as evidenced in many forms of media such as books, television, and film. In the 1940 biographical film Knute Rockne, All American documenting the life of famous Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, Cedar Point is featured at a pivotal point in the story. In 1913, Knute works as a lifeguard on a beach at Cedar Point, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> college roommate Gus Dorais worked on the forward pass. The concept, which was first used in a scrimmage game at Cedar Point, would revolutionize the sport and the film would later be preserved in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 2004, an independently-produced film, Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Infestation From Mars, was shot at several historic locations around Sandusky including Cedar Point. Dick Kinzel, CEO of Cedar Fair at the time, had a brief speaking role in the film.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was finally {{completed}} in 1840, and in July the Preston and Wyre Railway opened. The following year St Peter's Church was finished, and Hesketh-Fleetwood appointed as vicar the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey of Hilgay in Norfolk. Also in 1841, the North Euston {{was the fourth}} hotel {{to open in the}} town. Steamer services opened to the Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Ardrossan and Belfast. Fleetwood initially flourished, but Hesketh-Fleetwood had run out of money and was compelled to take out mortgages. He lost the £75,000 he had invested in the Preston and Wyre Railway Company owing to a lack of accounts. Kemp claimed that Hesketh-Fleetwood owed him money, but Kemp refused to explain his book-keeping. In the face of enormous debts Hesketh-Fleetwood sold his estates at Blackpool, Southport, Meols Hall, and Tulketh Hall. Charles bought the Churchtown estate, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife had been living, from his brother. In 1844 Hesketh-Fleetwood auctioned off his personal possessions from Rossall Hall and left Lancashire. The Rev. St. Vincent Beechey had set up the Northern Church of England School for boys. Close to bankruptcy, Hesketh-Fleetwood leased the buildings at Rossall Hall to the school for six years, with the option to buy it after nine for £7,000. Thereafter, the school was called Rossall School.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Mexico {{underwent}} {{a period of}} instability under the Plutarco Elías Calles administration who was seeking to limit {{the influence of the}} Catholic Church to modernize and centralize the state within the religious sphere of Mexican society. To protest the policies, the Catholic Church suspended all religious services, bringing about an uprising in Mexico. This uprising, or Cristero War, lasted from 1926 to 1929 and reemerged in the 1930s. On April 6, 1926 González had a vision in which God changed his name from Eusebio to Aarón and was later told to leave Monterrey <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife served Saulo and Silas. On his journey, he preached near the entrances of Catholic churchesoften facing religious persecutionuntil he arrived at Guadalajara on December 12, 1926. The Cristero Wars impacted both Catholic and non-Catholic congregations and preachers, especially evangelical movements. Small movements were attacked by the government and the Cristeros, resulting in a hostile environment for González's work.|$|E
