2500|$|The travel writer Pausanias listed Solon {{among the}} seven sages whose aphorisms adorned Apollo's temple in Delphi. Stobaeus in the Florilegium relates {{a story about}} a {{symposium}} where Solon's young nephew was singing a poem of Sappho's; Solon, upon hearing the song, asked the boy to teach him to sing it. When someone asked, [...] "Why should you <b>waste</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> on it?" [...] Solon replied , [...] "So that I may learn it then die."

2500|$|On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, {{participated in}} an {{interview}} with CBS, in which she personally apologized to John Edwards' wife for her sister's behavior. She also claimed Edwards had lied in his confession, because the affair was of a longer duration than the timeframe that he had claimed and was still ongoing. Marshall also stated that, {{in the days after the}} story broke, Edwards provided Hunter and her baby with a new and secret domicile to prevent media reporters from finding her. She also called upon Edwards to tell the complete truth about the affair. During that same day, an article from CBS News was published saying, [...] "CBS News legal analyst, Mickey Sherman, told Early Show co-anchor, Maggie Rodriguez, that Edwards may be in legal jeopardy if it could be shown that the funds were used for purposes other than the ones that they had been assigned for.

The New York Daily News also reported on that same day that, when questioned about the affair by reporters, Mimi Hockman, Hunter's partner in the Midline Groove video production company, [...] "said the contract they signed with John Edwards had a 'hefty' confidentiality clause that bars her from talking." [...] Two days earlier, on August 11, 2008, Hockman had been questioned by reporters from the Star-Ledger at her home.
