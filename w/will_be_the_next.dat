5|$|An {{increasingly}} popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists {{is that the}} hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> milestone {{in the implementation of}} the New World Order. The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States {{are in the process of}} being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E

25|$|JL-1 and JL-2 submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missiles. The JL-1 {{was first}} test fired in 1982 and first successfully launched from the Xia class SSBN in 1987. The JL-1 is currently carried on board China's sole SSBN, the Xia 092. It has 12 launch tubes. Each JL-1 has a range 2,150km {{and a single}} 250-500kt nuclear warhead. An improved model is in service with a 2,800km range and possibly higher accuracy. The JL-2 <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation of Chinese SLBM, similar to early variants of the Trident. With a range of 8000km and multiple warheads (MIRV), this missile is essentially based on the land based DF-31 ICBM design. This means that the future 094 class SSBN can patrol near Chinese waters and launch missiles that could hit the American mainland.|$|E
25|$|Qualification {{has changed}} significantly. Associations ranked 7–9 in the UEFA {{coefficients}} sent the cup winners and three (two since 2015–16 season) other teams to the UEFA Europa League qualification, all other nations sent a Cup winners {{and two other}} teams, except Andorra and San Marino, who sent only a Cup winner and a runner-up, and Liechtenstein, who sent only a Cup winner. Since Gibraltar was accepted as a full UEFA member at the UEFA congress held in London on 24 May 2013, their Cup winner also qualified for Europa League. Usually, the other teams <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> highest ranked clubs in each domestic league after those qualifying for the UEFA Champions League, however France and England will continue to use one spot for their League Cup winner. With {{the abolition of the}} Intertoto Cup, all participants of Europa League are qualified through domestic routes. Generally, the higher an association is ranked in the UEFA coefficients, the later its clubs start in the qualification. However, every team except for the title-holder (up to 2014–15 season) and the highest ranked teams (usually the cup winner and/or the best Europa League qualified team) from the top (six in 2012–15 seasons, 12 since 2015–16 season) associations had to play at least one qualification round.|$|E

Now what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What about the people who are suffering over there? They are going through what we were going through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E
