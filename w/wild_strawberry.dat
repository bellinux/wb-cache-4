25|$|The first garden {{strawberry}} was grown in Brittany, France {{during the late}} 18th century. Prior to this, wild strawberries and cultivated selections from <b>wild</b> <b>strawberry</b> species were the common source of the fruit.|$|E

25|$|The EBK {{gathered}} berries {{for consumption}} and also prepared {{a number of}} wild plants, judging from the seed remains of plants {{that could not be}} consumed without preparation. Of the berries that have been found are raspberry (Rubus idaeus), dewberry (Rubus caesius), <b>wild</b> <b>strawberry,</b> and the somewhat less palatable dogwood (Cornus sanguinea), hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna and C.oxyacantha), rowanberry (Sorbus aucuparia), crab apple and rose hips.|$|E
25|$|The {{strawberry}} fruit {{was mentioned}} in ancient Roman literature {{in reference to}} its medicinal use. The French began taking the strawberry from the forest to their gardens for harvest in the 14th century. Charles V, France's king from 1364 to 1380, had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden. In the early 15th century western European monks were using the <b>wild</b> <b>strawberry</b> in their illuminated manuscripts. The strawberry is found in Italian, Flemish, and German art, and in English miniatures. The entire strawberry plant was used to treat depressive illnesses.|$|E
25|$|Early {{settlers}} {{relied on}} hunting, fishing, and trapping, and foraging {{to supplement their}} diets and incomes. Today hunting and fishing for recreation are common activities and {{an important part of}} the tourist industry. Foraging for mushrooms (especially morels) and for ginseng is common and financially supported by established buyers in the area. Other forages include poke, watercress, persimmons and pawpaw; wild berries such as blackberry, black raspberry, raspberry, red mulberry, black cherry, <b>wild</b> <b>strawberry</b> and dewberry; and wild nuts such as black walnut and even acorns. Edible native legumes, wild grasses and wildflowers are plentiful, and beekeeping is common.|$|E

50|$|Allen's 1980s films, {{even the}} comedies, have somber and {{philosophical}} undertones, with their influences being {{the works of}} European directors, specifically Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. Stardust Memories was based on 8½, which it parodies, and <b>Wild</b> <b>Strawberries.</b> A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy was adapted from Smiles of a Summer Night. In Hannah and Her Sisters, part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from Fanny and Alexander. Amarcord inspired Radio Days. September resembles Autumn Sonata. Allen uses many elements from <b>Wild</b> <b>Strawberries.</b> In Crimes and Misdemeanors, Allen references a scene from <b>Wild</b> <b>Strawberries.</b>|$|R

25|$|After {{the chaos}} {{during and after}} Chen's visit, college {{students}} and professors launched a peaceful sitout, known as the <b>Wild</b> <b>Strawberry</b> student movement (Chinese: 野草莓運動), demanding a more reasonable assembly law and a stop to police violence. A few days into the sitout, the prime minister Liu Chao-shiuan accidentally spoke of his opinion during an interview on air {{that he did not}} think the movement would last more than three days, angering students, professors, and the general public. In the end, the sitout lasted one month. Then, it moved into an organizational direction. However, the polls in two of Taiwan's biggest newspapers after the visit still reported that about 70% of the Taiwanese public considered Chen's visit to {{have a positive effect on}} Taiwan's development, while 22% of the respondents thought the effect would be negative, with the remaining 8% not expressing an opinion. The opposition Pan-Green caucus have continuously alleged this result being a form of media manipulation by the KMT. However, other major polls in Taiwanese newspapers and news websites have shown similar results regardless of political alignment.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Scania belongs to the European hardwood vegetation zone, a considerable part of which is now agricultural rather than the original forest. This zone covers Europe west of Poland and north of the Alps, and includes the British Isles, northern and central France and the countries and regions {{to the south and}} southeast of the North Sea up to Denmark. A smaller north-eastern part of Scania is part of the pinewood vegetation zone, in which spruce grows naturally. Within the larger part, pine may grow together with birch on sandy soil. The most common tree is beech. Other common trees are willow, oak, ash, alder and elm (which until the 1970s formed a few forests but now is heavily infected by the elm disease). Also rather southern trees like walnut tree, chestnut and hornbeam can be found. In parks horse chestnut, lime and maple are commonly planted as well. Common fruit trees planted in commercial orchards and private gardens include several varieties of apple, pear, cherry and plum; strawberries are commercially cultivated in many locations across the province. Examples of wild berries grown in domesticated form are blackberry, raspberry, cloudberry (in the north-east), blueberry, <b>wild</b> <b>strawberry</b> and loganberry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vegetation}} in the {{coniferous forest}} {{is dominated by}} ponderosa pine. [...] Other tree species found in the watershed are lodgepole pine, sugar pine, white fir, and incense cedar. [...] The forest understory include mountain mahogany, big sagebrush, low sagebrush, rabbitbrush, bitterbrush, and manzanita. [...] Other common forest plants include ceanothus, huckleberry, snowberry, blue elderberry, chokecherry, twinberry, and serviceberry.

[...] Grasses found in the forested areas include Idaho fescue, intermediate wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Thurber needlegrass. [...] Invasive species include Kentucky bluegrass and cheatgrass brome. [...] There are also quaking aspen in the upland meadows areas dispersed within the pine forest portion of the watershed.|$|E

More conspicuous than the grass blades, green as verdigris, were the arrow-shaped leaves of the arum or cuckoo-pint. But there were no flowers yet except the <b>wild</b> <b>strawberry,</b> and these so few and small that only the eager eyes of the little children, seeking for spring, might find them.|$|E
60|$|October 29th.--On {{a walk to}} Scott's pond, with Ellery Channing, {{we found}} a <b>wild</b> <b>strawberry</b> in the woods, not quite ripe, but {{beginning}} to redden. For a week or two, the cider-mills have been grinding apples. Immense heaps of apples lie piled near them, and the creaking of the press is heard as the horse treads on. Farmers are repairing cider-barrels; and the wayside brook is made to pour itself into the bunghole of a barrel, in order to cleanse it for the new cider.|$|E

A colder wind blew here: mosses and lichens carpeted the banks and roadsides: the birds and insects were very different from those below; and everything proclaimed the marked change in elevation, and not only in this, but in season, for I had left the winter of the tropics and here encountered the spring of the temperate zone.|$|E
