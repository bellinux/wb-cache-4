5|$|Gascoigne {{was born}} in Dunston, Tyne and <b>Wear</b> <b>on</b> 27 May 1967. His father, John, was a hod carrier, and his mother, Carol, worked in a factory. He was named Paul John Gascoigne in tribute to Paul McCartney and John Lennon of the Beatles.|$|E
5|$|According to the inlay {{which comes}} with the Special Edition, all {{previous}} CD editions of the Primary & Secondary Phases played back slightly fast due to capstan <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the mastering tape machine, {{with the result that}} the audio was pitch-shifted up by half a semitone. That was corrected for the special editions and has the effect of making the episodes nearly a minute longer.|$|E
5|$|In some areas, {{people use}} weather {{forecasts}} {{to determine what}} to <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and the wind chill, forecasts {{can be used to}} plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead to survive through them.|$|E
50|$|For {{military}} officers, {{the medal}} {{is accompanied by}} a ribbon bar for <b>wearing</b> <b>on</b> military uniform, a miniature medal pendant for <b>wearing</b> <b>on</b> mess uniform, and a lapel badge for <b>wearing</b> <b>on</b> civilian clothes.|$|R
5000|$|Shoulder sleeve {{insignia}} {{receive their}} {{name from the}} fact that they are most commonly <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper left shoulders of all U.S. Army uniforms, though they can be placed on other locations, notably a combat helmet. Shoulder sleeve insignia <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper right shoulders on Army uniforms denote former wartime service. These [...] "combat patches" [...] are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Army Combat Uniform but are not <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Army Service Uniform. Instead a 2 inch metal replica is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the right breast pocket and is officially known as the Combat Service Identification Badge.|$|R

5|$|A {{gift from}} King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, it is a fringe {{necklace}} {{in design and}} set with brilliant and baguette cut diamonds. King Faisal bought the necklace, made by the American jeweller Harry Winston, and presented it to her while on a state visit to the United Kingdom in 1967. Before his departure, the Queen wore it to a banquet at the Dorchester hotel. She also lent the necklace to Diana, Princess of Wales, to <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> a state visit to Australia in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so would have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{place for the}} SSI to be <b>worn</b> is <b>on</b> the {{shoulder}} of the uniform, however it is also sometimes <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> other places, notably when the soldier's body armor covers the shoulders. SSI are also commonly <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder pads of interceptor body armor, which covers the SSI on the uniform. Some soldiers also <b>wear</b> SSI <b>on</b> their MICH TC-2000 Combat Helmets, however this is not standard practice for all units. Some SSI are too large to be <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the helmets. SSI are also occasionally <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the backpacks or rucksacks of soldiers, but this is not standard practice and is usually personal preference.|$|R
50|$|SADF Nutria Badges <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> Combat Uniform {{known as}} Browns, whilst the Metal {{insignia}} were <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Dress Uniform known as Step-Outs.|$|R
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{chandelier}} earrings, and 60 other pieces of jewellery, Mrs Greville left the Queen Mother a set of pear-drop earrings that she had bought from Cartier in 1938. The pear-shaped drop diamonds each weigh about 20carats (4g). Diana, Princess of Wales, borrowed them in 1983 to <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> her first official visit to Australia. At a state banquet, she wore the earrings with a tiara from her family's own collection. The Greville Pear-drop Earrings passed to the Queen upon her mother's death in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E
5|$|Eudimorphodonts can {{be divided}} into two major categories-those with long, robust wings similar to Campylognathoides, and those with long, slender wings. Species in the former category, {{including}} Carniadactylus and Eudimorphodon itself, were highly aerial animals and fast, agile flyers. The former was almost certainly insectivorous due to its small size; Eudimorphodon has been found with fish remains in its stomach. Slender-winged species, such as Austriadactylus and Caviramus, were likely terrestrial/semiarboreal in habits, and potentially generalists. Caviramus likely had a strong bite force, indicating an adaptation towards hard foods. All eudimorphodonts possessed well-developed molariform teeth and could chew their food, as indicated by the tooth <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> Caviramus and Eudimorphodon teeth. Austriadactylus and Eudimorphodon had a pair of these molariform teeth developed into enlarged fangs.|$|E
50|$|All rank {{insignia}} are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the collars of the shirt, {{except for}} sergeant, which is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> each sleeve, below the department patch.|$|R
50|$|Rank {{insignia}} on duty uniforms are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> {{right side}} of shoulders only, but rank insignia on dress uniforms are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> both sides.|$|R
5000|$|Officer's {{insignia}} were officially <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the collars of {{the shirt}} with Class B uniform. The officer's rank insignia was <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the right collar and {{the branch of}} service insignia (e.g., crossed muskets for Infantry) was <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the left collar. To prevent targeting by snipers, a set of rank insignia were usually <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder straps in combat. Warrant Officers wore the Warrant Officer [...] "Wreathed Rising Eagle" [...] (or [...] "Squashed Bug") as their branch of service insignia.|$|R
5|$|Ferugliotherium {{was much}} smaller than the sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and its body mass is {{estimated}} to have been about 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Great War, the Roman Catholic Church encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began to <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Gorée, Rufisque, Thiès, Ngazobil, Joal, Fadiouth, Foundiougne, Kaolack, Ziguinchor, Bignona and Banjul. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of Islam in the country.|$|E
5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

50|$|Different {{styles of}} rank {{insignia}} are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> different Marine uniforms:The gold stripes on red flash are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Dress Blue uniform coat, green stripes on red flash are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Service uniform coat; the rank insignia are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper sleeve of both blouses. The khaki uniforms use green stripes on khaki flash, and again are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper sleeves of both long and short-sleeved service blouses. Utility uniform rank insignia are black metal pins and are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the collars, or black embroidered insignia sewn into patches of material when wearing a flak. Musicians in the United States Marine Band wear insignia with lyre {{in the center}} {{as opposed to the}} crossed rifles, to denote their lack of a combat mission; full-service Marines who are attached to the 10 field bands of the Operating Forces and Supporting Establishment continue to wear their normal rank insignia.|$|R
5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E
5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
5|$|The Micro plug {{design is}} rated {{for at least}} 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles, {{which is more than}} the Mini plug design. The Micro {{connector}} is also designed to reduce the mechanical <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the device; instead the easier-to-replace cable is designed to bear the mechanical wear of connection and disconnection. The Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB receptacles (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs), and Micro-B plugs and receptacles, along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E

50|$|All rank {{insignia}} are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the epaulettes of the shirt, {{except for}} sergeants, corporal and soldiers, which are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> each sleeve, below the institutional patch (left) and state flag (right).|$|R
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E
5|$|With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium {{may have}} been an {{insectivore}} or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are thought to have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are thought to have evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the problems, the zip fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make {{up some of the}} difference. Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, another problem arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.|$|E
50|$|Aiguillettes {{are worn}} by honor guard {{personnel}}. A single silver aiguillette is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> enlisted cut uniforms of minor detachments. A single gold aiguillette is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> officer cut uniforms of minor detachments. A double gold aiguillette is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> officer cut uniforms of major detachments. All personnel of major detachments wear officer cut uniforms. Also, dembels (demobilized soldiers) often decorate their uniforms with makeshift aiguillettes.|$|R
50|$|In World War I United States {{soldiers}} received stripes called Wound Chevrons {{that was}} influenced by French practice. These looked {{exactly the same as}} Overseas Service Chevrons, but were always gold metallic-thread and <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the lower right sleeve. (At that time the gold Overseas Chevron was <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the lower left sleeve. Today its redesigned successor, the Overseas Service Bar, is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the right sleeve. Service Stripes are now <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the left sleeve.) In 1932 the Wound Chevron was replaced by the Purple Heart, and World War I veterans could apply for the new medal.|$|R
5000|$|No clasp is issued. A large [...] "South Atlantic" [...] (Falkland War) type rosette is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> {{the medal}} itself for {{operational}} service within Sierra Leone. A smaller rosette is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the ribbon.|$|R
