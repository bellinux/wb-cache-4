5|$|Fructose, galactose, and glucose are all simple sugars, monosaccharides, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> formula C6H12O6.

5|$|Hitchcock {{did most}} of the {{promotion}} on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of their revealing the plot.

5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|Lactose, maltose, and sucrose are all {{compound}} sugars, disaccharides, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> formula C12H22O11. They {{are formed}} by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water.|$|E

5|$|The RBZ also issued special traveller's cheques in 2003, {{with six}} {{denominations}} ranging from $1000 to $100000. These were short-lived due to unpopularity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> public: identification was required both during issue and encashment of such cheques, which {{could only be}} used once by the bearer. As usual, banks levied a commission fee {{on all of the}} cheques.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost to forage {{after it is}} already completely dark outside, this coincides <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. There is also some risk to the greater noctule from parasitism between bats.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot and}} {{characters}} of the game served {{as the basis for}} the 2005 spin-off game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, a beat'em up title which follows Liu Kang and Kung Lao as they fight their way through Outworld to defeat Shao Kahn. Some of the plot of Shaolin Monks, such as the death of Jade, is not compatible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> Mortal Kombat game series.|$|E
5|$|These two adaptations {{received}} mainly positive reviews, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> consensus {{being that}} they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being. Although Hobo with a Shotgun was not as big a box office success in the U.S. {{as it was in}} Canada, it has since gained a cult following there.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the piece}} begins, Wladimir Samoiloff, a young Russian Lieutenant, had an {{adventure}} {{in which he}} ended up disguising himself as a woman (who he named Fatinitza), and met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hot-tempered elderly <b>General</b> Kantschukoff, who {{fell in love with}} his disguise. Wladimir, however, is in love <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>General's</b> niece, Lydia.|$|R

5|$|Vick's NFL career {{came to a}} halt in 2007 {{after he}} pleaded guilty for his {{involvement}} in a dog fighting ring and spent 21 months in federal prison. His arrest and subsequent conviction garnered Vick notoriety <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> public, which lasted throughout the rest of his career. He was released by the Falcons shortly before leaving prison.|$|E

5|$|A scuba diver moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and {{a higher level of}} fitness may be needed for some applications.|$|E

5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2âˆ’, 2âˆ’ and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4Â·Th (SO4)2Â·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> formula An2Th(NO3)6Â·nH2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable coordination compounds of actinides â€“ tetravalent thorium and uranium â€“ are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E
5|$|Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> {{administration}} of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Australia {{considered}} {{joining the}} MRCA programme {{to find a}} replacement for their ageing Dassault Mirage IIIs; ultimately the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet was selected to meet the requirement. Canada similarly opted for the F/A-18 after considering the Tornado. Japan considered the Tornado in the 1980s, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and F/A-18; before selecting the Mitsubishi F-2, a domestically produced design based on the F-16. In the 1990s, both Taiwan and South Korea expressed interest in acquiring {{a small number of}} Tornado ECR aircraft. In 2001, EADS proposed a Tornado ECR variant with a greater electronic warfare capability for Australia.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004-05, Turple {{got off to}} a {{slow start}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Generals,</b> as he had a 4-4-0 record with a 3.71 GAA and a [...]872 save {{percentage}} after 10 games. <b>The</b> <b>Generals</b> traded Turple to the Kitchener Rangers for Carlo DiRienzo and Devereaux Heshmatpour.|$|R
