5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and <b>whooping-cough,</b> while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E

60|$|Then {{the bishop}} {{began to be}} {{particularly}} tormented by a bird that made a short, insistent, wheezing sound at regular intervals of perhaps twenty seconds. If a bird could have <b>whooping-cough,</b> that, he thought, {{was the sort of}} whoop it would have. But even if it had <b>whooping-cough</b> he could not pity it. He hung in its intervals waiting for the return of the wheeze.|$|E
6000|$|The {{intellectual}} life may be kept clean and healthful if man will live {{the life of}} nature and not import into his mind difficulties which are none of his. No man need be perplexed in his speculations. Let him do and say what strictly belongs to him, and though very ignorant of books, his nature shall not yield him any intellectual obstructions and doubts. Our young people are diseased with the theological problems of original sin, origin of evil, predestination and the like. These never presented a practical difficulty to any man,--never darkened across any man's road who did not go {{out of his way}} to seek them. These are the soul's mumps and measles and <b>whooping-coughs,</b> and those who have not caught them cannot describe their health or prescribe the cure. A simple mind will not know these enemies. It is quite another thing that he should be able to give account of his faith and expound to another the theory of his self-union and freedom. This requires rare gifts. Yet without this self-knowledge there may be a sylvan strength and integrity in that which he is. [...] "A few strong instincts and a few plain rules" [...] suffice us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, measles, and <b>whooping-cough,</b> and erysiplas, and consumption, and yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't {{know what}} all." ...|$|E
6000|$|No <b>whooping-cough</b> did rack his frame, [...] Nor measles drear with spots; [...] Not these {{impaired}} {{the sacred}} name [...] Of Stephen Dowling Bots.|$|E
6000|$|Q.--What illness {{have you}} had? A.--As a child, consumption, leprosy, and water on [...] the knee. As a man, <b>whooping-cough,</b> stomach-ache, [...] and {{water on the}} brain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Nelly {{softly to}} herself, [...] "that is a fairy tent, {{and in it}} I may find a baby elf sick with <b>whooping-cough</b> or scarlet-fever. How splendid it would be! only I could never nurse such a dainty thing." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not till}} the Queen {{had moved from}} St. James's, where her son had been born, to take up her abode at Whitehall, that Lady Oglethorpe was {{considered}} to be disinfected from her children's <b>whooping-cough,</b> and could conduct Mistress Anne Jacobina Woodford to her new situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] asks Frank; {{but before}} the nurse can answer, [...] "Thim little divils," [...] he {{perceives}} that the whooping-coughers of the morning have taken the occasion to renew a pleasant acquaintance, and are surrounding the baby and nurse with an atmosphere of <b>whooping-cough.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} are {{kindness}} itself, dear Jenny,' responded Miss Adeline. 'I am glad they own it! But it is very inconvenient and unlucky that that unjustifiable mother should have sent her child to the party to carry the <b>whooping-cough</b> to poor little Primrose, and Mysie, and Phyllis.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Were it {{yesterday}} afternoon?" [...] said Joe, after coughing behind his hand, {{as if he}} had had time to catch the <b>whooping-cough</b> since he came. [...] "No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon" [...] (with an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).|$|E
6000|$|To the doctor's ears, Lady Arabella was {{now talking}} {{of her son}} as a mother might of her infant when <b>whooping-cough</b> was abroad or croup imminent. [...] "There is nothing on earth the matter with him, I should say," [...] said the doctor. [...] "He has every {{possible}} sign of perfect health." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes {{but nothing}} {{to what she}} was before that blessed John Smith broke her leg and {{battered}} her nose. Ingenious Smith!--gifted Smith!--noble Smith! Author of all our bliss! Hark! Do {{you know what that}} wheeze means? Mary, that cub has got the <b>whooping-cough.</b> Will you never learn {{to take care of the}} children!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Tottie mustn't {{eat them}} till she is well. Sugar {{is bad for}} <b>whooping-cough,</b> though, of course, a young lady couldn't be {{expected}} to know that," [...] he added in a voice of gruff apology, then went on quickly, glancing at the little girl's arm, [...] "No marks, I see. Conscientious Objector? Or only lazy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Their {{general health}} is closely alike; {{whenever}} {{one of them}} has an illness, the other invariably has the same within a day or two, and they usually recover in the same order. Such has been the case with <b>whooping-cough,</b> chicken-pox, and measles; also with slight bilious attacks, which they have successively. Latterly, they had a feverish attack at the same time." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{due course}} these {{children}} caught the <b>whooping-cough,</b> and Jane visited them, taking with her some delicacies as a present. While {{she was there}} Dr. Merchison arrived in his capacity of parish doctor, and, beyond a curt bow taking no notice of Jane, began his examination, for this was {{his first visit to}} the family. Presently his eye fell upon a box of sweets.|$|E
60|$|Elspeth at last did {{something}} to win Tommy's respect; she fell ill of an ailment called in Thrums the croop. When Tommy first heard his mother call it croop, {{he thought she was}} merely humoring Elspeth, and that it was nothing more distinguished than London <b>whooping-cough,</b> but on learning that it was genuine croop, he began to survey the ambitious little creature with a new interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ma {{says she}} is going over the house {{in a day or}} two, now it is warm and dry after the storm, and we may go with her. You know she wouldn't take us in the fall, cause we had <b>whooping-cough,</b> and it was damp there. Now we shall see all the nice things; won't it be fun?" [...] {{observed}} Bab, after a pause.|$|E
60|$|She {{was glad}} that the night was not longer, and {{resolved}} {{to take advantage of}} the early morning to fulfil a commission of Lady Oglethorpe, whose elder children, Lewis and Theophilus, had the <b>whooping-cough.</b> Mouse-ear, namely, the little sulphur-coloured hawk-weed, was, and still is, accounted a specific, and Anne had been requested to bring a supply--a thing easily done, since it grew plentifully in the court of the castle.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later a pleasant-looking but dignified lady came out from among the tea-drinkers and bore down {{directly}} on me. [...] "I hear," [...] she said, [...] "you've been talking to my little girl, and I {{want you to know}} I was very sorry I couldn't let her paddle. She was just recovering from <b>whooping-cough</b> when I took her to the seaside, and I was afraid to let her go in the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (3.) [...] "They {{have never}} been separated, never the least {{differently}} treated in food, clothing, or education; both teethed at the same time, both had measles, <b>whooping-cough,</b> and scarlatina at the same time, and neither had had any other serious illness. Both are and have been exceedingly healthy, and have good abilities, yet they differ as much {{from each other in}} mental cast as any one of my family differs from another." ...|$|E
60|$|The White Hope, as Steve {{called his}} godson--possibly {{with the idea}} of {{influencing}} him by suggestion--grew. The ailments which attacked lesser babies passed him by. He avoided croup, and even <b>whooping-cough</b> paid him but a flying visit hardly worth mentioning. His first tooth gave him a little trouble, but that is the sort of thing which may happen to anyone; and the spirited way in which he protested against the indignity of cutting it was proof of a high soul.|$|E
60|$|Some {{months passed}} away before the landlady had cause {{to report to}} Sir Anthony. But during the worst depths of the next London winter, when gray fog {{gathered}} thick in the purlieus of Marylebone, and shivering gusts groaned at the street corners, poor little Dolly caught <b>whooping-cough</b> badly. On top of the <b>whooping-cough</b> came an attack of bronchitis; {{and on top of}} the bronchitis a serious throat trouble. Herminia sat up night after night, nursing her child, and neglecting the work on which both depended for subsistence. Week by week things grew worse and worse; and Sir Anthony, kept duly informed by the landlady, waited and watched, and bided his time in silence. At last the case became desperate. Herminia had no money left to pay her bill or buy food; and one string to her bow after another broke down in journalism. Her place as the weekly lady's-letter writer to an illustrated paper passed on to a substitute; blank poverty stared her in the face, inevitable. When it came to pawning the type-writer, as the landlady reported, Sir Anthony smiled a grim smile to himself. The moment for action had now arrived. He would put on pressure to get away poor Alan's illegitimate child from that dreadful woman.|$|E
60|$|He {{waited so}} long without this anxiously-expected event occurring, {{that he began to}} think it was not going to take place at all, when he heard light {{footsteps}} upon the gravel, and immediately afterwards beheld Arabella walking pensively down the garden. As soon as she came nearly below the tree, Sam began, by way of gently indicating his presence, to make sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be natural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore throat, croup, and <b>whooping-cough,</b> from his earliest infancy.|$|E
60|$|I couldn't keep my {{eyes off}} him. Always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable {{creature}} finger his glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic <b>whooping-cough</b> dance, and rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window, violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and apparently out of his mind.|$|E
60|$|Tell Mrs. Cerjat, to whom my love, {{and all our}} loves, that I have highly excited them at {{home here}} by giving them an account in detail of all your daughters; further, that {{the way in which}} Catherine and Georgina have {{questioned}} me and cross-questioned me about you all, notwithstanding, is maddening. Mrs. Watson has been obliged to pass her Christmas at Brighton alone with her younger children, in consequence of her two eldest boys coming home to Rockingham from school with the <b>whooping-cough.</b> The quarantine expires to-day, however; and she drives here, on her way back into Northamptonshire, to-morrow.|$|E
60|$|None of the {{children}} suffered, thank God, from the Boulogne risk. The three little boys {{have gone back to}} school there, and are all well. Katey came away ill, but it turned out that she had the <b>whooping-cough</b> for the second time. She has been to Brighton, and comes home to-day. I hear great accounts of her, and hope to find her quite well when she arrives presently. I am afraid Mary Boyle has been praising the Boulogne life too highly. Not that I deny, however, our having passed some very pleasant days together, and our having had great pleasure in her visit.|$|E
6000|$|And then, as {{luck would}} have it, Grace Crawley got up and left the room. Lily still waited for a few minutes, and, in order that her {{patience}} might be thoroughly exercised, she said a word or two about her sister Bell; how the eldest child's <b>whooping-cough</b> was nearly well, and how the baby was doing wonderful things with its first tooth. But as Mrs. Dale had already seen Bell's letter, all this was not intensely interesting. At last Lily came to the point and asked her question. [...] "Mamma, from whom was that other letter which you got this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it's {{a perfect}} <b>whooping-cough</b> factory, this place," [...] cries Cousin Lucy in a desperation. [...] "Go away, do, please, from the baby, you poor little dreadful object you," [...] she continues, turning upon the only visible {{operative}} in the establishment. [...] "Here, take this," [...] and she bribes {{her with a}} bit of sponge-cake, on which the child runs lightly off {{along the edge of the}} wharf. [...] "That's been another of their projects for driving me wild," [...] says Cousin Lucy,--"trying to take their own lives in a hundred ways before my face and eyes. Why will their mothers let them come here to play?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{best part}} of the day was spent in {{relating}} the sad end of Captain Fred Flower to various enquirers. The deceased gentleman was a popular favourite, and clerks from the office and brother skippers came down in little knots to learn the full particulars, and to compare the accident with others in their experience. It reminded one skipper, who invariably took to drink when his feelings were touched, of the death of a little nephew from <b>whooping-cough,</b> and he was so moved over a picture he drew of the meeting of the two, that it took four men to get him off the schooner without violence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such a boy, {{respected}} sir, I {{would not}} get for you, but a boy that never needed reform. Do not smile, for as <b>whooping-cough</b> and measles are juvenile diseases, and yet some juveniles never have them, so are there boys equally free from juvenile vices. True, for the best of boys' measles may be contagious, and evil communications corrupt good manners; but {{a boy with a}} sound mind in a sound body--such is the boy I would get you. If hitherto, sir, you have struck upon a peculiarly bad vein of boys, so much the more hope now of your hitting a good one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't get {{anyone else}} to take the part, because nobody liked it, so finally I had to take it myself. Olive Kirk is on the concert {{committee}} and goes against me in every single thing. But I got my way in asking Mrs. Channing to come out from town and sing for us, anyhow. She is a beautiful singer and will draw such a crowd that we will make more than {{we will have to}} pay her. Olive Kirk thought our local talent good enough and Minnie Clow won't sing at all now in the choruses because she would be so nervous before Mrs. Channing. And Minnie is the only good alto we have! There are times when I am so exasperated that I feel tempted to wash my hands of the whole affair; but after I dance round my room a few times in sheer rage I cool down and have another whack at it. Just at present I am racked with worry for fear the Isaac Reeses are taking <b>whooping-cough.</b> They have all got a dreadful cold and there are five of them who have important parts in the programme and if they go and develop <b>whooping-cough</b> what shall I do? Dick Reese's violin solo is to be one of our titbits and Kit Reese is in every tableau and the three small girls have the cutest flag-drill. I've been toiling for weeks to train them in it, and now it seems likely that all my trouble will go for nothing.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed that}} there had hardly ever been such an eventful period {{in the lives of}} the family before, and he listened to a minute account of it from Cousin Lucy. [...] "You know, Frank," [...] says she, [...] "that Sallie's one idea in life is to keep the baby from getting the <b>whooping-cough,</b> and I declare that these {{premises}} have done nothing but reëcho with the most dolorous whoops ever since you've been gone, so that at times, in my fear that Sallie would think I'd been careless about the boy, I've been ready to throw myself into the water, and nothing's prevented me but the doubt whether it wouldn't be better to throw in the whoopers instead." ...|$|E
6000|$|To which Cuffy {{replied with}} a bark, which one might imagine should come from a dog in the last stage of <b>whooping-cough,</b> and with a wag of his tail--not merely at the root thereof, but a {{distinct}} wag--that extended obviously along its entire length to the extreme point. Jarwin observed the successful effort, laughed feebly, and said, [...] "Brayvo, Cuffy," [...] with evident delight; for {{it reminded him of}} the days when that little shred of a door-mat, in the might of its vigour, was wont to wag its tail so violently as to convulse its whole body, insomuch that it was difficult to decide whether the tail wagged the body, or the body the tail! ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dowson saw {{husband and}} {{daughter}} {{off to work}} in the morning, and after washing up the breakfast things drew her chair up to the kitchen fire and became absorbed in memories of the past. All the leading incidents in Flora's career passed in review before her. Measles, <b>whooping-cough,</b> school-prizes, and other things peculiar to the age of innocence were all there. In her enthusiasm she nearly gave her a sprained ankle which had belonged to her sister. Still shaking her head over her mistake, she drew Flora's latest portrait carefully from its place in the album, and putting on her hat and jacket went round to make a call in Peter Street.|$|E
