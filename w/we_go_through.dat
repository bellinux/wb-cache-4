500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> and as women <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E

When asked to define the traits of a Bond girl, she perceived the role as [...] "a powerful woman with a kind of male charisma and male power" [...] and a [...] "bit of animality". During promotional interviews, Marlohe advocated for the removal of the title of Bond girl, explaining that she aimed to imagine the character as more modern and realistic; she explained that the Bond girl is [...] "a beautiful concept but it's a concept, and I wanted to create a real human being". She went to say that she did not want Sévérine to be simply labelled as a [...] "good Bond girl" [...] or a [...] "bad Bond girl".

500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there {{and come up with a}} hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E

On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast {{in an upcoming}} episode as [...] "Walter's musical hero". Noble explained Lloyd's role: [...] "We all know how much Walter loves music, right? Well this fellow {{was one of his}} icons. He adored this man. So Walter gets to {{be a bit of a}} fanboy". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that." [...] Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter.

500|$|Carey wrote [...] "Mine Again" [...] {{alongside}} producer James Poyser. The ballad has {{electronic keyboard}} notes, a rhythmic vinyl sound, and melodies from gospel and R genres. [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was produced by}} Carey and Kanye West, and samples a piano loop from Ramsey Lewis's 1971 cover version of [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow". In the lyrics, the protagonist faces the dilemma of spending the night with an ex-lover, although he is in another relationship. [...] "Get Your Number" [...] samples the hook from British band Imagination's 1982 single [...] "Just an Illusion", and derives its production from [...] "'80s-esque synthesizers" [...] and computerized musical instruments. Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple", with lyrics such as [...] "I gotta shake you off / Just like a Calgon commercial". In an interview with Ferber, Carey described the track as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "'Shake It Off' can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll listen to that song when I've {{just come out of}} an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] Editor Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the album follows a formula that was most apparent on [...] "Shake It Off": [...] "On this album, the verses stay in a narrow range, the choruses glide higher, and at the ends of some songs, Ms. Carey gives herself a few of her old sky-high notes as a background flourish." ...|$|E

500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a top pick from the album. Michael Paoletta, writing for Billboard, gave the song a positive review, complimenting its lyrics, production and Carey's vocals. He concluded his review with his assurance that the song would be a success, writing [...] "After 'We Belong Together' {{brought her back to}} radio big time, 'Shake It Off' will take Carey's good fortune to the next step." [...] Some critics compared the song heavily to Usher's material from his 2004 album, Confessions. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote [...] "Mariah too heavily bites on the styles of her successors: Usher by way of Dupri on 'Shake It Off'," [...] while Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song was [...] "Usher-lite". Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] track from the album. When discussing the track with Ferber, Carey described the song as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "Shake it off can apply to anything.

I'll listen to that song when I've just come out of an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] While Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine described it as [...] "sultry", a writer from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called it [...] "lyrically crude" [...] and [...] "ghetto".

[...] "I think that situation, where 60,000 children a year are forcibly denied any kind of equal parenting time with their fathers, {{is one of the}} worst state-enforced abuses of human rights in Canada today," [...] he told the committee. [...] "The court ordeals <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> are sickening and unbelievable. Abusive lawyers are rewarded by adversarial, winner-take-all courts.

[...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E

This new intro also includes some 3D animation when the camera pans over [...] The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told the New York Post: [...] "The clouds {{at the very beginning of}} the main title were always unsatisfying to me.
