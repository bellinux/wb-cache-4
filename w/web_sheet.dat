5000|$|The spiders {{remain under}} leaves during the hottest {{hours of the}} day. During this time, they stay in the resting {{position}} with their legs retracted under the cephalothorax. In the evening the spiders leave the leafy area above the <b>web</b> <b>sheet,</b> “the retreat,” in order to renew the silk threads in the web or to position themselves to wait for prey to be captured. During cold and rainy days, the spiders are active throughout the day. Prey capture can happen during the daytime if the prey vibrates enough to attract the spider to leave the retreat to capture the prey.|$|E

A general efficiency chart for shells in torsion is established, {{based on the assumption}} that the efficiency of the <b>web</b> <b>sheet</b> in resisting deformation decreases linearly with the average stress. The chart is used to calculate the torsional deflections of eight box beams, a test wing panel, and a complete wing; the results of the calculations are shown in comparison with the test results.

40|$|General EcologyNatural {{selection}} should {{favor the}} most fit {{form of a}} trait and result {{in the loss of}} all other forms, yet polymorphism, the existence of two or more forms of a trait in a population, is quite common. There are a few ways polymorphism can be maintained, including disruptive and directional selection. When two or more predators favor different forms of the same trait in a prey species, polymorphism can be maintained. It has been observed that orb webs preferentially capture midges with smaller body sizes at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) (Johnson et al. 2002). Despite this directional selection, body size among midges at UMBS remains polymorphic We investigated the possibility that <b>sheet</b> <b>webs,</b> a different type of web, are preferentially capturing larger midges i. e. that <b>sheet</b> <b>webs</b> select against smaller midges). To test this hypothesis, we compared means and variances for thorax length, thorax width, and the ratio of thorax length to width for midges caught by <b>sheet</b> <b>webs</b> vs. uncaught (free) midges. We did this separately for two midge species, tentatively called A and B, in two sites on the UMBS campus: Blissville and Manville. We found that evidence of directional selection acting on Species B midges in Manville (length: p= 0. 005, width: p= 0. 005, ratio: p= 0. 28). However, like orb <b>webs,</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>webs</b> favored larger midges. We also found evidence of disruptive selection acting on Species B midges in both Blissville (length: p= 0. 020, width: p= 0. 008, ratio: p= 0. 007) and Manville (length: p= 0. 004, width: p= 0. 000016, ratio: p= 0. 48). We conclude that disruptive selection, but not directional selection, may explain the persistence of polymorphism in midge body size at UMBS, particularly if the total mortality caused by <b>sheet</b> <b>webs</b> exceeds that caused by orb webs. Alternatively, as yet unidentified factors {{may play a role in}} the maintenance of this polymorphism...|$|R

40|$|Prey {{consumption}} {{depends on}} the predator's ability to locate, capture and handle prey. We investigated these three steps in interactions between the delicate-bodied recluse spider Loxosceles gaucho (Araneae) and a heavy-bodied and armoured harvestman, Mischonyx cuspidatus (Opiliones). Although previous research suggested that the hard integument of such harvestmen protects them from being preyed upon by spiders larger than Loxosceles, indirect evidence suggested that Loxosceles spiders can subdue these prey. in the present study, we tested the following three hypotheses with regard to L. gaucho: (1) spiders use chemical cues left by prey to select foraging sites; (2) vibratory cues of prey are essential information in the predatory process; and (3) the spider's <b>web</b> <b>sheet</b> allows adequate handling of prey so vulnerable body regions of the prey can be bitten. To understand how a delicate predator can overcome the defences of a heavy-bodied and well-defended prey, we also quantitatively described the spider's behaviour. To test hypothesis 1, we compared the time spent in areas with harvestmen, crickets and no cues. for hypothesis 2, we compared latency to bite and number of bites in {{the presence or absence}} of vibratory information, and for hypothesis 3, we compared latency to detect prey, latency to capture prey and predation success. All three hypotheses were rejected. Loxosceles gaucho seems to be exceptional among spiders by not needing its web, indirect prey chemical cues, or prey's substrate borne vibrations to hunt the tested prey. What enables L. gaucho to prey upon M. cuspidatus is its unique hunting strategy, compared to previously studied spiders: it touches the prey with its tarsi possibly to locate weak parts of the prey's body, such as joints and distal parts of the legs, then it delivers several bites to these vulnerable areas. Our study is the first to document and describe how recluse spiders overcome the defences of an armoured harvestman. (C) 2015 the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|A interação entre presas e predadores é uma relação ecológica assimétrica e antagônica visto que, para predadores, capturar presas é vantajoso devido ao ganho de energia e, para presas, ser capturado, frequentemente significa morrer. A interação predador-presa é tida como uma pressão evolutiva que tende a aperfeiçoar tanto os mecanismos de caça de predadores como as defesas das presas. Para esta dissertação, utilizamos como modelo de predador a aranha Loxosceles gaucho e como presa o opilião Mischonyx cupidatus, ambos noturnos e sintópicos. No primeiro capítulo investigamos o uso de modalidades sensoriais por L. gaucho na busca por um sítio adequado de forrageio e na detecção de presas, bem como qual comportamento possibilita que estas aranhas consumam opiliões, presas com uma cutícula altamente esclerotizada. Foram testadas as seguintes hipóteses: (1) L. gaucho passa mais tempo em áreas com químicos de suas presas; (2) a vibração é uma informação essencial no processo de predação por L. gaucho; (3) o lençol de teia permite que L. gaucho prede opiliões. Realizamos também uma análise comportamental em que foi descrito um etograma e um fluxograma. Todas as hipóteses foram rejeitadas. O que aparentemente possibilita que L. gaucho capture esta presa é sua habilidade de encontrar e morder os pontos fracos do corpo do opilião, como juntas e partes distais das pernas. Contrariando vários estudos que demonstram que aranhas rejeitam opiliões Laniatores, este foi o primeiro estudo que demonstrou uma alta taxa de sucesso de predação de aranhas sobre opiliões e, além disso, demonstrou evidências comportamentais das estratégias que permitem a predação. No segundo capítulo, investigamos os comportamentos defensivos de M. cuspidatus em uma situação de risco intermediário (frente aos químicos dos predadores) e alto risco (frente aos predadores), visto que a teoria conhecida como T̈hreat {{sensitive}} hypothesisp̈ostula que para as presas é vantajoso modular comportamento defensivo de acordo com o nível de ameaça. Adicionalmente, testamos se lesões no abdômen de L. gaucho, provocadas por apófises do fêmur da perna IV de um opilião, podem influenciar na sobrevivência da aranha. Encontramos comportamentos defensivos nos opiliões apenas na situação de alto risco. A sobrevivência das aranhas não foi alterada após serem lesionadas pelas apófises dos opiliões. Surpreendentemente, não observamos comportamentos de defesa muito conhecidos entre opiliões (ex. defesa química, retaliação com quelícera e pedipalpos) em uma situação de alto risco. Por fim, destacamos a importância de abordagens comportamentais descritivas de comportamento para compreender especificidades das interações entre predadores e presas. CHAPTER I: Consuming prey involves {{finding an}} adequate site to forage, detecting and manipulating it. We investigated these three steps in {{interactions between the}} delicate recluse spider Loxosceles gaucho (Araneae) and a heavy bodied and armored harvestman, here represented by the harvestman Mischonyx cuspidatus (Opiliones). The hard integument of such harvestmen had been previously reported {{to protect them from}} spiders larger than Loxosceles. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) spiders prefer areas with cues from their prey, (2) vibratory cues are essential information in the predatory process and (3) the <b>web</b> <b>sheet</b> allows handling prey adequately so that the vulnerable spots of the prey can be bitten. To understand exactly how a delicate predator can overcome the defenses of a heavy bodied and well-defended prey, we also quantitatively described the spider´s behavior. To test hypothesis (1), we compared the time spent in areas with harvestmen, crickets and no cues. For hypothesis (2), we compared latency to bite and number of bites in {{the presence or absence of}} vibratory cues, and for hypothesis (3) we compared latency to detect, to capture and predation success. All hypotheses were rejected. Loxosceles gaucho seems to be exceptional among spiders by not needing its web, indirect prey chemical cues, or prey´s substrate borne vibrations to hunt it. What seems to enable Loxosceles to prey upon M. cuspidatus is its totally different hunting strategy, compared to previously studied spiders attempting to eat these armored harvestmen. The spider quickly touches the prey with its tarsi, finding and biting several times the weak parts of the prey body, such as joints and distal parts of the legs. With several previous papers reporting spiders rejecting these harvestmen, this is the first that describes how a spider overcomes the defenses of an armored harvestman. CHAPTER II: The threat sensitive hypothesis predicts that animals modulate the defensive behaviour with the level of threat. Therefore, responses to predator cues may differ from responses to the actual predator in close range. Also, in high threat situations, prey would be expected to use their most dangerous defences. The recluse spider Loxosceles gaucho (Araneae, Sicariidae) is known to prey upon well defended harvestmen such as the laniatorid Mischonyx cuspidatus (Opiliones, Gonyleptidae), which has been reported to use tanathosis, chemical defences, pinching with sharp apophyses on legs, chelicerae and pedipalps. Because of harvestmen´s dependence on chemical stimuli, we tested if M. cuspidatus would change its locomotory behaviour in the presence of chemicals of the recluse spider (medium threat situation; spider vs blank vs chemical control; one at a time). Subsequently, we tested harvestmen behaviour in the presence of the spider in close range, a high-threat situation. Finally, we looked at the survival rate of spiders after being pierced by sharp apophyses M. cuspidatus that have on the legs. The harvestmen only showed defensive behaviours in the high threat situation. Surprisingly, their mostly known defensive behaviours (chemical defence, tanathosis, pinching with chelicerae and pedipalps) were not seen even in the high threat situation. This is the first evidence that these behaviours are not used against a natural predator that has an almost 80...|$|E

40|$|Arthropods {{in several}} orders use traps to capture prey. Such trap-building predators expend {{most of their}} {{foraging}} energy prior to any prey contact. Nevertheless, relative investments in trap construction and actual prey capture may vary among trap builders, and {{they are likely to}} face a trade-off between building very effective but energetically costly traps and building less effective traps requiring faster reaction times when attacking prey. We analysed this trade-off in a field experiment by comparing the prey capture behaviour of four different sympatric web-building spiders (Araneae: Araneidae, Nephilidae, Tetragnathidae, Theridiidae) with the retention times of five different prey types in the webs of these spiders. Retention times differed greatly among webs and among prey types. The vertical orb webs retained prey longer than the horizontal orb <b>web</b> and the <b>sheet</b> <b>web,</b> and active prey escaped more quickly than less active prey. Among spiders with orb webs, the spider with the web that retained prey for the shortest time was the fastest to capture prey, thus confirming the expected trade-off between building long-retaining webs and attacking slowly versus building short-retaining webs and attacking more rapidly. The <b>sheet</b> <b>web,</b> however, neither retained prey for an appreciable period of time nor facilitated rapid prey capture. We suggest that this low capture effectiveness of <b>sheet</b> <b>webs</b> is compensated by their lower maintenance costs...|$|R
