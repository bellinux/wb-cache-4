He signed a contract forbidding disclosure of sensitive security materials, and had to promise not to visit any Arab or Communist countries for five years after his employment at the facility ended. He passed health checks, after which his training began. He was put through an intensive training course in physics, chemistry, mathematics, first aid, fire drill, and English. He did sufficiently well to be accepted, and was employed as a nuclear plant technician and shift manager in February 1977. Vanunu earned a high salary by Israeli standards, and lived well.

2500|$|Efforts made in 1975 {{to improve}} {{educational}} quality were unsuccessful. By 1980 it appeared doubtful that the politically oriented admission criteria had accomplished even {{the purpose of}} increasing enrollment of worker and peasant children. Successful candidates for university entrance were usually children of cadres and officials who used personal connections {{that allowed them to}} [...] "enter through the back door." [...] Students from officials' families would accept the requisite minimum two-year work assignment in the countryside, often in a suburban location that allowed them to remain close to their families. Village cadres, anxious to please the parents/officials, gladly recommended these youths for university placement after the labor requirement had been met. The child of an official family was then on his or her way to a university without having academic ability, a record of political activism, or a distinguished <b>work</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
