All these effects, {{except those}} of decomposition, were {{reproduced}} by two extended long wires, {{not having the}} form of helices, but placed close to each other; and thus it was proved that the extra current could {{be removed from the}} wire carrying the original current to a neighbouring wire, and was at the same time identified, in direction and every other respect, with the currents producible by induction (1089.). The case, therefore, of the bright spark and shock on disjunction may now be stated thus: If a current be established in a wire, and another <b>wire,</b> <b>forming</b> a complete circuit, be placed parallel to the first, at the moment the current in the first is stopped it induces a current in the same direction in the second, the first exhibiting then but a feeble spark; but if the second wire be away, disjunction of the first wire induces a current in itself in the same direction, producing a strong spark. The strong spark in the single long wire or helix, at the moment of disjunction, is therefore the equivalent of the current which would be produced in a neighbouring wire if such second current were permitted.|$|E

But as {{it might}} be {{supposed}} that in all the preceding experiments of this section, it was by some peculiar effect taking place during the formation of the magnet, and not by its mere virtual approximation, that the momentary induced current was excited, the following experiment was made. All the similar ends of the compound hollow helix (34.) were bound together by copper <b>wire,</b> <b>forming</b> two general terminations, and these were connected with the galvanometer. The soft iron cylinder (34.) was removed, and a cylindrical magnet, three quarters of an inch in diameter and eight inches and a half in length, used instead. One end of this magnet was introduced into the axis of the helix (fig. 4.), and then, the galvanometer-needle being stationary, the magnet was suddenly thrust in; immediately the needle was deflected {{in the same direction as}} if the magnet had been formed by either of the two preceding processes (34. 36.). Being left in, the needle resumed its first position, and then the magnet being withdrawn the needle was deflected in the opposite direction. These effects were not great; but by introducing and withdrawing the magnet, so that the impulse each time should be added to those previously communicated to the needle, the latter could be made to vibrate through an arc of 180° or more.|$|E

50|$|An ideal {{inductor}} {{would have no}} resistance or energy losses. However, real inductors have winding resistance from the metal <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> the coils. Since the winding resistance appears as a resistance in series with the inductor, it is often called the series resistance. The inductor's series resistance converts electric current through the coils into heat, thus causing a loss of inductive quality. The quality factor (or Q) of an inductor is the ratio of its inductive reactance to its resistance at a given frequency, and {{is a measure of}} its efficiency. The higher the Q factor of the inductor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal, lossless, inductor. High Q inductors are used with capacitors to make resonant circuits in radio transmitters and receivers. The higher the Q is, the narrower the bandwidth of the resonant circuit.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use braided copper <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> the shield. This {{allows the}} cable to be flexible, {{but it also}} means there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield. The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.|$|E

5000|$|Cloisonné first {{developed}} in the jewellery of the ancient Near East, typically in very small pieces such as rings, with thin <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> the cloisons. In the jewellery of Ancient Egypt, including the pectoral jewels of the Pharaohs, thicker strips form the cloisons, which remain small. In Egypt gemstones and enamel-like materials sometimes called [...] "glass-paste" [...] were both used. The Byzantines perfected a unique form of cloisonné icons. Byzantine enamel spread to surrounding cultures and a particular type, often known as garnet cloisonné is widely found in the Migration Period art of the [...] "barbarian" [...] peoples of Europe, who used gemstones, especially red garnets, as well as glass and enamel, with small thick-walled cloisons. Red garnets and gold made an attractive contrast of colours, and for Christians the garnet {{was a symbol of}} Christ. This type is now thought to have originated in the Late Antique Eastern Roman Empire and to have initially reached the Migration peoples as diplomatic gifts of objects probably made in Constantinople, then copied by their own goldsmiths. [...] Glass-paste cloisonné was made in the same periods with similar results - compare the gold Anglo-Saxon fitting with garnets (right) and the Visigothic brooch with glass-paste in the gallery. Thick ribbons of gold were soldered {{to the base of the}} sunken area to be decorated to make the compartments, before adding the stones or paste. [...] Sometimes compartments filled with the different materials of cut stones or glass and enamel are mixed to ornament the same object, as in the Sutton Hoo purse-lid. In the Byzantine world the technique was developed into the thin-wire style suitable only for enamel described below, which was imitated in Europe from about Carolingian period onwards.|$|E

For known {{well the}} {{contributions}} of both tension-compression-ratio of material and intermediate principal shear stress to <b>wire</b> <b>forming,</b> the <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> problem is developed based on unified strength theory. By denoting a notation of D, the unified stresses solution for <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> is gained, which is suitable to both wire drawing and extrusion. In addition, when material has identical strength in tension and compression, the stresses solution based on unified strength theory become that based on unified yield criterion.

Whether any yield criterion (e. g., Mises, Tresca or unified yield criterion) is adopted, for {{it is assumed that}} the tensile and compressive strength is equal to one another, the stresses solution is as same as that based on unified yield criterion, and is merely a special case of the unified stresses solution developed by this paper...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIndustrial {{decision-makers}} often try {{to develop}} new products by reusing their past experience. Methods for obtaining feedback are available in knowledge management and produce tangible results in the industrial world. Nowadays, companies often consider employees' knowledge as an asset. This approach is a potential answer for reusing knowledge acquired through experience. The Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) methodology, based on cognitive sciences, consists in solving new problems by reusing past experience. Case-Based Reasoning is an approach to solving a new problem by remembering and adapting a previous successful similar situation to the problem at hand. Of the four activities comprising CBR - Retrieve, Reuse, Revise, and Retain-this paper deals with the ''Retrieve'' phase. Consequently, we suggest using the Multi-Criteria Decisions concept in problem description {{to search for the}} solution in a case-based scenario. We show that Multi-Criteria Decisions and Case-Based Reasoning are complementary.

40|$|The electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow {{induced by}} the corona {{discharge}} was experimentally investigated in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). The ESP was a narrow horizontal Plexiglas box (1300 mm× 60 mm× 60 mm). The electrode set consisted of a single wire discharge electrode and two collecting aluminum plate electrodes. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method was used to visualize the EHD flow characteristics inside the ESP seeded with fine oil droplets. The influence of applied voltage (from 8 kV to 10 kV) and primary gas flow (0. 15 m/s, 0. 2 m/s, 0. 4 m/s) on the EHD flow transition was elucidated through experimental analysis. The formation and transition of typical EHD flows from onset to the fully developed were described and explained. Experimental {{results showed that the}} EHD flow patterns change depends on the gas velocity and applied voltage. EHD flow starts with flow streamlines near collecting plates bending towards the wire electrode, forming two void regions. An oscillating jet forming the downstream appeared and moved towards the wire electrode as voltage increased. For higher velocities (≥ 0. 2 m/s), the EHD transition became near wire phenomenon with a jet-like flow structure near the <b>wire,</b> <b>forming</b> a void region behind the wire and expanding as voltage increased.

40|$|AbstractWe study {{algorithmic}} {{aspects of}} bending wires and sheet metal into a specified structure. Problems {{of this type}} {{are closely related to}} the question of deciding whether a simple non-self-intersecting wire structure (a carpenter's ruler) can be straightened, a problem that was open for several years and has only recently been solved in the affirmative. If we impose some of the constraints that are imposed by the manufacturing process, we obtain quite different results. In particular, we study the variant of the carpenter's ruler problem {{in which there is a}} restriction that only one joint can be modified at a time. For a linkage that does not self-intersect or self-touch, the recent results of Connelly et al. and Streinu imply that it can always be straightened, modifying one joint at a time. However, we show that for a linkage with even a single vertex degeneracy, it becomes NP-hard to decide if it can be straightened while altering only one joint at a time. If we add the restriction that each joint can be altered at most once, we show that the problem is NP-complete even without vertex degeneracies. In the special case, arising in <b>wire</b> <b>forming</b> manufacturing, that each joint can be altered at most once, and must be done sequentially from one or both ends of the linkage, we give an efficient algorithm to determine if a linkage can be straightened...|$|E
