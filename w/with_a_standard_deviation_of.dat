5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who died}} of {{multiple}} organ failure additionally exhibited signs of skin hemorrhaging and necrosis, though both are otherwise rare. The two likely reasons for skin hemorrhaging and necrosis are an inability to effectively neutralize the venom, or unusually potent venom toxicity for that set of stings. In either case, these stings lead to multiple organ injury. While not everyone displayed lesions or necrosis, a strong correlation existed {{between the number of}} stings and the severity of injury. Those who died, on average, were stung 59 times (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> 12) while those who survived suffered 28 stings (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> 4).|$|E

25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, {{an investor}} may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E

40|$|We use {{published}} OGLE LMC/SMC data {{to present}} comprehensive Period-Color (PC) and Amplitude-Color (AC) relations for both fundamental and overtone stars. For fundamental mode stars, we confirm earlier work that the minimum light extinction corrected PC relation in V-I has a shallow slope but with considerable scatter (LMC: [0. 093 ± 0. 019] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> about {{this line of}} 0. 116, SMC: [0. 055 ± 0. 058] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> about this line of 0. 099). We note the high scatter about this line for both the LMC and SMC: either there is some source of uncertainty in extinction or some other physical parameter is responsible for this dispersion. We compare with previous results and discuss some possible causes for this scatter. In contrast, RRc overtone stars do not obey a flat PC relation at minimum light (LMC: [0. 604 ± 0. 041] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> about this line of 0. 109, SMC: [0. 472 ± 0. 265] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> about this line of 0. 091). The fact that fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars obey a flat relation at minimum light and overtone RR Lyrae stars do not {{is consistent with the}} interaction of the stellar photosphere and hydrogen ionization front. We compare these results with PC relations for fundamental and first overtone Cepheids. The fact that the PC relations change significantly as a function of phase indicates strongly that Cepheid and RR Lyrae relations can only be understood at mean light when their properties as a function of phase are determined.

2500|$|The idea of {{characteristic}} earthquakes was {{the basis}} of the Parkfield prediction: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>of</b> ±3.1 years. Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval). The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the trend, which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters. [...] However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade late. This seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are quasi-periodic, and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{population}} of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values.
