30|$|The {{prices of}} camel hides also varied at primary-market level, {{depending}} on the curing methods. Sun-dried hide prices ranged from KES 150 to 300 (US$ 1.9 to 3.8), while <b>wet-salted</b> <b>hide</b> prices ranged from KES 400 to 600 (US$ 5 to 7.6). There were no raw hides as they were cured at the stores. At the tanneries, the prices of sun-dried camel hides ranged from KES 400 to 500 (US$ 5 to 6.3), while the wet-salted hides were sold from KES 700 to 800 (US$ 8.8 to 10). This study also revealed that camel hides were sold to five tanneries in Kenya, including Aziz Din, Mnasi, Zogo, Sagana and Bata leather tanneries (in Limuru town), and to the leather industries of Kenya in Thika town.|$|E
50|$|Preparing hides {{begins by}} curing them with salt. Curing is {{employed}} to prevent putrefaction of the protein substance (collagen) from bacterial growth {{during the time}} lag from procuring the hide to when it is processed. Curing removes water from the hides and skins using a difference in osmotic pressure. The moisture content of hides and skins is greatly reduced, and osmotic pressure increased, {{to the point that}} bacteria are unable to grow. In <b>wet-salting,</b> the <b>hides</b> are heavily salted, then pressed into packs for about 30 days. In brine-curing, the hides are agitated in a saltwater bath for about 16 hours. Curing can also be accomplished by preserving the hides and skins at very low temperatures.|$|R
3000|$|Camel hides {{were the}} least valued as {{compared}} to hides of cattle and skins from small ruminants. The prices of camel hides were the lowest, with no differences for all grades despite their weight, as compared to those of cattle, since the average weight of a <b>wet-salted</b> camel <b>hide</b> was 18 kg, while that of a cow was 12 kg. This {{study found that the}} prices of hides were determined by the different curing methods used. The prices at the producers' level of sun-dried hides (suspension-dried and ground-dried) were the lowest, ranging from KES 50 to 150 (US$ 0.6 to 1.9). Those of raw hides ranged from KES 150 to 300 (US$ 1.9 to 3.8), while the wet-salted had the highest price ranging from KES 300 to 600 (US$ 3.8 to 7.6) [...]...|$|R
