25|$|We’re {{so lucky}} to have gotten here, and if we {{look back on the}} fact that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E
25|$|With the {{way that}} {{everything}} is being done, with people like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring to us that when you're doing things on your own {{you can do whatever}} you want. Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and have the freedom to release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E

25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the eve of a General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{received}} poorly {{and failed to}} chart or improve Powderfinger's platform despite the respectable success of its predecessor, Transfusion. Critics complained about its poor imitation of Americana and grunge, {{as well as its}} overuse of complex riffs. In a 2004 interview, Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning said, in reference to the album, [...] "God knows what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> then." [...] Three singles were released from the album, all of which failed to chart.|$|E

Cher later commented on this period: [...] "I {{could do a}} whole album... in three days... <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the road... and we were doing the Sonny & Cher Show".|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} to start on September 15, 2012. Principal photography commenced in October 2012 and concluded in November after 42 days; filming took place in New Mexico. The production received a 25% tax credit for filming in the state. Berg shot Lone Survivor with creative autonomy as Universal did not fully oversee the film's production. [...] "Not having the studio there every day ...

He also said that in making Parables for Wooden Ears, Powderfinger [...] "went through this weird stage of trying to be something [...] weren't." [...] Fanning also told Australian Musician that the album, a [...] "spectacular failure", was a result of the band feeling [...] "forced" [...] to play like other bands that were popular in Brisbane at the time.|$|E

500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> a trip when we made it... every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what we were on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping. Fantasia was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Holmes {{noted that}} he had outlived most of his friends, {{including}} Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. As he said, [...] "I feel like my own survivor... <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> deck together as we began the voyage of life... Then the craft which held us began going to pieces." [...] His last public appearance was at a reception for the National Education Association in Boston on February 23, 1893, where he presented the poem [...] "To the Teachers of America". A month later, Holmes wrote to Harvard president Charles William Eliot that the university should consider adopting the honorary doctor of letters degree and offer one to Samuel Francis Smith, though one was never issued.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited harmonica player, guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy, guitarist Wayne Moss, guitarist and bassist Joe South, and drummer Kenny Buttrey. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles—partitions separating the musicians {{so that there}} was [...] "an ambience fit for an ensemble". Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, [...] "as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> a tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart". Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions.|$|E

500|$|The band Them {{was signed}} by Phil Solomon, who {{contracted}} producer Bert Berns {{to work with the}} group, and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist. The group became popular with songs including [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Here Comes the Night". Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort of thing.

500|$|In a 2015 interview, Cris Kirkwood {{said that}} {{following}} Frusciante's {{departure from the}} Chili Peppers in 1992 he auditioned for his band the Meat Puppets. Kirkwood said [...] "“He showed up with his guitar out of its case and barefoot. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> a major label then, we just got signed, and those guys had blown up {{to where they were}} at and John needed to get out. John gets to our pad and we started getting ready to play and I said, ‘You want to use my tuner?’ He said, ‘No, I’ll bend it in.’ It was so far out. Then we jammed but it didn’t come to anything. Maybe he wasn’t in the right place and we were a tight little unit. It just didn’t quite happen but it could have worked." ...|$|E

[...] "We were sent a track which had this awful DRM attached and it was frustrating us trying to play it through dial-up connection. Someone else sent us another track which was a simple MP3." [...] Tanaka eventually {{came up with the}} idea of a ball that [...] "connected through things". Knight didn't quite understand the idea at first, but through a process of miscommunication, they wrote the video's treatment about [...] "a crazy basketball" [...] which was the quickest treatment they had ever written at the time.|$|E

500|$|Monáe {{has said}} about the {{recording}} sessions [...] "Over {{the last year and}} a half when we were recording the ArchAndroid I went through a very transformative period in my life". Monáe completed the album in Atlanta at the Wondaland Studios and the famous asylum The Palace of the Dogs. Monáe has stated that the album signifies [...] "breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types". She has said of recording the album, [...] "Overall, this music came from various corners of the world—from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta—places <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> tour. While recording, we’d experiment with different sounds. Once we became engulfed in the sound, we all had an emotional connection to the album. It has definitely transformed my way of thinking, the way that I approach the stage and overall, my life".|$|E
500|$|On 18 October, The Sun {{reported}} that McGuire {{had left the}} band. At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia, he said: [...] "The pressure of the tour was just too much. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the road {{all the time and}} I guess I wasn't as strong {{as the rest of the}} band. When we got into the studio I had the shakes. I mean I was playing the right notes, but not in the right places." [...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E

The episode was initially written to feature a lesbian kiss between Hearst's character and Keri Lynn Pratt's character, Hallie, when the two were discovered to be having an affair. However, The CW, the network the series aired on, stepped in and decided to cut the scene before it was filmed. Hearst reported, [...] "I meet Keri and I'm like, 'Hello.' We didn't know until <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the set we couldn't actually kiss. We were all set for that." [...] AOL TV commented that the network might have made the choice to prevent [...] "Lord of the Pi's" [...] from becoming a lesbian kiss episode involving an older woman, while AfterEllen.com called the choice [...] "bizarre".|$|E
