500|$|At Cubzac, on {{the high}} rocky {{shoreline}} overlooking the Dordogne, and in the town centre, are {{the ruins of the}} castle [...] "des Quatre fils Aymon" [...] within ordinary houses. The entrance of the fortress is flanked by the remains of two towers. These few stones are however extraordinarily rich in history and legend. First off, the castle did not belong to the four sons of Aymon who lived, perhaps, the time of Charlemagne. It was built and rebuilt in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It was the seat of the lordship of Cubzaguais. In 1206, John Lackland, the king of England and youngest son of Eleanor of Aquitaine, took revenge of the king of France Philippe Auguste, who accused him of treason and deprived him of his fiefs, by engaging in miscellaneous abuses. He stormed the castle of Cubzac, and destroyed it. It is a brief English victory. The lordship returns to the French, and is attributed to Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, son of the terrible and bloody winner of the Albigensian Crusade. He built a new castle deemed impregnable, on behalf of the King of England, <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls,</b> and yet it is the one for which ruins remain. He was sacked by the Gascon barons revolted against Simon de Montfort. Half sacked, it served as a stately home, until moving to the lordship Bouih.

60|$|Here the {{fishermen}} lived, sleeping away the bitter winter. In the late autumn {{they had left}} the fishing village at Harbor Weal, driven out like the wild ducks by the fierce gales that raged over the whole coast. With their abundant families and scant provisions they had followed the trail up the Southwest Brook till it doubled around the mountain and led into a great silent wood, sheltered on every side by the encircling hills. Here the tilts were built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls,</b> filled in between with leaves and moss, to help the little stoves that struggled bravely with the terrible cold; and the roofs were covered over with poles and bark, or with the brown sails that had once driven the fishing-boats out and in {{on the wings of}} the gale. The high mountains on the west stood between them and the icy winds that swept down over the sea from the Labrador and the Arctic wastes; wood in abundance was at their doors, and the trout-stream that sang all day long under its bridges of snow and ice was always ready to brim their kettles out of its abundance.|$|E
60|$|They removed Mary to Fotheringay Castle for her trial, and lawyers, counselors, commissioners, and {{officers}} of state began to assemble there from all quarters. The castle was a spacious structure. It was surrounded with two moats, and <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls,</b> and was strongly fortified. It contained numerous and spacious apartments, {{and it had}} especially one large hall which was well adapted to {{the purposes of this}} great trial. The preparations for the solemn ordeal through which Mary was now to pass, brought her forth from the obscurity in which she had so long been lost to the eyes of mankind, and made her the universal object of interest and attention in England, Scotland, and France. The people of all these nations looked on with great interest at the spectacle of one queen tried solemnly on a charge of high treason against another. The stories of her beauty, her graces, her misfortunes, which had slumbered for eighteen years, were all now revived, and every body felt a warm interest in the poor captive, worn down by long confinement, and trembling in the hands of what they feared would be a merciless and terrible power.|$|E

The emphasis is put upon {{the application of the}} dissipative properties of a thin air layer between two flexible plates. Vibration energy is converted into heat by the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the air between the plates. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop and to validate efficient models including viscothermal wave propagation for <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> panels which make it possible to investigate the noise reduction for both airborne and structure borne noise at low frequencies...|$|R
30|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{study was}} carried out using a potentiostat PGZ 100 piloted by Voltamaster software. This potentiostat is connected to a cell with three electrode thermostats <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> (Tacussel Standard CEC/TH). A saturated calomel electrode and platinum electrode were used as reference and auxiliary electrodes, respectively. The material used for constructing the working electrode was the same with that used for the gravimetric measurements. The surface area exposed to the electrolyte is 0.04 cm 2.|$|R
60|$|Next, {{the mass}} of organic bricks, or 'cells' as they are {{technically}} called, thus formed, acquires an orderly arrangement, becoming converted into a hollow spheroid <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> Then, upon one side of this spheroid, appears a thickening, and, by and bye, in {{the centre of the}} area of thickening, a straight shallow groove (Fig. 13, A) marks the central line of the edifice which is to be raised, or, in other words, indicates the position of the middle line of the body of the future dog. The substance bounding the groove on each side next rises up into a fold, the rudiment of the side wall of that long cavity, which will eventually lodge the spinal marrow and the brain; and in the floor of this chamber appears a solid cellular cord, the so-called 'notochord.' One end of the inclosed cavity dilates to form the head (Fig. 13, B), the other remains narrow, and eventually becomes the tail; the side walls of the body are fashioned out of the downward continuation of the walls of the groove; and from them, by and bye, grow out little buds which, by degrees, assume the shape of limbs. Watching the fashioning process stage by stage, one is forcibly reminded of the modeller in clay. Every part, every organ, is at first, as it were, pinched up rudely, and sketched out in the rough; then shaped more accurately; and only, at last, receives the touches which stamp its final character.|$|E
50|$|Loughmacrory has a {{good example}} of a wedge tomb. It is a burial chamber of six people with a front chamber and doorway marked by three stones, <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> made of large upright stones, and a roof of flat stones.|$|E
50|$|The battery {{along with}} 2 six in gun emplacements and {{observation}} posts was re-utilised during World War II {{to defend the}} approaches to Botany Bay. During WWII, it was armed with two 18-pounder Mk IV field guns and two QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns. The underground bunker and tunnel complex consisted of vaulted ammunition storage rooms <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> and ceilings. The doubling up of walls and ceilings was a preventative measure meant to stop the walls from collapsing {{in the event of}} a direct hit. The battery is currently not in use.|$|E

50|$|The {{buildings}} were generally built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> dry-stone walls packed with earth, and were roofed with wooden rafters {{covered with a}} thatch of turf with cereal straw or reed. The floor was generally flagstones or packed earth {{and there was a}} central hearth for the fire. There was no chimney for the smoke to escape through. Instead the smoke made its way through the roof. This led to the soot blackening of the interior which may also have contributed to the adoption of name blackhouse.|$|R
50|$|According to {{architect}} restorer, Leopoldo Torres Balbás, the Alcazaba of Málaga is {{the prototype}} of military architecture in the Taifa period, <b>with</b> its <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> and massive entry fortifications.

He invented a number of tools that revolutionized the ice-harvesting business and increased its productivity greatly. He also invented above-ground ice houses, <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> for insulation.

5000|$|Schneider {{rebuilt the}} rooms inside the German {{pavilion}} into a similar house <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> and double floors {{on the ground}} in a house just as he did in Rheydt. He remodeled a late 19th-century entrance with columns as standard door entrance with a letterbox-slot and aged doorbell panels on the side. Inside windows could not be opened to the outside. [...] "One builds what one no longer knows", Schneider commented about his installation. Within the Biennale the work has also been interpreted as a subtle political declaration, because the German pavilion building from 1909 has been often considered as the most [...] "intimidating" [...] building [...] "in the area of the Giardini".|$|E
50|$|The rock fort is 900 ft {{tall and}} has a {{circumference}} of 2.75 km. Cannon and gunfire artillery {{were included in the}} fort during the 17th century. The fort was cemented <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> to withstand heavy artillery. Cannons were installed at vantage points around the fort with an arms and ammunition godown built with safety measures. The double-walled rooms were fully protected against external threat and were well ventilated by round ventilation holes in the roof. A thin brick wall {{in one corner of the}} godown helped soldiers escape in case of emergency. The sloping ceiling of the godown prevented seepage of rainwater. The fort has 48 rooms that were once used as cells to lodge war prisoners and slaves, a spacious kitchen, a horse stable and a meeting hall for the army commanders. The fort also has its own rainwater reservoirs constructed by taking advantage of the steep gradient. The construction highlights the ingenuity of Indian kings in their military architecture.|$|E
50|$|Over twelve {{working days}} the crew built the two-story main house <b>with</b> <b>double</b> wooden <b>walls,</b> a main deposit, an {{emergency}} house, five metal warehouses for supplies, {{housing for the}} dog packs, a power generator and the four towers for the 25 m high rhombic antenna.|$|R

Species from Australian collections {{appear to be}} more subglobose than those seen from the United States, raising the possibility that the latter are not the same species.|$|R
5000|$|The wooden gas chambers, built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> {{insulated}} by earth packed down in between, were {{disguised as}} the shower barracks, {{so that the}} victims would not realize the true purpose of the facility. The gassing itself, which took about 30 minutes, was conducted by Hackenholt with the Ukrainian guards and a Jewish aide. Removing the bodies from the gas chambers, burying them, sorting and repairing the victims' clothing for shipping was performed by Sonderkommando work-details. The workshops for the Jewish prisoners, and the barracks for the Ukrainian guards, were separated from the [...] "processing" [...] zone behind an embankment of the old Otto Line with the barb-wire on top. Most Jews from the corpse-unit (the Totenjuden) were killed periodically and replaced by new arrivals, {{so that they would}} neither organize a revolt nor survive to tell about the camp's purpose. [...] The German SS and the administration were housed in two cottages outside the camp.|$|E
5000|$|The tender Warrington {{brought the}} working party and {{materials}} {{to the harbor}} {{in the summer of}} 1870. A lighthouse tender was a smaller ship that would take care of its supported lights. They would come to service the station, keeping it stocked with food, supplies, and construction materials. Work was completed in early summer of 1871. The base was 10 ft below the ground, with the base of nineteen feet tapering off to 12 ft right below the gallery. The new tower was built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> Though the winds and the waves here at Presque Isle would not be nearly as rough as they could be at more remote locations like Stannard’s Rock, the walls would still stand strong against any harsh weather Lake Huron could deliver. A spiral cast iron stairway led the Lighthouse keeper 138 steps to the top gallery. This plan was so unique and elegant that it inspired several other lighthouses around the Great Lakes to copy its design. (Outer Island and Au Sable Point on Lake Superior, and Big Sable Point Light and Grosse Point Light on Lake Michigan were recreated using a similar structure.) ...|$|E
50|$|East of Bahawalpur is the Cholistan Desert {{which covers}} {{an area of}} about 15,000 km2 and extends into the Thar Desert of India. The region was once watered by the Hakra River, known as the Saravati in vedic times. At one time there were 400 forts {{in the area and}} archaeological finds around the Derawar Fort, the only place with a {{perennial}} waterhole, indicate that it was contemporaneous with the Indus Valley Civilisation. The average annual rainfall is only 12 cm, and the little cultivation there is, is made possible by underground wells, drawn up by the camels. The water is stored in troughs, built by the tribes, between sandhills and din waterholes called tobas. The people are racially similar to those in Rajasthan - tall, with sharp features. They live in large, round, mud and grass huts, usually built on the top of sandhills. On the whole, they are pastoral and nomadic. The main tribes are the Chhachhar, Mehr, Lar, Paryar, Channar, Chandani and Bohar. The forts here were built at 29 km intervals, which probably served as guard posts for the camel caravan routes. There were three rows of these forts. the first line of forts began from Phulra and ended in Lera, the second from Rukhanpur to Islamgarh, and the third from Bilcaner to Kapoo. They are all in ruins now, {{and you can see that}} they were built <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> of gypsum blocks and mud. Some of them date back to 1000 BC, and were destroyed and rebuilt many times.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was initially}} designed by Lieutenant George Gordon Meade. Later, Lt. William Raynolds, who succeeded Meade {{as head of}} the 4th and 7th Lighthouse Districts, improved the strength of the lighthouse <b>with</b> a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> design. The lighthouse and oil house construction was accomplished by Captain Edward Yorke, who arrived December 31, 1859 and completed the tower in May 1860. It was lit July 10, 1860.|$|R
50|$|It took 47 days {{of labor}} to {{dynamite}} the rock, {{lay down the}} groundwork for the radio antennae and build the main house: a semi-prefabricated building 27 m long and 7.50 m wide, <b>with</b> thermally insulated <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> and ceilings.

5000|$|The [...] "rear" [...] {{range light}} was {{constructed}} 2300 ft {{south of the}} mouth of the river. Eleventh district engineer Major Godfrey Weitzel's design for the combined rear range tower and dwelling was unique. A large elevated concrete base was to support a combined brick dwelling and tower. Because of swampy ground, timber piles had to be driven deep into the ground to provide a solid foundation on which timber forms for the concrete base could be erected and filled. Atop this concrete foundation, a square two-story Cream City brick Lighthouse keeper's dwelling 26 ft in plan was constructed. Integrated into the northwest corner of the dwelling, a tapered 53 ft-tall square tower <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> housed a set of prefabricated cast iron spiral stairs. Winding from the cellar to the lantern, these stairs also serve as the only means of access to the first and second floors by way of landings on each floor. Each was outfitted with tightly fitting arch-topped iron doors designed to stem the spread of fire between floors. A timber deck supported by timber columns encircled the dwelling at the first floor level, providing easy and dry access to all sides of the structure. The living quarters consisted of a kitchen, parlor and oil storage room on the first floor, and three bedrooms above. The tower was capped with a square iron gallery, supported by five cast iron corbels on each of its four sides. An octagonal cast iron lantern was installed at its center, with a fixed white fourth-order Fresnel lens placed at a focal plane of 61 feet.|$|E
5000|$|Potsdamer Platz is a {{historic}} square {{in the heart of}} Berlin Germany, which had been largely destroyed during World-II, then divided by the Berlin Wall between East and West Berlin. When a major reconstruction was commenced in 1990. Piano was selected to design the new buildings on five of the fifteen sites of the project, with the requirement that the buildings have roofs of copper, and facades of clear glass and materials of a baked earth color. Other architects engaged in the enormous project included Rafael Moneo, Arata Isozaki, and his former partner, Richard Rogers. The centerpiece of Piano's part of the project was the Debis building, composed of four different buildings of different sizes but in the same style. Distinctive elements include an atrium 28 meters high, and a 21-story tower whose east, south and west facades are covered <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> of glass separated by 70 centimeters, which reduced the need for air conditioning and heating. The complex also included an IMAX movie theater, restaurant and shops. The 36 meter dome of the IMAX theater, was visible from a distance and also from the street, through the clear glass of the facade. Piano wrote in The Disobedience of the Architect (2004) that he tried to match his architecture to the personality of a city. [...] "The Berliners are accustomed to living outdoors, and to a certain form of conviviality." [...] The new Potsdamer Platz was designed to capture the Berliner's [...] "sense of gaiety, their sense of humor....Why should a city be demoralizing?

40|$|A {{series of}} well-aligned arrays of copper chalcogenide nanostructures, {{including}} CU 7 S 4 and CU 2 -xSe nanotubes <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> {{have been successfully}} prepared by using Cu(OH) (2) nanorods as sacrificial templates. This new method is based on layer-by-layer chemical conversion and inward etching of. the sacrificial templates, which is essentially a kind of lithography inside the Cu(OH) (2) nanorods. The key step of the process involves repeated formation of the copper chalcogenide wall and {{the dissolution of the}} Cu(OH) 2 core for two consecutive cycles. A large difference of the solubility product (K-sp) between the copper chalcogenicle wall and the Cu(OH) 2 core materials is crucial for the direct replacement of one type of anions by the other.

40|$|In this study, Pt {{nanoparticles}} are {{deposited on}} the surface of nitrogen-sulfur functionalized reduced graphene oxide and mixed <b>with</b> <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> carbon nanotubes (Pt/NS-rGO/DWCNT). The obtained nanocomposite is used as an electrocatalyst for the ethanol electro-oxidation reaction (EOR). CO oxidation studies with differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) show a lower onset potential indicating higher poisoning tolerance of these materials. The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/NS-rGO/DWCNT nanocomposite is studied at different temperatures (40, 50, 60, and 70  °C) and compared with that of Pt/rGO, Pt/rGO/DWCNT composites and commercial carbon-supported Pt catalyst. Pt/rGO/DWCNT and Pt/NS-rGO/DWCNT display significantly higher ethanol electro-oxidation currents especially at low potentials relevant to fuel cell applications. At high temperatures (> 50  °C), Pt/NS-rGO/DWCNT is the most active catalyst in concordance with its higher apparent activation energy. Pt/NS-rGO/DWCNT is also the most durable of the catalysts after a 500 potential cycle test and suffers the least from poisoning effects during chronopotentiometric testing. These results allow to conclude that combining NS-functionalized graphene catalyst support with DWCNT to form a composite provides excellent performances due to enhanced Pt electrocatalytic activity from NS-functionalization and enhanced mass transfer from the DWCNT filler.
