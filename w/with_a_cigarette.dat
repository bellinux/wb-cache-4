5|$|The Nixons {{moved to}} a gated complex in Park Ridge, New Jersey, in 1991. Pat's health was failing, {{and the house was}} smaller and {{contained}} an elevator. A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself to be seen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> in public, she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer, emphysema, and ultimately lung cancer, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems.|$|E
5|$|The deadliest fire in Davenport history came on January 7, 1950, when 41 {{people were}} killed in a fire at the St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a mental ward {{operated}} by Mercy Hospital. Most of the people who lost their lives were female patients trapped behind windows locked shut by rusty, iron bars. The cause was attributed to a patient who was lighting curtains on fire <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> lighter.|$|E
5|$|That night, Scully {{talks to}} Mulder {{over the phone}} and informs him that Pudovkin is a con man {{and part of the}} Russian mafia. Frustrated by the conversation, Scully calls Jerse and tells him that she changed her mind. At a nearby lounge, Scully is {{concerned}} about Ed's arm, where he has burned the tattoo <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> butt. Ed convinces Scully to get a tattoo, and she has one of an Ouroboros applied to her back. Scully stays at Ed's apartment. The tattoo is angry at him, saying she will be dead if he kisses her, which he does anyway.|$|E

5|$|Originally, EVE {{would have}} been {{electrocuted}} by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection {{at the hands of}} the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the Ratatouille short film Your Friend the Rat, created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.|$|E
25|$|Rob's father, Francis Wilco is {{a retired}} {{firefighter}} and {{former member of the}} United States Marine Corps (1969–1974) who presumably saw time in Vietnam. He reluctantly pet-sits Bucky and Satchel from time to time, has thinning hair, and is usually pictured <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> dangling from his mouth.|$|E
25|$|Nightclubbing {{claimed the}} number 1 slot on NMEs Album of the Year list. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 40 on {{its list of}} Best Albums of the 1980s. Nightclubbing is now widely {{considered}} Jones' best studio album. The album's cover art is a painting of Jones by Jean-Paul Goude. Jones {{is presented as a}} man wearing an Armani suit jacket, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> in her mouth and a flattop haircut. While promoting the album, Jones slapped chat-show host Russell Harty live on air after he had turned to interview other guests, making Jones feel she was being ignored.|$|E

25|$|Brynner began smoking heavily at age 12, and {{although}} his promotional photos often showed him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> in hand, he quit the habit in 1971. In September 1983, {{he found a}} lump on his vocal cords. In Los Angeles, only hours before his 4,000th performance in The King and I, he received the test results indicating that while his throat was fine, he had inoperable lung cancer. He and the national tour of the musical were forced {{to take a few}} months off while he underwent radiation therapy, which hurt his throat and made it impossible for him to sing or speak easily. The tour then resumed.|$|E
25|$|Female smokers in film {{were also}} early on {{associated}} with a type of sensuous and seductive sexuality, most notably personified by German film star Marlene Dietrich. Similarly, actors like Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn have been closely identified with their smoker persona, {{and some of their}} most famous portraits and roles have involved them being haloed by a mist of cigarette smoke. Hepburn often enhanced the glamor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> holder, most notably in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Smoking could also be used as a means to subvert censorship, as two cigarettes burning unattended in an ashtray were often used to suggest sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|While Mel Gibson {{financed the}} film through his Icon Productions, Disney {{signed on to}} {{distribute}} Apocalypto for a fee in certain markets under the Touchstone Pictures label. The publicity for the film started with a December 2005 teaser trailer that was filmed {{before the start of}} principal photography and before Rudy Youngblood was cast as Jaguar Paw. As a joke, Gibson inserted a subliminal cameo of the bearded director in a plaid shirt <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> hanging from his mouth posing next to a group of dust-covered Maya. A clean-shaven Gibson also filmed a Mayan-language segment for the introduction of the 2006 Academy Awards in which he declined to host the ceremony.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} he made his last film, Querelle (1982), Fassbinder was using drugs and alcohol {{as a way to}} assist his unrelenting schedule. On the night of 9–10 June 1982, Wolf Gremm, {{director}} of the film Kamikaze 1989 (1982), which starred Fassbinder, was staying in his apartment. Early that evening, Fassbinder retired to his bedroom. He was working on notes for a future film, Rosa L, based on the life of Polish-German revolutionary socialist Rosa Luxemburg. Fassbinder was watching television while reading when, shortly after 1 a.m., he {{received a phone call from}} his friend and assistant Harry Baer. At 3:30 a.m, when Juliane Lorenz arrived home, she heard the noise of the television in Fassbinder's room, but she could not hear him snoring. Though not allowed to enter the room uninvited, she went in and discovered his lifeless body <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> still between his lips. A thin ribbon of blood trickled from one nostril.|$|E

Upon being scouted out {{of college}} by Canucks personnel, his style of play was {{compared}} to offensive defenceman Christian Ehrhoff. Not aggressive, Tanev relies primarily on his positioning to check players. Following his performance in Game 5 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, teammate Kevin Bieksa also highlighted his calm on-ice demeanor, quipping that [...] "he could have played <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> in his mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|Reubens had {{not always}} thought of his {{character}} as one for children, but sometime during the mid-1980s, he started forming Pee-wee into the best role model he possibly could, making of his show a morally positive show that cared about issues like racial diversity. Reubens was also careful on what should be associated to Pee-wee. Being a heavy smoker, he {{went to great lengths}} never to be photographed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> in his mouth, even refusing to endorse candy bars and other kinds of junk food, all the while trying to release his own sugar-free cereal [...] "Ralston Purina Pee-wee Chow cereal", a project that died after a blind test.|$|E
500|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name. At the Trocadero club, a converted cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool, he first saw an [...] "auburn-haired girl with a bright smile and high cheekbones"; Julia Stanley. [...] He saw her again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Lennon, who {{was dressed in a}} bowler hat and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> holder in hand, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. Julia (14 years old) said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old Alf replied that she looked [...] "lovely", and sat down next to her.

500|$|On {{her first}} day working at Ralph Lauren, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) tries {{to get along with}} her new {{colleague}} and boss, Nancy and Kim. The latter two are smokers, and go on a cigarette break, which Rachel can't join as she doesn't smoke and she is angered to find that Nancy and Kim are busy making company decisions without her during the smoking break. Rachel fears for her position, as Kim and Nancy spend more time together during smoking breaks and have a better chance to bond, and thus Nancy is most probably going to get promotions. To make an effort and bond with her co-workers, Rachel goes with them and smokes a cigarette. She is not enthusiastic to fall into the bad habit and tries to talk Kim and Nancy into quitting which comes to no avail, later catching them smoking behind her back. Kim warns Rachel that she would fire her if she catches her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> as she doesn't want to [...] "drag her down with them". She forces Rachel to leave, just as she invites Nancy to go on a business trip to Paris with her.|$|E
500|$|Barrett did not {{contribute}} material to the band after A Saucerful of Secrets was released in 1968. Of the songs he wrote for Pink Floyd after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, only one, [...] "Jugband Blues", {{made it to the}} band's second album; one, [...] "Apples and Oranges", became a less-than-successful single; and two others, [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man", were never officially released until 2016 in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set, as they were deemed too dark and unsettling. Feeling guilty for ousting their friend, the members of Pink Floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Rick Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, Wright had the awful job of telling Barrett that he was going out to buy cigarettes while he went off to play a gig. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> burned completely down between his fingers (an incident later referenced in Pink Floyd's The Wall). Emerging from catatonia and unaware that {{a long period of time}} had elapsed, Barrett would ask, [...] "Have you got the cigarettes?". Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, in the reception area, waiting to be invited in. He also showed up to a few gigs and glared at Gilmour. Barrett played slide guitar on [...] "Remember a Day" [...] (which had been first attempted during the Piper sessions), and also played on [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". On 6 April 1968, the group officially announced Barrett was no longer a member, the same day the band's contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated as the record label. Considering Barrett to be the musical brains of the band, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett.|$|E
500|$|Norway's {{prohibition}} from 1916 onwards {{opened up}} possibilities for a lucrative criminal career, and Andersen joined up in 1921 with old friends {{from his days}} at Toftes gave in grand-scale smuggling operations. Using ingenious methods for hiding the spirits, they smuggled alcohol into Norway by sea. In his smuggling years Andersen cooperated with future award-winning author Arthur Omre, serving as both crew and skipper on Omre's boats before getting his own smuggling vessel. Eventually his cover was blown, and being a wanted man in Norway he had to flee to Germany. While in Germany he worked {{for one of the}} biggest suppliers of spirits for the illegal Norwegian market. In 1925 Norway requested that Germany extradite him, and he was arrested in the harbour of Hamburg. Prison life was harsh, but Andersen managed to get transferred to a hospital when faking syphilis by burning his member <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b> He was then deported under police escort back to Norway on the steamship Kong Dag, but when the ship entered the Oslofjord, Andersen escaped by jumping overboard near Spro. For several months he was on the run before being recaptured. In the years that followed he {{was in and out of}} prison repeatedly. He gained considerable renown for his elegantly executed burglaries, being labelled by the media [...] "gentleman-forbryter i Grünerløkka-utgave" [...] (...) [...] He was also well known for his safe-cracking skills. Andersen once more tried to evade justice when he fled a crowded court room in Drammen in 1929, jumping out a window as the sentence was being proclaimed. He was then smuggled from Drammen inside a chest of drawers which was to be repaired in Oslo. He was recaptured shortly before intending to board a cargo ship bound for Canada.|$|E
