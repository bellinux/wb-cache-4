40|$|To {{establish}} whether {{changes in}} skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency contribute to increased energy expenditure and decreased metabolic efficiency of overeating rats <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> thermogenesis, we measured basal proton leak, fatty acid-induced uncoupling and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP 3) content in subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar skeletal muscle mitochondria. Intermyofibrillar, but not subsarcolemmal, mitochondria from rats <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> thermogenesis exhibited a lower proton leak compared with controls. In both mitochondrial populations from rats <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> thermogenesis, fatty acid-induced uncoupling was increased significantly {{and a small}} recoupling effect of GDP was detected. In addition, intermyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria from rats <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> thermogenesis showed higher UCP 3 contents than controls. These results point out that metabolic efficiency in subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria from rats <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> thermogenesis is differently regulated. In fact, in intermyofibrillar mitochondria both basal proton leak and fatty acid-induced uncoupling are altered, while in subsarcolemmal mitochondria only fatty acid-induced uncoupling increases. Both mitochondrial populations in skeletal muscle cells from rats <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> thermogenesis display an increased fatty acid-induced uncoupling and UCP 3 content, which could contribute to avoiding obesity...|$|R
