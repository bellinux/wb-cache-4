5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, {{a person in the}} desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E

A 2007 article by Bruce Bawer published in City Journal magazine and a subsequent article in February 2009 by Barbara Kay in the National Post criticised some of Galtung's statements. Both authors criticized Galtung's opinion that while Communist China was [...] "repressive in a certain liberal sense", Mao Zedong was [...] "endlessly liberating when seen from many other perspectives that liberal theory has never understood" [...] because China showed that [...] "the whole theory about what an 'open society' is must be rewritten, probably also the theory of 'democracy'—and it {{will take a long time}} before the West <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> view China as a master teacher in such subjects."

2500|$|When {{technological}} progress occurs, the supply curve shifts. [...] For example, assume that someone invents {{a better way}} of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases. [...] Otherwise stated, producers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve S1 outward, to S2—an increase in supply. This increase in supply causes the equilibrium price to decrease from P1 to P2. The equilibrium quantity increases from Q1 to Q2 as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price. As a result of a supply curve shift, the price and the quantity move in opposite directions. [...] If the quantity supplied decreases, the opposite happens. If the supply curve starts at S2, and shifts leftward to S1, the equilibrium price will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded. The quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift, reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted. But due to the change (shift) in supply, the equilibrium quantity and price have changed.|$|E
