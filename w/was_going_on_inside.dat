By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> of me.

Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

Some of Uthman's slaves counter-attacked, one of whom killed the assassin and was in turn killed by the rebels.|$|E

Jerkins had distanced himself from the project following its official release, declaring his dissatisfaction with the involvement of other producers on the album.|$|E
2500|$|Discussion of the {{literary}} genre includes whether what is represented is a history, a parable, a myth, or compound of various genres. This relates {{to the reality of}} the encounter. Sometimes the temptation narrative is taken as a parable, reading that Jesus in his ministry told this narrative to audiences relating his inner experience {{in the form of a}} parable. Or it is autobiographical, regarding what sort of Messiah Jesus intended to be. Writers including William Barclay have pointed to the fact that there is [...] "no mountain high enough in all the world to see the whole world" [...] as indication of the non-literal nature of the event, and that the narrative portrays what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> Jesus' mind. Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas explained, [...] "In regard to the words, 'He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,' we are not to understand that He saw the very kingdoms, with the cities and inhabitants, their gold and silver: but that the devil pointed out the quarters in which each kingdom or city lay, and set forth to Him in words their glory and estate." ...|$|E

[...] Luka Neskovic also wrote an article for The Huffington Post, [...] "How The Media Shattered The Man in the Mirror" [...] in which he said, [...] "...Except for this trial was declared a [...] "trial of the century" [...] and displayed media at their worst. Sensationalism, exclusivity, negativity, excentricism, chaos, and hysteria {{were some of the}} features. After all, that was the thing that interested them and us the most (and unfortunately there are few who do not fit into stated majority)." [...] During the trial, Matt Drudge accused the media of largely ignoring testimony and evidence that exonerated Jackson and said, [...] "Out here...Michael Jackson is being literally crucified...I think if you did a pulse poll, of people listening to these local talk shows, they would say 95% that Michael Jackson did all this...because it's based on the coverage."

2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved to know what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round.
