5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E

25|$|Archaeologists {{excavated}} numerous ancient cities, {{among them}} Mohenjo Daro, Harrappa and Kot Diji, {{which have a}} uniform, appropriate structure with broad roads as well as <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> out sanitary and drainage facilities. The majority of the discovered brick constructions are public buildings such as bath houses and workshops. Wood and loam served as construction materials. Large scale temples, such as those found in other ancient cities are missing. With {{the collapse of the}} Indus Valley civilization the architecture also suffered considerable damage.|$|E

25|$|On 14 June 1561 Kranich {{was granted}} denization by Elizabeth I. In London he practised medicine, and {{became known as}} 'Dr Burcot'. His {{abilities}} as a physician were <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> of by some, including John Somers, who wrote from court to Sir Nicholas Throckmorton on 29 August 1562 that 'My Lady Marquis' was seriously ill with jaundice, and that although some physicians had despaired of her, 'Burcot, the Dutchman, at a pinch is like to do some good if he may be suffered'.|$|E
25|$|The BNCR {{purchased}} {{a share in}} the lease of the long-standing and <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> of Antrim Arms hotel at Portrush and in 1883 formed a separate company to manage what was renamed the Northern Counties Hotel. Situated on an elevated site, the hotel overlooked the Atlantic Ocean at front and back. With more than one hundred rooms, it was intended to accommodate high-class tourists visiting the Giant's Causeway. The hotel was enlarged and improved in 1884 and 1892 and in 1902 the BNCR purchased the freehold outright from the Earl of Antrim.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} a {{compromise}} and hastily prepared, apparently {{so it could}} be launched in time for the anniversary of Tsushima, but appeared <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> out, well organized, and finely timed when viewed from a Japanese viewpoint. Against four carriers, two light carriers, 11 battleships, 16 cruisers and 46 destroyers likely to be {{in the area of the}} main battle the US could field only three carriers, eight cruisers, and 15 destroyers. The disparity appeared crushing. Only in numbers of carrier decks, available aircraft, and submarines was there near parity between the two sides. Despite various mishaps developed in the execution, it appeared that—barring something unforeseen—Yamamoto held all the cards.|$|E
50|$|Wells also {{dedicated}} {{a chapter}} of A Red Record to juxtapose the different positions that she and Willard held. The chapter was titled “Miss Willard’s Attitude”.

25|$|However, Clark {{remained}} belligerent in his {{attacks on}} the Trudeau government, angrily clashing with the prime minister in Parliament. He hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies and ran his office efficiently. He improved his party's standing in national opinion polls. Clark worked very hard, and gradually earned the respect of most people, including his own caucus, by presenting a series of <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> out speeches and questions in Parliament. He benefited when live television came to the House of Commons in 1977, allowing viewers {{to see that he}} was evolving into a real rival for Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|Tactical {{media in}} video games plays {{a crucial role}} in making a {{statement}} or conveying a message on important relevant issues. This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be newsgames. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point. For example, Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games. Some of these games include Darfur is Dying, Finding Zoe, and In The Balance. All of these games bring awareness to important issues and events in an intelligent and <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> out manner.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

500|$|Tughlaq’s primary {{attention}} to infrastructure, particularly of iron {{supply to the}} city, was also <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> out.

This structure called the Satpula is still existing (though nonfunctional) near Khirki village on the boundary walls of Jahanpanah. [...] Similar structures had also been built at Tughlaqabad and Delhi in Hauz Khas Complex, thus covering the water supply needs of entire population of Jahanpanah.|$|E

Butterfield felt that the dungeon {{was not an easy}} challenge, especially with the strong and numerous monsters (such as the roughly eighty trolls on one level). In conclusion, he stated, [...] "I advise all DMs who are looking for an exciting, worthwhile adventure for their players to pick this one up. You won't be disappointed." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his role}} in the Hetch Hetchy controversy, Lane was {{friendly}} towards the National Park movement, and in 1915 hired Stephen Mather to oversee the parks for which the Department was responsible. [...] Mather, a self-made millionaire and member of the Sierra Club, had written Lane a bitter letter in late 1914, complaining that the national parks were being exploited for private profit. Lane was intrigued by Mather's letter, made inquiry, and found that Mather was <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> of by Lane's friends—and had, like Lane, attended the University of California. [...] Mather's advocacy led to the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916.|$|E

In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen that we thought through carefully the postwar aspects of what we were going to do once the military campaign was over. And I think it's now very public knowledge that that was not well handled. It was not <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> through, it was not well executed.

500|$|Herbert left Universal Classics and Jazz {{to pursue}} a less {{commercial}} and more personal musical direction and then self-financed a project in which she collaborated with Polar Bear's Seb Rochford in a production role. Between Me and the Wardrobe, an album of self-penned songs, was recorded in three days and was never intended for general release. The album was initially made available, in 2006, on Herbert's own Monkeywood label before being picked up by Blue Note Records, making Herbert their first UK signing in 30 years. In a five-starred review, Stuart Nicholson of The Observer said that on this album she [...] "lets the lyrics do the work for her.

500|$|Latino groups {{criticized the}} show {{for the lack of}} Hispanic {{characters}} during its early years. A committee of Hispanic activists, commissioned by the CTW in 1970, called Sesame Street [...] "racist" [...] and said that the show's bilingual aspects were of [...] "poor quality and patronizing". [...] According to Morrow, Cooney admitted that the show's bilingual elements were [...] "not <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> out". [...] By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-70s, Morrow reported that [...] "the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words". [...] In 1989, Sesame Street created a four-year [...] "race relations curriculum" [...] that focused on introducing its viewers to various cultural backgrounds.|$|E

500|$|While Saw {{received}} mixed reviews, {{a general}} consensus among reviewers was that {{fans of the}} film series would enjoy it. Reviewer for Xbox 360 Achievements Alan Pettit wrote that while he enjoyed the game, {{it was not an}} outstanding title. Pettit commented that the game suffered due to the choice of Zombie Studios as the developer and that the franchise could be successful if a sequel was made with changes in developer and budget. Although he claimed it was repetitive, Pettit mentioned that [...] "If there was only one thing the game did well, I'd say the puzzles that are put before you are excellently constructed, <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> out and best of all, difficult enough that you may not get it on your first attempt." [...] The resulting score from Pettit's review was a 74 out of 100.|$|E
500|$|Those {{who knew}} Stone <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> {{her voice was}} lacking strength. In August {{when she and her}} husband Harry wanted to take part in more {{meetings}} at the Exposition, she was too weak to go. Stone was diagnosed as suffering from advanced stomach cancer in September. She wrote final letters to friends and relatives. Having [...] "prepared for death with serenity and an unwavering concern for the women's cause," [...] Lucy Stone died on October 18, 1893, at the age of 75. At her funeral three days later, 1,100 people crowded the church, and hundreds more stood silently outside. Six women and six men served as pallbearers, including sculptor Anne Whitney, and Stone's old abolitionist friends Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Samuel Joseph May. Mourners lined the streets for a sight of the funeral procession, and front-page banner headlines ran in news accounts. Stone's death was the most widely reported of any American woman's up to that time.|$|E
500|$|... "4-D" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two noted that, while the episode's premise [...] "doesn't seem as <b>well</b> <b>thought</b> through" [...] as Maeda's past efforts, [...] "4-D" [...] is [...] "worth it". Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode [...] "earns its stripes by at last restoring to the series a pulse." [...] Furthermore, they praised Gish's performance, noting that she [...] "finally [...] given a showcase that makes Reyes {{so much more than}} a New Age fanatic". Christina Urban, in an editorial review of the ninth season in Barnes & Noble, praised the episode. Urban said it is [...] "by far the best of the season". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B". Morgan slightly criticized the episode's resolution, writing that it [...] "explained nothing.
