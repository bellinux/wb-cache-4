5|$|Louis XVIII {{signed the}} Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814. The treaty gave France her 1792 borders, which {{extended}} {{east of the}} Rhine. She had to pay no <b>war</b> <b>indemnity,</b> and the occupying armies of the Sixth Coalition withdrew instantly from French soil. These generous terms would be reversed in the next Treaty of Paris after the Hundred Days (Napoleon's return to France in 1815).|$|E
5|$|In November 1815, Louis XVIII's {{government}} had to sign another Treaty of Paris that formally ended Napoleon's Hundred Days. The previous treaty had been quite favourable to France, but this one took a hard line. France's borders were retracted to their extent at 1790. France {{had to pay for}} an army to occupy her, for at least five years, at a cost of 150million francs per year. France also had to pay a <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> of 700million francs to the allies.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Macedonian War (200–196 BC), Macedon {{had given}} Sparta control over Argos, an {{important}} {{city on the}} Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos {{at the end of}} war was used as a pretext for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> to Rome over the next eight years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E
50|$|However, {{industry}} remained very limited, {{with heavy}} state-control. Trades were organised into monopolistic guilds and fiscal and customs laws were complex and inefficient. After {{the defeat of}} 1806, funding the occupation force and the <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> put Prussia's economy under pressure. As in the 18th century, the early 19th century reforms aimed to create budgetary margins, notably in their efforts towards economic development.|$|R
50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objectives in}} warfare is dramatically {{different from those}} of other strategy games: it is generally very difficult to do severe damage to an enemy's economy in a single war, occupied territory is only temporarily {{in the hands of the}} occupier, and post-war territorial gains are generally modest and difficult to subdue. However, there are other conditions to peace such as <b>War</b> <b>Indemnities</b> and Humiliation.|$|R
25|$|The French forces withdrew on 9 March 1839 after a {{peace treaty}} was signed. As part of said treaty the Mexican {{government}} agreed to pay 600,000 pesos as damages to French citizens while France received promises for future trade commitments in place of <b>war</b> <b>indemnities.</b> However, this amount was never paid and that was later used {{as one of the}} justifications for the second French intervention in Mexico of 1861.|$|R
5|$|Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting {{his office}} in Vienna to his father. He set about using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out at Schönbrunn. The {{concessions}} he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the <b>war</b> <b>indemnity,</b> restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family's, and the lifting of a 150,000 man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed {{as a sign of}} increased Austrian independence, although Austria could no longer afford an army greater than the limit prescribed.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, the Persian army rebelled and overthrew Khosrow II, {{raising his}} son Kavadh II, {{also known as}} Siroes, in his stead. Khosrow was shut in a dungeon, where he {{suffered}} for five days on bare sustenancehe {{was shot to death}} slowly with arrows on the fifth day. Kavadh immediately sent peace offers to Heraclius. Heraclius did not impose harsh terms, knowing that his own empire was also near exhaustion. Under the terms of the peace treaty, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a <b>war</b> <b>indemnity,</b> and most importantly for them, the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E
5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, {{putting an end to}} hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective it was likely that Władysław's abnegation of his claim was more important, in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E
50|$|From {{the title}} of the Agreement on Friendship with Bulgaria of 1947, signed in Bled, the Yugoslav Government {{abandoned}} Bulgarian <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> through a unilateral act. Regardless of the fact that in July 1992 the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia promulgated the Declaration on the Annulation of the Decision on Absolving Bulgaria of Compensation for War Damages, there was no legal title under which the question of war damages inflicted by Bulgaria could be raised.|$|R
50|$|This long-standing {{relationship}} with the German military positioned Hontzfirma {{at the top of}} the elevation game. Karl and his son, Klaus, ran the Aufzugfirma together; according to the Bern Report, Karl acted as a salesman and installation expert while Klaus followed up and performed repairs on functioning Hontz machinery. Post-war, however, the elevator business went through the floor and the Aufzugfirma was one of the companies worst hit by the <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> of the Treaty of Versailles.|$|R
50|$|According to Stein, the {{administration}} should be split up by field {{and no longer}} by geographical area. Thus {{the administration}} had to {{be divided into two}} branches - the public revenue branch and the top-level state-policy branch (oberste Staatsbehörde). One of the main aims of this concept was to rationalise the state financial system to raise the money to meet its <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> under the treaty of Tilsit. Rationalising the state finances would allow the state to raise revenue but limit losses due to poor administrative organisation.|$|R
5|$|The {{great number}} of Russian horses {{captured}} as matériel during wartime became {{a threat to the}} Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, {{and there was no way}} to ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses back as a part of Finland's massive <b>war</b> <b>indemnity.</b> Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{costly for}} Philip and the Macedonians, losing them a fleet {{that had taken}} three years to build as well as {{triggering}} the defection of their Greek allies, the Achean League and the Aetolian League, to the Romans. In the war's immediate aftermath the Dardani, a barbarian tribe, swarmed across the northern border of Macedon, but Philip was able to repel this attack. In 197, however, Philip was defeated in the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Romans {{and was forced to}} surrender. This defeat cost Philip most of his territory outside Macedon and he had to pay a <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> of 1,000 talents of silver to the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{replied to}} Nabis by proposing his own terms, under which Sparta and Rome would {{conclude}} a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos {{with all his}} garrisons from the Argolid; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> over {{the next eight years}} and not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities. Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that he had enough supplies to withstand a siege. Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city. Flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered {{by the fact that the}} Romans' large shields made missile attacks futile.|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{involuntary}} international transfers (<b>war</b> <b>indemnities)</b> has been constructed {{on the assumption}} that the donor and recipient are completely indifferent to each other's well-being. The assumption is hard to justify since usually the transfers closely follow periods during which the countries have been dropping bombs on each other. In the present paper, we rework the theory on the more plausible assumption that the well-being of each country is negatively influenced by the well-being of the other country. It is shown that, contrary to the conventional theory, the donor might benefit at the expense of the recipient, even when local Walrasian stability is imposed. ...|$|R
50|$|Tax {{reform was}} a central problem for the reformers, notably due to the <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> imposed by Napoleon, and these {{difficulties}} marked Hardenberg's early reforms. He managed to avoid state bankruptcy and inflation by increasing taxes or selling off lands. These severe financial problems led to a wholesale fiscal reform. Taxes were standardised right across Prussia, principally by replacing {{the wide variety of}} minor taxes with main taxes. The reformers also tried to introduce equal taxation for all citizens, thus bringing them into conflict with aristocratic privileges. On 27 October 1810, the king proclaimed in his Finanzedikt:Excises were raised the following year on appeals.|$|R
50|$|The {{war ended}} on 7 July 1807 {{with the first}} Treaty of Tilsit between Napoleon and Alexander I of Russia. Two days later, Napoleon signed a second Treaty of Tilsit with Prussia, {{removing}} half its territory and forcing Prussia's king to recognise Jérôme Bonaparte as sovereign of the newly created Kingdom of Westphalia, to which Napoleon annexed the Prussian territories west of the river Elbe. Prussia had had 9 million inhabitants in 1805, of which it lost 4.55 million in the treaty. It was also forced to pay 120 million francs to France in <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> and fund a French occupying force of 150,000 troops.|$|R
5|$|Macedon {{began to}} {{encroach}} on territory claimed by several other Greek city states in 200 BC and these pleaded {{for help from}} their newfound ally Rome. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum that he must submit Macedonia to being essentially a Roman province. Philip, unsurprisingly, refused and, after initial internal reluctance for further hostilities, Rome declared war against Philip in the Second Macedonian War. In the Battle of the Aous Roman forces under Titus Quinctius Flamininus defeated the Macedonians, and in a second larger battle under the same opposing commanders in 197 BC, in the Battle of Cynoscephalae, Flamininus again beat the Macedonians decisively. Macedonia was forced to sign the Treaty of Tempea, in which it lost all claim to territory in Greece and Asia, and had to pay a <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> to Rome.|$|E
5|$|From the 14th to the 16thcentury, Finnish {{horses were}} {{exported}} to Russian and Germany in such quantities that eventually {{restrictions on the}} number of exports were set. The Finnish horses exported to Russia in early 19thcentury influenced the development of the Vyatka horse. In the 19thcentury and early 20thcentury, horses of Finnish origin were used in creating many Baltic and Russian agricultural draught breeds, such as the Tori Horse and the Lithuanian Draught. In most cases, these breeds were developed by crossbreeding Finnish horses on small local horses, thus increasing size. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Finnhorse was also used in the breeding of the Estonian horse. The heavy Mezen horse was bred with both the Finnhorse and the Estonian Horse, until its stud book was closed in the 1950s. Traces of Finnhorse influence is found in other Soviet and Russian work horse breeds, in the mid-20thcentury, Finland exported 15,000 horses to Soviet Russia as part of its <b>war</b> <b>indemnity.</b> In the 1960s and 1970s, pony-sized Finnhorses were also used to improve quality and broaden the gene pool of the Norwegian Nordlandshest, which had become highly inbred by the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|One year later, the feudal {{families}} of the Sasanian Empire, who were tired of war against the Byzantines and Khosrow's oppressive policies, freed Khosrow's son Kavadh, who had been imprisoned by his own father. The feudal families included: Shahrbaraz himself, who represented the Mihran family; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by spahbed Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni; and finally the Kanarang. In February, Kavadh, along with Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire on 25 February, and {{with the aid of}} Piruz Khosrow, executed all his brothers and half-brothers, including Khosrow II's favorite son Mardanshah. Three days later, he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. With the agreement of the nobles of the Sasanian empire, Kavadh then made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius; under the terms of this peace, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a <b>war</b> <b>indemnity,</b> along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E
40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis I am {{focusing on}} the socio and economic impacts of hyperinflation on {{the economy of the}} Weimar Republic. In first chapters I am dealing with the analysis of long-term and short-term causes which led to hyperinflation. I am also taking into account German economic theory, manner of financing of the war in Germany and furthermore I am concentrating on the question of <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> and crisis in the Ruhr area. In the followingchapters I am dealing with the progress of hyperinflation and her economic, social and also political impacts. My aim is to confirm the hypothesis, in which I argue that hyperinflation had negative impact on economic and social situation inside the Weimar Republic.

50|$|In {{the same}} way as the towns' self-government, Hardenberg foresaw the {{establishment}} of a national representative body made up of corporative and representative elements. The first assembly of notable figures was held in 1811 and the second in 1812. These were made up of a corporative base of 18 aristocratic landowners, 12 urban property owners and nine representatives from among the peasants. This corporative composition was based partly on the traditional conception of society and partly on practical and fiscal considerations - in order to be able to pay its <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> to France, the Prussian state had to have massive recourse to credit contracts issued by the aristocrats and to gain credit in foreign countries the different states had to offer themselves as guarantors.|$|R
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in <b>war</b> <b>indemnities,</b> and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|R
25|$|At the beginning, {{the bank}} used its own {{resources}} almost entirely for both financial and banking operations.

25|$|The {{battle was}} {{disastrous}} for the Seleucids, and Antiochus {{was forced to}} come to terms. Amongst {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Apamea, Antiochus had to pay 15,000 talents (450 tonnes/990,000 pounds) of silver as a <b>war</b> <b>indemnity,</b> and he was forced to abandon his territory west of the Taurus Mountains. Rhodes gained control over Caria and Lycia, while the Pergamese gained northern Lycia and all of Antiochus' other territories in Asia Minor.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to manufacturing, Carthage practised highly advanced and productive agriculture, using iron ploughs, irrigation, and crop rotation. After the Second Punic War, Hannibal promoted agriculture {{to help restore}} Carthage's economy and pay the <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> to Rome (10,000 talents or 800,000 Roman pounds of silver), and he was largely successful. When Rome conquered and destroyed Carthage in 146 BC, the Roman Senate decreed that Mago's famous treatise on agriculture be translated into Latin.|$|E
40|$|The Paasikivi's "Horrible Years" 1944 - 1948 Jiří Volák Abstract Finland did {{not become}} a Soviet {{satellite}} after the World War II, despite that many preconditions {{were in favor of}} such development. The country was defeated and, as stated in the Moscow Armistice of 1944, obliged to cede its territories and to pay severe <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> to the Soviet Union. Firstly, the thesis approaches domestic roots which led to this absolutely unique international position of Finland during the early Cold War years. The main goal is to map a role that Finnish Prime Minister and later President Juho Kusti Paasikivi had in securing and maintaining the surprising "Finnish path. " Of what ideology he profited? Could he be compared to President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia? Both primary and secondary sources are being used. According to the conclusions, Paasikivi was highly responsible for preservation of the Finnish democracy. Secondly, the significance of a Czechoslovak coup d'état is not omitted. Fear of a similar fate had a great influence on the Finnish society in the year 1948, while Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Finland and Soviet Union (YYA-sopimus) was negotiated. The result created a legal base of Finno- Soviet relation for forty years to come and the "Years of Danger", as Finnish [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Russian proximity to the straits the British, against {{the wishes of the}} Sultan, intervened in the war. A large task force representing British naval supremacy entered the straits of Marmara and anchored in view of both the royal palace and the Russian army. The British may have saved the Ottoman Empire once again, but it ended the rosy relations between the two powers that had endured since the Crimean War. Looking at the prospect of a British entry into the war the Russians decided to settle the dispute. [...] The Treaty of San Stefano gave Romania and Montenegro their independence, Serbia and Russia each received extra territory, Austria was given control over Bosnia, and Bulgaria was given almost complete autonomy. The hope of the Sultan was that the other great powers would oppose such a one-sided resolution and a conference would be held to revise it. His desire became reality and in 1878 the Congress of Berlin was held where Germany promised to be an [...] "honest broker" [...] in the treaty's revision. In the new treaty Bulgarian territory was decreased and the <b>war</b> <b>indemnities</b> were cancelled. [...] The conference also again hurt Anglo-Ottoman relations by giving the British the island of Cyprus. While annoyed at British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, the Sultan had nothing but praise for Otto von Bismarck who forced many of the major concessions upon Russia. These close Germano-Ottoman relations would persist until both empires' very end.|$|R
40|$|Reparations as an {{instrument}} of international peace settlements were abandoned after the failure of Germany to pay its post World <b>War</b> I <b>indemnity.</b> However, reparations played a useful role in the construction of earlier peace treaties. This paper examines the payment of reparations by the French after the Napoleonic Wars. By most measures, these reparations were the largest ever fully paid; and they imposed a high cost on the economy in terms of lost output and consumption and diminished capital stock. The incentives to pay were appropriately set and payment permitted France to be accepted once again as an equal among the great powers. ...|$|R
25|$|After Hasdrubal's {{assassination}} by a Celtic assassin, Hamilcar's {{young sons}} took over, with Hannibal becoming the strategus of Iberia, although {{this decision was}} not undisputed in Carthage. The output of the Iberian silver mines allowed for the financing of a standing army and the payment of the <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> to Rome. The mines {{also served as a}} tool for political influence, creating a faction in Carthage's magistrate that was called the Barcino.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Rome annexed Corsica and Sardinia by revisiting {{the terms}} of the treaty that ended the first Punic War. As Carthage was under siege and engaged in a {{difficult}} civil war, they grudgingly accepted the loss of these islands and the subsequent Roman conditions for ongoing peace, which also increased the <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> levied against Carthage after the first Punic War. This eventually plunged relations between the two powers to a new low point.|$|E
25|$|The Niitaka-class cruisers {{were ordered}} by the Imperial Japanese Navy under its 2nd Emergency Expansion Program, with a budget partly funded by the <b>war</b> <b>indemnity</b> {{received}} from the Empire of China {{as part of the}} settlement of the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War. The class was intended for high speed reconnaissance missions. Niitaka was built at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, with the keel laid down on 7 January 1902 and launching on 15 November 1902.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resolution}} finally adopted stated categorically {{that the}} war was a consequence of bourgeois property relations which had produced a series of imperialist antagonisms. The war would not end the capitalist economy or imperialism so therefore it would not do away with the causes of future wars. Schemes such as courts of international arbitration, disarmament and the democratization of foreign policy could not end wars, as long as the capitalist system existed. [...] "The struggle for lasting peace can, therefore, be only a struggle for the realization of socialism" [...] (emphasis in the original). On the basis of the Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Basel resolutions the delegates declared that it is a vital commandment to raise a call for an immediate truce and peace negotiations. The workers would succeed in hastening {{the end of the war}} and influencing the nature of the peace only to the extent that this call finds a response within the international proletariat and led them to [...] "forceful action directed toward overthrowing the capitalist class." [...] The proletariat also must struggle against annexations and attempts to create [...] "pseudo-independent states" [...] on the [...] "pretext of liberating oppressed peoples". Socialists did not oppose annexations in order to return to the pre-1914 borders but because [...] "...socialism strives to eliminate all national oppression by means of an economic and political unification of the peoples on a democratic basis, something which cannot be realized within the limits of capitalist states." [...] So long as socialism has not achieved this, the proletariat's duty was still to oppose national oppression, attacks on weaker states, <b>war</b> <b>indemnities,</b> support the protection of minorities, and the autonomy of peoples on a [...] "basis of real democracy". Finally, socialists should take advantage of mass movements originating in the dislocations of the war, such as unemployed movements and protest against the high cost of living and unite them into one international struggle for socialism.|$|R
5000|$|Moon {{made some}} {{controversial}} {{statements about the}} Holocaust, that its victims were paying indemnity for the crucifixion of Jesus. Some commentators, including David G.

[...] Donald Tingle and Richard Fordyce, ministers with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) who debated two Unification Church theologians in 1977, wrote: [...] "In short, indemnity is {{anything you want to}} make it, since you establish the conditions.
