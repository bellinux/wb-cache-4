5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a <b>whore</b> because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a <b>whore</b> and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
5|$|The main {{intention}} of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as the <b>Whore</b> of Babylon World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as the <b>Whore</b> of Babylon, the figure of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, {{to make it a}} self-confident dig at all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. Air-conditioning was turned off during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.|$|E

5|$|Kings was {{recorded}} by the Opies as common in eastern England. The English Dialect Dictionary recorded much {{the same in the}} nineteenth century. The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg's 1851 Dialect of Northamptonshire. Queens is recorded as used in the kings area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart the game. Kings truce is found in Thomas Dekker's The Honest <b>Whore,</b> Part One (II,i), which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel.|$|E

5|$|Several {{artists have}} applied Ovid's account to new {{translations}} or reworkings, or adapted {{the story for}} the stage. British poet Ted Hughes (1930–1998) used the myth in his 1997 work Tales from Ovid (1997) which was a loose translation and retelling of twenty-four tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Both Israeli dramatist Hanoch Levin (in The Great <b>Whore</b> of Babylon) and English playwright Joanna Laurens (in The Three Birds) wrote plays based on the story. Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer James Dillon in 2004 and a 1964 vocal composition by American composer Milton Babbitt with text by John Hollander.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister, Liz Sanbourne, discovers Irma's existence, {{and brings}} her to Harmony to destroy Eve's life by {{revealing}} her past to her family.

The revelations destroy Eve and T.C.'s marriage. Despite her Christian upbringing, Irma is often foul-mouthed; she frequently calls Eve a <b>whore</b> or a slut. When Eve's daughter Simone tells Irma she is a lesbian, Irma, who has previously been kind to her, tells Simone homosexuality is vile and disgusting, and orders her to leave and never return. Irma was portrayed by actress Marla Gibbs on a recurring basis in 2004 and 2005. Gibbs viewed Irma as a malicious character, and was surprised at fans' positive feedback.|$|E

5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a <b>whore.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fearing for Shae's safety, Tyrion {{breaks up}} with her and orders her to leave for Pentos. She refuses until he calls her a <b>whore,</b> and {{declares}} that she cannot have his children.

At his trial, Shae appears to testify against him, falsely claiming that Sansa refused to bed Tyrion unless he killed Joffrey.

Tyrion is defended by Oberyn Martell, who believes that his sister, niece, and nephew were murdered by Gregor. Oberyn is nearly victorious, but his refusal to kill Gregor without obtaining a confession gives Gregor the opportunity to kill him, and Tyrion is sentenced to death.
