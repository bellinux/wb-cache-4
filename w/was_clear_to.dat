5|$|We {{received}} daily e-mails with feedback {{that was}} concise, unambiguous and occasionally entertaining. She works extremely hard with gumption and detail, and it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> us how she {{has remained on}} top for twenty years. It was no use being unprepared with vague ideas disguised as creativity, {{and there was no}} place to hide... First it felt like doing nonsense, then it's fun and it's something that's going to be seen. The project brings us into contact with interesting actors within both film and music.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a strong position in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 14 September, Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war. Göring was not present; he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium. Erhard Milch replaced him. Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London. He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results on the weather. Nevertheless, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Hitler that victory had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe. Under those circumstances, Operation Sea Lion could not take place. Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine, agreed. He argued that Sea Lion should only be carried out {{as a last resort}} regardless of gaining air superiority.|$|E

5|$|When {{recording}} was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher {{if he had}} {{any ideas}} for a further season of Star Cops. Boucher felt that were the series to continue he would like to extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the Mars colonies and the Big Ring space colonies under construction. He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there. The second season was never developed beyond these few basic notions as it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed. Following Star Cops, Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running ITV police drama The Bill before returning to freelance writing while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series The House of Eliott.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{receiving}} {{a report of}} the damage inflicted, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Capt. Woods that the Peveril would founder, and the necessary provisions were made to abandon ship.

25|$|This {{language}} {{was at first}} adopted by the exiled Noldor after their return to Middle-earth at Losgar.

25|$|When the State Bureau of Investigation {{officers}} began {{investigating the}} case late in 2013, they also interviewed residents of Hawthorne at the View.

The agent who interviewed her asked questions that elicited more useful information from her, she recalled.|$|E

25|$|In the assembly, 80 of 130 deputies, all {{close to}} the government, showed their displeasure {{with the idea of}} {{replacing}} George, a development that threatened to plunge the island anew into revolt. The closer the Prince’s departure seemed, the more his allies agitated in the hope of a new European intervention. However, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Powers this time that the situation could only improve with George’s departure.|$|E
25|$|As the 6th U.S. Army Group and the 3rd Army {{finished}} clearing southern Germany {{and approached}} Austria, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> most observers, Allied and German alike, {{that the war}} was nearly over. Many towns flew white flags of surrender to spare themselves the otherwise inevitable destruction suffered by those that resisted, while German troops surrendered by the tens of thousands, sometimes as entire units.|$|E
25|$|On the Fascist side, {{after the}} fall of Tunis and Pantelleria, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> many that the war had been lost. The landing in Sicily and the lack of {{resistance}} shocked the Fascists, who asked themselves why the Duce was not reacting. Many of them looked to the King, and many at Mussolini. One big problem was to find an institution suitable for a political action.|$|E

25|$|Although Michael Grade {{had left}} the BBC in 1987 {{to take up a}} new {{position}} as Chief Executive of Channel 4, Doctor Who remained in its poor slot opposite Coronation Street and continued to suffer in the ratings. Jonathan Powell, the new Controller of BBC 1, who regarded Nathan-Turner with contempt, decided to suspend the series, a decision which <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the production team by the end of production on the twenty-sixth season in August 1989.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} commercial {{failure of}} the novel has been suggested as pivotal in Herbert's later career – it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> him that novel-writing was not likely to prove financially rewarding, which helped focus his efforts on light journalism and {{set the tone for}} most of his later writings. He would not write anything quite the same again – The House by the River (1920), a crime novel, retains something of the simple style, but begins to introduce elements of humour not found in The Secret Battle.|$|E
25|$|King James II was {{campaigning in}} Ireland {{as a first}} step in an {{ultimately}} unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne following his deposition after the Glorious Revolution. In August 1689, Marshal Frederick Schomberg had been sent from England to bolster the forces loyal to King William but after the Siege of Carrickfergus his army had stalled through the winter of 1689–90, suffering from sickness and desertion. As early as January 1690, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> William {{that he would have to}} sail to Ireland, with substantial reinforcements, to salvage the situation.|$|E
