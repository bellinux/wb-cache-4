40|$|Gyrotron are {{the most}} {{powerful}} sources of coherent millimeter and centimeter wave capable to operate in long- pulse and continuous regimes and successfully used for fusion experiments and advanced material processing. Until recently development new gyrotron intended mainly on increase of operating frequency, power and efficiency. The power level of modern quasi-cw gyrotrons achieved up to 1 MW {{and there is an}} evident tendency to further increase of output power at least up to 1, 5 - 2 MW [1 - 4]. The efficiency of best gyrotron tubes reaches without CPD (recovering of residual energy of worked-out electron beam) 40 % in continuous regimes and 50 % in pulse one, and achieves with one-step CPD 50 % in continuous regimes and 70 % in pulse regimes. The further increase of power and efficiency of gyrotrons is limited by several physical and technical reasons. The complete gyrotron efficiency and maximum gyrotron power is defined by partial efficiencies and limiting capabilities of its subsystems: gun, beam tunnel, cavity, mode converter, output <b>window,</b> <b>collector</b> (with or without CPD). The cavity oscillation efficiency is reduced due to energy and velocity spread in a helical electron beam (HEB), ohmical cavit...|$|E

50|$|Some BASIC interpreters, such as Applesoft BASIC on the Apple II family, {{repeatedly}} {{scanned the}} string descriptors for the string having the highest address {{in order to}} compact it toward high memory, resulting in O(n2) performance, which could introduce minutes-long pauses in the execution of string-intensive programs. A replacement garbage collector for Applesoft BASIC published in Call-A.P.P.L.E.

40|$|A {{reduction}} of heating energy for houses affects {{the consumption of}} primary energy sources appreciably, and therefore should be a primary aim of energy politics. Heat insulation alone is not sufficient as only heat transmission losses are dealt with. Passive solar energy utilization is the most promising {{way to reduce the}} energy demand further on by trying to match losses with solar gains. Apart from heat, good passive solar design also considers light, humidity and air transport to optimize human comfort. An optimization of the solar apertures of a house therefore needs a variety of materials to make a design possible which is best adapted to environment and requirements of the inhabitants. Transparent insulation materials as collector covers, starting from simple glazing, are the key materials, which are described in this article. Existing materials, solar transmission, heat transport and problems of application are covered, while no importance is laid on design variations of the fun damental generic apertures <b>window</b> and <b>collector</b> wall.

40|$|The directional-hemispherical (also {{sometimes}} called direct-diffuse) solar transmittance for several different honeycomb-type structures has been measured with an indoor solar simulator and a 40 cm diameter integrating sphere for incidence angles up to 70 degree.

The resulting coefficients describe the angular and thickness dependence of the solar transmittance for each type of material.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the development and employment of an hp-adaptive finite element method (FEM) algorithm for solving heat transfer problems in partitioned enclosures, which has attracted the attention of both experimental and theoretical researchers in recent years. Design/methodology/approach – In the hp-adaptive FEM algorithm presented here, both the element size and the shape function order are dynamically controlled by an a posteriori error estimator based on the L 2 norm; a three-step adaptation strategy is used with a projection algorithm for the flow solver. Findings – Simulation results are obtained for 2 D and 3 D natural convection within partitioned enclosures. Results show refined and enriched elements that develop near the partition edges and side walls of the enclosure, as expected. The heat transfer between the heated and cooled side walls is reduced in the presence of a partial partition. Research limitations/implications – The Rayleigh numbers were set to 105 in the 2 D case and 103 in the 3 D case. Efforts are underway to apply the hp-adaptive algorithm to partitioned enclosures at much higher Rayleigh numbers, including comparison with available experimental data. Practical implications – Heat transfer within partitioned enclosures occurs in many engineering situations: heat transfer across thermo pane <b>windows,</b> solar <b>collectors,</b> fire spread and energy transfer in rooms and buildings, cooling of nuclear reactors and heat exchanger design. Originality/value – The hp-adaptive FEM algorithm is one of the best mesh-based algorithms for improving solution quality, whilst maintaining computational efficiency. The method shows considerable promise in solving a wide range of heat transfer problems including fluid flow...|$|R

40|$|A new lateral bipolar {{junction}} transistor that utilises a double-polysilicon self-aligned structure to maximise high-frequency performance is introduced. Silicon-on-oxide (SOI) wafers are used to isolate devices from the substrate and to minimise parasitic substrate capacitances(CJCS 0) around 1. 3 – 2. 6 fF (substrate is ground).
