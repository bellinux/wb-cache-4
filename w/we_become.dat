5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if <b>we</b> <b>become</b> accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E

Productively, rootedness enables us to grow beyond the security of our mother and establish ties with the outside world.

25|$|We {{are able}} to {{apprehend}} and represent nature to ourselves in the successive forms which its development assumes {{since it is the}} same spirit of which <b>we</b> <b>become</b> aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external teleology in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of Naturphilosophie is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.|$|E

25|$|Shafarevich {{argued that}} ancient {{socialism}} (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt) was not ideological, as an ideology socialism was {{a reaction to}} the emergence of individualism in the Axial Age. He compared Thomas More's (Utopia) and Campanella's (City of the Sun) visions with what is known about the Inca Empire, and concluded that there are striking similarities. He claimed that <b>we</b> <b>become</b> persons through our relationship with God, and argued that socialism is essentially nihilistic, unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded that we have the choice of either pursuing death or life.|$|E
25|$|Austrian {{psychiatrist}} Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted {{ways with}} Freud, emphasised {{the role of}} goals and motivation in his Individual Psychology. One of Adler's most famous ideas is {{that we try to}} compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, <b>we</b> <b>become</b> one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.|$|E

The narrator and Edgar likewise acquire passports and go to Germany, but continue to receive death threats after emigrating. Kurt remains in Romania, no longer working; he is later found hanged. The novel ends with the same passage as it began: [...] "When we don't speak, said Edgar, <b>we</b> <b>become</b> unbearable, and when we do, we make fools of ourselves".|$|E

Wibe, on the other hand, left politics, as did Lars Erik Grønntun. The board members of Aust-Agder Youth of the Progress Party joined the Free Democrats in August.

Wenger noted after the match that Chelsea's bigger squad would serve them well as the season progressed, but stressed his smaller squad had stability: [...] "We have been together for years and have the comfort of knowing we have won things before. When we are challenged, <b>we</b> <b>become</b> even more united." [...] Arsenal ended October with a 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic. After 10 games, Arsenal garnered 24 points.

500|$|Following its release, Anbe Sivam has {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Tamil cinema and receives re-runs on television channels. Baradwaj Rangan wrote that Anbe Sivam was [...] "leagues {{ahead of the}} average Tamilwhy, even Indianfilm", though he felt that [...] "the masses were unwilling to accept the experimental nature of the film", while talking about the film's box office failure. During his acceptance speech after winning the Vijay Award for Best Director in 2010 for Naan Kadavul (2009), director Bala revealed that a scene in Anbe Sivam where Kamal says to Madhavan, [...] "when we love others unconditionally without any expectation, <b>we</b> <b>become</b> Gods", inspired him to make his film. Bala also made a reference to Anbe Sivam in his 2003 film, Pithamagan, in a scene where Suriya's character goes for a screening of the film with his friends. A dialogue told by Kamal to Madhavan, [...] "Do you what a tsunami is? Periya alai illa…malai." [...] (It's not just a big wave…it's a mountain) also attained popularity.|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolved}} around themes of evolution, {{as well as}} her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster.

[...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E
500|$|Miss Freda Whitlam (born 1920), {{sister of}} Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was {{principal}} between 1958 and 1976. It {{was a period}} of great social transition.

[...] Technology is taking the drudgery out of our lives and opening up exciting opportunities for those who have a good general education and are willing to think positively and creatively. [...] Here we help the girls with this aim in view.' In 1970, after the Rev. Bill McLeod spoke to some of the seniors and advised those intending to become a nurse or a teacher to learn Greek or Italian (to aid communication with immigrants), Miss Whitlam took up the suggestion: 'We have people with time to do something after the exams {{at the end of each}} year - let's organise Greek classes for them'. In March 1972 the school also produced a newsletter ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ ΝΕΑ providing background on Greek culture and language and a bibliography of relevant books in the school library.|$|E
