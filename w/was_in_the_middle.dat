5|$|I {{remember}} {{when they came}} to record 'Spice Up Your Life'. It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the chaos. It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and {{there was going to be}} an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E
5|$|In Frankfort in 1825, Sharp <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of {{a bitter}} {{political}} battle {{known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy. He identified with the New Court, or Relief party, which promoted a legislative agenda favorable to debtors. In opposition was the Old Court, or Anti-Relief party, which worked to secure the rights of creditors to collect debts. Sharp had served as the state's attorney general under New Court governors John Adair, whose term lasted until August 1824, and Joseph Desha, who succeeded him in office. The New Court party's power was beginning to wane.|$|E

5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a Texas Bullrope match between Randy Orton and Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes started the match by {{performing}} {{a series of}} elbows on Orton's head. Orton, however, took the advantage after hitting Rhodes' head several times with the cowbell, which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the rope connecting the two men. After a final hit to the head, Orton pinned Rhodes to win the match. After the match, Orton attempted to punt Rhodes in the head, but Rhodes' son, Cody, made the save.|$|E
5|$|After a coach saw Wilson pitch well at {{a tournament}} in California, {{he was offered}} a {{scholarship}} to Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played for the LSU Tigers baseball team, eventually becoming their No. 2 starter. In his time at LSU, Wilson pitched in 51 games (22 starts) and accumulated 18 wins, 10 losses, and five saves. He <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of his third season on March 28, 2003, when he injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery. He also played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a summer league for collegiate prospects. Despite facing extensive rehabilitation, Wilson chose to enter the 2003 Major League Baseball draft.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart {{was booked}} {{to face his}} brother Owen, with whom he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a feud. The storyline between the Hart {{brothers}} began at Survivor Series 1993, where they were competing {{on the same side}} of an elimination match. As Owen was fighting in the ring, Bret, who had sustained a kayfabe injury, was staggering along the ring apron. Owen ran into Bret, causing Owen to lose his focus and get eliminated from the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and had a confrontation with Bret. In the following weeks, Owen demanded a match with Bret, but Bret refused to accept the challenge. Eventually, the storyline had the brothers reunite to face The Quebecers at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret sustained another kayfabe injury, causing the referee to end the match. In a planned turn, Owen got upset by the loss and attacked Bret to restart the feud.|$|E

5|$|Callaway {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by UPN's cancellation of Mercy Point because of their strong support of the show. He felt {{the decision was made}} {{in part because of the}} show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating on ash mounds {{associated}} with Neolithic cultures in South India {{date back to}} 8000BCE. Artefacts such as ground stone axes, and minor copper objects {{have been found in}} the region. Towards the beginning of 1000BCE, iron technology spread through the region; however, there {{does not appear to be}} a fully developed Bronze Age preceding the Iron Age in South India. The region <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu linking the Mediterranean and East Asia. Trade with Phoenicians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Syrians, Jews and Chinese began from the Sangam period (c. 3rd century BC to c. 4th century AD). The region was part of the ancient Silk Road connecting the Asian continent in the East and the West.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Duigan desired command of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), which was to be raised for service in Europe. Lack of command experience and his performance as CGS meant that he was not a popular choice within the military or the New Zealand Government. Major General Bernard Freyberg was instead appointed commander of 2NZEF, and Duigan's term as CGS was extended. Throughout 1940, Duigan worked to ensure the continued support and reinforcement of 2NZEF, and oversaw the reintroduction of conscription. He also attended defence conferences in Singapore and India, and made tours of the 2NZEF while it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East.|$|E

5|$|Macartney hit 105 as Australia amassed 7/708 {{declared}} against Hampshire {{and then}} made 193 as Australia compiled 621 and defeated Northamptonshire by an innings and 484 runs. The two matches were separated by a match against Surrey, which Macartney missed due to injury. In the latter match, Macartney came in at first drop after the hosts took a wicket from the first ball of the match, and he scored 193 of the 318 runs scored while he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> Macartney took only 135 minutes and hit 31 fours as Australia added more than 300 in just over two hours of batting. Such was the dominance of Macartney {{and the rest of}} Armstrong's men that they disposed of Northamptonshire in less than two days. However, his most famed innings was yet to come.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} began as Zolciak <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> {{of her first}} {{pregnancy}} by her boyfriend Biermann; she later gave birth to their son. Leakes continued divorce proceedings with Gregg, while Whitfield found herself in financial difficulties after her ex-husband failed to pay child support. Meanwhile, Bailey opened her own modeling agency, while Parks looked to launch a family-operated funeral home. Leakes's new friendship with Hampton caused tension between all of the women, which escalated during a group vacation in South Africa; while Zolciak, who had remained home with her children, became upset by negative comments Bailey (not Burruss) made about her during the group vacation. As the season closed, Leakes began to reconsider her divorce from Gregg.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{a passing}} loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours. Coordinating this limited timetable with the main line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers could face a long wait on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, a passing loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer timetables. This required introducing a new working section, and Llangwyllog became a staff station. As the new section <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a line, a third type of staff was required (a C configuration); {{one of only a}} few sections on the LNWR that did not use a type A or B staff.|$|E

5|$|The {{third season}} saw the {{introduction}} of Bailey and Parks, while Leakes and Zolciak reconciled as the former contemplated divorcing her husband Gregg and the latter began a lesbian relationship. Parks, who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of her pregnancy, clashed with her husband Apollo Nida over their differing opinions on parenting; she gave birth later in the season. Meanwhile, Zolciak and Burruss continued recording music together, although they clashed over their creative differences. Bailey later became engaged to her boyfriend Peter Thomas, while Zolciak set her affections on football player Kroy Biermann; a conflict between Burruss, Leakes, and Zolciak later ensued while the latter two women embark on a promotional concert tour. Against the advice {{of her mother and}} sister, Bailey married Thomas in the third-season finale.|$|E
5|$|This {{task was}} given to 44th Indian Airborne Division, but the {{division}} <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a reorganization, and as such a composite battalion was formed from two Gurkha parachute battalions. The battalion assembled and then trained throughout April, and then {{early in the morning}} of 1 May was dropped near Elephant Point. As it advanced towards the battery one of the battalion's companies was attacked by American bombers, causing a number of casualties. Despite this, and torrential rain, the battalion successfully assaulted Elephant Point and neutralized the battery there after a fierce firefight. It remained around Elephant Point until 2 May, when 26th Indian Division conducted its amphibious assault and secured Rangoon.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{gained control}} of Indiana, the entire region <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of Pontiac's Rebellion. During the next year, British {{officials}} negotiated with the various tribes, splitting them from their alliance with Pontiac. Eventually, Pontiac lost most of his allies, forcing him {{to make peace with}} the British on July 25, 1766. As a concession to Pontiac, Great Britain issued a proclamation that the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains was to be reserved for Native Americans. Despite the treaty, Pontiac was still considered a threat to British interests, but after he was murdered on April 20, 1769, the region saw several years of peace.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E
5|$|No. 36 Squadron was {{particularly}} active during 2011. In January that year the squadron had to evacuate two C-17s from Amberley to Richmond when the base was threatened by rising floodwaters during the Queensland floods; {{of the other}} two Globemasters, one <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East and the other was undergoing maintenance and could not be flown. The aircraft stranded at Amberley was moved onto high ground during the crisis at the base and escaped without damage. The two Richmond-based C-17s subsequently flew over 227 tonnes of supplies to flood-affected regions of Queensland. When flooding also took place in Victoria during January, No. 36 Squadron transported 100,000 sandbags to Melbourne and flew Royal Australian Navy personnel and vehicles into the state from HMAS Albatross in New South Wales. No. 36 Squadron returned to Amberley after the flood waters dropped in mid-February. In early February the north Queensland city of Cairns was threatened by Cyclone Yasi, and the RAAF conducted two C-17 sorties and two C-130 sorties to evacuate patients from Cairns Base Hospital on the night of 1/2 February. After the cyclone passed over the Queensland coast, C-17s flew 200 tonnes of groceries into Cairns over a two-day period as part of Operation Yasi Assist. No. 36 Squadron also contributed aircraft to the Australian response to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in late February, the C-17s flying urban search and rescue teams into the city from the 23rd of the month and evacuating Australian citizens on their return flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{task was}} given to 44th Indian Airborne Division, but this {{presented}} several problems. The division <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a reorganization, {{and many of its}} officers were on leave, as were two Gurkha airborne battalions; another, the 3rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion, was about to transfer to 77th Indian Parachute Brigade. With no one unit available, a composite force was put together for the operation. The Headquarters Company was formed of men from 2nd and 3rd Gurkha Parachute Battalions, and each battalion provided a further two companies – A and B from 2nd Gurkha Parachute Battalion and C and D from 3rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion. A mortar platoon and machine gun platoon augmented the ad hoc formation. The battalion was formed in early April, and came under the command of Major Jack Newland. After its initial formation it transferred to Chaklala, where its strength was augmented by Field Ambulance and Indian Engineers sections and it undertook training for the operation. When was this was completed it was transported to Midnapore, where for ten days it assembled its equipment and conducted a rehearsal exercise. Finally, on 29 April it was flown to Akyab on the Burmese coast, approximately 200 miles north of Rangoon, and was soon joined by a 200-strong reserve force formed of men from both Gurkha battalions and the 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion. The battalion would be transported in 40 C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft belonging to 1st and 2nd United States Air Commando Group.|$|E
