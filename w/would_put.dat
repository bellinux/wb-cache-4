5|$|Calhoun, {{though as}} avid a proponent for Texas {{acquisition}} as Upshur, posed a political liability to Tyler's aims. As secretary of state, Calhoun's political {{objective was to}} see that the presidency was placed {{in the hands of a}} southern extremist, who <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the expansion of slavery at the center of national policy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{places in}} Norway farms also {{maintained}} mountain farms (seter/støl), where cows, goats, and sheep <b>would</b> <b>put</b> out to pasture {{during the summer}} months. These would typically include a small dwelling house and a dairy for making and storing cheese, sour cream, etc.|$|E
5|$|A notable venue {{not found}} at the 1956 Games was an Olympic Village, where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d'Ampezzo had a {{population}} of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it <b>would</b> <b>put</b> many of them out of business. Athletes were billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.|$|E

5|$|During {{his rise}} to power, Richard Nixon {{became known as}} a leading anti-communist. After he became {{president}} in 1969, Nixon saw advantages in improving relations with China and the Soviet Union; he hoped that détente <b>would</b> <b>put</b> pressure on the North Vietnamese to end the Vietnam War, and {{he might be able}} to manipulate the two main communist powers to the benefit of the United States.|$|E
5|$|During his tenure, the {{business}} group grew its revenues {{more than ten}} percent each year for six years. The division {{accounted for more than}} 20 percent of Microsoft's revenues by January 2009. In this position, Muglia led Microsoft's ten-year plan for data center and desktop automation products, its Dynamic Systems Initiative and its Dynamic IT strategy. In October 2010, developers criticized Muglia for suggesting Microsoft <b>would</b> <b>put</b> less emphasis on Silverlight; a statement he later retracted.|$|E
5|$|High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato {{supports}} {{an early}} dating for Ebla that <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring {{the date of}} 2500 BC, later accepted the event could have happened in 2400 BC. The scholar suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash—who boasted of taking tribute from Mari—or Lugalzagesi of Umma, {{who claimed to have}} reached the Mediterranean.|$|E

It has been falsely reported as a prediction. The passage is clear, when you read the date in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this <b>would</b> <b>put</b> Christianity into disrepute.|$|E
5|$|In an {{election}} held on September 19, 1995, {{the residents of}} King County voted against a 1-percentage-point sales tax increase to fund {{the building of a}} replacement stadium.

5|$|NATO's unity was {{breached}} {{early in}} its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France. De Gaulle protested against the USA's strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship {{between it and the}} United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued {{for the creation of a}} tripartite directorate that <b>would</b> <b>put</b> France on an equal footing with the US and the UK.|$|E
5|$|Paul Davies, {{a member}} of the SETI Post-Detection Taskgroup, has stated that post-detection protocols, calling for {{international}} consultation before taking any major steps regarding the detection, are unlikely to be followed by astronomers, who <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the advancement of their careers over the word of a protocol that is not part of national or international law.|$|E
5|$|Positioning the Second and Third Armies {{with their}} {{bridging}} equipment along the canal {{in preparation for}} Operation Badr <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the Israelis on high alert. Without {{the element of surprise}} Egyptian forces would suffer high losses in the attack (estimates for casualties already ran in the thousands). The Directorate of Military Intelligence (abbreviated Aman), which formulated Israel's intelligence estimate and was known for its competency, was tasked with detecting troop movements and activity along Egyptian and Syrian forces; military activity which would be particularly intensive in the last days preceding the assault.|$|E

As a child, Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota. The circus's atmosphere sparked Reubens' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy, which made him want to make people laugh. At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, where he and his siblings <b>would</b> <b>put</b> on plays.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian High Command {{warned the}} French and British of their concerns. They {{feared that the}} Dyle plan <b>would</b> <b>put</b> not just the Belgian {{strategic}} position in danger, but also the entire left wing of the Allied front. King Leopold and General Raoul Van Overstraeten, the King's Aide de Camp, warned Gamelin and the French Army Command of their concerns on 8 March and 14 April. They were ignored.|$|E
5|$|The JNA was {{initially}} formed during World War II {{to carry out}} guerrilla warfare against occupying Axis forces. The success of the Partisan movement led to the JNA basing much of its operational strategy on guerrilla warfare, as its plans normally entailed defending against NATO or Warsaw Pact attacks, where other types of warfare <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the JNA in a comparatively poor position. That approach led to maintenance of a Territorial Defense system.|$|E

On November 1 of that year, the highway was realigned {{to follow a}} new road extending north of Woodward, intersecting US-64 east of Buffalo, and following existing highways north to the state line. This <b>would</b> <b>put</b> SH-34 on its present-day route north of Woodward. SH-50 would remain concurrent with SH-34 north of US-64 until November 9, 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} North Korean forces {{committed}} to the region is not known, however later {{research suggests that the}} North Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, and it is likely that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This <b>would</b> <b>put</b> the range of North Korean forces involved in the battle between 500 and 2,000.|$|E
5|$|Unsurprisingly, Ostapchuk {{was against}} Alliance Atlantis’s plans for Whyte Avenue, believing that it <b>would</b> <b>put</b> both the Garneau and the Princess out of business. The Old Strathcona Foundation sided with Magic Lantern, and fought the plans. The {{argument}} {{went all the}} way to Edmonton City Council, which was asked to waive Old Strathcona’s four-story height limit for the six-story multiplex. Council sided against Alliance Atlantis when Councillor Terry Cavanagh changed his vote at the last minute, defeating the motion 6-5.|$|E
