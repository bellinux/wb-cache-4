25|$|People grew richer {{entering}} the 1970s. Not surprisingly, {{people started to}} look for some means of investment. The passing of Banking Ordinance of 1964 would begin the tightening up of banks. A minimum capital of HKD 5million and liquidity ratio of 25% and limitation on loans and investments became the new requirements to open a legit institution. People began to have more trust in their banks, and the accumulation of savings led to people's <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest.</b>|$|E

With then-County Commissioner Bob Bedinghaus and members of City Council, she helped form the joint City-County Planning Committee to develop the Master Plan for Cincinnati's Central Riverfront and to determine the location of the two stadiums. In 1998, she ensured the expansion of the city's premier riverfront park system by insuring that money was budgeted for the construction of the Theodore M. Barry International Friendship Park.|$|E

2500|$|However, in an {{unexpected}} move, Portland showed their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in O'Neal by offering him a four-year contract worth $24 million. However, {{the new deal}} did not translate into more playing time for the power forward in the 1999–2000 season. Portland acquired Detlef Schrempf, [...] Scottie Pippen, and Steve Smith during the 1999 offseason, which meant that O'Neal was once again consigned to the bench. His statistics remained unimpressive, averaging 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during the regular season. In the meantime, the Trail Blazers continued {{to build on the}} success of their previous campaign. They notched 59 wins in the regular season, and defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Utah Jazz en route to reaching the Western Conference Finals. Up against recent perennial rivals the Los Angeles Lakers, the team relinquished a 15-point lead {{in the fourth quarter of}} the pivotal Game 7, and lost 89–84. Not that O'Neal was heavily involved in any of this, however. With back-to-back Conference Finals disappointments coupled with a lack of playing time, he soon announced his intention to be traded. The Trail Blazers relented in the end and sent him to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for NBA All-Star Dale Davis.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Somers, {{president}} of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia in 2007 article has emphasized the influence of American private investments for Russian democracy, {{as well as the}} amount of local support for them: [...] "In a nutshell, the booming Russian economy is transforming that nation's outlook, standard of living and opportunities for its people in ways that were unimaginable only five years ago. More than 10 million Russian citizens have traveled abroad. Private enterprise is thriving. Russians are happier, healthier and more optimistic than ever in their lives. And, contrary to what you might hear, surveys show that the Russian people are as pro-American, if not more so, than the populations of many a European country, and most hope for closer relations with the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "I would argue that the American business community has played a not insignificant role in fostering these developments. By their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in Russia's future, American companies have become effective ambassadors for the United States and its values, while creating new jobs and benefiting the economies of both our countries. And the Putin government has been supportive of these efforts in ways that some might find surprising. Russian officials go to considerable lengths to be cooperative and accommodate the needs of American business, {{while at the same time}} revising their regulations to align them more closely with international standards." ...|$|E

The sovereign was made to say that during the past year there had been no marked increase of serious crime, but there was in many places a concerted resistance to the enforcement of legal obligations, and the practice of intimidation continued to exist. “If,” the speech went on, “as my information leads me to apprehend, the existing provisions of the law should prove to be inadequate to cope with these growing evils, I look with confidence to your <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> my government with all necessary powers.” There was also an abstract paragraph about the legislative union between the two islands.|$|E

Although many factors affect the formation of human capital (e.g., investment in health and medical facilities and entrepreneurial training programs), education is the main contributor to human capital accumulation. Natural resource dependence decreases the <b>willingness</b> of individuals <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in human capital.

50|$|To raise capital, {{you require}} them from investors who are {{interested}} in the investments. You have to present those investors with high-return projects. By displaying high-level potentials of the projects, investors would be more attracted to put their money into those projects. After certain amount of time, usually in a year’s time, rewards of the investment will be shared with investors. This makes investors happy and they may continue <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> further. If returns do not meet the intended level, this could reduce the <b>willingness</b> of investors <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> their money into the funds. Hence, the amounts of financial incentives are highly weighted determinants to keep the funding remain at a desirable level.|$|R

30|$|There are {{no doubts}} that {{liberalization}} {{had a profound}} impact on the wheat sector in general and wheat R&D sector in particular. Reduction in wheat prices following liberalization as producers were required to compete with foreign counterparts, turned wheat from a profitable commodity into an extremely risky and unprofitable crop that farmers would only use as a filler in their fields in winter when more profitable crops could not be grown. The opening of the economy was perceived by the interviewees as very sudden, which undermined wheat production and <b>willingness</b> of farmers <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in wheat R&D.|$|R

This paper, based on the latest three waves of the UK Community Innovation Survey, compares drivers of innovation investment before and during the crisis.

40|$|Production {{processes}} in horticulture are increasingly industrialized. Greenhouses have developed towards high-tech production {{plants that are}} highly automated by advanced systems for climate control, irrigation, crop monitoring, harvesting, internal transportation, sorting and packaging. At the same time, horticultural production nowadays is a complex managerial task, which needs advanced management information. However, this information is often registered manually in enterprise management systems. This paper aims {{to contribute to a}} better integration of production automation systems and enterprise management systems in the Dutch horticulture. It investigates the current situation and existing related standards (ISOBUS and ISA- 95). Moreover, the paper identifies barriers for the adoption of integration solutions, including the economic situation, a decrease of the high-end market, a low <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> cooperate, a relative low scale of growers, a high perceived complexity and path dependency, a negative perception of the relative advantage and a limited <b>willingness</b> of growers <b>to</b> <b>invest.</b> </p...|$|R

The primary aim of this study is to begin to address this gap by understanding how individuals attribute different emphasis on specific aspects of human rights when making decisions <b>to</b> purchase, work, <b>invest</b> or support the community operations for socially responsible organisations. In order to achieve this objective, a survey instrument was administered to professionals in Russia and Bulgaria. Our data indicate that there is a significant correlation between individuals’ sensitivity towards different components of human rights and their perceptions of the importance of CSR in decision making. Specifically, the recognition of political rights was strongly associated with the <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> purchase, <b>invest,</b> seek employment and support socially responsible firms.

30|$|The prior {{research}} adopted agency theory {{and studied the}} relationship between ownership and firms’ R&D by addressing the potential conflicts between shareholders and managers (Kim et al. 2008; Belloc 2012; Choi et al. 2012). Agency theory views modern corporations as contractual relationships between shareholder and management and asserts that agency problem arises when the desires or goals of shareholder and management conflict due to the separation of ownership and control (Jensen and Meckling 1976). The divergence of interests between shareholders and management hence requires adequate monitoring to discipline managers and ensure they work in the shareholders’ interests instead of their own. Researchers have found that both ownership type and structure are vital in shaping organizational R&D decision making and innovation performance because they affect both <b>willingness</b> and power <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in this risky strategy (Choi et al. 2011).|$|R
