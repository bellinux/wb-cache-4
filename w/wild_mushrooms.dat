American mycologist David Arora reported that some enjoyed it while he felt it had a strong sour taste.|$|E
5|$|One {{danger of}} {{attempting}} to consume hallucinogenic or other <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> especially for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility of}} misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 In this dissertation, I {{illustrate}} how disciplinary power techniques {{are being used}} today to extend and solidify state control over forest understory products located on national forest lands in the Pacific Northwest. The spring <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> harvest on the Sisters Ranger District in central Oregon serves {{as a case study}} for exploring this topic. I used a political ecology framework to analyze <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> politics at Sisters. I relied upon ethnographic methods, including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and archival analysis, to gather data. My work indicates that the Sisters Ranger District is using five elements of disciplinary power noted by Foucault in efforts to solidify control over the activities of commercial <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> harvesters. The elements in use include: (1) categorization of pickers; (2) separation of commercial pickers from other forest users; (3) development of a documenting apparatus {{in the form of a}} variety of permit requirements; (4) creation of a <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> "panopticon" in the form of a heavily monitored <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> buying camp; and (5) a movement toward professionalization of the knowledge accepted as valid within the forest management decision-making process. The application of these disciplinary power techniques has created considerable tension between <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> pickers and buyers and the Forest Service. These tensions revolve in part around the Forest Service's failure to include pickers and buyers in key decisions affecting their lives, such as the establishment and siting of an industrial <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> camp. The disciplinary apparatus also works by fixing people in place and time in order to facilitate monitoring and tracking of activities and individuals. Yet mobility and flexibility constitute the very core of pickers and buyers lives. Lastly, the disciplinary power apparatus has transformed what were once picker living spaces into industrial work places. Much of the current resistance to the Forest Service's <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> policies stem from pickers and buyers' feelings of having lost control, not just over their work, but over their lives...|$|R
5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so {{to feed their}} dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of Dolly Varden trout, <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and <b>wild</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of different drying temperature to the nutritional compositions of edible <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> (Volvariella volvacea) and to determine the best drying temperature suitable for post-harvest handling without compromising their nutritional value. The fresh <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> was obtained from the rural area near to the forest area around Sandakan. The mushroom samples (fresh and treated with 40, 50, 60 °C) were tested for proximate analysis (moisture, ash, total crude fibre, fat, protein and carbohydrate content). The fresh mushroom contained high protein (12. 38 %) and carbohydrate (13. 51 %); but low in fat content (0. 77 %) as compared to the commercial one (Lentinus edodes and Agaricus bisporus). All the samples exhibited reducing trend (P< 0. 05) for the parameters tested (moisture, fat, crude fiber and carbohydrate content) when treated at respective temperatures, except for the ash and crude fiber content. Mushroom treated at 60 °C has comparable high energy (1468. 73 kj) and calorie (346. 04 kcal) content. The current study revealed that the treatment using 60 °C is suitable to dry the edible <b>wild</b> <b>mushroom</b> as it preserves most nutritional values.

It is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable Tylopilus felleus, but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini, it is a whitish, net-like pattern on a brownish stalk, whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting a tiny bit of flesh will yield a bitter taste. It can also resemble the [...] "bolete-like" [...] Gyroporus castaneus, which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem.|$|E
500|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, but {{removal of}} the slimy cap cuticle and partial veil is recommended to avoid possible gastrointestinal upset; similarly, the 1992 field guide Edible <b>Wild</b> <b>Mushrooms</b> of North America recommends the {{removal of the}} tube layer before preparation, as it can become slimy during cooking.

A Canadian field guide is more cautious in its assessment, and suggests that one would have to be brave to consume a mushroom with such a sticky veil. Mycologist David Arora, in his Mushrooms Demystified, opines that it is not worth eating.
