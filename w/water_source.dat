40|$|Water is {{essential}} to life. Three general forms of water exist: pre-formed water that is available in food, metabolic water that is created as a byproduct of life processes (e. g., metabolism of fat or breakdown of carbohydrates), and free water (i. e., water available for drinking). As humans settle arid environments, the addition of man-made free <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> (e. g., sewage ponds, catchment ponds) often occurs. In addition, a tool commonly used to increase the abundance or distribution of wildlife species in desert environments is the addition of <b>water</b> <b>sources,</b> usually specifically designed to benefit game species like bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar). In recent decades, some scientists have argued that adding <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> to deserts may have little to no effect on desert species because they are adapted to living in desert conditions, and have thus evolved to obtain their water needs in preformed and/or metabolic form. Scientists have also suggested that adding <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> to desert environments may actually harm some individual species and alter the arraignments of groups of similarly related species, known as communities. I conducted four studies at the U. S. Army Dugway Proving Ground to determine if man-made <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> have an influence on the rodent community, jackrabbits, and the canid community at the U. S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. I found that turning off <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> {{had no effect on}} abundance of rodent communities or jackrabbits. I found that a portion of coyotes used <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> and coyotes were only slightly less common near <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> once they were turned off. In addition, a portion of coyotes rarely or never drink from <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> and that coyotes did not leave their territories if <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> accessible to them were turned off. My final study revealed that turning off <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> did not influence kit fox survival or abundance, and that kit fox territories differed from areas associated with <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> in several key environmental characterizes, which may suggest that areas associated with <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> were not historically used by kit foxes. In summary, these findings suggest that water developments have little impact on the species that I studied...|$|R

Underground <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> and other permanent <b>water</b> <b>sources</b> were therefore tapped into and used in these areas which have very different topographical features and appearances.

In the 19th century, native forests were cleared, gravel removed for construction and many foreign species introduced.

5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh <b>water</b> <b>source</b> of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E
