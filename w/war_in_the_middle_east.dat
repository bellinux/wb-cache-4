5|$|The <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> {{ended on}} 31 October 1918, {{following}} {{the signing of}} the Armistice of Moudros. In November the regiment was selected {{to be part of the}} Allied force of occupation for the Dardanelles peninsula. They would again be going in a dismounted role, but only twenty-five officers and 464 other ranks were involved. Leaving Egypt on 28 November they disembarked on 5 December and moved into their camps at Maidos and Kilid Bahr. On 19 January 1919, the majority of the regiment returned to Egypt, rejoining the brigade at Kantara.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{overwhelming}} British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian Edward Ingram noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to {{change the course of}} history is underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Auguste de Marmont, Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, Louis Desaix, Jean Reynier, Antoine-François Andréossy, Jean-Andoche Junot, Louis-Nicolas Davout and Dumas were all passengers on the cramped Mediterranean crossing.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E

25|$|The <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> ended shortly {{afterwards}} {{when the}} armistice of Mudros {{was signed in}} October 1918.

25|$|The British Empire was {{severely}} {{weakened by the}} <b>war.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> the war had made Britain conscious of its dependence on Arab oil. British firms controlled Iraqi oil and Britain ruled Kuwait, Bahrain and the Emirates. Shortly after VE Day, the Labour Party won the general election in Britain.

25|$|Many {{adherents of}} the 9/11 Truth {{movement}} suspect that United States government insiders {{played a part}} in the attacks, or may have known the attacks were imminent, and did nothing to alert others or stop them. Some within the movement who argue that insiders within the United States government were directly responsible for the September 11 attacks often allege that the attacks were planned and executed in order to provide the U.S. with a pretext for going to <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> and, by extension, as a means of consolidating and extending the power of the Bush Administration.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Fanshawe commanded a cavalry division and then the Cavalry Corps in France, before assuming command of V Corps in late 1915. He was removed from command in mid-1916, however, as a result of political manoeuvring following the attempt to find a scapegoat for the failed Actions of St Eloi Craters in March 1916. He later commanded the 18th Indian Division in Mesopotamia and was with it {{at the end of the}} <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> He retired from the Army in 1920, and served as the ceremonial colonel of the Queen's Bays.|$|E
25|$|A Provisional Battalion {{had been}} formed in January 1916 from {{reinforcements}} {{intended for the}} 1st Ox and Bucks, joining the 28th Indian Brigade, 7th (Meerut) Division. The battalion joined the Lines of Communication (LoC) force and the Provisional Battalion was re-titled the 1st Battalion on 6 July 1917. On 19 October 1917 the battalion transferred to the 50th Indian Brigade, 15th Indian Division. By then, the British had taken Baghdad and were gradually pushing the Ottomans further back. Between 26–27 March 1918 it took part in fighting against the Ottomans at Khan Baghdadi. The Ottomans signed an Armistice with the Allies on 30 October, ending the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b>|$|E
25|$|The final major {{military}} {{operation in the}} <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> took place shortly thereafter. The Soviet Union desperately needed supplies for its war against Germany. Supplies were being sent around the North Cape convoy route to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, but the capacity of that route was limited and subject to enemy action. Supplies were also sent from the United States to Vladivostok in Soviet-flagged ships. However, yet more capacity was needed, the obvious answer was to go through Persia (now Iran). The Shah of Persia was somewhat pro-German, and so would not allow this. Consequently, British and Soviet forces invaded and occupied Persia. The Shah was deposed (removed from power) and his son put on the throne.|$|E

25|$|Egyptian {{sovereignty}} and {{ownership of the}} Canal had been confirmed by the United States and the United Nations. In retirement Eden maintained that the military response to the crisis had prevented a much larger <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> Israel had been expecting an Egyptian invasion in either March or April 1957, {{as well as a}} Soviet invasion of Syria. The crisis also arguably hastened the process of decolonization, as many of the remaining colonies of both Britain and France gained independence over the next several years. Some argued that the imposed ending to the Crisis led to over-hasty decolonization in Africa, increasing the chance of civil wars and military dictatorships in newly independent countries.|$|E
25|$|A strong Ottoman {{column was}} seen {{retiring}} north of Aleppo along the Alexandretta road by the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade. The Mysore Lancers advanced at the charge; three squadrons in line of squadron columns, the fourth squadron in support {{to capture a}} rearguard position held by 150 Ottoman soldiers armed with rifles and artillery. About 50 survived and 20 were taken prisoner. The Jodhpur and Mysore Lancers made a second unsuccessful charge after the position had been strong reinforced {{by as many as}} 2,000 soldiers commanded by Mustapha Kemal. Fighting continued throughout the day until at about 23:00 when the 14th Cavalry Brigade (5th Cavalry Division) arrived and the Ottoman force withdrew ending the last engagement of the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was then}} involved in following up the retreating Ottoman forces into Palestine. In 1918, they were positioned on the River Jordan, fighting two small battles at Amman in February and Es Salt in April and May. The main British assault {{was on the}} coast, but the 5th Light Horse remained on the Jordan, attacking Amman in September. On 29 September, two of the regiment's squadrons accepted the surrender of 4,500 Ottoman soldiers. When the Armistice of Mudros was signed in October 1918, and the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> ended, the regiment returned to Egypt, to assist in putting down a riot. Then, on 28 June 1919, the regiment sailed for Australia; their involvement in the war cost them 137 killed and 708 wounded.|$|E
