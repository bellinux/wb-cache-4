The resulting two volumes, titled Studies and Executed Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright, were published in 1911 in two editions, creating the first major exposure of Wright's work in Europe. The work contained more than 100 lithographs of Wright's designs and was {{commonly known as the}} Wasmuth Portfolio.|$|E
500|$|The film's plot is {{influenced}} primarily from [...] "Extremis," [...] the 2005-2006 Iron Man comics storyline written by Warren Ellis. The first two acts would remain character-centric, albeit in Shane Black's words [...] "more hectic, frenetic, and large scale" [...] {{to fulfill its}} sequel obligations, with the third act going for more over-the-top action to <b>what</b> <b>Drew</b> Pearce described as [...] "giving a sense of opera." [...] The middle act was compared to Sullivan's Travels in having Tony meeting various people on his journey, and the writers made sure to not make the characters too similar. The initial draft had Maya Hansen herself leading the villainous operation, with the Mandarin and Killian emerging as antagonists in later versions of the script. During one of the writing sessions, Pearce suggested that the Mandarin was a fake, and Black agreed by going with making him an actor, which in turn Pearce detailed as an overacting British stage performer. Black explained: [...] "Who would be fool enough to declare that is an international terrorist? If you're smart, whatever regime you're part of, you'd put a puppet committee and remain your house." [...] In turn Killian would hide Slattery in [...] "his own frat house, {{in kind of a}} drug-related house arrest" [...] to keep the secret alive.|$|E
500|$|Fresco {{approached}} Jonathan Slavin, {{with whom}} he had previously worked on the sitcom Andy Richter Controls the Universe, about playing the role of Phil. Being a fan of Slavin's work, he thought he'd be great for the role. Andrea Anders, whom Fresco previously enjoyed on The Class, and Malcolm Barrett were cast for the roles of Linda and Lem respectively. Portia de Rossi met with Fresco about the role of Veronica. Fresco assessed during their meeting that de Rossi was completely convinced that the role was perfect for her and that she was born to play it. He thought de Rossi nailed the role and cast her. When asked <b>what</b> <b>drew</b> her to the role, de Rossi replied, [...] "I'm really attracted to strong women." [...] De Rossi further went on to say, [...] "I kind of had to throw myself at [...] I told him I'd played this character who had similar qualities, very work driven, strong, insensitive, slightly chilly. I had to convince him I could play this character well and could play a character of this nature." [...] Jay Harrington was the first person Fresco met with when trying to cast someone as Ted Crisp. Although Fresco really liked Harrington, he decided to see more people before casting the role. After five weeks, Harrington was cast.|$|E

500|$|By April 2010, Joss Whedon {{was close}} to {{completing}} a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script, and was officially announced in July 2010. When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not [...] "have anything" [...] and they should [...] "pretend this draft never happened". Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is." [...] Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that <b>what</b> <b>drew</b> him to the film is that he loves how [...] "these people shouldn't {{be in the same room}} let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family".|$|E
500|$|According to CNN, {{he became}} a drug dealer and used the Bible that his {{grandmother}} gave him as a good luck charm. After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced {{him that he was}} at a [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were just people like me. [...] They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was just different. They were loving and that's really <b>what</b> <b>drew</b> me in." [...] Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though [...] "it wasn't overnight" [...] and he [...] "spent a lot of time making bad decisions." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 29, 2008, Clark made {{comments}} on Face the Nation that were critical of Republican John McCain, {{calling into question}} the notion that McCain's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. [...] "I certainly honor [...] service as a prisoner of war", Clark said, [...] "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded—it wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall." [...] When moderator Bob Schieffer noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he [...] "ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down", Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark's retort, however, is <b>what</b> <b>drew</b> rebuke. In referring to McCain's military experience, he stated: [...] "Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president." [...] Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark's comment. However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark's comments were [...] "inartful" [...] and were not intended to attack McCain's military service. In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat. In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain's service, he has serious concerns about McCain's judgment in matters of national security policy, calling McCain [...] "untested and untried".|$|E

Anderson had heard that Daniel Day-Lewis liked his earlier film Punch-Drunk Love, which gave him the confidence to hand Day-Lewis a copy of the incomplete script. According to Day-Lewis, being asked to do the film was enough to convince him. In an interview with The New York Observer, he elaborated that <b>what</b> <b>drew</b> him to the project was [...] "the understanding that [...] had already entered into that world, [...] wasn't observing it [...] entered into it [...] and indeed [...] populated it with characters who [...] felt had lives of their own".|$|E

[...] With the exception of silver mines worked in the Aztec period at Taxco, southwest of Tenochtitlan, the Mexico's mining region was outside the area of dense indigenous settlement. Labor for the mines {{in the north of}} Mexico had a workforce of black slave labor and indigenous wage labor, not draft labor. Indigenous who were drawn to the mining areas were from different regions of the center of Mexico, with a few from the north itself. With such diversity they did not have a common ethnic identity or language and rapidly assimilated to Hispanic culture.

Herman's version was so successful that it made Columbia hold from release the arrangement that Harry James had recorded days earlier. The Columbia contract coincided with a change in the band's repertoire. [...] The 1944 group, which he called the First Herd, was famous for its progressive jazz. The First Herd's music was heavily influenced by Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Its lively, swinging arrangements, combining bop themes with swing rhythm parts, were greatly admired. [...] As of February 1945 the personnel included Bill Harris, Sonny Berman, Pete Candoli, Billy Bauer (later replaced by Chuck Wayne), Ralph Burns, Davey Tough and Flip Phillips.

As Wilder noted, [...] "He was in Alcoholics Anonymous, and I {{think he had a}} tough time with me – I drove him back into drinking..." [...] By the time the picture was released, Chandler was thoroughly disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled [...] "Writers in Hollywood" [...] for The Atlantic Monthly in November 1945 in which he complained: [...] "The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio." [...] He neglected, however, to mention that the studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval – a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days. Offended, Wilder responded by saying, [...] "We didn't invite him? How could we? He was under the table drunk at Lucy's," [...] a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees.

[...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film.
