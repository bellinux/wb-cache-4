5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the same}} day Haldane ordered US 1/28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels in their area of operations, {{uncovering}} a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps. A Company subsequently located another tunnel system after an American {{was killed by a}} Viet Cong soldier <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> appeared out of a large anthill. Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.|$|E
5|$|Theo died in January 1891, {{removing}} Vincent's {{most vocal}} and well-connected champion. Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties {{who had not}} known either her husband or her brother-in law very long and <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{had to take care}} of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation, and Johanna's brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his work. Aurier, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters among the critics, died of typhoid fever in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.|$|E

5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E
5|$|Xander's dream {{begins when}} he wakes on Buffy's couch. After excusing himself {{to use the}} restroom, he finds himself the object of an {{attempted}} seduction by Joyce. In the restroom, he starts to unzip, then realizes that the bathroom {{is attached to a}} large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike – unaffected by daylight – tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they invite him to join them. He tries to do so, only to end up in the basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the Apocalypse Now scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz. Throughout the sequence Xander finds himself in his basement again and again, chased by an unseen pursuer, who is revealed as the First Slayer when she tears his heart out.|$|E

25|$|The Franks of Acre {{were for}} some time aware of the {{seriousness}} of the situation. They asked for help from Europe which resulted in nothing significant. A small group of knights, among them the Savoyard Otto of Grandson, were sent by King Edward I of England. Burchard of Schwanden, the Grand Master of the German Teutonic Knights, resigned and was replaced by Konrad von Feuchtwangen <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> left Acre for Europe.

25|$|Bustamante was a well-behaved {{teenager}} <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{at the age}} of 22 {{became a}} career criminal. His crimes included theft, breaking and entering, drug offenses, and robbery. In 1990 Bustamante was charged with a homicide. The defense team discovered that the client had suffered a head injury from a crowbar {{at the age of}} twenty. Bustamante’s behavior changed fundamentally after that, transforming him from a normal individual into an impulsive and emotionally labile criminal. The defense team had his client’s brain scanned, which revealed malfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex. At the end the jury believed that Bustamante’s brain was not normal and spared him from the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|At 07:45 on 1 April as the rearguard of Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment {{passed through}} the village the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron was {{attacked}} by Circassians <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> opened fire from a mill and adjacent caves, from houses and from behind rocks on the nearby hills.

25|$|Discontinuing benzodiazepines or {{antidepressants}} abruptly due {{to concerns}} of teratogenic {{effects of the}} medications has {{a high risk of}} causing serious complications, so is not recommended. For example, abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepines or antidepressants has a high risk of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms, including suicidal ideation and a severe rebound effect of the return of the underlying disorder if present. This can lead to hospitalisation and potentially, suicide. One study reported one-third of mothers <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> discontinued or very rapidly tapered their medications became acutely suicidal due to 'unbearable symptoms'. One woman had a medical abortion, as she felt she could no longer cope, and another woman used alcohol in a bid to combat the withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines. The study reported physicians generally are not aware of the severe consequences of abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Surrealist Street filled {{one side}} of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various surrealists. The main hall was a {{simulation}} of a dark subterranean cave with 1,200 empty coal bags suspended from the ceiling. The floor was covered by Paalen with dead leaves and mud from the Montparnasse Cemetery. In the middle of the grand hall underneath Duchamp´s coal sacks, Paalen installed an artificial water-filled pond with real water lilies and reeds, which he called Avant La Mare. Illumination was provided only by a single light bulb, so patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art (an idea of Man Ray), while the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Around midnight, the visitors witnessed the dancing shimmer of a scantily dressed girl <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> arose from the reeds, jumped on a bed, shrieked hysterically, then disappeared just as quickly. Much to the surrealists' satisfaction, the exhibition scandalized many of the guests.|$|E

Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E

25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, <b>who</b> <b>suddenly</b> decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E
