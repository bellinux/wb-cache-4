500|$|As Madsen has described, Cisneros's [...] "effort to {{negotiate}} a cross-cultural identity {{is complicated by the}} need to challenge the deeply rooted patriarchal values of both Mexican and American cultures." [...] The lives of all Cisneros’s female characters are affected by how femininity and female sexuality are defined within this patriarchal value system and they must struggle to rework these definitions. As Cisneros has said: [...] "There's always this balancing act, we've got to define what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> fine for ourselves instead of what our culture says." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs and}} {{scenes from the}} show address racial issues. [...] "Colored Spade", which {{introduces}} the character Hud, a militant black male, is {{a long list of}} racial slurs ("jungle bunny... little black sambo") topped off with the declaration that Hud is the [...] "president of the United States of love". At the end of his song, he tells the tribe that the [...] "boogie man" [...] will get them, as the tribe pretends to be frightened. [...] "Dead End", sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. One of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "What do <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> really great? To bomb, lynch and segregate!" [...] "Black Boys/White Boys" [...] is an exuberant acknowledgement of miscegenation; the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967.

The various pop and urban influences in that album confused the audience, and Milian wanted So Amazin to paint a picture; [...] "you get led down the whole way, you kinda get to see my growth through one album". Wanting a more consistent approach for her new album, Milian collaborated with only one team of producers, which made for a greater representation of a [...] "more mature, settled" [...] Milian. The purpose of the album was to record an album that had more realness, so that female fans could relate to what she was singing about. Milian felt that Cool & Dre brought their own style of beats to the album, giving it a [...] "raw feel" [...] and [...] "street credibility". Marcello [...] "Cool" [...] Valenzano of Cool & Dre said that [...] "we come from an R background, and we bringing [...] something new to the table, a style <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> hot." [...] For So Amazin, Milian knew that she needed to record material that had a [...] "realness". She wanted to make dance tracks, but also wanted to express more of herself at the same time. Milian found the album to be [...] "so much more real and urban and street" [...] than her previous albums.|$|E

All of the North American shows took place in smaller-scale clubs, rather than a large arena or stadium. All pyrotechnics were removed from the shows. The European leg of the tour began approximately one month after the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Guitarist DJ Ashba discussed a potential follow up to Chinese Democracy in a 2012 interview, stating [...] "I've written and demoed up probably about 12 songs, I think.

[...] The design featured a “prow-shaped base of stone,” with a sweeping 125-foot glass carillon tower providing “a luminous well of light.” The current social outreach and education facilities would be doubled and the modern design, the architects asserted, would create a sense of refuge and “communitarian communality.” The architects described the design: [...] "...the crisscrossing of the structure, like a canopy of trees, but you won’t {{be able to see the}} top, which <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> an expression of sacredness,” adding, “the sanctuary is very flexible and interfaith use is possible so that space can be shared with other denominations.” ...|$|E

[...] In 2008, along with then-Senator (and presumptive Democratic nominee for president) Barack Obama, and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Hagel visited Iraq in a congressional delegation trip, meeting with U.S. service members, General David Petraeus, and the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki.

2500|$|According to writer Spencer Rothbell, {{the show}} was created with a naturalistic tone, similar to {{cartoons}} of the 1990s, combined with a more modern feeling. Given this naturalism, writers can reference works that have inspired for them or fit the genre of an episode. He ultimately {{felt that it was}} about [...] "empowering kids and having fun". Rothbell also avoids [...] "pigeonholing" [...] into one type of story, and that while some plots are mostly character-driven, others are [...] "based on one idea that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> really funny". Inspiration also came from the shows Page watched as a child, which invoked more poignant and relatable situations. Despite this, elements of fantasy are allowed, and that conveying both incongruous to one another was one technique he particularly enjoyed. Boles noted that the art direction called for inconsistent character design to avoid having to fit model sheet with the universe perfectly—a result of what he dubs the Simpsons effect. Attention is also paid to background characters in order to expand variety in its plot and universe.|$|E
2500|$|The Cleveland Indians traded Lawton to the Pittsburgh Pirates on December 11, 2004. The Indians {{received}} pitcher Arthur Rhodes in the trade. Both teams received cash considerations {{from each}} other. Pirates general manager Dave Littlefield {{commented on the}} acquisition by saying [...] "Lawton, <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> a good fit. With this move we've been able to help our offense". Lawton was slated to be the team's leadoff hitter after {{the departure of the}} man who hit in that position during the 2004 season, Jason Kendall.

2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going on in our country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> really important and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other.

500|$|Feelings: {{emotions}} or sensations, free {{of thought}} and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., [...] "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> (e.g., [...] "inadequate"), how <b>we</b> <b>think</b> others <b>are</b> evaluating us (e.g., [...] "unimportant"), or what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> others <b>are</b> doing to us (e.g., [...] "misunderstood", [...] "ignored").

2500|$|Deleuze's unusual metaphysics entails {{an equally}} {{atypical}} epistemology, {{or what he}} calls a transformation of [...] "the image of thought". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as Aristotle, René Descartes, and Edmund Husserl, misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, neutral point of view, but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a [...] "thought without image", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. [...] "All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift." ...|$|E
