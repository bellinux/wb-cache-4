500|$|Under oath in court, Bomar {{said that}} he had no search warrant and {{anticipated}} that he would not have a warrant the next time he searched similar properties. He called journalist Vincent Sheean a [...] "lying Communistic yellow ——." [...] According to a contemporary account, [...] "In this situation, even though it’s fair to say [...] <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> his job, it’s equally clear that he was a loose cannon. His personality dominated the scene, and it was the personality of a bully." ...|$|E

[...] Nilsson explained [...] "once I got the take down, I knew what I {{was going to do}} with it later. He didn't." [...] Newman said of his experience that he [...] "was honored that a writer with Harry's talent would choose to do an album of someone else's songs." [...] Newman continued, [...] "he was such a great singer, a virtuoso singer, really, and he could do so many things as a vocalist that I couldn't do—like hold a note." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Beyond the Sea" [...] {{was written}} by The X-Files co-executive {{producers}} and long-time writing partners, Glen Morgan and James Wong; it was their fourth script for the series. The episode was directed by David Nutter. As Morgan and Wong explained, their episode was written in response to criticisms of the show's initially limited characterization of Scully. Wong said, [...] "Gillian Anderson needed to show off her talents more, {{and this was a}} perfect opportunity to dispel those notions that Scully will never believe. It was time for the character to grow, because she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> {{the same kind of thing}} too often." [...] Executives at Fox vetoed the idea two times before Carter told the network, [...] "we're doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan Sprouse {{has stated}} that the {{experience}} of coming to fame after the success of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is [...] "kind of scary, how fast everything is moving" [...] and that a year prior [...] "none of this was happening, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> Suite Life", and that he was excited for the future. While filming The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, the both of them received on-set tutoring for three hours each day for school, and said they were getting [...] "straight A's and honors". In their last year of high school, the brothers both took Advanced Placement classes. Dylan took AP Psychology and AP Spanish, and Cole took AP Psychology and AP Government.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{began their}} third {{nationwide}} tour on 18 May 1963, the bill this time headed by Roy Orbison. Orbison had established even greater UK chart success than either Montez or Roe, with eight previous chart entries of his own—four of them entering the top 10, including the #2 [...] "Dream Baby" [...] and the #1 [...] "Only the Lonely"—and {{was about to}} achieve his next top 10 entry with [...] "Falling", which entered the charts during the tour. However, at the tour's opening show, staged at the Adelphi Cinema, Slough, the American star proved less popular than The Beatles, just as had happened with Roe and Montez throughout the previous nationwide tour. As events unfolded it became obvious this {{was not going to}} change, and a week into the tour the covers of the souvenir programs were reprinted to place The Beatles above Roy Orbison. Despite The Beatles' ascent {{to the top of the}} bill, Starr was impressed with the response Orbison still commanded. Starr recalled, [...] "We would be backstage, listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> it by his voice. Just standing there singing, not moving or anything." [...] The third tour had a duration of three weeks, and ended on 9 June 1963.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{an instant}} success, the novel {{steadily}} increased in sales, eventually attracting a following behind its core idea of [...] "Generation X". Over his own protestations, Coupland was dubbed the spokesperson for a generation, stating in 2006 [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> what I do and {{people sort of}} stuck that on to me. It's not like I spend my days thinking that way." [...] Terms popularized by Coupland in the novel, including Generation X and McJob, ultimately entered the vernacular.|$|E

2500|$|Raeder {{testified that}} he was an apolitical {{professional}} who <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> his duty, and to the extent he thought about politics, he disliked the Nazi regime. Raeder {{testified that he}} was deeply horrified {{by the nature of the}} Nazi regime when he saw how badly Gessler had been tortured in March 1945, stated he had stopped wearing his Golden Party Badge to protest the Nazi regime after he had seen what had been done to Gessler, and he had frequently made [...] "serious protests" [...] against the Nazi regime during private meetings with Hitler, so it was unfair to blame him for the crimes of the Third Reich. This in turn led him to be questioned by Maxwell Fyfe about his speech on Heroes' Day on 12 March 1939 praising Hitler [...] "...for the clear and unmerciful declaration of war against Bolshevism and International Jewry, whose drive for destruction of peoples we have felt quite enough in our racial body". Raeder testified in response to Maxwell Fyfe's question about his Heroes' Day speech to his belief that starting in 1917 [...] "International Jewry had destroyed the resistance of the German people...and had gained an excessively large and oppressive influence in German affairs" [...] and all of the anti-Semitic measures of the Nazi regime which presumably included genocide were merely just acts of German self-defence. Goda wrote that Raeder by his own testimony disproved his own claims to have been an apolitical professional who was against the Nazi regime, and instead established {{that he was an}} anti-Semite who willingly served the Nazi regime because of his hatred for Jews. Taylor commented about Raeder's claim to have been just an apolitical professional doing his job was meaningless because: [...] "It is an innocent and respectable business to be a locksmith, but it is nonetheless a crime if the locksmith turns his talents into picking the locks of his neighbours and looting their homes." [...] Raeder's claims to have been an apolitical officer who objected to the Nazis involved him in many testy exchanges with Maxwell Fyfe. Maxwell Fyfe charged that Raeder had been part of the effort to cover up that it was an U-boat that sank the Athenia and to falsely accuse the British of sinking the Athenia. Raeder claimed that he had been [...] "very indignant" [...] about his government's claim that Britain had sunk the Athenia, which led Maxwell Fyfe to remark that he had done nothing to express that [...] "indignation", just as he claimed to have been angry about the false charges of homosexuality against Werner von Fritsch, where he had also done nothing after Fritsch had been cleared.|$|E

5000|$|Former {{rock band}} drummer Matt Stevens {{was the final}} member to join. The band met him while in the studio making a demo {{recording}} {{on the advice of}} friends. According to Hood, they didn't really think anything would happen with it:"We were never into rap for the business or industry standpoint. We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> it as a tool. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a good idea to send demo out, it was not like we put our hopes behind it-it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> something to <b>do.</b> We were content to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> in the northeastern Ohio area ministering, but God saw fit, because of our faithfulness to Him, to take it abroad." ...|$|R
60|$|At dinner-time {{he found}} out that his father was going to take him and all his sisters to the circus, and his father and mother were so nice to him, asking him about the {{procession}} and everything, that his heart ached at the thought of running away from home and leaving them. But now he had to do it; the circus man was coming for him, and he could not back out; {{he did not know what}} would happen if he did. It seemed to him as if his mother had done everything she could to make it harder for him. She had stewed chicken for dinner, with plenty of gravy, and hot biscuits to sop in, and peach preserves afterward; and she kept helping him to more, because she said boys that followed the circus around got dreadfully hungry. The eating seemed to keep his heart down; it was trying to get into his throat all the time; and he knew that she was being good to him, but if he had not known it he would have believed his mother <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> it to mock him.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} {{suffering}} because love {{was not the}} first emotion in his heart, the girl could only feel he was right not to be loving her; that she ought to be glad of what was eating up all else within him. It was ungenerous, unworthy, to want to be loved at such a moment. Yet she could not help it! This was her first experience of the eternal tug between self and the loved one pulled in the hearts of lovers. Would she ever come to feel happy when he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> what he thought was right? And she drew a little away from him; then perceived that unwittingly she had done the right thing, for he at once tried to take her hand again. And this was her first lesson, too, in the nature of man. If she did not give her hand, he wanted it! But she was not one of those who calculate in love; so she gave him her hand at once. That went to his heart; and he put his arm round her, till he could feel the emotion under those stays that would not be drawn any closer. In this nest beneath the ash-tree they sat till they heard the organ wheeze and the furious sound of the last hymn, and saw the brisk coming-forth with its air of, 'Thank God! And now, to eat!' till at last there was no stir again about the little church--no stir at all save that of nature's ceaseless thanksgiving....|$|E
