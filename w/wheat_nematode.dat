40|$|Twenty-two {{cover crops}} were {{evaluated}} {{for their ability}} to reduce damage by root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica, to taro, Colocastia esculenta, in a tropical cropping system. Cover crops were grown and incorporated into the soil before taro was planted. Barley, greenpanic, glycine, marigold, sesame, sunn hemp, and sorghum x sudangrass DeKalb ST 6 E were poor or nonhosts to the nematode as measured by low population changes of nematodes in soil between cover crop planting and taro planting. Alfalfa, buckwheat, cowpea, lablab, Lana vetch, mustard, oat, okra, rhodes grass, ryegrain, ryegrass, siratro, sweet corn, and <b>wheat</b> allowed <b>nematode</b> populations to increase dramatically. Taro yields were greatest in the marigold plots and lowest in the ryegrain plots. Taro corm weight decreased with increasing initial nematode population (Pi) (r = 0. 22, P = 0. 056). Siratro, ryegrass, and Blizzard wheat plots had higher taro yield than plots with similar Pi's but planted to other cover crops. These cover crops may have antagonism to other soil microorganisms or their decomposition products may be toxic or adversely affect the nematodes. Cover crops can be an effective and valuable nematode management tactic for use in minor tropical cropping systems such as taro...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{parasitic}} nematodes {{are difficult}} to identify because different species are morphologically similar, and this makes their control more difficult. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} rapid, simple method to identify plant parasitic nemal:odes, based on analysis of protein profiles of nematodes generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). Two methods have been used: grinding and direct analysis of intact nematodes. Both methods were standardised using the <b>nematode</b> Anguina tritici (<b>wheat</b> seed-gall <b>nematode)</b> as a model. Development of the approach involved optimisation of experimental parameters to generate reproducible diagnostic protein profiles for plant parasitic nematodes. With α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as the matrix, the most effective solvent extraction was with 90 % acetone. With sinapinic acid (SA) as matrix, 90 % ethanol was most effective. When intact nematodes were analysed directly by mixing with the matrix solution, 40 min extraction with CHCA matrix solution generated the best protein profiles. The standardised methods were applied to analyse the seed-gall nematodes A. tritici and A. funesta and to the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica, which infects many horticultural crops. Typical protein profiles and diagnostic peaks were identified for these nematode species and for mixtures of Anguina species. The results provide 'proof-of-concept' that these nematode species can be identified by protein profiling using MALDI-TOFMS. This new approach could be extended to identify other plant and non-plant parasitic nematodes...|$|R
40|$|Root-lesion {{nematode}} (Pratylenchus thornei) significantly reduces wheat yields in {{the northern}} Australian grain region. Canola {{is thought to have}} a 'biofumigation' potential to control nematodes; therefore, a field experiment was designed to compare canola with other winter crops or clean-fallow for reducing P. thornei population densities and improving growth of P. thornei-intolerant wheat (cv. Batavia) in the following year. Immediately after harvest of the first-year crops, populations of P. thornei were lowest following various canola cultivars or clean-fallow (1957 – 5200 P. thornei/kg dry soil) and were highest following susceptible wheat cultivars (31 033 – 41 294 /kg dry soil). Unexpectedly, at planting of the second year <b>wheat</b> crop, <b>nematode</b> populations were at more uniform lower levels (< 5000 /kg dry soil), irrespective of the previous season's treatment, and remained that way during the growing season, which was quite dry. Growth and grain yield of the second-year wheat crop were poorest on plots previously planted with canola or left fallow due to poor colonisation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, with the exception of canola cv. Karoo, which had high AM fungal colonisation and low wheat yields. There were significant regressions between growth and yield parameters of the second-year wheat and levels of AMF following the pre-crop treatments. Thus, canola appears to be a good crop for reducing P. thornei populations, but AM fungal-dependence of subsequent crops should be considered, particularly {{in the northern}} Australian grain region. ...|$|R

Untreated seeds served as control. The trial was arranged in a randomized block design with six replicates. Two months after germination, the population density of H. avenae in three treatments was 10 - 20 % of that of the control and that of P. mediterraneus was 20 - 35 %.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} identify nematodes at the species level requires specific skills in nematode taxonomy. The most common approach used is microscopy, which {{takes time and}} requires specific training: molecular approaches to plant nematode identification can also be used. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is {{being used as a}} new approach to identify microorganisms. Identification is based on the characteristic protein profile of the organism generated by MALDI-TOF MS. In MALDI-TOF MS, pulses from a UV laser are absorbed by a crystalline matrix to which macromolecules have been adsorbed, and this results in relatively gentle desorption and ionization of the macromolecules, which are then accelerated using a high voltage and travel along the flight tube. The time taken to reach the detector {{is directly related to the}} mass/charge ratio of the molecule. MALDI-TOF is a promising approach for rapid identification of organisms because of the simple sample preparation and the rapidity of the technique. The aim of this work was to develop a rapid, simple method to identify plant parasitic nematodes, based on analysis of protein profiles of nematodes generated by MALDI-TOF MS. Two methods have been used: grinding and direct analysis of intact nematodes. Both methods were standardized using the <b>wheat</b> seed-gall <b>nematode</b> Anguina tritici as a model.

The results provide proof-of-concept that these nematode species can be identified by protein profiling using MALDI-TOF MS.

40|$|Path {{analysis}} was used to assess the efficacy of the fiddleneck flower gall nematode as a weed biocontrol agent of coast fiddleneck in competition with wheat during 2 yr of field experiments. The path analysis revealed that the number of inflorescences/plant for fiddleneck and the number of heads/plant for wheat were the most important yield components that determine fecundity and seed yield. The density of fiddleneck had a much greater impact on the yield components of fiddleneck than did the density of <b>wheat</b> or the <b>nematode</b> rate of inoculation. The nematode had its greatest negative impact on the number of seeds/flower of fiddleneck and its greatest positive impact on the number of heads/plant of wheat. Path analysis predicts that a biocontrol agent that has a large negative direct effect on the number of inflorescences/plant for fiddleneck would be more efficacious in decreasing fecundity and seed yield than an agent that only impacts the number of flowers/ inflorescence, seeds/flower, or biomass/seed.

40|$|Published online: 09 Nov 2017 Rice is {{the third}} most {{important}} crop in Kenya after maize and <b>wheat.</b> Plant parasitic <b>nematodes</b> (PPN) are a major rice production constraint. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution and abundance of rice PPN in Kenya and their association with environmental variables. Soil and plant samples were collected from rainfed upland and irrigated lowland rice fields in Kirogo, Thiba, Nyangati, Ombeyi, Kombura, Kakola and Mwambe Sub-locations. Twenty-two PPN genera were identified across all Sub-locations with the highest (20) number of nematode genera recorded in rainfed upland rice fields. The nematode genera Scutellonema, Hoplolaimus, Ditylenchus, Hemicycliophora, Heterodera, Paralongidorus and Tylenchus were not recorded in the irrigated lowland rice fields while Criconemella and Tylenchorhynchus were not observed in rainfed upland fields. Canonical correspondence analysis of the relationship between soil properties and nematode abundance revealed a significant (P < 0. 05) relationship between PPN abundance and potassium, sodium, sand and clay. The relationship between rainfall, minimum temperature and nematode genera was significant (P < 0. 05) while maximum temperature was not significant (P = 0. 928). Our results provide critical information for designing nematode management strategies in Kenyan rice fields. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Pratylenchus thornei and P. neglectus are {{two species}} of root-lesion {{nematode}} that cause substantial yield losses in wheat. No commercially available wheat variety has resistance to both species. A doubled-haploid population developed from a cross between the synthetic hexaploid wheat line CPI 133872 and the bread wheat Janz was used to locate and tag quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with resistance to both P. thornei and P. neglectus. Wheat plants were inoculated with both species of nematode in independent replicated glasshouse trials repeated over 2 years. Known locations of wheat microsatellite markers were used to construct a framework map. After an initial single-marker analysis to detect marker-trait linkages, chromosome regions associated with putative QTLs were targetted with microsatellite markers to increase map density in the chromosome regions of interest. In total, 148 wheat microsatellite markers and 21 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers were mapped. The codominant microsatellite marker Xbarc 183 on the distal end of chromosome 6 DS was allelic for resistance to both P. thornei and P. neglectus. The QTL were designated QRlnt. lrc- 6 D. 1 and QRlnn. lrc- 6 D. 1, for the 2 traits, respectively. The allele inherited from CPI 133872 explained 22. 0 - 24. 2 % of the phenotypic variation for P. thornei resistance, and the allele inherited from Janz accounted for 11. 3 - 14. 0 % of the phenotypic variation for P. neglectus resistance. Composite interval mapping identified markers that flank a second major QTL on chromosome 6 DL (QRlnt. lrc- 6 D. 2) that explained 8. 3 - 13. 4 % of the phenotypic variation for P. thornei resistance. An additional major QTL associated with P. neglectus resistance was detected on chromosome 4 DS (QRlnn. lrc- 4 D. 1) and explained a further 10. 3 - 15. 4 % of the phenotypic variation. The identification and tagging of nematode resistance genes with molecular markers will allow appropriate allele combinations to be selected, which will aid the successful breeding of <b>wheat</b> with dual <b>nematode</b> resistance...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this thesis showed that Rhizoctonia solani Anastomosis Group 8 was widespread in all Victorian cropping soils. In barley, the incidence of Rhizoctonia root rot at anthesis, was 54 %, 70 %, 93 % and 97 % on grey clay, red clay, red duplex and Mallee soils respectively. In wheat, the incidence at anthesis was 70 %, 69 %, 74 % and 68 % on the grey clay, red clay, red duplex and Mallee soils respectively. Over the years 1990 - 1992, the disease caused an average grain yield loss of 12 % in barley and 5. 5 % in wheat, with the highest losses occurring on the Mallee and red duplex soil types. It was shown that farmers were not achieving adequate control of Rhizoctonia root rot, and that cultivation per se was not effective in reducing its incidence or severity. In barley, the average incidence of Rhizoctonia root rot at anthesis was over 90 % in crops grown on Mallee or red duplex soil types, regardless of tillage practice. Other researchers have reported tillage to reduce the incidence and severity of Rhizoctonia root rot. In wheat, incidence at anthesis was over 60 % in crops grown on all soil types, regardless of tillage practice. The distribution of R. solani (AG 8) was related to both biological and physical factors of the different soil types. The disease was more severe in soils where organic matter levels were low, and there was little natural suppression of the fungus by other organisms. It is postulated that {{increasing the amount of}} organic matter in the soil would lead to a higher microbial mass in the soil and the resulting competition would reduce the survival of R. solani (AG 8). The root and hypocotyl rot strain of R. solani AG 2 - 1 (ZG 6) that occurs on pulses, was found on wheat and barley roots, and the cruciferous strain AG 2 - 1 (ZG 5) was found on both wheat and lupin roots and hypocotyls. These strains of R. solani could therefore increase under intensive rotations in the Wimmera and North-Central areas. Results from the field experiments demonstrated that the use of "cultivate deep - sow shallow" methods of crop establishment in conservation farming systems are as effective in controlling Rhizoctonia root rot, as traditional cropping systems. However, control could be improved with a strategic cultivation in years with an early autumn break to maximise destruction of the fungus networks of the fungus in the soil. Deep banding fertiliser, 5 - 10 cm under the seed, with the depth-modified combine at sowing reduced the severity of Rhizoctonia root rot and increased grain yield in 5 out of 9 field experiments. This indicates that deep banding fertiliser is viable option for farmers, and further studies in this area with a range of fertilisers would confirm these results. As a consequence of the studies represented in this thesis it was concluded that further research into the management of R. solani (AG 8) should concentrate on developing host plant resistance with transgenes. Other diseases: Cereal cyst nematode (Heterodera avenae) was detected in all soil types, and caused annual yield losses of 6. 0 % in barley and 6. 6 % in <b>wheat.</b> The <b>nematode</b> was most common on Wimmera grey clays, and was recorded {{for the first time on}} the red duplex soils of the North-Central district. Further studies are required to determine if changes in cultural practice through the use of gypsum, stubble retention and direct drilling to improve soil structure will increase the incidence of cereal cyst nematode. The re-introduction of susceptible cultivars into the Wimmera could lead to major outbreaks of cereal cyst nematode. Take-all (Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici) was detected in crops growing on all soil types. Yield losses were 4. 9 % in barley and 5. 1 % in wheat, and the pathogen was most prelevent in Mallee and red duplex soils. It is recommended that further studies should be undertaken to determine whether the adoption of conservation farming practices to improve soil structure will reduce the incidence and severity of take-all.
