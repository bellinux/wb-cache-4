40|$|In this diploma work a {{model of}} an {{integrated}} pulp and paper mill has been evaluated and analysed. The pulp mill is a reference model mill, defined in the research program “The Ecocyclic Pulp Mill”, and it consists of the best technology built and run in the Nordic pulp and paper industry. The paper mill however, is modelled in this study. The heat demand of the mill has been analysed using Pinch Technology. The paper mill in the reference model mill is a conventional paper mill, and consists of wire and press section with a <b>white</b> <b>water</b> <b>system,</b> and a cylinder dryer followed by a soft calender. Since the dryer is the most energy demanding section of the paper mill, mainly different {{ways to improve the}} drying section have been studied. Three different ways to change the dryer section have been studied, higher dry solids content before the cylinder dryer and a combination of the cylinder dryer with either an impulse dryer or a superheated steam dryer. Apart from the mill’s energy demand, changes in fuel costs and emissions of carbon dioxide with the different dryer models have been studied. When part of the cylinder dryer is replaced with an impulse dryer or a superheated steam dryer the live steam demand decreases, while the electricity or natural gas demand increases. A reduction in steam consumption, i. e. reduction in steam production, also leads to a decrease of the electricity production in the mill. To compensate this the mill has to buy externally produced electricity. The bark, which has been made available through the reduced production of steam, can be used to decrease the deficit of bark in the mill. In the base case the reference model mill has a heat demand of 9, 46 GJ/t paper, while the cylinder dryer has a heat demand of 3, 77 GJ/t paper. If the dry solids content increases with five percentage units, the heat demand in the cylinder dryer decreases with 15 %. When part of the cylinder dryer is replaced with an impulse dryer drying the paper to a dryness of 65 % the steam demand decreases in the cylinder dryer section with 42 %. At the same time the electricity or natural gas demand increases with 290 or 326 kWh/t paper respectively. When using a combination of a superheated steam dryer and cylinder dryer, where 50 % of the drying is carried out in each of the dryer, the live steam demand decreases with roughly 50 %, while the natural gas demand increases with 622 kWh/t paper. The reduced steam demand and the raised electricity and natural gas demand leads to decreased emissions of carbon dioxide in the mill, if it can be assumed that the bark that is made available is used to replace oil elsewhere. The emissions decreases with 111 and 148 kg/t paper for the combination of a cylinder dryer and an impulse dryer heated with electricity or natural gas respectively, and with 197 kg/t paper when using the combination of a superheated steam dryer and a cylinder dryer. The fuel cost increases when using a combination of a cylinder dryer and an impulse dryer or a superheated steam dryer, compared to only using a cylinder dryer. The cost increases with 48 SEK/t paper for the impulse dryer when heated by electricity, and 26 SEK/t paper when heated by natural gas. For the superheated steam dryer the fuel cost increases with 51 SEK/t paper. The cylinder dryer is therefore a better alternative regarding fuel cost...|$|E
40|$|During stock {{preparation}} from waste paper recycling some polymeric substances will {{be separated from}} raw materials. Treatment temperature, shear and pH of the process enhance the tackiness of the polymeric materials and form the “stickies” problems. Furthermore, more closure of the <b>white</b> <b>water</b> <b>system</b> lead to heavier stickies problems. As different materials, additives and operation sequence in the paper mills are adopted, the stickies problems are also varied in sloving difficulty. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the compositions of stickies in three paper mills of Taiwan, and to determine the possible sources of stickies. In addition to control stickies problems by adding cationic polymeric electrolyte to pulp slurry and fixing the stickies particle onto fibers. Stickies were analyzed by FTIR and Py-GC/MS and comparison were made among the possible sources and stickies. Stickies control was made on addition of cationic polymeric fixing agents to pulp slurry. Amounts of stickies from resulting white water filtrate were determined by extracting with dichloromethane. And two filtrates from treated white water were compared on cationic demand and particle size. The sources of stickies from A mill were shown to be a mixture of polyacrylates, hotmelt and plastics etc., and the sources of stickies from B and C mills were shown to be a mixture of SBR, EVA, polyacrylates, hotmelt and plastics etc. The results of the control of stickies formation were improved by adding cationic polymeric fixing agents. The DCM extracts of white water reduced 30 - 50 ％ on addition of 1400 ppm HM Polymin and PL 1310. The cationic demand reduced 40 - 45 ％ on addition of 1400 ppm PC 1279, HM Polymin and ATC 4150. The particle size reduced 25 - 45 ％ on addition of 600 ppm fixing agents. 由於廢紙再生備漿時，加工或應用時各種高分子物質如膠合劑及黏著劑等的脫離，以及在備漿製程中溫度、剪力及 pH 值等作用因子導致這些高分子物質在系統中黏性的增加或粒子變大，而黏著造紙設備或殘留於產品中，產生黏著物(Stickies) 的問題。又由於環保及降低成本等因素的考量，製程中的白水不斷重複回收利用，因而使黏著物的問題更趨嚴重。更由於不同的原料、不同製程添加物以及製程讓多數紙廠產生不同類型的黏著物障礙，而增加其解決的困難度。本文研究的目的為了解以廢紙作為原料的三家台灣紙廠中其黏著物的組成成分，並推估其可能來源，並希望藉由在漿料中添加凝集劑(Fixing agent) 以降低黏著物的問題。 試驗部分主要分成兩大部分：(1) 黏著物的定性分析及(2) 以高分子凝集劑進行控制。分析部分以傅利葉紅外光光譜測定儀(Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy；FTIR) 及熱裂解氣相質譜層析儀(Pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry；Py-GC/MS) 鑑別並判定黏著物的成分及可能來源。黏著物的控制試驗則是添加陽離子性凝集劑於 C 廠頭箱的漿料中，比較處理前後其二氯甲烷萃取物含量的變化，並利用不同孔徑過濾，比較不同粒徑的黏著物在處理前後其陽離子需求量及粒子大小的變化。 FTIR 及 Py-GC/MS 分析結果發現 A 廠的烘缸上黏著物主要來源經判定為丙烯酸酯類感壓膠及熱熔膠或塑膠等。 B 廠及 C 廠的烘缸上黏著物主要來源則可能為 SBR、EVA、丙烯酸酯類感壓膠及熱熔膠或塑膠等。凝集劑控制試驗部分結果為以凝集劑處理後白水中的黏著物，各項性質皆可獲得改善的效果。如以 HM Polymin 及 PL 1310 最高添加劑量 1400 ppm 的凝集劑處理後可減少黏著物萃取物 30 ~ 50 ％。以最高添加劑量的 PC 1279 、HM Polymin 及 ATC 4150 處理後可降低陽離子需求量 40 ~ 45 ％。而以最低添加劑量 600 ppm 的凝集劑處理後可使黏著物粒子變小 25 ~ 45 ％。摘要………………………………………………………………………………………i Abstract…………………………………………………………………………………. ii 目次……………………………………………………………………………………. iii 表目次…………………………………………………………………………………viii 圖目次. ………………………………………………………………………………… xi 壹、前言………………………………………………………………………………… 1 貳、前人研究…………………………………………………………………………… 2 一、廢紙再生的現況……………………………………………………………… [...] 2 二、黏著物的形成及影響形成的因子…………………………………………… [...] 3 三、黏著物的鑑定方法…………………………………………………………… 5 （一）黏著物的定性…………………………………………………………… 5 （二）黏著物的定量…………………………………………………………… 7 （三）其他常見的相關測試方法……………………………………………… 10 四、黏著物的成分及特性…………………………………………………………. 10 （一）製程中之汙染物………………………………………………………… 10 （二）最有害之黏著物………………………………………………………… 12 （三）黏著物的特性及危害…………………………………………………… 13 五、黏著物控制對策…………………………………………………………… 15 參、試驗材料與試驗方法…………………………………………………………… 21 一、黏著物的可能來源物質之定性分析……………………………………… 21 （一）試驗材料……………………………………………………………… 21 1. 膠合劑標準品……………………………………………………… 21 2. 其他可能進入廢紙回收系統之常見可能造成黏著物的來源… 21 （二）試驗方法…………………………………………………………… [...] 22 1. 傅利葉紅外光光譜測定(Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy；FTIR) …………………………………………………………… 22 2. 衰減式全反射傅里葉轉換紅外線光譜(Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared；ATR-FTIR) ………………………… 22 3. 熱裂解氣相質譜層析儀(Pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry；Py-GC/MS) ……………………………………… 22 二、紙廠中黏著物的定性分析………………………………………………… [...] 23 （一）試驗材料………………………………………………………………. 23 1. 造紙廠中的黏著物………………………………………………… 23 （二）試驗方法……………………………………………………………… 23 1. 萃取………………………………………………………………… 23 2. 灰分………………………………………………………………… 23 3. 傅利葉紅外光光譜測定(Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy；FTIR) ……………………………………………………………… 23 4. 衰減式全反射傅里葉轉換紅外線光譜(Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared；ATR-FTIR) …………………………. 24 5. 熱裂解氣相質譜層析儀(Pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry；Py-GC/MS) ……………………………………… 24 三、紙廠頭箱漿料中的黏著物定量及控制試驗……………………………… 24 （一）試驗材料………………………………………………………………. 25 1. 工廠試驗用漿料…………………………………………………… 25 2. 定量試驗用所添加之凝集劑……………………………………… 25 （二）試驗方法……………………………………………………………… 26 1. 漿料濾液中黏著物的定量………………………………………… 26 2. 陽離子需求量……………………………………………………… 27 3. 粒徑分析………………………………………………………… [...] . 27 肆、結果與討論……………………………………………………………………… 28 一、黏著物的可能來源物質之定性分析………………………………………… 28 （一）膠合劑標準品………………………………………………………… 28 1. 苯乙烯丁二烯乳膠(Styrene butadiene rubber；SBR) …………… 28 (1) SBR的FTIR光譜圖……………………………………………… 28 (2) SBR的Py-GC/MS圖譜………………………………………… 29 2. 聚乙烯醇(Polyvinyl alcohol，PVA) ……………………………… 31 (1) PVA 的 ATR-FTIR 光譜圖…………………………………… 31 (2) PVA 的 Py-GC/MS 圖譜……………………………………… 31 3. 乙烯醋酸乙烯酯(Ethylene vinyl acetate，EVA) …………………… 33 (1) EVA 的 FTIR 光譜圖………………………………………… 33 (2) EVA 的 Py-GC/MS 圖譜………………………………………. 34 4. 聚異丁烯(Polyisobutene) ………………………………………… 36 (1) 聚異丁烯的 FTIR 光譜圖………………………………………. 36 (2) 聚異丁烯的 Py-GC/MS 圖譜………………………………… 36 5. 熱熔膠……………………………………………………………… 39 (1) 熱熔膠的 ATR-FTIR 光譜圖…………………………………… 39 (2) 熱熔膠的 Py-GC/MS 圖譜……………………………………. 39 6. 聚醋酸乙烯酯(Polyvinyl acetate，PVAc) ………………………. 42 (1) PVAc 的 FTIR 光譜圖………………………………………… 42 (2) PVAc的Py-GC/MS圖譜………………………………………… 42 7. 環氧丙烯酸酯(Epoxyacrylate) …………………………………… 44 (1) 環氧丙烯酸酯的 FTIR 光譜圖………………………………… 44 (2) 環氧丙烯酸酯的Py-GC/MS 圖譜……………………………… 44 （二) 其他可能進入廢紙回收系統之常見可能造成黏著物的來源……… 46 1.

40|$|Abstract. —Fisheries co-management lies at {{the center}} of environmental, social, and {{economic}} issues in the lower Pastaza River basin in the Peruvian Amazon. In this remote region, the intermingling of black and <b>white</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> creates unique aquatic habi-tats that harbor diverse assemblages of fishes, including Prochilodus nigricans, a migratory species of high ecological and socioeconomic importance throughout the Amazon. In the lower Pastaza basin, freshwater fishes provide a major source of food and income for in-digenous communities such as the Kandozi. However, the basin’s aquatic resources and the livelihoods of indigenous people are being compromised by environmentally unsound practices such as overfishing by unregulated commercial fishers and pollution from petro-leum exploration and exploitation in the region. In response, there has been a concerted effort by indigenous communities, conservation organizations, and the Peruvian govern-ment to develop systems of fisheries co-management in recent years. Near Lake Rimachi, the largest lake in the Peruvian Amazon, an association of Kandozi fishermen was re-cently formed to oversee the management of the lake’s aquatic resources. The association is working towards implementation of a newly created fisheries management plan, whic...|$|R
5000|$|C. arcana was {{collected}} in a karstic region of the upper Tocantins River basin in both epigean (above-ground) and subterranean waters. C. baudoensis {{has been found in}} a highly turbid, white-water river over clay bottoms with logs in the main channel and clay and leaves in the lower portions of the quebradas that were tributary to the main river channel. Specimens were collected at depths of 2 m or less and at an elevation of less than 50 m. C. motatanensis is found in swiftly flowing water among rubble to coarse gravel. C. oliveirai originates in <b>white</b> <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> at depths of 2 - 40 m and feeds on terrestrial arthropods. C. orinoco reportedly inhabits the middle portions of the water column of high-velocity streams during the night and hides among submerged branches and other obstructions in the river channel during the day. C. plumbea is reported to feed on a variety of terrestrial and aquatic insects. It inhabits streams with moderate current and a depth of up to 1 m, occurring within such streams in areas over sand substrates but lacking vegetation. C. sandrae was found in riffles in a relatively fast-flowing forest stream, approximately 3 - 4 m wide and 0.4 - 0.8 m deep with a small waterfall. C. candiru, commonly known as the Candiru-açu, is perhaps the most formidable species, being a hunter and scavenger of dead and dying fish, which it devours from the inside-out using its circular maw of razor-sharp teeth. Featured heavily in River Monsters and BBC's [...] "Amazon Abyss", it has been implicated and proven to attack and devour humans, with corpses containing hundreds of fish being recorded in morgues. It is worth noting however that humans only become prey of C. candiru when dead or incapacitated, such as when drowned or drunk.|$|R
40|$|Regions in the Amazon Basin {{have been}} {{associated}} with specific biogeochemical processes, but a detailed chemical classification of the abundant and ubiquitous dissolved organic matter (DOM), beyond specific indicator compounds and bulk measurements, has not yet been established. We sampled water from different locations in the Negro, Madeira/Jamari and Tapajós River areas to characterize the molecular DOM composition and distribution. Ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) combined with excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed a large proportion of ubiquitous DOM but also unique area-specific molecular signatures. Unique to the DOM of the Rio Negro area was the large abundance of high molecular weight, diverse hydrogen-deficient and highly oxidized molecular ions deviating from known lignin or tannin compositions, indicating substantial oxidative processing of these ultimately plant-derived polyphenols indicative of these black waters. In contrast, unique signatures in the Madeira/Jamari area were defined by presumably labile sulfur- and nitrogen-containing molecules in this <b>white</b> <b>water</b> river <b>system.</b> <b>Waters</b> from the Tapajós main stem did not show any substantial unique molecular signatures relative to those present in the Rio Madeira and Rio Negro, which implied a lower organic molecular complexity in this clear water tributary, even after mixing with the main stem of the Amazon River. Beside ubiquitous DOM at average H ∕ C and O ∕ C elemental ratios, a distinct and significant unique DOM pool prevailed in the black, <b>white</b> and clear <b>water</b> areas that were also highly correlated with EEM-PARAFAC components and define the frameworks for primary production and other aspects of aquatic life...|$|R
