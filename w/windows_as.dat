Episode One follows scientist Gordon Freeman and his companion Alyx Vance as they continue to cope with the events chronicled in Half-Life 2 and humanity's continuing struggle against the Combine.

DirectX support is undertaken through ReactX, an in-house implementation. 2D hardware-accelerated rendering is done natively, while other drawing functionality is redirected to OpenGL as a stopgap solution.|$|E

5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the <b>windows.</b> <b>As</b> firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|An {{approximately}} 1,000-person team developed Grand Theft Auto V, an action-adventure video game, {{over several}} years. Rockstar Games released Grand Theft Auto V on 17 September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, on 18 November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft <b>Windows,</b> <b>as</b> the fifteenth {{entry in the}} Grand Theft Auto series. Development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IVs release and was led by Rockstar North's core 360-person team, who collaborated with several other international Rockstar Games studios. The team considered the game a spiritual successor to many of their previous projects like Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3. After its unexpected announcement in 2011, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, viral marketing strategies and special editions. Its release date, though subject to several delays, was widely anticipated.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} announced {{that there would}} be a simultaneous release on the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft <b>Windows</b> <b>as</b> well as concurrent Japanese and American release, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an Xbox release, but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive. Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference, there was a great deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story, which it ended up having, and the title of Final Fantasy Online was suggested. Following an August 2001 beta test in Japan, a public Japanese beta test was done in December 2001.|$|E
5|$|Kud Wafter was {{released}} in Japan on June 25, 2010 as a limited edition version for <b>Windows</b> <b>as</b> a DVD. As a bonus, it came bundled with the visual novel's original soundtrack and a game demo of Key's ninth game Rewrite. Takahiro Baba, the president of VisualArt's, the publisher of Kud Wafter, announced via his Twitter account in April 2010 that 100,000 copies of Kud Wafter would be produced in its initial release. To advertise Kud Wafter, Good Smile Racing took Shinji Orito's 2003 Honda Fit and made it into an itasha (a car featuring illustrations of anime-styled characters) with images of Kudryavka. The car was driven around and showcased throughout Japan between April 19 and June 26, 2010. The car was put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website on June 25, 2010 and sold for 1,699,000 yen after starting the auction at 1 yen.|$|E

5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay aisles on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and a porch on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. The aisles and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various mouldings and designs typical of that period, including chamfered arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are some larger square-headed Perpendicular Gothic <b>windows</b> <b>as</b> well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken <b>windows</b> <b>as</b> the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Lutheran Church (also {{known as}} the Cross Church at Danebod) was {{dedicated}} Sunday, June 16, 1895. It is a cruciform clapboard building with a square placed obliquely in the center. The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to {{the arms of the}} cross. The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake. It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers, who had little to give. Points of interest include the altar chairs, kerosene lamps, architectural structure, wainscoting walls and ceiling, porthole <b>windows</b> <b>as</b> in a ship, hand-carving on the altar, pulpit and railing, the candelabra and altar cloth, hand-carved stone baptismal font, the Star of Bethlehem in the ceiling, Bertel Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ, the Celtic cross, and pictures in the narthex. The church is located at 101 Danebod Court. The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (DELCA). This organization later merged into the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) in 1962 and then into the largest Lutheran church in the U.S. in 1988: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Danebod Lutheran Church remains a part of the ELCA still today.|$|E
