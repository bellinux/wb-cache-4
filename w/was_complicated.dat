The distinction {{between these two}} roles <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> in the medieval era, since professionals were generally lower class, and amateurs had {{as much time as}} professionals to devote to their craft. Joglaresse were lower class, professional composers far less respected than the trobairitz.|$|E
5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> {{by the fact that}} Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him into contact with the more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the First English Civil War Rupert was {{employed}} by the young King Louis XIV of France to fight the Spanish during the final years of the Thirty Years' War. Rupert's military employment <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by his promises to the Holy Roman Emperor that had led to his release from captivity in 1642, and his ongoing commitment to the English Royalist faction in exile. He also became a Knight of the Garter in 1642. Throughout the period Rupert was inconvenienced by his lack of secure income, and his ongoing feuds with other leading members of the Royalist circle.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> because of her slave status. Since the mother's status {{dictated}} that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E

Following the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided food, blankets, and water purification kits to over 100,000 Hunan residents in mass evacuation shelters. The relief effort <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by an earthquake in Yunnan, as well as three more tropical cyclones: Typhoon Kaemi, Typhoon Prapiroon, and Typhoon Saomai. All of the storms were stronger than Bilis, and exacerbated flooding and other problems in the region.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by the {{discovery}} of a potential toxic waste site {{in the path of the}} subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> {{by the need to}} keep the line open: trains {{ferrying}} materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming that many of those first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E

5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and colour printer in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination.

Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.|$|E

Its release followed an alliance between Internet provider Excite@Home and antivirus vendor McAfee.com to provide Internet subscribers with McAfee's new firewall software, McAfee Personal Firewall. Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages.

5|$|Scott's plans {{gradually}} came to fruition– {{a large-scale}} scientific and geographical expedition with {{the conquest of}} the South Pole as its principal objective. Scott was anxious to avoid the amateurism that had {{been associated with the}} Discovery Expedition's scientific work. He appointed Edward Wilson as his chief scientist, and Wilson selected an experienced team. The expedition set off in June 1910 in Terra Nova, one of Discovery's relief ships. Its programme <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by the simultaneous arrival in the Antarctic of Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Amundsen's party reached the South Pole on 14 December 1911 and returned safely. Scott and four companions, including Wilson, arrived at the Pole on 17 January 1912; all five perished on the return journey.|$|E
5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India. The matter <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking {{to be admitted to}} Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed {{to the creation of a}} Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy {{planned to}} develop and {{introduce}} the supersonic P.1154 independently of the cancelled NATO requirement. This ambition <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by the conflicting requirements between the two services—while the RAF wanted a low-level supersonic strike aircraft, the Navy sought a twin-engine air defence fighter. Following {{the election of the}} Labour Government of 1964 the P.1154 was cancelled, as the Royal Navy had already begun procurement of the McDonnell Douglas Phantom II and the RAF placed a greater importance on the BAC TSR-2's ongoing development. Work continued on elements of the project, such as a supersonic PCB-equipped Pegasus engine, with the intention of developing a future Harrier variant for the decades following cancellation.|$|E
