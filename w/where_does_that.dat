500|$|When asked {{from where}} she draws {{consolation}} {{in the face of}} aging and death, Streep responded: [...] "Consolation? I'm not sure I have it. I have a belief, I guess, {{in the power of the}} aggregate human attempt – the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism – you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better. <b>Where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> come from?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, {{he was in}} camp to-day, {{with his}} daughters," [...] cried Dick. [...] "Wish I had known of this before. I might have hired {{him to make a}} hunt for the fellow we are after. <b>Where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> judge live?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{he means}} {{mischief}} of some sort," [...] replied Rinkitink, [...] "and we'll laugh after {{the danger is}} over, Bilbil. There's an old adage that says: 'He laughs best who laughs last,' {{and the only way}} to laugh last is to give the other fellow a chance. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> knife come from, I wonder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{wonderful}} plot for {{the sensational}} novelist. To the ordinary {{human being who}} knew Baring, there remains a substratum almost of uneasiness. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> voice come from that spoke along the wires, and what was its message?

6000|$|... "And the Death of Tu-Kila-Kila?" [...] {{the woman}} whispered, very low, still {{soothing}} his arm {{with her hand}} and patting his cheek softly {{from time to time}} with a gentle, caressing motion. [...] "Tell me <b>where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> live? Who holds it in charge? Where is Tu-Kila-Kila's great spirit laid by in safety?

Then I {{would make a}} fact so disgraceful known, and boldly challenge society to set it right. It appears to me, my dear Mr. Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, forcibly, 'that what Mr. Micawber has to do, is to throw down the gauntlet to society, and say, in effect, [...] "Show me who will take that up. Let the party immediately step forward."' ...|$|E
60|$|Consider this! I {{now had a}} {{daughter}} to whom I could read my manuscript! <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> personality come from? Was her soul merely the automatic reaction of a material organism against a material environment? Was her spirit dependent {{on the life of}} its little body or could it live on independent of the flesh? Acknowledging the benumbing, hopeless mystery of it all, I continued to live for my children, finding in them my comfort and my justification.|$|R

5000|$|Elegancegoes {{directly}} {{to the question of}} how the laws of nature are constructed. Nobody knows the answer to that. Nobody! It's a perfectly legitimate hypothesis, in my view, to say that some extremely elegant creator made those laws. But I think if you go down that road, you must have the courage to ask the next question, which is: <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> creator come from? And <b>where</b> <b>did</b> his, her, or its elegance come from? And if you say it was always there, then why not say that the laws of nature were always there and save a step? Carl Sagan ...|$|R

I do feel like a snob when I say that. But what is it? <b>Where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> spark come from? Is it in our modern air, that discontent, that desire, that thrusting forth toward a new light--something as yet unformulated, but which we all feel, even at small institutions of learning like Silliston?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bluff, {{with nothing}} behind it. You don't take me that way," [...] he said. [...] "Now I'll put my cards right {{down in front}} of you. Alton is not a fool, and you couldn't tell him {{anything}} he doesn't know already. The trouble is, he can prove nothing. He has a tolerably short temper, and one day he 'most hammered the life out of another man in the Somasco mill. That man didn't like him before, and it's quite possible he fell foul of Alton after it, but <b>where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> take in me? Got hold of that, haven't you? Well, then, there's just this difference between you and me. I could tell Alton one or two things about you he didn't know!" ...|$|E

Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?" [...] He held the small table {{sideways}} to the electric light. [...] "I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface. No, I see nothing. I don't think there is anything more to be learned here. Now for the central table. This small pellet is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of. Roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this is very interesting. And the cut--a positive tear, I see. It began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case, Mr. Soames. <b>Where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> door lead to?" ...|$|E

50|$|The German {{productions}} {{used the}} same costumes with some new additions - the most notable change being that Milady's costume for <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> summer go? was changed from a black leather coat and dishevelled hair to a long black velvet gown and her hair down and curly. The sets for the German productions were realistic and true to {{the period of the}} piece and gave an interesting contrast with the modern costume styles. Following in the tradition of Elisabeth, new songs were added for each new production.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at {{the crowd}} in this street, Courtier, which of all crowds {{in the whole world}} can best afford to be left to itself; secure from pestilence, earthquake, cyclone, drought, from {{extremes}} of heat and cold, {{in the heart of the}} greatest and safest city in the world; and yet-see the figure of that policeman! Running through all the good behaviour of this crowd, however safe and free it looks, there is, there always must be, a central force holding it together. <b>Where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> central force come from? From the crowd itself, you say. I answer: No. Look back at the origin of human States. From the beginnings of things, the best man has been the unconscious medium of authority, of the controlling principle, of the divine force; he felt that power within him--physical, at first--he used it to take the lead, he has held the lead ever since, he must always hold it. All your processes of election, your so-called democratic apparatus, are only a blind to the inquiring, a sop to the hungry, a salve to the pride of the rebellious. They are merely surface machinery; they cannot prevent the best man from coming to the top; for the best man stands nearest to the Deity, and is the first to receive the waves that come from Him. I'm not speaking of heredity. The best man is not necessarily born in my class, and I, at all events, do not believe he is any more frequent there than in other classes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{just talk}} as I see life," [...] replied Dale, reflectively, as he poked a stick {{into the red}} embers of the fire. [...] "Maybe I have a {{religion}}. I don't know. But it's not the kind you have--not the Bible kind. That kind doesn't keep the men in Pine an' Snowdrop an' all over--sheepmen an' ranchers an' farmers an' travelers, such as I've known--the religion they profess doesn't keep them from lyin', cheatin', stealin', an' killin'. I reckon no man who lives as I do--which perhaps is my religion--will lie or cheat or steal or kill, unless it's to kill in self-defense or like I'd do if Snake Anson would ride up here now. My religion, maybe, is love of life--wild life {{as it was in}} the beginnin'--an' the wind that blows secrets from everywhere, an' the water that sings all day an' night, an' the stars that shine constant, an' the trees that speak somehow, an' the rocks that aren't dead. I'm never alone here or on the trails. There's somethin' unseen, but always with me. An' that's It! Call it God if you like. But what stalls me is--where was that Spirit when this earth was a ball of fiery gas? Where will that Spirit be when all life is frozen out or burned out on this globe an' it hangs dead in space like the moon? That time will come. There's no waste in nature. Not the littlest atom is destroyed. It changes, that's all, as you see this pine wood go up in smoke an' feel somethin' that's heat come out of it. <b>Where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> go? It's not lost. Nothin' is lost. So, the beautiful an' savin' thought is, maybe all rock an' wood, water an' blood an' flesh, are resolved back into the elements, to come to life somewhere again sometime." ...|$|E

A Stunnin'ton man would have naturally passed to windward of Blok Island; and a Newport or Providence fellow would not have fetched so far to windward without making a stretch or two on purpose.

5000|$|As {{we looked}} through the comics, there was this {{fascinating}} idea that Batman's presence in Gotham actually attracts criminals to Gotham, it attracts lunacy. When you're dealing with questionable notions like people taking the law into their own hands, {{you have to really}} ask, <b>where</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> lead? That's what makes the character so dark, because he expresses a vengeful desire. —Nolan, on the theme of escalation ...|$|E

Is not every book a mirror in which the reader is reflected, whether he knows it or not? And is not every reader a mirror in which the book is reflected?" ...|$|E

60|$|A knotty {{point for}} Venters {{was the fact}} that the cattle tracks all pointed west. The broad trail came from the {{direction}} of the canyon into which the rustlers had ridden, and undoubtedly the cattle had been driven out of it across the oval. There were no tracks pointing the other way. It had been in his mind that Oldring had driven the red herd toward the rendezvous, and not from it. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> broad trail come down into the pass, and <b>where</b> <b>did</b> it lead? Venters knew he wasted time in pondering the question, but it held a fascination not easily dispelled. For many years Oldring's mysterious entrance and exit to Deception Pass had been all-absorbing topics to sage-riders.|$|R
