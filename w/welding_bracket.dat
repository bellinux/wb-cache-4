The conclusion is made from analysis results that the strength criterion is satisfied with operating requirement of the equipment, and the risk area of the tensile stress is explored, moreover, the dangerous natural frequencies are 41 Hz and 95 Hz which are worked out respectively through modal analysis results. This analysis process is significant for the agitator design. The technique foundation and method are not only set up effectively, but also the utilized data is provided for the product design and successive manufacturing. The lead time of the agitator will be shortened, and the product quality will be improved...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the mechanical properties of three glass ionomers cements (GICs) used for band cementation in Orthodontics. METHODS: Two conventional glass ionomers (Ketac Cem Easy mix/ 3 M-ESPE and Meron/Voco) and one resin modified glass ionomer (Multi-cure Glass ionomer/ 3 M-Unitek) were selected. For the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength tests, 12 specimens {{were made of}} each material. For the microhardness test 15 specimens were made of each material and for the shear bond strength tests 45 bovine permanent incisors were used mounted in a self-cure acrylic resin. Then, band segments with a <b>welded</b> <b>bracket</b> were cemented on the buccal surface of the crowns. For the mechanical tests of compressive and diametral tensile strength and shear bond strength a universal testing machine was used with a crosshead speed of 1, 0 mm/min and for the Vickers microhardness analysis tests a Microdurometer was used with 200 g of load during 15 seconds. The results were submitted to statistical analysis through ANOVA complemented by Tukey's test at a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: The results shown that the Multi-Cure Glass Ionomer presented higher diametral tensile strength (p < 0. 01) and compressive strength greater than conventional GICs (p = 0. 08).

50|$|Since carbide {{saw blades}} are circular, they are {{radially}} the stiffest {{elements of the}} power train {{in the direction of}} the feed, but very unstable perpendicular to the feed direction. Due to the thin blade body the blades must be stabilized to minimize the side vibration amplitudes. When the first experiments with carbide saws were made, a development engineer of Advanced Machine & Engineering in Rockford stabilized the blade by using a broomstick which he pushed against the vibrating blade, minimizing the vibrations. From this experience a blade stabilizer was developed using two plastic coated ball bearings mounted on eccentric shafts and supported by a <b>welded</b> <b>bracket</b> to the gearbox. Horst Doepcke, who saw this method during experiments carried out by Metalcut, also describes them in his dissertation “Sägen von Rohren mit hartmetallbestückten Kreissägeblättern”. Further Amsaw developments lead to segment stabilizers, whereby on both sides of the blade adjustable plastic-coated plates minimized the blade vibrations (AME). Other manufacturers later used similar slide elements as “vibration dampeners”. These erroneously labeled vibration dampeners did not however dampen the oscillations, but merely minimized the amplitudes. Mr. Doepke describes this function in detail in his dissertation.Recently the Advanced Machine & Engineering Company has developed a pair of front stabilizers for its AMSAW machines arranged close to the point at which the blade enters the material. These stabilizers hydraulically extend, when the carbide teeth have moved past the stabilizer tips before cutting and stabilize the blade which also help to guide the blade into the cut to improve the accuracy. Other forms of stabilizers are listed in German in the VDI Verlag Nr. 1999 by Dipl.-Ing. Rainer Liebrecht. This report especially addresses the effect of vibration on saw blades.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{functional}} requirement of a structural detail brackets {{with and without}} scallop are frequently used in bridges, decks, ships and offshore structure. Scallops are designed to serve as passage way for fluids, to reduce weld length and plate distortions. Moreover, scallops are used to avoid intersection {{of two or more}} welds for {{the fact that there is}} the presence of inventible inherent initial crack except for full penetrated weld and the formation of multi-axial stress state at the weld intersection. Welding all around the scallop corner increase the possibility of brittle fracture even for the case the bracket is not loaded by primary load. Avoiding of scallop will establish an initial crack in the corner if <b>bracket</b> is <b>welded</b> by fillet welds. If the two weld run pass had crossed, this would have given a 3 D residual stress situation. Therefore the presences and absence of scallop necessitates the 3 D FEA fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using effective notch stress approach (). FEMAP 10. 1 with NX NASTRAN was used for the 3 D FEA. The first and main objective of this research was to investigate and compare the fatigue resistance of brackets with and without scallop. The secondary goal was the fatigue design of scallops in case they cannot be avoided for some reason. The fatigue resistance for both types of brackets was determined based on approach using 1 mm fictitiously rounded radius based on IIW recommendation. Identical geometrical, boundary and loading conditions were used for the determination and comparison of fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using linear 3 D FEA. Moreover the size effect of bracket length was also studied using 2 D SHELL element FEA. In the case of brackets with scallop the flange plate weld toe at the corner of the scallop was found to exhibit the highest and made the flange plate weld toe critical for fatigue failure. Whereas weld root and weld toe at the weld intersections were the highly stressed location for brackets without scallop. Thus <b>weld</b> toe for <b>brackets</b> with scallop, and weld root and <b>weld</b> toe for <b>brackets</b> without scallop were found to be the critical area for fatigue failure. Employing identical parameters on both types of brackets, brackets without scallop had the highest except for full penetrated weld. Furthermore the fatigue resistance of brackets without scallop was highly affected by the lack of weld penetration length and it was found out that decreased as the weld penetration was increased. Despite the fact that the very presence of scallop reduces the stiffness and also same time induce stress concentration, based on the 3 D FEA it is worth concluding that using scallop provided better fatigue resistance when both types of <b>brackets</b> were fillet <b>welded.</b> However <b>brackets</b> without scallop had the highest fatigue resistance when full penetration weld was used. This thesis also showed that <b>weld</b> toe for <b>brackets</b> with scallop was the only highly stressed area unlike brackets without scallop in which both weld toe and weld root were the critical locations for fatigue failure when different types of boundary conditions were used. Weld throat thickness, plate thickness, scallop radius, lack of weld penetration length, boundary condition and weld quality affected the fatigue resistance of both types of brackets. And as a result, bracket design procedure, especially welding quality and post weld treatment techniques significantly affect the fatigue resistance of both type of brackets...|$|R

50|$|The GSN-19 silent (flash and noiseless) grenade {{launcher}} {{is unusual in}} {{the fact that it is}} both muzzle- and breech-loaded. The standard projectile is a specially designed AP-I (Armour Piercing - Incendiary) grenade with pre-engraved rifling. The warhead is designed to penetrate hulls of tactical ballistic missile launchers, aircraft, C&C equipment, and then cause enough damage to render the target inoperative. The grenade has no propelling system in itself. The launch is performed by special blank cartridges, which are loaded into a detachable box magazine (holding 8 cartridges in the 7.62mm based version or 10 cartridges in the 5.45mm based version). Cartridges are fed into the chamber by a manually operated rifle-type rotary bolt action mechanism. To achieve the noise- and flash-less launch, blank cartridges are discharged into the limited volume breech, which is fitted with a movable telescopic piston at the front. Upon discharge, this piston violently pushes the grenade, loaded into the muzzle part of the launcher, out of the barrel, and then stops and seals the expanding powder gases inside the rear part of the launcher's barrel. After a short while the pressure inside drops to a safe level and the gun can be reloaded by operating the bolt (to extract the spent blank and load a fresh launching cartridge) and then loading the new grenade from the muzzle. Loaded grenade is held in the barrel by special springs. The muzzle velocity of the 30mm grenade for 7.62mm version is quoted as"above 100 m/s", for 5.45mm version it is listed as 175 m/s.

5000|$|The boom is {{connected}} with {{the lower part of}} the mast which is shaped like a [...] "Y" [...] or a bipod and therefore it is a single swinging derrick. On the cross trees, two guys are fastened using swivel outriggers which are stayed vertically and horizontally. In order to maintain a good controlling angle between guys and derrick, the outriggers cannot pass the inboard parallel of the centerline. Looking at the illustration, one can easily see that the right outrigger stays in the centerline and the left outrigger has moved outboard. This derrick will lower or heave cargo as both guys are veered or hauled. Three winches, controlled by joystick, are necessary to operate the Hallen Derrick; two for the guys and one for the purchase. To avoid an over-topping or over-swinging limit-switches are used. However, the limits can be modified if a different working range or a special vertical stowage is required. The safe working load (SWL) of the Hallen is between 10 and 80 tonnes. In a Hallen Universal derrick, which has no Hallen D-Frame, the halyard has an extended length since it runs through further blocks on the centerline. The Universal Hallen derrick, replacing the D-frame option, is a kind of traditional topping lift. The Hallen D-Frame is a steel <b>bracket</b> <b>welded</b> on the mast in the centerline. For an observer standing a beam, the frame has a [...] "D"-shape. The D-Frame supersedes the outriggers and provides a good controlling angle on the guys.

It keeps the deck clear of guy ropes and preventors. Only one winchman is needed and within a few minutes the Hallen is brought into use. It is less expensive than a crane. A disadvantage is the low working range of the Hallen Derrick, it is able to swing 75° from the centerline and can work against a list of up to 15°.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the trends}} in ship {{building}} is {{the building of}} larger and faster ships. However, increasing demand for speed has forced the ship designers to search for alternative materials to reduce {{the weight of the}} ship without compromising strength. Aluminium alloys, once properly designed, can achieve this goal by reducing the weight of structural components by over 50 % compared to those made of normal carbon steel. Another advantage of aluminium alloys is that its corrosion resistance. In a sea environment, steel has been found to corrode about 100 times faster than aluminium alloys under the same corrosive environment. As the size of aluminium ship increases, fatigue {{has become one of the}} main design criteria. In order to effectively make use of the high strength/weight ratio of aluminium alloys, the cross section of the structural components as well as the joint design should be optimized to provide sufficient fatigue strength while still maintain acceptable fabrication cost. Extruded hollow stiffeners have been proven to be able to provide excellent light and stiff panels for aluminium ships. Box stiffener is such a cross section profile investigated in the present study. The box stiffener is usually oriented longitudinally by interacting with a large number of web frames by fillet welds. These welded joints may be exposed to larger fatigue damage due to its significant stress variations experienced during the service of the ships. In addition, welding of these joints is quite costly since there are a lage amount of them and it is difficult to apply automatic welding due to complex profile. Any simplification in the welding procedure would cause a significant benefit to the ship builders. Three similar web frame/box stiffener connections are considered in these studies, by varying the opening shape on the web fame and accordingly the welding procedure. The objective is to achieve sufficient fatigue strength while still maintaining an economically efficient joint. The first connection (denoted as Alt- 1) tries to make a relatively larger opening on the web frame for easy assembling and more space for welding. The second and third alternatives (denoted as Alt- 2 and Alt- 3) are identical in the opening on the web frame while differs on welding procedure only. Interrupted welding is performed for Alt- 2 to save both the human resource and weld material while continuous welding is required for Alt- 3 for a simple welding procedure. Alt- 3 also provides a water tight solution due to the continuous welding. It is found that the change of cutting shapes on the web frame as well as the corresponding weld procedure has great impact on both the static and fatigue properties of the joints. Extra welding around the web frame may cause a high stress concentration at the weld toe and therefore imply an unacceptable fatigue damage. However, a simple weld can be a good candidate to achieve sufficient fatigue strength. Butt weld is usually used to join two pre-fabricated units to obtain sufficient overall strength of the joined single piece structure. However, difficulty may arise for such units when the box stiffeners are presented as the longitudinal stiffeners due to relatively large shrinkage and distortion introduced in the fabrication process including welding in the adjacent area. A special type of lap joint, denoted as box stiffener lap joint is designed to provide a joining solution for the box stiffeners. By enabling the inside profile of the lapping plate to be identical to the outside profile of the box stiffener, the joining of two box stiffeners is just to weld the intersection lines between the lapping plate and box stiffener. Only the wide flanges of the box stiffener require a conventional weld. Cracking from the weld root should be avoided to ensure sufficient fatigue strength. Good fatigue performance is observed for the box stiffener lap joint. The weld leg length is found to be a determining factor that affects both the fatigue strength and fatigue crack initiation site. Weld leg length between 6. 0 and 7. 5 mm is suggested to avoid high stress concentration at the weld toe. Moreover, this design reduces the likelihood of fatigue cracks to initiate from the most complex manual welding area. Information about fatigue analysis of welded aluminium structures is quite limited in the open literature. This thesis deals with fatigue assessment methods of welded aluminium plate structures based on both numerical analysis and experimental tests. Various stress based fatigue assessment methods such as the nominal, structural and notch stress approaches have been applied to the investigated joints. The nominal stress range approach can not provide a satisfactory prediction of the fatigue strength of novel welded joints because the local geometrical details including structural geometry and weld geometry are implicitly embedded in the nominal design SN curves. Laboratory tests would hence be needed to establish nominal stress approaches. More refined local approaches including the structural stress range approach and the notch stress range approach have been developed for a more accurate assessment of the fatigue strength. The main challenge for these local approaches is to find suitable stress calculation methods in the vicinity of the weld and thereby the uncertainties that determine the fatigue strength of the joint can be quantitatively reflected in a local stress concentration factor. Several of these methods are applied in the study of novel types of welded aluminium joints in this thesis. The choice of design SN curves must be consistent with the way by which the design stress range is calculated. Fatigue test data support the use of a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 40 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium fillet <b>welded</b> in-plane <b>bracket</b> connections when the structural stress has been derived from the extrapolation methods. It has been shown that a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 44 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium lap joints can be used. Another important issue is to investigate the effect of the local weld geometry such as the weld toe angle, weld toe radius, and weld leg length on the value of the structural/notch stress and accordingly on fatigue behaviour. The weld parameters of the joints have been measured in the laboratory and the statistical measured values are used in the numerical finite element models (FEM). Improving fatigue strength of critical joints is found to be necessary late in the design process or during the service time of a structure to extend the whole service life of the structure. The effect of weld toe grinding on the stress concentration at the weld toe is studied by finite element analysis (FEA). Fatigue tests show that the fatigue life in terms of number of cycles to failure is nearly doubled by simply grinding the weld toe of the joint. However, the standard deviations are not so much affected as the fatigue strength. The effect of weld parameters such as the grinding depth has been found to play a decisive role in fatigue life improvement. </p...|$|R

Slijede dva zvona iz 16. st. : jedno iz župne crkve u Vinici (1545.), drugo iz kapele sv. Vida u Samoboru (1564.). Zvono izliveno 1669. potpisao je majstor Petter Zweiffer u Grazu. Dva zvona oblikovali su poznati majstori zvonolijevači Pavle de Polis, (1725) i Johannes Schulz (1755), a za treće zvono iz 18. st. nema podataka o majstoru, ali je izliveno u jednoj od zagrebačkih radionica 1742. godine. Najmlađe zvono muzejske zbirke proizvedeno je 1839. godine, a potpisao ga je varaždinski majstor Anton Fiel. Analysing eight church bells, the {{collection}} in the Croatian Historical Museum in Zagreb, the author defines their typological, iconographical and stylistic features. The oldest is the Gothic bell, probably manufactured in Croatia in the late 14 th and early 15 th century (41 x 43, 5 cm). Instead of the original crown, the hook with a coil was installed subsequently. (tab. 1) The bell from the parish church in Vinica near Varaždin (34 x 30 cm) dates from 1545; harmonious Rennaissance features are present in its proportions and expressive shape. The upper part, between two lines, bears the inscription:" AVE-MARIA-M-D-XXXX-V-IAR-+" (tab. 2) The bell from the St. Vitus chapel of Samobor (48 x 35 cm). On the top end between two lines there is the inscription "S. D. P. R. V. PA V L S H AT M I C H G 0 S E N", with the date 1564 underneath. Master "Pavls" (Paulus) is obviously the caster of the bell, but {{it is impossible to}} establish accurately the place of manufacture (tab. 3). Petter Zwelffer is the master caster of one bell (36 x 32 cm) east in Graz in 1669. The inscription "PETTER* ZWELFFER* IN GRAZ* HAT MICH GOSSEN ANNO* 1669 ", is between two parallel lines on {{the upper part of the}} bell. The relationship of proportions is close to the Rennaissance principles of regularity, but the multiplication of plastic elements (gradual addition of circles in the upper and lower parts) and a certain "warping" of shape presage the early-Baroque play and articulation of surfaces (tab. 4) The bell by Pavlo de Polis from 1725 (42 x 36). The central space between rows of parallel lines is taken up by four reliefs arranged in even intervals: The Crucifixion, Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows, a figure of a saint kneeling on clouds, and St. Joseph with the baby Jesus in his right hand and a twig in his left. Above that, and between parallel horizontal lines, there is the inscription: "ANNO DOMINI MDCCXXV", decorated on top by a band with a tendril — and heart-shaped pattern. The full signature of the caster is under the representation of the crucified Christ, as follows: "OPVS/ PAVLI DE/ POLIS" (tab. 5) A bigger bell (44 x 40 cm) dating from the middle of the 18 th century, with the inscription "S. DONATUS. ORA. PRO. NOBIS" and "FUSA. ZAGRABIAE. 1742 " on the rim is decorated with four relief figures. Above the word "FUSA" there is the representation of Christ on the cross; it is followed by St. Donatus dressed in bishop 2 ̆ 7 s vestments, with the mitre on his head, the pastoral staff in his left hand and a book in his right; a crowned Madonna with the baby Jesus and a sceptre, and the fourth, a figure of a kneeling bearded man in left profile, hands clasped in prayer, which is typical for a donor. The bell is of additional interest because the original mechanism with the wooden construction circled by metal brackets has been preserved (tab. 6). The bell by Johannes Schulz (32 /without the <b>bracket</b> <b>welded</b> later/ x 24 cm) is in the worst condition. It is cracked and scratched in many parts, and on the upper half a new bracket has been applied. There are no documents about the reason for and the date of that later, rather badly executed intervention. Under the cap of the bell, between two horizontal lines, there is the inscription: "JOHANNES SCHUI Z FUDIT ME ZAGRABIAE 1755 ", with a horizontal decorative band underneath. On the surface of the rim there is the representation of Christ on the Cross, and opposite the figure of a saint with a twig in her lowered right hand (tab. 7). Only one bell in the museum collection dates from the 19 th century (40 x 42 cm), east by master Anton Fiel and marked by the inscription: "MICH GOSS ANTON FIEL IN WARASDIN AN 1839 ". It is decorated on the rim with two representations facing each other, the Crucifixion with the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene, and the image of Archangel Michael (tab. 8) ...|$|R
