25|$|Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer started positively, taking {{runs off}} the {{occasional}} bad balls that were served up by Harmison, Hoggard and Giles, and before anyone noticed, they had racked up 47 for no loss, and were <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> chasing {{the target of}} 282. Then, Flintoff came in to bowl his first over. The ball was hurled down the pitch, and swung enough to deceive the Australian batsmen – Flintoff got Langer and Ponting out in the same over, and Australia were struggling again, the score on 48 for 2.|$|E
25|$|And {{they took}} care of their good form. Winning two of their first three games, against Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Durham, they looked <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the quarter-finals, {{although}} the fight would be difficult against Lancashire, to whom they lost their fourth match. However, that was their last loss, as Leicestershire won three of their next four to finish second in the North Division. In the County Championship, however, they were defeated by a triple century from Somerset's skipper Graeme Smith, which sent them further down the Division Two tables. Their second tour match of the season against Australia followed - this time they drew, thanks to a solid batting effort from Australian Chris Rogers, who made a career highest-score of 209.|$|E

25|$|After {{a frantic}} first four sessions, in which twenty wickets had fallen, Sri Lanka's batsmen again showed {{control in the}} second innings. Marvan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya hit {{boundaries}} with ease in the opening twelve overs, taking runs at nearly five an over, before Powell and Lawson broke through in successive overs, Powell getting lucky as Atapattu sliced a cut straight to a diving Banks at backward point, while Jayasuriya gave a routine outside edge to Runako Morton. Then, Best entered with a fiery five-over spell that had Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene shaken up, and Jayawardene required medical treatment after one bouncer had smacked into his glove. After that, the batsmen settled into their groove, and lasted until rain stopped play on the second day, with Sri Lanka <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> building a challenging target.|$|E
25|$|Kent {{looked to}} be <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> posting a {{challenging}} total, as they were on 323 for 6 at stumps on day 2, with four of their batsmen making fifties. However, day three saw a total of twenty wickets tumble. First, Kent lost four wickets to be all out for 348, trailing by 30. Then, after Michael Yardy and Goodwin had rescued to Sussex to 89 for 2 after both openers had been removed for sub-20 scores, Sussex fell apart. Min Patel ran through the middle-order, Amjad Khan {{took care of the}} tail, and Sussex were all out for 155, setting a target of 186. However, accurate bowling was enough to undo Kent, as no Kent batsmen passed 35 and Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed shared eight wickets - Kent were all out for 119, but retained the County Championship lead, as their closest competitors failed to win.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} toss and {{deciding}} to bat against Canada, Bermuda scored 206/8 from their 50 overs: an innings that was saved from collapse in large {{due to the}} partnerships between captain Irving Romaine and Saleem Mukuddem, for 57, as well as Lionel Cann and Delyone Borden, for 38. Cann top scored for Bermuda again, this time for 42 – notably off just 25 balls, including five sixes. Come the Canadian innings, opener Abdool Samad took to the crease in similar fashion to Nafees the day before. His 83 from 86 took Canada to 135/3, and <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> victory. Delyone Borden's spin bowling brought {{them back into the}} game – taking 4 wickets for just 33 runs, and reducing Canada to 179/6; but the tail end of Canada's batting order got them the 207 runs they required – with 6 overs to spare and losing just 1 more wicket – to finish on 207/7.|$|E

25|$|The only {{downside}} for Sri Lanka {{was that}} their opener Sanath Jayasuriya had torn his shoulder, and looked {{unlikely to have}} a bat. Therefore, Kumar Sangakkara joined Marvan Atapattu as openers for Sri Lanka. They pair added 19 in 26 balls, before Irfan Pathan dug him out with a good inswinger. India took wickets regularly, {{but by the end}} of the 25th over Sri Lanka were 99/3, and <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> chasing 206. But Harbhajan Singh's off-breaks two players to miss their shots, and suddenly the score was 112/5, with an injured Jayasuriya and debutante Dilhara Lokuhettige at the crease. However, Jayasuriya battled on bravely and made an unbeaten 43 to guide Sri Lanka to the target with ten balls to spare, well helped by Farveez Maharoof, who made 23 from number 9 including four fours hit in front of square and a number of nervy shots that missed the bat.|$|E

Then, Flintoff came and bowled the over of the series. He {{failed to make the}} hat-trick he was on from the last innings, but with his second ball he bowled Langer with a leg cutter. His third delivery was narrowly turned down for lbw, the fourth found Ponting's edge but failed to carry to slip, an lbw appeal on the fifth was also turned down, but his sixth which Ponting left outside the offstump was a no ball, so there was a seventh and final delivery, another leg cutter and Ponting was out caught behind. Including the previous innings, Flintoff had taken four wickets in nine balls. But more importantly, Australia had been reduced from 47/0 to 48/2.|$|E
25|$|England {{went into}} their last Super Sixes match against New Zealand {{knowing that if}} Australia beat the West Indies and they beat New Zealand, they would reach the final. However, {{during the early stages}} of the match news came through that West Indies had staged a {{remarkable}} comeback victory over Australia, meaning those two teams would contest the final, and England and New Zealand would finish 3rd and 4th. The game lost some of its intensity after the news came through, but England posted 266-6, with Taylor scoring 88 and Edwards 54. New Zealand appeared to be <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> victory at 145-1, but good spells of bowling from Gunn and Colvin saw New Zealand collapse and England win by 15 runs. The same sides then contested the 3rd/4th place playoff, where the once again impressive Colvin helped limit New Zealand to 220-8. England successfully chased this target down to finish 3rd in the tournament, with Taylor, Greenway and Brindle supporting a match winning hundred from Edwards, who became the first woman to score 5,000 runs in ODIs as she finished 106*. Edwards, Brunt, Colvin and Shrubsole all were named in the team of the tournament, giving England the most representatives with four.|$|E

2500|$|Design and {{experimentation}} with gun synchronization had been underway in France and Germany in 1913/14, following {{the ideas of}} August Euler, {{who seems to have}} been the first to suggest mounting a fixed armament firing in the direction of flight (in 1910). However, the first practical (if far from reliable) gear to enter operational service was that fitted to the Eindecker monoplane fighters, which entered squadron service with the German Air Service in mid 1915.
