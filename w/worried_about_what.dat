5|$|Newman {{himself had}} been {{regarded}} as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled {{the headquarters of the}} NFB. Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx's 24 heures ou plus, at such a tense political time, <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the Canadian public would think. Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E
5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

The greatest joy I get as a filmmaker is to slip into an audience for one of our movies anonymously, and watch people watch our film. Because people are 100 percent honest when they're watching a movie.

25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember {{at that time the}} Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E
25|$|Being {{a lonely}} Serbian Anglophile Mijatović {{wished to be}} {{appointed}} as the first Serbian Minister in London, but {{had to wait until}} October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the Court of St James's. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the sole Serbian negotiator in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was {{able to get out of}} the war without suffering more serious consequences. In Bucharest Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative Ivan Evstratiev Geshov concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared in such a way that he was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was more <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> sort of reputation he would have in England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.|$|E
25|$|When {{a serial}} killer dubbed The Salem Stalker starts wreaking havoc around town, killing many friends, {{including}} Roman, John and Marlena are <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> could happen to them. The killer, though, is later revealed to be Marlena, though John believes {{she was forced to}} by someone else. Marlena is arrested, and sent to prison, while John tries to clear her name. Marlena tries to escape, and is killed by police fire. However, she's later found alive with all of her victims on Melaswen Island, and it's revealed she was brainwashed by Andre DiMera into committing the murders. She reunites with John, but soon after, Marlena finds out she's pregnant with Roman's child, conceived when they were stranded on the island. During an argument between John and Roman, Marlena falls down the stairs and miscarries. She wakes up with amnesia, {{as a result of the}} miscarriage. Amnesiac specialist Alex North is brought in to care for Marlena, and she appears to fall in love with him. Alex later reveals that he is Marlena's first husband, and was presumed dead in Vietnam. Since Alex and Marlena's marriage has never been dissolved, Marlena's subsequent marriages are all invalid. Suspicious, John investigates, and finds out that Alex is an abusive husband. John uncovers that Alex is planning to kill Marlena. By the time that Alex is proven to be a fraud, he and Marlena have renewed their vows, and left on a honeymoon. Alex takes Marlena to Morgan Island, but John soon finds them and, after a shootout and scuffle, Alex falls over a cliff and is presumed dead.|$|E

500|$|In 1905, Berkman was transported {{from the}} Western Penitentiary to the Allegheny County Workhouse, {{where he spent}} the final 10 months of his sentence. He found {{conditions}} in the workhouse [...] "a nightmare of cruelty, infinitely worse than the most inhuman aspects of the penitentiary." [...] The guards beat inmates for the slightest provocation, and one particularly sadistic guard shoved prisoners down the stairs. Berkman felt mixed emotions; {{he was concerned about}} the friends he had made in the prison, he was excited about the prospect of freedom, and he was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> life as a free man would be like.|$|E
500|$|While MalcolmX and {{scholars}} contemporary to the book's publication regarded Haley as the book's ghostwriter, modern scholars tend to regard {{him as an}} essential collaborator. They say he intentionally muted his authorial voice to create the effect of MalcolmX speaking directly to readers. Haley influenced some of MalcolmX's literary choices. For example, MalcolmX left the Nation of Islam during the period {{when he was working}} on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a polemic against the Nation which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of [...] "suspense and drama". According to Manning Marable, [...] "Haley was particularly <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism" [...] and he rewrote material to eliminate it.|$|E

By about lap two or three I knew we had a very balanced car and we'd be competitive all day long, get a solid finish.", he continued, [...] "I see guys get so <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> other people think, what other people say and {{spend a lot of time}} in those areas.

500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself.

[...] According to Cosmo, Manning had her own cell with [...] "two tall vertical windows that face the sun", and could see [...] "trees and hills and blue sky and all the things beyond the buildings and razor wire".

500|$|Kneale {{had brought}} Quatermass's story {{to a close}} in the 1979 serial Quatermass, and for many years {{saw no reason to}} revisit the character. However, in 1995 he was {{approached}} by BBC radio producer Paul Quinn with an idea for creating a drama-documentary about the character as part of a season of BBC radio programming looking back at the 1950s. Quinn told Dreamwatch magazine, [...] "For many people who remember the seminal experience of hiding behind the sofa when the Quatermass serials came on the television, Quatermass was the 1950s. His adventures [...] have gone down in popular cultural history." [...] Kneale was intrigued by the idea, and agreed to write new dramatic material of Quatermass relating his memories which Quinn could then combine with archive clips from the existing episodes of the various Quatermass television serials. Kneale saw the older Quatermass of this new serial as [...] "the same very concerned scientist who is now, in retrospect, horribly <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he may have done to the world through his encounters with various lifeforms that were better not contacted". It was Kneale's first radio work since he had written the play You Must Listen for the BBC in 1952, and his first work for the BBC in any medium since the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|Back home, Kennedy {{played with}} the Port Colborne Sailors of the OHA Sr. league for the 1942–43 hockey season. The Port Colborne coach was former NHL star and Hall of Fame inductee Nels Stewart who had been hired in November. Stewart became a mentor to Kennedy, working on his playmaking skills. Kennedy credits Stewart with {{teaching}} him how to [...] "operate {{in front of the}} net". Kennedy finished the season second in the league, only one point behind scoring champion, Dillon Brady of Hamilton. It was during this time that Kennedy debuted as a player at Maple Leaf Gardens. OHA senior teams played at the Gardens on Friday evenings and this included Kennedy and the Port Colborne Sailors. At the end of the season, in early February 1943, in spite of his having abandoned the Royals, Montreal scout Gus Ogilvie was sent to induce Kennedy to sign a contract with the promise that if he signed, he would finish the season with the Canadiens in the NHL. Concerned about his treatment in Montreal, he declined, despite being warned by Ogilvie, [...] "Well, you know, Ted, if you turn pro, {{it will have to be}} with the Canadiens." [...] Kennedy now thought his dreams of playing in the NHL were over. However, Nels Stewart believed in Kennedy, considering him [...] "a coming great", and recommended him to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy was called out of his grade 11 Latin class to the Principal's office. Kennedy, the high school student, was at first <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> he may have done wrong, but it turned out to be a phone call from Nels Stewart. Stewart had arranged a meeting with General Manager of the Leafs Frank Selke and Kennedy had to travel immediately to Toronto. Unlike Montreal, the Maple Leafs had someone there to meet Kennedy when he got off the train. Kennedy signed a contract that evening.|$|E

Three weeks later when we got to play in Israel the audience knew the words to all the new songs and it was wonderful." [...] Kid A was leaked online and shared via Napster three weeks before release. Asked whether he believed Napster had damaged sales, Capitol president Ray Lott likened the situation to unfounded concern about home taping in the 1980s and said: [...] "I'm trying to sell as many Radiohead albums as possible.
