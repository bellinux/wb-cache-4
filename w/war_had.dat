5|$|The {{quality of}} guns, armor, ordnance, and design was {{changing}} rapidly, so experience could quickly become irrelevant. Combat {{experience in the}} Spanish–American <b>War</b> <b>had</b> shown the value of many smaller guns at close range, where the larger guns had been inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{military}} {{victory of the}} absolutist city authorities was complete, the <b>war</b> <b>had</b> also shown them that they depended very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands. In the long term, the peasant war of 1653 prevented Switzerland from an excessive implementation of absolutism as occurred in France {{during the reign of}} Louis XIV.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>war</b> <b>had</b> officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year. In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of Caesar and was appointed praetor with consular power.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} consideration for Napoleon {{was that a}} French victory might cause French speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, {{and most of the}} British veterans of the Peninsular <b>War</b> <b>had</b> been sent to North America to fight in the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Another civil <b>war</b> <b>had</b> {{begun in}} Uruguay which pitted its {{political}} parties against one another. The internal conflict {{led to the}} murder of Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's Progressive Cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War.|$|E
5|$|As {{investor}} {{confidence in the}} global economic outlook fell in early August, Bloomberg suggested the currency <b>war</b> <b>had</b> entered a new phase.

50|$|Civil wars {{since the}} end of World <b>War</b> II <b>have</b> lasted on average just over four years, a {{dramatic}} rise from the one-and-a-half-year average of the 1900-1944 period. While the rate of emergence of new civil <b>wars</b> <b>has</b> been relatively steady since the mid-19th century, the increasing length of those <b>wars</b> <b>has</b> resulted in increasing numbers of wars ongoing at any one time. For example, there were no more than five civil wars underway simultaneously {{in the first half of}} the 20th century while there were over 20 concurrent civil wars close to the end of the Cold War. Since 1945, civil <b>wars</b> <b>have</b> resulted in the deaths of over 25 million people, as well as the forced displacement of millions more. Civil <b>wars</b> <b>have</b> further resulted in economic collapse; Somalia, Burma (Myanmar), Uganda and Angola are examples of nations that were considered to have had promising futures before being engulfed in civil wars.|$|R

5|$|As the <b>war</b> <b>had</b> {{ended with}} the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under the Articles of Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined. Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, the course of the <b>war</b> <b>had</b> gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{successes in}} the Seven Years' <b>War</b> <b>had</b> left it with {{expensive}} commitments in the Americas {{that had to}} be paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the Thirteen Colonies of British America led to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and started the Anglo-Spanish War and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.|$|E

In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of the island.

A civil <b>war</b> <b>had</b> caused the Khan to flee the city, and riots were becoming more and more widespread. Meanwhile, T'aigo Wangsa, a Korean Buddhist monk, traveled to China to receive training under the guidance of Buddhist leader Shih-wu. T'aigo later founded the T'aigo sect of Korean Buddhism.|$|E
