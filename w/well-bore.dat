40|$|Annular flow {{is one of}} {{the most}} common flow {{patterns}} encountered in natural gas <b>well-bores</b> and pipelines. It occurs at high gas and low to medium liquid flow rates and at all pipe orientations. Using a newly-designed flow loop in the University of Huddersfield, annular flow was established and different measurements were carried in a vertical Perspex pipe (i. d. = 50 mm). An ultrasonic flow meter, USFM, was designed to serve the purpose of measuring the velocity of the gas in the core. The USFM successfully measured the gas velocity over a wide range of gas and water flow rates. In this study, another device that was used was a novel Conductance Flow Meter, CFM, for measuring the liquid film flow rate by measuring the film thickness and the film velocity (using the cross-correlation technique). An empirical relationship between the entrainment fraction and the gas superficial velocity has also been established. The liquid film was mathematically modeled and the film velocity profile was characterized. The overall results of the present work have shown a good agreement with Zabaras and Dukler’s work (1986) which indicates the success of the new combination of the measurement technique...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental TechnologyThe {{exploitation}} of hydrocarbon {{has forced the}} petroleum production to move closer to extreme climate areas and deep waters such as the Barents Sea. These challenges require effective and safe production, transport and processing of the petroleum sources. Chemical and physical changes in the reservoir may cause different types of unpredicted problems such as organic deposits which are mainly asphaltene and wax precipitation. Wax precipitation is very common in subsea pipelines. Asphaltenes are more affected by for example pressure drops and high shear, which may cause formation damage as well as plugup the <b>well-bores</b> and tubing. In the petroleum industry, flow assurance has become a key concern where the cold sea bottom temperatures and extreme water depths give rise to enormous technical challenges which includes the management of solids such as asphaltenes and wax. Flow assurance is defined as “safe, uninterrupted and simultaneous transport of gas, oil and water from reservoirs to processing facilities”. The term refers {{to the need to}} guarantee flow of oil and gas from the reservoirs to the processing facilities. In this thesis the focus will be on chemical control of asphaltene and the formulation of an optimal asphaltene dispersant mixture. An experimental method needed to be established for the screening tests of the dispersant mixtures. When performing a screening test, the experimental method is desired to be simple and quick. This will save time and money as the screening test will only give an idea of how the system works and interacts. Different methods were tested such as measurement of the asphaltene deposit level, spot test, UV-Vis spectroscopy and turbidity measurements. Turbidity measurement was decided {{to be used in the}} formulation of an optimal asphaltene dispersant mixture. Design of experiments (DoE) and mixture design are well known methods which are often used when mixing together multiple components. DoE techniques provide an idea of how the mixtures work together and can then optimize the formulation at a minimum effort and cost. The computer software, Design Expert was used for the experimental design in this thesis. The program was used to set up an experimental plan which showed the mixture components and the mixture proportions to be tested. When the results were ready, they were inserted in Design Expert and a model was suggested. The analysis of the model was also done by Design Expert which made it possible to easily detect certain trends in the model such as identifying results that deviated from the model in form of failed experiments. Three different crude oils were tested, Crudo-Metapetroleum a viscous and heavy crude oil with an asphaltene content of 12, 1535 g/ 100 ml, Hier D 02 A crude oil which is a more common crude oil with an asphaltene content of 2, 2380 g/ 100 ml and Jordbær crude oil with an asphaltene content of 0, 2210 g/ 100 ml. Three commercial asphaltene dispersant were tested in order to find an optimal mixture formulation. The dispersants used for these tests, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DDBSA), Hybase M- 401 and Flowsolve 113, did not show any usable synergistic effects. The results showed that the best dispersant was Flowsolve 113...|$|R

50|$|Oil Well Perforation may be {{basically}} classified in {{two types}} a) Overbalanced Perforating and b) Underbalanced Perforating. Overbalanced perforating is normally {{carried out with}} the help of Perforating Guns or Hollow carriers. In Overbalanced Perforation the weight of the <b>Well-bore</b> Column is more than the Reservoir Pressure, thus it normally ensures that the Well does not start flowing oil or gas immediately after perforation. However, it may have the effect of damaging the formation due to forced entry of <b>well-bore</b> fluid (mud) into the reservoir.|$|E

40|$|Needle wells are {{conventional}} <b>well-bores</b> {{that contain}} several hundreds of laterals, called needle holes. The reservoir contact area is increased by these holes, which enables enhanced hydrocarbon production. The needle holes {{are created by}} dedicated pipes that are equipped with nozzles. These pipes are mounted in a special liner that is lowered downhole. By pumping fluid-abrasive particle mixtures through the nozzles, the formation is eroded away and causes the needle to propagate into the reservoir. The transport of fluid-particle mixtures in the narrow annulus of a needle geometry might result in challenges with regards to hole cleaning. Also, pressure losses for these mixtures are challenging to predict. The {{purpose of this study}} was to experimentally investigate the effects of flow rate variations, needle inclinations and needle eccentricity on pressures and hole cleaning in the annulus between a needle and the hole that it creates. From a literature study was determined that the combination of water with 4 vol. % steel particles might be a good mixture for the purpose of needle jetting. Due to strong acceleration of the mixture in the nozzles of the needle, the impact of the particles cause the formation to break and the water subsequently can enter the cracks to remove the rock cuttings. Typical pressures that have to be applied over the nozzles are in the order of 350 bar. The material properties for steel particles and water were used as input for a needle system design calculation. The needle diameter was set at 10 mm and from pressure loss calculations, and the aim to apply maximum pressure drop over the nozzle, the annulus outer diameter was defined to be 16 mm. Typical flow rates needed per needle are in the order of 30 L/min. Steel particle sizes for this system were calculated to be ~ 0. 2 mm. A program of experiments was defined wherein flow rates were varied between 10 - 30 L/min in steps of 10 L/min. Steel particle concentrations were set at 4 vol. % and particle sizes ranged from 0. 2 - 0. 3 mm. These experiments were run in a specially designed setup, wherein the annulus eccentricity and inclinations can be varied over their full range. Experiments were conducted for a concentric annulus in horizontal, vertical and 45 degree critical angle setting. For a fully eccentric annulus, the transport in horizontal and critical angle setting were investigated. In the vertical and critical angle experiments, the flow-direction was set against the force of gravity. Over a small length in the annulus, movies of the particle distributions were recorded by high speed camera. Stationary beds, moving beds and an asymmetric suspension of particles only occurred at 10 L/min & 20 L/min for horizontal eccentric setting and at 10 L/min for critical angle eccentric setting. The pressure losses for water-steel particle mixtures in concentric annuli were all higher than the losses for water flow. However, for increasing flow rates, this difference decreased. During water-steel particle experiments at 10 L/min in horizontal concentric setting, the annulus plugged. This resulted in rapid particle buildup in the annulus and should therefore be avoided. When flowing at 10 L/min in vertical concentric setting, the pressure losses were lower than for flowing at 10 L/min at horizontal and critical angle concentric settings. A pressure loss model for homogeneously suspended particles matched within 10 % accuracy with the results from vertical concentric setting. Furthermore, it was expected that at the critical angle, particle beds would slide back into the hole. This was not observed during the experiments.

5000|$|Eliminates {{formation}} damage.

50|$|The three {{prevailing}} water-related {{problems that}} upset oil companies today are corrosion, gas hydrates and scaling in production systems. The reservoir water {{has a high}} composition of dissolved minerals equilibrated {{over millions of years}} at constant physicochemical conditions. As the reservoir fluids are pumped from the ground, changes in temperature, pressure and chemical composition shift the equilibria and cause precipitation and deposition of sparingly soluble salts that build up over time with the potential of blocking vital assets in the oil production setups. Scaling can occur at all stages of oil/gas production systems (upstream, midstream and downstream) and causes blockages of <b>well-bore</b> perforations, casing, pipelines, pumps, valves etc. Severe scaling issues have been reported in Russia and certain North Sea production systems.|$|E
50|$|Porosity logs {{measure the}} {{fraction}} or percentage of pore volume in {{a volume of}} rock. Most porosity logs use either acoustic or nuclear technology. Acoustic logs measure characteristics of sound waves propagated through the <b>well-bore</b> environment. Nuclear logs utilize nuclear reactions {{that take place in}} the downhole logging instrument or in the formation. Nuclear logs include density logs and neutron logs, as well as gamma ray logs which are used for correlation. The basic principle behind the use of nuclear technology is that a neutron source placed near the formation whose porosity is being measured will result in neutrons being scattered by the hydrogen atoms, largely those present in the formation fluid. Since there is little difference in the neutrons scattered by hydrocarbons or water, the porosity measured gives a figure close to the true physical porosity whereas the figure obtained from electrical resistivity measurements is that due to the conductive formation fluid. The difference between neutron porosity and electrical porosity measurements therefore indicates the presence of hydrocarbons in the formation fluid.|$|E
50|$|DOGGR also {{maintains}} {{a database of}} active wells, expired wells, surveyed lands and leases on California land, coastal waters (0-3 miles) and federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). When a well is no longer needed, either because the oil or gas reservoir becomes depleted, or because no oil or gas was found (called a dry-hole), the well is plugged and abandoned. A well is plugged by placing cement in the <b>well-bore</b> or casing at certain intervals as specified in California laws or regulations. The purpose of the cement is to seal the wellbore or casing and prevent fluid from migrating between underground rock layers. Cement plugs are required to be placed across the oil or gas reservoir (zone plug), across the base-of-fresh-water (BFW plug), and at the surface (surface plug). Other cement plugs may be required {{at the bottom of}} a string of open casing (shoe plug), on top of tools that may become stuck down hole (junk plug), on top of cut casing (stub plug), or anywhere else where a cement plug may be needed. Also, the hole is filled with drilling mud to help prevent the migration of fluids.|$|E
