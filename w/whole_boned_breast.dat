40|$|The {{application}} of engineering theory and analysis to bone {{has led to}} many insights regarding the etiology of increased skeletal fragility with aging and diseases such as osteoporosis. According to mechanics of materials theory, <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behavior should depend {{on the amount of}} bone tissue, bone geometry, and tissue material properties. Through the use of micro-computed tomography, the influence of bone mass and geometry on <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> strength and stiffness have been confirmed and quantified. With the {{application of}} nanoindentation to the study of bone, the ability to measure the mechanical properties of bone at the micron length scale is now possible. However, most studies using nanoindentation have focused only on tissue-level properties and, therefore, relatively {{little is known about the}} relationships between tissue-level properties and <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behavior. The objectives of this research were to 1) examine the effects of two composition changes, mineralization and crystallinity, on <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> and tissue-level mechanical behavior, and 2) examine changes in tissue-level composition and mechanical properties due to osteoporosis. To investigate the effects of mineralization and crystallinity independently, two separate dietary interventions in rodents were used. First, vitamin D deficiency in growing rats was used to reduce cortical bone mineralization. The vitamin D deficient animals had compromised <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behav- ior, as indicated by the lower failure moment and bending stiffness. To take into account the mechanical property heterogeneity and cortex geometry when predicting <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behavior, a density-weighted section modulus was calculated using composite beam theory. The weighted section moduli predicted <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behavior better than geometric parameters or average mechanical properties alone. In the second study, growing rats given fluoride had increased cortical bone crystallinity and reduced measures of <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behavior. Cortical cross-sectional geometry was not different with fluoride, implying a difference in mechanical properties was responsible for the altered <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behavior; however, indentation modulus and hardness were not different. The discrepancies between tissue-level and <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behavior suggest that interfaces between microstructural features and other mesoscale features influence <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical behavior. In the third study, tissue-level composition and mechanical properties of osteoporotic cancellous bone from a fracture prone location were examined. Vertebral cancellous bone from female cadavers was divided into two groups, osteoporotic and not osteoporotic based on T-scores from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans. Tissue from osteoporotic donors had lower indentation moduli and showed a trend towards being less mineralized compared to tissue from normal and osteopenic individuals. Independent of reduced bone mass and altered trabecular architecture, lower indentation moduli of osteoporotic bone could contribute to skeletal fragility associated with osteoporosis. 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} plasma, bone surface (periosteal) and <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> as biomarkers of chronic fluoride (F) exposure. METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were assigned to 4 groups (n= 10 /gr) that differed according to the F concentration they received in the drinking water. Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 received water containing 0 (control), 5, 15, and 50 mg F/L, respectively. The rats were killed at 120 days of age. Plasma and femur were collected and analyzed for fluoride with the ion specific electrode by the direct method or after hexamethyldisiloxane-facilitated diffusion. Data were tested for statistically significant differences by ANOVA and linear regression (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Mean (± SE) plasma F concentrations ranged from 0. 030 ± 0. 002 to 0. 187 ± 0. 013 (mg/mL). The concentrations in surface and <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> ranged from 610 ± 32 to 4, 693 222; and 647 ± 22 to 3, 439 ± 134 µg/g, respectively. The surface/whole F concentration ratios were 0. 941, 1. 414, 1. 173 and 1. 377, for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. For plasma and <b>whole</b> <b>bone,</b> the difference among all groups was statistically significant, except for group 2 compared to group 1. For bone surface, all groups differed from each other except for group 2 compared to group 3. A significant positive correlation was found between <b>bone</b> surface and <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> F (r²= 0. 94), {{as well as between}} plasma and bone surface (r²= 0. 71) and plasma and <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> (r²= 0. 74).

40|$|Abstract Background Osteoporotic hip {{fractures}} occur due to loss of cortical and trabecular {{bone mass}} and consequent degradation in <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> strength. The direct cause of most fractures is a fall, and hence, characterizing the mechanical {{behavior of a}} <b>whole</b> osteopenic <b>bone</b> under impact is important. However, very {{little is known about}} the mechanical interactions between cortical and trabecular bone during impact, and it is specifically unclear to what extent epiphyseal trabecular bone contributes to impact resistance of <b>whole</b> <b>bones.</b> We hypothesized that trabecular bone serves as a structural support to the cortex during impact, and hence, loss of a critical mass of trabecular bone reduces internal constraining of the cortex, and, thereby, decreases the impact tolerance of the <b>whole</b> <b>bone.</b> Methods To test this hypothesis, we conducted cortical strain rate measurements in adult chicken's proximal femora subjected to a Charpy impact test, after removing different trabecular bone core masses to simulate different osteopenic severities. Results We found that removal of core trabecular bone decreased by ~ 10 -fold the cortical strain rate at the side opposite to impact (p Conclusion We conclude that in our in vitro avian model, loss of over 10 % of core trabecular bone substantially altered the deformation response of <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> to impact, which supports the above hypothesis and indicates that integrity of trabecular bone is critical for resisting impact loads. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the Corpus sterni using {{computed}} tomography and finite element analysis with the question, “whether certain sections of the bone could represent the mechanical characteristics of the <b>whole</b> <b>bone.</b> ” This approach results from the clinical problem, that in Cardiac-thoracic Surgery a median sternotomy is often used to access the mediastinal structures and if postoperative complications such as sternal dehiscence occurs, a high mortality rate exists. In this study five human sterna were analyzed postmortem. The bones were put in a buffered formalin solution and then evacuated. Computed Tomography images were generated with the XtremeCT (Scanco Medical) using a resolution of 82 µm. The reconstruction and post-processing of the three-dimensional structure models was performed with the program Amira®. The xiphoid process was separated from the Corpus sterni. A total of three cubes were virtually taken from each sternum considering anatomical criteria. A finite element grid was generated for all samples and <b>whole</b> <b>bones.</b> Performing the finite element analysis, all models were transferred to the program Abaqus. After defining boundary conditions and material properties, force application was performed on all <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> and cube samples. The detected strains and deformations were measured and represented through histograms and color-coding images. The mechanical behavior of the <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> samples were contrasted with the cube samples in a ranking system. It was determined that analyzing with Von Mises Stress one cube sample at the articulation with the fifth left rib (cube 3) made the best correlation with the structure of the <b>whole</b> <b>bone.</b> Analysis with “Minimum Principal Strains” and structural parameters of the computed tomography showed little or no correlation. In conclusion, one cube sample of the Corpus sterni is a good representation of the mechanical behavior of the <b>whole</b> <b>bone.</b> This observation has to be validated in clinical studies. The analysis of bone quality of only one section of the bone could facilitate the introduction of a preoperative analysis for identifying patients with high risk for postoperative complications such as sternal dehiscence...|$|R

40|$|Progressive {{bone loss}} and {{weakening}} bone strength associated with aging predispose the elderly population to osteoporosis {{and millions of}} costly fragility fractures. Micro finite element (µFE) analysis based on clinical high-resolution skeletal imaging provides an accurate computational solution to assessing the mechanical properties of bone, {{which can be used}} as the dominant factors for fracture risk. However, the current µFE analysis technique is impractical for clinical use due to its prohibitive computational costs, which result from the “voxel-to-element” approach of modeling human bone regardless of its microstructural pattern. I developed a novel plate-rod microstructural modeling technique for highly efficient patient-specific µFE analysis and translated it to clinical research for the assessment of bone strength in osteoporosis and fragility fractures. Trabecular microstructure is composed of interconnected plate-like and rod-like trabeculae. Instead of converting every image voxel directly into an element, the plate-rod modeling approach created mechanical characterization for every individual trabecular plate and rod. The validation studies demonstrated that the PR model was able to reproduce the morphology and mechanical behavior of the original trabecular microstructure, while reducing the size of the µFE model and improving the efficiency of µFE simulations. First, the PR models of trabecular bone were developed based on high-resolution micro computed tomography (µCT), and evaluated in comparison with computational gold standard-voxel µFE models and experimental gold standard-mechanical testing for estimating Young’s modulus and yield strength of human trabecular bone. Results suggested that PR model predictions of the trabecular bone mechanical properties were strongly correlated with voxel models and mechanical testing results. Moreover, the PR models were indistinguishable from the corresponding voxel models constructed from the same images in the prediction of trabecular bone Young’s modulus and yield strength. In addition, PR model nonlinear µFE analyses resulted in over 200 -fold reduction in computation time compared with voxel model µFE analyses. In the effort of studying the heterogeneous bone mineralization in trabecular plates and rods, I developed an individual trabecula mineralization (ITM) analysis technique that allows quantification of the tissue mineral density of each individual trabecular plate and rod. By examining the variation of mineral density with trabecular types and orientations, it was found that trabecular plates were higher mineralized than trabecular rods. Furthermore, trabecular plate mineral density varied with trabecular orientation, increasing from the longitudinal direction to the transverse direction. ITM provided measurement of mineral density of each trabecular plate and rod, which was converted to trabecula-specific tissue modulus and used in the PR models to incorporate mineral heterogeneity in µFE simulations. Results suggested that heterogeneous PR models did not differ from the homogeneous PR models or specimen-specific PR models in their predictions of apparent Young’s modulus and yield strength of the human trabecular bone specimens from non-diseased donors. Based on the trabecular bone PR model, a <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> PR model was developed for assessing <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical strength at the distal radius and the distal tibia from high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). The accuracy of the <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> PR model was evaluated on human cadaver radius and tibia specimens which were imaged using HR-pQCT and µCT, respectively, and tested to failure. The <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> stiffness and yield load of the radius and tibia segments predicted by HR-pQCT PR models were strongly correlated with those predicted by corresponding HR-pQCT voxel models, µCT voxel models, and mechanical testing measurements. The PR models µFE results were indistinguishable from the voxel models constructed from the same HR-pQCT images. Moreover, the PR models significantly reduced the computational time for nonlinear µFE assessment of <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> strength. After evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of the newly developed <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> PR model, it was employed in a clinical study aimed at characterizing the abnormalities of trabecular plate and rod microstructure, cortical <b>bone,</b> and <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical properties in postmenopausal women with vertebral fractures. Women with vertebral fractures had thinner cortical bone, and larger trabecular area compared to their non-fractured peers. ITS analyses suggested vertebral fracture subjects had deteriorated trabecular microstructure, evidenced by fewer trabecular plates, less axially aligned trabeculae and less trabecular connectivity at both radius and tibia. These microstructural deficits translated into reduced <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> stiffness and yield load at radius and tibia as predicted by PR model nonlinear µFE simulation. More importantly, logistic regression indicated that <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> yield load was effective in discriminating the vertebral fracture subjects from the non-fractured controls...|$|R

However, the molecular mechanism of metastatic <b>bone</b> disease in <b>breast</b> cancer remains unknown. We have recently made the novel observation of the BST 2 protein expression in human breast cancer cell lines. The purpose of our present study is to investigate the expression and the role of BST 2 in <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer. Methods cDNA microarray analysis was used to compare the BST 2 gene expression between a metastatic to <b>bone</b> human <b>breast</b> cancer cell line (MDA- 231 BO) and a primary human breast cancer cell line (MDA- 231). The BST 2 expression in one <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer and seven non-bone metastatic breast cancer cell lines were also determined using real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays. We then employed tissue array to further study the BST 2 expression in human breast cancer using array slides containing 20 independent breast cancer tumors that formed metastatic bone lesions, 30 non-metastasis-forming breast cancer tumors, and 8 normal breast tissues. In order to test the feasibility of utilizing BST 2 as a serum marker for the presence of <b>bone</b> metastasis in <b>breast</b> cancer, we had measured the BST 2 expression levels in human serums by using ELISA on 43 breast cancer patients with <b>bone</b> metastasis, 43 <b>breast</b> cancer patients without bone metastasis, and 14 normal healthy controls.

Results The microarray demonstrated over expression of the BST 2 gene in the <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer cell line (MDA- 231 BO) compared to the primary human breast cancer cell line (MDA- 231). The expression of the BST 2 gene was significantly increased in the <b>bone</b> metastatic <b>breast</b> cancer cell lines and tumor tissues compared to non-bone metastatic breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues by real time RT-PCR, Western blot and TMA.

Cyclic loading studies indicated that A/J femurs accumulated damage differently than C 57 BL/ 6 J femurs, consistent with their increased brittleness. Differences in matrix composition also were observed between the two mouse strains. A/J femurs had a 4. 5 % increase in ash content and an 11. 8 % decrease in collagen content. Interestingly, a reciprocal relationship was observed between femoral geometry and material stiffness; this relationship {{may have contributed to}} the brittle phenotype of A/J femurs. A/J femurs are more slender than those of C 57 BL/ 6 J femurs; however, their 47 % smaller moment of inertia appeared to be compensated by an increased tissue stiffness at the expense of altered tissue damageability. Importantly, these differences in <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> mechanical properties between A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 J femurs could not have been predicted from bone mass or density measures alone.

40|$|Trabecular bone {{plays an}} {{important}} mechanical role in bone fractures and implant stability. Homogenized nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis of <b>whole</b> <b>bones</b> can deliver improved fracture risk and implant loosening assessment. Such simulations require the knowledge of mechanical properties such as an appropriate yield behavior and criterion for trabecular bone. Identification of a complete yield surface is extremely difficult experimentally but can be achieved in silico by using micro-FE analysis on cubical trabecular volume elements. Nevertheless, {{the influence of the}} boundary conditions (BCs), which are applied to such volume elements, on the obtained yield properties remains unknown. Therefore, this study compared homogenized yield properties along 17 load cases of 126 human femoral trabecular cubic specimens computed with classical kinematic uniform BCs (KUBCs) and a new set of mixed uniform BCs, namely periodicity-compatible mixed uniform BCs (PMUBCs). In stress space, PMUBCs lead to 7 – 72 % lower yield stresses compared to KUBCs. The yield surfaces obtained with both KUBCs and PMUBCs demonstrate a pressure-sensitive ellipsoidal shape. A volume fraction and fabric-based quadric yield function successfully fitted the yield surfaces of both BCs with a correlation coefficient R 2 ≥ 0. 93. As expected, yield strains show only a weak dependency on bone volume fraction and fabric.

40|$|Age‐related {{osteoporosis}} {{is characterized}} by a decrease in bone‐forming capacity mediated by defects in the number and function of osteoblasts. An important cellular mechanism that may in part explain osteoblast dysfunction that occurs with aging is senescence of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). In the telomere‐based Wrn −/− Terc −/− model of accelerated aging, the osteoporotic phenotype of these mice is also associated with a major decline in MPC differentiation into osteoblasts. To investigate the role of MPC aging as a cell‐autonomous mechanism in senile bone loss, transplantation of young wild‐type <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> marrow into Wrn −/− Terc −/− mutants was performed and the ability of engrafted cells to differentiate into cells of the osteoblast lineage was assessed. We found that <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> marrow transplantation in Wrn −/− Terc −/− mice resulted in functional engraftment of MPCs up to 42 weeks, which was accompanied by a survival advantage as well as delays in microarchitectural features of skeletal aging.

40|$|Abstract: Adult mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) {{obtainable}} from autologous bone marrow aspirates have generated tre-mendous {{interest in the}} medical and scientific communities {{in the last two}} decades and are currently being investigated by a of interested physicians for use in point-of-care stem cell therapies due to their great potential to differentiate into multi-ple cell lineages such as bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, and nerve. However, as these stem cells are found in very low numbers in adult tissue, centrifugal concentration or expansion through in vitro culturing has been pursued to obtain higher numbers of efficacious regenerative therapeutic applications. More recently, some physicians and scientists have chosen to explore use for direct injection of un-fractionated, native <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> marrow aspirate as a strategy in regenera-tive treatment regimes. This review examines the potential merits and disadvantages of using either concentrated and culture expanded MSCs versus native <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> marrow aspirate as key proliferant in direct regenerative injection ther-apy (RIT). Results from a number of published investigations have clearly shown high potential of various deleterious ef-fects on manipulating MSCs obtained from native bone marrow aspirate either by centrifugal forces or expansion through in vitro culturing; moreover, currently used centrifugal concentration techniques do not significantly concentrate MSCs from bone marrow aspirate, thus, defeating the purpose of this manipulative step. On the other hand, preliminary results and observations of using un-fractionated <b>whole</b> <b>bone</b> marrow injection for treatment of various musculoskeletal joint dis-eases (for example, osteoarthritic joints) suggest that the procedure is safe and potentially efficacious, with no know...|$|R
