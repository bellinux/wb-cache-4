A unit may also have a secondary job set of abilities, where it can use any abilities of the selected job, but with the stat profile of the primary job.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to deal with the {{implications}} of insider trading on an unhampered market and on the regulated market. We argue that insider trading <b>will</b> <b>not</b> always <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> in all firms even if the absence of contract banning insider trading within the firms tends to confirm this phenomenon. Consequently, we show that market devices exist to help those firms that wish to prohibit to their insiders the use of inside information for their transactions. Moreover, we argue that insider trading becomes a problem in the relationship between shareholders and insiders when the government meddles with the market. Insider trading <b>is</b> a problem <b>not</b> because there <b>are</b> "market failures " but because the government intervention creates such failures.
