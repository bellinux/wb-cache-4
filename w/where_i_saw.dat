500|$|After the Restoration and King Charles II's {{return to}} London on 29 May 1660, a pall-mall court was {{constructed}} in St James's Park {{just south of the}} wall, on the site of The Mall. Samuel Pepys's diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he [...] "...went into St. James's Park, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Duke of York playing at Pelemele, the first time that I ever saw the sport." [...] This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway. In July 1661 posts and rails were erected, stopping up the old road. The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow, and often known as an alley, so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James's Palace. A grant was made to Dan O'Neale, Groom of the Bedchamber, and John Denham, Surveyor of the King's Works allocating a [...] area of land for this purpose. The grant was endorsed [...] "Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James's." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
2500|$|The West Indies secured {{their first}} ever victory against England in the Second Test at Lord's. The match was won by 326 runs, with Ramadhin and Valentine taking 18 of the 20 wickets. The event was immortalised by the {{composition}} of a song, Victory Calypso. The last two lines have gone down in cricketing folklore. The words are: Cricket lovely Cricket, // At Lord's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it; // Cricket lovely Cricket, // At Lord's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it; // Yardley tried his best // But Goddard won the Test. // They gave the crowd plenty fun; // Second Test and West Indies won. // With those two little pals of mine // Ramadhin and Valentine.|$|E

60|$|I was {{as nearly}} home-sick as ever I {{was in my}} life; they seemed to make it such an incalculable {{distance}} to the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> the day.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the very}} spot <b>where</b> <b>I</b> last <b>saw</b> him," [...] said Jack, leading me to a palm-tree which stood a little within the outer verge of the wood; [...] "and here are his {{footsteps}} faintly indicated on the grass." ...|$|R
2500|$|Corgan later {{admitted}} that they switched back to the album format because he [...] "...reached a point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that the one-song-at-a-time idea had maxed itself out...I just saw we weren't getting the penetration in to everybody that I would have hoped." ...|$|E
2500|$|The diarist Samuel Pepys visited St. Mary's Church {{on several}} occasions. During one visit on 28 April 1667, he recorded:"and {{then back to}} Putney Church, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the girls of the schools, few of which pretty; and there I come into a pew, and met with little James Pierce, which I was much pleased at, the little rogue being very glad to see me: his master, Reader to the Church. Here was a good sermon and much company, but I sleepy, and {{a little out of}} order, for my hat falling down through a hole {{underneath}} the pulpit, which, however, after sermon, by a stick, and the help of the clerke, I got up again, and then walked out of the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his attempt}} to get {{permission}} to settle in Frankfurt failed, Stoskopff went to Paris. He stayed there from about 1622 until 1639, which can be reconstructed from indirect reports and property inventories of Parisians. His first works in larger format were also created here, such as [...] "Summer" [...] or [...] "Winter" [...] (now both in Strasbourg). A contemporary statement from Sandrart proves his residence in Paris: [...] "Von dannen [...] verreiste er in Frankreich und hinterließ viele gute Werke; von Pariß zoge er nach Italien (allwo ich ihn zu Venedig Anno 1629 gesehen), hernach wieder zurück nach Pariß und so fürters nach Straßburg [...] ("From there , he travelled to France and left many good works; from Paris, he moved to Italy (<b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him in Venice in 1629), afterwards again back to Paris and further to Strasbourg [...] ").|$|E
6000|$|Smoke laughed. [...] "That's the way {{it takes}} everybody. You see those high ledges across there to the northwest? There's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> it. No warning. Just {{suddenly}} caught {{the view of the}} whole lake from there. I'd given up looking for it, too.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But Uncle Maurice {{always was}} under a cloud, wasn't he, {{especially}} at Beechcroft, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> him or {{his wife in the}} holidays except once, when I believe she was not at all liked, and was thought to be very proud, and stuck-up, and pretentious.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{schooner}} pitched {{and tossed}} {{to such a}} degree that I had great difficulty in reaching the forward deck, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> presently <b>saw</b> my sailor friend hard at work clearing away the remains of the boom of the mainmast, which had swung around and snapped off.|$|R
2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} Currents centre on {{personal}} transition and growing older. Parker's lyrics {{on the album}} are entirely autobiographical. His vocals are clearer and less affected than in prior Tame Impala releases, which is partially owed to him having more pride in his lyrics; he said he {{hoped it would be}} easy for listeners to understand them. Parker considered the primary theme of the album to be a [...] "deep feeling of transition in your psyche," [...] or, in a broad sense, fully entering adulthood. He began learning about the concept of the Saturn return halfway through the recording process, which explained his feelings of reflection. He said, [...] "I was halfway through making the album when I heard about it, and it gave what I was doing a lot more meaning; suddenly things made a lot more sense." [...] Accordingly, on the album his reaction to transition is acceptance, exemplified by the opening song, [...] "Let It Happen". Parker also felt buying the home where he recorded Currents [...] "really changed my perspective about <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> myself, like a place that I belonged." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{covered with}} his hand {{the upper part of}} his face, but did not conceal his mouth, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{hovering}} an expression I liked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me go away {{alone for}} a little while," [...] I said. [...] "I shall bear it better when I have looked once more at the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> her--when <b>I</b> have knelt and prayed by the grave where they have laid her to rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>where's</b> Luigi Pulci? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him." [...] "Oh, in {{the wood}} there. Gone, depend upon it, To vent some fancy in his brain--some whim, That will not let him rest till it's a sonnet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} means any harm by it, but I don't {{like to see}} a {{minister}} laugh so much. I can't hardly get him to talk seriously about anything. And I just know he makes fun of Lottie. I don't mean that he always makes fun with me. He didn't that night at the vaudeville, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} seem to {{know his}} face," [...] said the officer, thoughtfully, [...] "although <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it I have not the least idea. What is his name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What has happened?" [...] I exclaimed, hurrying {{around to}} the front of the coach, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that the pole had been broken off about the middle of its length.|$|E
60|$|On {{my return}} to Chester I {{passed over the}} {{mountain}} called Penmaen Ross, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> plainly a part of Ireland, Scotland, England, and the Isle of Man all at once.|$|E
5000|$|According to Donner, [...] "It {{took about}} two hours {{and by the time}} we were done, I was in seventh heaven. They found innuendoes; they found {{laughter}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> it; they found tears where they didn't exist before; and, most importantly, they found a relationship — all in just one reading. So if you ask about casting... it was magical, just total dynamite." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{all this}} time I never ceased {{wondering}} at my own mental state; I thought of it when, quickly tired, my trembling fingers dropped the pencil; or when I woke from uneasy sleep to find the vision still before me, inviting, insistently calling to me, to resume my childish rambles and adventures of long ago in that strange world <b>where</b> <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> the light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Wallingford," [...] he said, [...] "there {{is little}} need of {{preliminaries}} {{between you and}} me. I recollected your ship, when the Black Prince and Speedy were {{in the act of}} closing with the Frenchmen, three months since; and I need scarcely say that the manner in which she got back to the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> then <b>saw</b> her, requires an explanation at your hands." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{night in}} Chicago (<b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Salvini play Othello), {{a day in}} Neshonoc to visit my Uncle Richard, and I was again {{in the midst of}} a jocund rush of land-seekers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, Miss Rose--it {{seemed to}} me a good two leagues to the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him, and the boat is fast that will run two leagues in an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have the}} {{perception}} of individual images very strong, but a dim one of the relation of place. I remember the man or the tree, but <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them I mostly forget.[1] ...|$|E
60|$|Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw {{the skull}} an altar, and the {{artificial}} smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel {{as an object of}} vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton-- brushed the vines aside--broke through the ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbors. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening <b>where</b> <b>I</b> entered. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> no living thing within; naught was there but bones.|$|R
5000|$|Every corpse <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> was {{as black}} as coal. It was not {{possible}} to remove them. They were buried <b>where</b> they fell. ... <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> no live man lying on this ground. The wounded must have suffered horribly before death relieved them, lying there exposed to the blazing southern sun o' days, and being eaten alive by beetles o' nights.

6000|$|... "I don't know <b>where,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them a {{few minutes}} ago most {{distinctly}} 'slope.' They've gone for a quiet, unwatched hour, poor dears, out into the park or the gardens. When one knows it, it's all there. But what's that vulgar song?--'You've got to know it first!' It strikes me, if you don't mind my telling you so, that the way you get hold of things is positively uncanny. I mean as regards what first marked her for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I see. But, somehow, this edge of {{the woods}} doesn't look {{familiar}} to me. I thought we entered at a point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a clump of four trees on the left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You bear, I am told, an honored name, and you {{are well}} {{received}} in society. Why do you associate with murderers and thieves in that hell of a café <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you first?" ...|$|E
60|$|Having secured my boat, I took my gun {{and went}} on shore, {{climbing}} up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{the full extent of}} it, and resolved to venture.|$|E
6000|$|From <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Pope's face only in profile: it was {{gentle and}} benign enough, but not great in expression, and the smile on it almost {{degenerated}} into a simper. His Holiness had a cold; and his recitative, though full, was not smooth. He was all priest when, {{in the midst}} of the service, he hawked, held his handkerchief up before his face, a little way off, and ruthlessly spat in it! ...|$|R
60|$|As {{she walked}} {{directly}} to the spot <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Sylvia as <b>I</b> had seen her in my day-dreams,--a beautiful girl, dressed as a beautiful girl should dress in summer time. In one hand she carried a portfolio, in the other a little leathern case. As she came nearer, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that she was attired exactly as Mother Anastasia had been dressed when I met her here. Nearer she came, but still {{she did not see}} me. I was not now concealed, but her eyes seemed fixed upon the path in which she was walking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{go round}} behind the Fleischmarkt," [...] said Diogenes, {{as soon as}} his two friends had come within ear-shot of him, [...] "and reach the rear of the cathedral that way. Unless I am greatly mistaken the seat of yonder quarrel is by a small postern gate which I spied awhile ago at the corner of Dam Straat and <b>where</b> methinks <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a number of men and women furtively gaining admittance: they looked uncommonly like Papists and the postern gate not unlike a Romanist chapel door." ...|$|R
