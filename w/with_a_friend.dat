5|$|After {{reaching}} the Western Conference Final in the 2006 playoffs, the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks entered the 2006–07 season with high expectations; the team brought Selänne {{back with a}} one-year, $3.75 million contract.

On December 31, he played his 1,000th NHL game.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test whether the presence of new friends at moments of substance-use initiation differs across substances, and whether individuals tend to initiate substance use, across different substances, either <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new <b>friend</b> or <b>with</b> <b>an</b> old <b>friend.</b> Participants were 419 Italian high school students (41 % female). Results showed that the presence of <b>a</b> new <b>friend</b> at the moment of substance-use initiation varied across different substances. New friends were least often present when an individual first tried cigarettes, and were most often present the first time an individual tried marijuana. Substance-use initiation in the co-presence of both <b>an</b> old <b>friend</b> and <b>a</b> new <b>friend</b> was almost exclusively linked to higher levels of substance use (marijuana and hard alcohol) and non-existent with tobacco use. However, results showed a clear tendency for individuals to initiate substance use either <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new <b>friend</b> or <b>with</b> <b>an</b> old <b>friend.</b> Results are discussed in terms of extending peerinfluence research to include transitions in peer relations as important moments for peer influence...|$|R
