500|$|For Diệm and his family, {{the failed}} coup {{was a turning}} point in {{relations}} with the US support, which had generally been unconditional and strong since 1955. He felt the US had let him down and that some Americans had been encouraging his overthrow and undermining his rule. He had previously though the Americans had full support for him, but afterwards, he told his confidants that he felt like Syngman Rhee, the President of the anti-communist South Korea who had been strongly backed by Washington until being deposed in a coup earlier in 1960, a regime change Diệm saw as US-backed. Diệm's opponents felt the same way about the similarities to Korea. Lieu later told Kahin [...] "We had no <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> continued American assistance if we were successful; we felt we could count on it, just like Park did when he overthrew Rhee." [...] Kahin also wrote that several senior officers including a senior figure in the coup, whom he did not name, were [...] "explicit in charging American encouragement of the rebels".|$|E

For Star Trek II, it was decided to acknowledge the reality of the ageing actors, both by setting the film some 15 years after [...] "Space Seed", and by having Kirk <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> old.|$|E

2500|$|Children {{may have}} {{problems}} with bladder control (primarily at night), until eight years or older, and may wear diapers while sleeping to control bedwetting. The Children's Health and Wellness website claims that diapering a child can prolong bedwetting, as it sends a [...] "message of permission" [...] to urinate in their sleep. [...] Dr Anthony Page of the Creative Child Online Magazine claims that children can get used to their diapers and begin to view them as a comfort, {{and that of the}} children surveyed, most would rather wear diapers than <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> up at night to go to the toilet. In a series of online surveys, Robert A Pretlow, MD, of eHealth International, Inc., cites an identical figure. He argues that if Internet users are representative of society as a whole, these surveys imply that a fetishistic or emotional attraction to diapers may be responsible for these [...] "comfort" [...] cases, and that [...] "these behaviors are a significant cause of enuresis and incontinence." [...] He called for further studies to be done on the topic.|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
