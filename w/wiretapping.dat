40|$|Abstract—Characterization of the rate-equivocation {{region of}} a general <b>wiretap</b> channel {{involves}} two auxiliary random variables:, for rate splitting and,forchannel prefixing. In this paper, we explore specific classes of <b>wiretap</b> channels for which {{the evaluation of the}} rate-equivocation region is simpler. We show that if the <b>wiretap</b> channel is more capable, is optimal and the boundary of the rate-equivocation region is achieved by varying rate splitting alone. Conversely, we show under a mild condition that if the <b>wiretap</b> channel is not more capable, then is strictly suboptimal. Next, we focus on the class of cyclic shift symmetric <b>wiretap</b> channels. We show that optimal rate splitting that achieves the boundary of the rate-equivocation region is uniform with cardinality and the prefix channel between optimal and is expressed as cyclic shifts of the solution of an auxiliary optimization problem over a single variable. We provide a special class of cyclic shift symmetric <b>wiretap</b> channels for which is optimal. We apply our results to the binary-input cyclic shift symmetric <b>wiretap</b> channels and thoroughly characterize the rate-equivocation regions of the BSC-BEC and BEC-BSC <b>wiretap</b> channels.

40|$|The secrecy {{capacity}} of a network, for a given collection of permissible <b>wiretap</b> sets, is the maximum rate of communication such that observing links in any permissible <b>wiretap</b> set reveal no information about the message. This paper considers secure network coding with nonuniform or restricted <b>wiretap</b> sets, for example, networks with unequal link capacities where a wiretapper can <b>wiretap</b> any subset of k links, or networks where only a subset of links can be <b>wiretapped.</b> Existing results show that for the case of uniform <b>wiretap</b> sets (networks with equal capacity links/packets where any k can be <b>wiretapped),</b> the secrecy capacity is given by a cut-set bound if random keys are injected at the source (and decoded at the sink), {{whether or not the}} communicating users have information about the choice of <b>wiretap</b> set. In contrast, we show that for the nonuniform case, this secrecy rate is achievable for the case of known but not unknown <b>wiretap</b> set. We give achievable linear optimization-based strategies where random keys are canceled at intermediate nonsink nodes or injected at intermediate nonsource nodes. Finally, we show that determining the secrecy capacity is an NP-hard problem...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{individual}} secrecy of two-way <b>wiretap</b> channel is investigated, where two legitimate users' messages are separately guaranteed secure against an external eavesdropper. For one thing, in some communication scenarios, the joint secrecy {{is impossible to}} achieve both positive secrecy rates of two users. For another, {{the individual}} secrecy satisfies the secrecy demand of many practical communication systems. Thus, firstly, an achievable secrecy rate region is derived for the general two-way <b>wiretap</b> channel with individual secrecy. In a deterministic channel, the region with individual secrecy is shown to be larger than that with joint secrecy. Secondly, outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region are obtained for the general two-way <b>wiretap</b> channel and for two classes of special two-way <b>wiretap</b> channels. The gap between inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region is explored via the binary input two-way <b>wiretap</b> channels and the degraded Gaussian two-way <b>wiretap.</b> Most notably, the secrecy capacity regions are established for the XOR channel and the degraded Gaussian two-way <b>wiretap</b> channel. Furthermore, the secure sum-rate of the degraded Gaussian two-way <b>wiretap</b> channel under the individual secrecy constraint is demonstrated to be strictly larger than that under the joint secrecy constraint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} two-user one-eavesdropper {{discrete}} memoryless compound <b>wiretap</b> channel, where the transmitter sends a common confidential message to both users, which {{needs to be}} kept perfectly secret from the eavesdropper. We provide a new achievable secrecy rate which is shown to be potentially better than the best known lower bound for the secrecy capacity of this compound <b>wiretap</b> channel. We next consider the twouser one-eavesdropper Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) compound <b>wiretap</b> channel. We obtain an achievable secrecy rate for the Gaussian MIMO compound <b>wiretap</b> channel by using dirty-paper coding (DPC) in the achievable scheme we provided for the discrete memoryless case.

40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{discrimination}} causes the large racial disparities {{in the criminal justice}} system is a long-standing and difficult empirical question. This paper studies a decision in which the influence of race on prosecutors is directly observed: the process of obtaining judicial approval to conduct <b>wiretap</b> surveillance. The Department of Justice requires that federal prosecutors obtain its authorization before seeking judicial approval for a <b>wiretap</b> warrant, and the Department’s strict internal review of these applications implies that federal judges approve all <b>wiretap</b> applications that reach them. After the Department gives its authorization, prosecutors in most judicial districts have discretion to choose the judge who will review the application for a <b>wiretap</b> warrant. In this setting, a judge’s personal characteristics, including a judge’s race, should not influence the number of <b>wiretap</b> applications she receives.

40|$|Despite several {{works on}} secrecy coding for fading and MIMO <b>wiretap</b> {{channels}} from an error probability perspective, {{the construction of}} information theoretically secure codes over such channels remains as an open problem. In this paper, we consider a fading <b>wiretap</b> channel model where the transmitter has only partial statistical channel state information. We extend the flatness factor criterion from the Gaussian <b>wiretap</b> channel to fading and MIMO <b>wiretap</b> channels, and propose concrete lattice codes with a vanishing flatness factor to achieve information theoretic security. These codes are built from algebraic number fields with constant root discriminant for the single-antenna fading <b>wiretap</b> channel, and from division algebras centered at such number fields for the MIMO <b>wiretap</b> channel, respectively. The proposed lattice codes achieve strong secrecy and semantic security over any ergodic stationary fading/MIMO <b>wiretap</b> channel with sufficiently fast decay of time correlations, for all secrecy rates R < C_b-C_e -κ, where C_b and C_e are Bob and Eve's channel capacities respectively, and κ is an explicit constant gap.

3000|$|The <b>wiretap</b> channel {{considered}} in the seminal paper [1] is the first example that demonstrates the possibility of secure communications at the physical layer. It is shown in [1] that a source can transmit a message at a positive (secrecy) rate to a destination {{in such a way}} that an eavesdropper only gathers information at a negligible rate, when the source-to-eavesdropper channel is a degraded version of the source-to-destination channel, the source-to-eavesdropper and source-to-destination channels will hereafter be referred to as eavesdropper and destination channels, respectively. A similar result for the Gaussian <b>wiretap</b> channel is provided in [2]. The work in [3] further removes the degraded <b>wiretap</b> channel restriction showing that positive secrecy capacity is possible if the destination channel is [...] "more capable" [...] ("less noisy" [...] for a full extension of the rate region in [1]) than the eavesdropper's channel. Recently, there has been a flurry of interest in extending these early results to more sophisticated channel models, including fading <b>wiretap</b> channels, multiinput multi-output (MIMO) <b>wiretap</b> channels, multiple-access <b>wiretap</b> channels, broadcast <b>wiretap</b> channels, and relay <b>wiretap</b> channels.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{networks of}} noisy degraded <b>wiretap</b> channels {{in the presence}} of an eavesdropper.

Thus in this case there is a separation between <b>wiretap</b> channel coding on each channel and secure network coding on the resulting noiseless network.
