A three-year {{study was conducted to}} determine the impact of terminated small grain winter cover crops, which are hosts for Meloidogyne incognita, on cotton yield, root galling and nematode midseason population density. The small plot test consisted of the cover treatment as the main plots (<b>winter</b> fallow, <b>oats,</b> rye and wheat) and rate of aldicarb applied in-furrow at-plant (0, 0. 59 and 0. 84 kg a. i. /ha) as subplots in a split-plot design with eight replications, arranged in a randomized complete block design. Roots of 10 cotton plants per plot were examined at approximately 35 days after planting. Root galling was affected by aldicarb rate (9. 1, 3. 8 and 3. 4 galls/root system for 0, 0. 59 and 0. 84 kg aldicarb/ha), but not by cover crop. Soil samples were collected in mid-July and assayed for nematodes. The winter fallow plots had a lower density of M. incognita second-stage juveniles (J 2) (transformed to Log 10 (J 2 + 1) / 500 cm 3 soil) than any of the cover crops (0. 88, 1. 58, 1. 67 and 1. 75 Log 10 (J 2 + 1) / 500 cm 3 soil for <b>winter</b> fallow, <b>oats,</b> rye and wheat, respectively).

40|$|Crown rust, {{caused by}} the fungus Puccinia coronata, is a severe disease {{negatively}} impacting seed quality and yield in oat (Avena sativa). Host genetic resistance is the primary means for controlling this disease. The most extensive oat map contains nearly 2, 500 genetic markers, {{many of which are}} restriction and amplified fragment length polymorphic (RFLP or AFLP) markers. However, the use of more abundant single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers combined with diversity arrays technology (DArT) would be more advantageous for marker assisted breeding (MAB) and genome wide selection (GWS) applications due to the availability of high density genotyping technologies. The purpose of using this technology is to improve the competitiveness of oat by producing varieties with durable resistance to crown rust and desirable traits that will benefit oat growers in the U. S. Panels of winter and spring oat were evaluated for resistance to crown rust in four field environments in Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota, and North Dakota during a two-year study in 2010 and 2011. Plants representing 702 elite lines of oat were phenotyped for crown rust resistance and found to have highly diverse responses. The winter oat lines demonstrated the best crown rust resistance and are expected to yield the most QTL to be used in developing durable crown rust resistance. Heritability of crown rust resistance in this study ranged from 0. 88 to 0. 90 in spring and <b>winter</b> <b>oats,</b> respectively. Crown rust measurements were also found to be repeatable. Repeatability ranged from 0. 56 to 0. 88 at Castroville, TX in 2011 and 2010, respectively in spring oats and from 0. 79 at St. Paul, MN in 2011 to 0. 96 at Castroville, TX in 2010 in <b>winter</b> <b>oats.</b> Oat lines contributed by states along the Puccinia pathway in Texas, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin on average exhibited the best crown rust resistance as compared to other areas in the country where spring and winter oat are grown.

The experiment was carried out as a {{randomised complete block design}} with four replications, and whole forage samples were obtained at two harvest dates (June and July). For both harvest times, all intercrops increased (P < 0. 05) forage yield compared with oats, but forage crude protein content was only increased (P < 0. 05) for BAV and MIX. Compared with oats, intercropping with BAV increased (P < 0. 05) in vitro rate of gas production and total volatile fatty acid production, indicating a higher rate and extent of rumen degradation of BAV forage. In contrast, BIV forage harvested in June had lower (P < 0. 05) rate of gas production and total volatile fatty acid production than June oats, but in general no differences in the in vitro rumen fermentation were detected between oats and BIV samples harvested in July.

There were no significant differences found between the treatments for weeds, volunteers and crop yield of <b>winter</b> wheat and <b>oats.</b> These results confirm and continue the observations of the years 1999 - 2003 in the long run. Stubble tillage had no visible effect on the density of annual weeds in a diverse, 8 -year organic crop rotation with focus on cereals if a plough was used for primary tillage...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the environmental impacts}} of producing bread, as delivered to the consumer, assuming the use of Norwegian ingredients only. Ten impact categories, including global warming potential (GWP), were quantified by mixed modelling and life cycle assessment. Firstly, we quantified the impacts of growing barley, <b>oats,</b> <b>winter</b> and spring wheat on 93 farms that were representative of the main cereal production regions in Norway. We used wide system boundaries, which included all relevant processes occurring both pre-farm and on-farm. Secondly, we assessed a representative production chain for bread, including transport, milling, baking and packing processes. On-farm processes accounted for a large share of the environmental impacts attributable to the production of bread (e. g. 50 % for GWP). There is thus considerable potential for environmental improvements through changes in farm management. In total, the GWP per kg of bread (freshweight) was 0. 95 kg CO 2 -equivalent. The environmental footprint of transport was small...|$|R
40|$|The annual {{results of}} Swedish crop variety trials are {{presented}} in reports {{and on the internet}} for Sweden divided into seven regions (production areas) A-G covering southern Sweden. The yield results for test varieties are usually presented as ratios relative to the yield of a control variety. These ratios are presented per region, with the implicit assumption that differences in ratios may exist between regions. In this report, the division of agricultural districts into regions was investigated through cluster analyses. Districts that produced similar levels of yield or similar ratios were clustered into groups of similar districts. Cluster analyses were performed on regions, districts and soil types for spring barley, <b>winter</b> wheat and <b>oats,</b> based on a large data set of results from variety trials performed during the period 1997 - 2006. The study revealed that some regions, districts and soil types produce similar levels of yield or similar yield ratios. However, clusters of regions, districts or soil types that produce similar levels of yield do not always produce similar yield ratios...|$|R
