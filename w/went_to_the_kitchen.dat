2500|$|Towards evening a hawker named Gloster camped, as usual, at the station. When he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{with his}} assistant, a station hand {{told him that}} the Kellys were there, to which Gloster replied, [...] "I wish they were, it would be Â£2,000 in my pocket." [...] Kelly looked up and said, [...] "What is that you say?" [...] Gloster, without waiting to give an explanation, rushed towards the wagon, and Kelly and Joe Byrne {{followed}}. McCauley was worried for the safety of Gloster and followed them. Upon reaching his wagon, the hawker searched for his revolver, but was [...] "covered" [...] by the bushrangers, and McCauley threatened, [...] "Look out Gloster, you will be shot", at the same time appealing to Kelly not to shoot him. Gloster turned and said, [...] "Who are you?" [...] Kelly replied, [...] "I am Ned Kelly, son of Red Kelly, as good a blood as any in the land, and for two pins I would put a match to your wagon and burn it." [...] The stationhands, Gloster, and Beecroft were all placed in the storeroom, under guard. The Kellys stole new suits and a revolver from Gloster's stock as they wanted to look presentable at the bank. They offered the hawker money for them to which he refused. After sunset the hostages were allowed some fresh air. Time passed quietly until two o'clock in the morning, and at that hour the outlaws gave a peculiar whistle, and Steve Hart and Joe Byrne rushed from the building. [...] McCauley was surrounded by the bushrangers and Kelly said, [...] "You are armed, we have found a lot of ammunition in the house." [...] After this episode the outlaws retired to sleep.|$|E
60|$|We <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> in a body. Mrs. Beale was {{standing}} in front of the empty grate, making seductive cat-noises up the chimney.|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} nine o'clock. Alvina rose and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> the men {{trailing}} after her. Miss Pinnegar was not there. She was not anywhere.|$|E
5000|$|... 6.30 a.m. Aunt Marja-Liisa {{and one of}} <b>the</b> maids <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> prepare breakfast.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{thought the}} Hunter, 'The cabbage must {{have already begun}} to work.' And he said, 'I will <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and fetch it myself.' ...|$|R
60|$|When Mrs. Eastman had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> prepare dinner, Maggie Hatfield {{was startled}} by the {{appearance}} of Lawrence at the low open window of the sitting-room.|$|R
60|$|Ranse <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> at {{the rear}} of the house. Pedro, the Mexican cook, sprang up to bring the food he was keeping warm in the stove.|$|E
60|$|I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where Hopgood {{was sitting}} at the table, eating bread and cheese. He got up on seeing me, and very kindly brought me some cold bacon and a pint of ale.|$|E
6000|$|He {{emerged from}} under the sink, and they <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and {{afterwards}} upstairs. Alvina followed them persistently, but a little aloof, and silent. When the tour of inspection was almost over, she said innocently: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{and clean}} <b>the</b> silver spoons," [...] said Anne. [...] "That's a task which won't require much {{thinking}} fortunately [...] . for I COULDN'T think tonight. And {{it will pass}} the time." ...|$|R
50|$|Ralph {{comes home}} {{to prepare a}} {{surprise}} birthday for his wife Alice. What prevents Ralph from getting party food is a cat in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Ralph <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> sink <b>to</b> ask Ned Morton for help.|$|R
6000|$|... "The carrier, no doubt," [...] I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry. I {{was passing}} the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, {{the door of}} which was half open, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> when some one ran out-- ...|$|R
60|$|When Margaret {{got down}} at the ranch she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and sat by the fire. For a time she said nothing and Jardine quietly smoked his pipe. Then she looked up with a frown.|$|E
60|$|Then she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{and baked}} {{a number of}} cakes, more than Peter could have eaten in a whole month. He had not {{finished}} a quarter of them, when the dog began to howl.|$|E
60|$|The boys arose {{as quietly}} as possible, and dressing, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and {{prepared}} their morning meal of wheat cakes and a small moose steak, and coffee. They were just finishing the repast when Professor Jeffer showed himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--no--no. You {{must not}} <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> alone," [...] she said, hurriedly. [...] "There {{are two of}} them, and desperate looking wretches are they, with their faces blackened, and they have muskets. No--no--no. Come, I will {{accompany}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|This threat seemed effective. The girl, with a sour face, began eating, and {{the maid}} {{came over to}} take Josie's order. The tables were near enough for conversation, so when <b>the</b> maid had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> Josie said sweetly: ...|$|R
50|$|Halliwell is seen {{doing all}} the {{housework}} and cooking for her 'boyfriend'. She then <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> make him coffee, when really she is preparing the Girl Powder drink. Once her boyfriend drinks it, his hair becomes pink {{and he has been}} transformed into a subservient male.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Polly <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{window and}} {{surveyed}} his namesake, who was away up the garden path {{with her hands}} behind her back, and whisps of black hair in disorder about her little face, thinking, thinking profoundly, about ducklings.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vyner {{shook his}} head at both of them, and at an offer of a glass of beer looked so {{undecided}} that the captain, after an uneasy glance at the table, which did not escape Mr. Vyner, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> to procure some.|$|E
6000|$|Getting up, I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> but {{no person}} was there. Suddenly a loud knock was given {{on the door}} {{communicating}} with the second room. [...] "Oh, my friend," [...] cried Cleta's voice behind it, [...] "my ruffian of a husband has locked me in--can you let me out, do you think?" ...|$|E
50|$|Nathan and Tracy are in bed. Nathan {{gets out}} of bed and <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where he finds Mr. Linderman waiting for him. Nathan {{believes}} Linderman is a hallucination, but Linderman claims to have been sent from a higher power to warn Nathan that Tracy was in danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing 'll {{happen if}} you try to keep quite calm and do exactly as I tell you. <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and wait there until I call you. If the {{soldiers}} come in and question you, if they try to frighten you, remember that we have nothing to fear from men, and that our lives are in God's keeping." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> sisters <b>went</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> {{and sent}} <b>the</b> servant <b>to</b> finish <b>the</b> stairs.|$|R
60|$|I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Zillah was not there. I {{knocked at}} the door of her bed-room. There was no answer: the bed-room was empty when I looked in. Awkward as it would be, I found myself obliged, either to give my note to Lucilla with my own hand, or to decide on {{speaking}} to her, after all.|$|E
6000|$|I {{left him}} in the drawing room, and told Van Helsing that he had said goodbye, so the latter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> to tell the undertaker's men {{to proceed with the}} {{preparations}} and to screw up the coffin. When {{he came out of the}} room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he replied, [...] "I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!" ...|$|E
60|$|Neale {{went out}} {{in search of a}} meal and entered the first restaurant. It was merely a canvas house {{stretched}} over poles, with compartments at the back. High wooden benches served as tables, low benches as seats. The floor was sand. At one table sat a Mexican, an Irishman, and a Negro. The Irishman was drunk. The Negro came to wait on Neale, and, receiving an order, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> The Irishman sidled over to Neale.|$|E
60|$|When Mrs. Joseph <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{her eyes}} {{fell on the}} heaped-up table in the corner.|$|R
60|$|La Fleur {{was not a}} bit {{ashamed of}} herself; she chuckled as she <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|R
60|$|Having <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> {{bottle with}} milk, {{which she had}} set to warm, Miriam {{accompanied}} her guest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barn. As she walked {{by the side of}} Dora, with the bottle in one hand and the other holding up her voluminous silk robe, it was well for her peace of mind that no stately coachman sat upon a box and looked at her.|$|R
6000|$|Anne <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Hester Dethridge was at {{her usual}} {{occupation}} at that time--preparing the breakfast. The slight signs of animation which Anne had noticed in her when they last met appeared no more. The dull look was back again in her stony eyes; the lifeless torpor possessed all her movements. Asked if any thing {{had happened in the}} night, she slowly shook her stolid head, slowly made the sign with her hand which signified, [...] "Nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{head was}} light, and her brain {{confused}} with loss of sleep. When the child called her from above, and woke {{her out of}} her morning drowse, she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and begged the servant to give the little one its breakfast, saying that she was sick and wanted nothing herself. She did not say anything about Bartley's breakfast, and she would not think anything; the girl took the child into the kitchen with her, and kept it there all day.|$|E
60|$|Whereupon I {{departed}} in a {{state of}} humiliation and self-reproach I had never before known, wandering about aimlessly for a long time. When at length I arrived at home, late for supper, my mother's solicitude only served to deepen my pain. She <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> herself to see if my mince-pie were hot, and served me with her own hands. My father remained at his place {{at the head of the}} table while I tried to eat, smiling indulgently at her ministrations.|$|E
60|$|She <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> with <b>the</b> {{wine bottle}} in her hand. Her face was {{twitching}} {{in spite of}} herself.|$|R
60|$|Gilbert <b>went</b> out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> in {{response}} <b>to</b> Anne's beckoning. Anne {{shut the door}} and gave him a connubial lecture.|$|R
5000|$|Everyone recuperates at Buffy's {{while she}} {{continues}} to show her anger towards James. Buffy <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> where she finds a sign for the 1955 Sadie Hawkins dance in her pocket as James' voice whispers, [...] "I need you." [...] She heads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school where the wasps part for her to enter. Willow finds the ad and everyone rushes after Buffy, but they cannot enter the school.|$|R
