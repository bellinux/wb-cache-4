Then several things occurred: one of his friends was beaten by the Police and put to prison, he was punished by his father for not being devoted enough to the ideas of socialism, Metka got pregnant and they were again forced to move, so Sead should leave his life behind and start it anew.

On 29 April 1982, the Federal Conference of the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of Yugoslavia approved a list of ministers submitted by Planinc, and on 15 May 1982 a joint session of the National Assembly’s two houses named her head of the Federal Executive Council; thus she became prime minister. She became the first woman to occupy such a high post in the country's 64-year history. Planinc had a new governmental body, The Federal Executive Committee, and it consisted of 29 members. All of the members of this committee were new, except for five that were members of the old committee.|$|E

When I travelled with Dr. Traboulsi to Bosnia-Herzegovina, I {{thought the}} Bosnian war {{was triggered by}} ethnic hatred whereby three groups refused to co-exist in the same country. At the time, I assumed that the Serbs, Muslims, and Croats had their nationalisms subdued till the time <b>when</b> <b>Tito</b> <b>died</b> and the Bosnian war broke out. In Sarajevo, my interviews at the time revealed that people actually loved the Communist dictator, {{and as a matter}} of fact, he was commonly missed by all ethnic groups. This led me to ask the following question: how can an ethnic society love Tito and his secular regime, and in less than a decade after his death, they turned into warring ethnic factions? The purpose of my thesis is to prove that the last war (1992 - 1995) in BosniaHerzegovina was not an ethnic war; rather it was a political war between the leaders of Serbia and Croatia to maintain their position in power. In order to investigate how valid such a hypothesis is, I investigated the history of nationalist movements in Bosnia since its foundation as a sovereign entity. During that time, and up to the Bosnian war of 1992 - 1995, it was found that the majority of the Bosnians were not ethnically driven. Instead, the nationalists outside Bosnia imposed ethnicity on its people. Wars in such a scenario are a tool to impose ethnic tags on citizens in order to separate Bosnia's community by force into a three way nationalist ghettos. History reveals that Bosnia enjoyed interreligious co-existence, and ethnicity came initially from abroad, mainly from the political elites in bordering Serbia and Croatia. 1 bound copy: x, 214 leaves; ill., col. maps; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|E

At first, it seemed that operation was successful, but after few hours it was clear it was not. Due to severe damage to the arteries, which led to the interruption of blood flow and accelerated tissue devitalization of the left leg, Tito's left leg was amputated on January 20, as otherwise <b>Tito</b> would <b>die</b> of gangrene. <b>When</b> <b>Tito</b> had been told what awaited him, he resisted the operation as long as possible. At the end, after meeting with his two sons Zarko and Miso, he agreed to amputation. After the second surgery, Tito's health temporarily improved, he began rehabilitation, and on 28 January, he was transferred from the Department of cardiovascular surgery to the Department of cardiology. In the first days of February, his health was improving, so Tito could perform some of his regular presidential duties.|$|R

In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|R
