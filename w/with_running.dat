5|$|He {{was born}} in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family {{connected}} to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford him any power or responsibilities, but gradually developed a reputation for supporting many public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted <b>with</b> <b>running</b> the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.|$|E
40|$|Rocker profile shoes (rocker shoes) {{are one of}} the {{treatment}} options of metatarsalgia and forefoot stress fractures. The efficacy of rocker shoes in unloading the forefoot pressure has been shown in walking. In running, however, the effect of rocker shoes on forefoot pressure is unknown. Eighteen healthy female runners participated in this study. In-shoe plantar pressures were recorded during <b>running</b> <b>with</b> the standard <b>running</b> shoes and rocker shoes. Shoe comfort was assessed after each shoe measurement. Peak pressure (PP), maximum mean pressure (MMP) and force-time integral (FTI) were determined for seven foot areas. The effects of shoes on the different outcome variables were statistically analyzed using a linear mixed model. <b>Running</b> <b>with</b> the rocker shoes caused a significant reduction (p < 0. 001) in all pressure parameters in the central and lateral forefoot. FTI and MMP were also reduced by 11 % and 12 % in the medial forefoot while <b>running</b> <b>with</b> rocker shoes. <b>Running</b> <b>with</b> rocker shoes resulted in a significant increase in all pressure parameters at the heel region (p < 0. 001). <b>Running</b> <b>with</b> rocker shoes received a significant (p < 0. 01) lower comfort rate than <b>running</b> <b>with</b> standard <b>running</b> shoes. Rocker shoes might be beneficial for runners who are recovering from metatarsalgia or stress fractures of the forefoot region, as it reduces plantar pressure in the forefoot region.

Cast iron was used because of problems <b>with</b> <b>running</b> sand under the original stone locks.

Wonsley became the first Buccaneer running back, other than Wilder, to rush for 100 yards since Nov. 29, 1981. He was the first Tampa Bay rookie to rush for 100 yards since Jerry Eckwood in 1979. Wonsley {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} his two older brothers, George and Otis, both backup NFL running backs who came off the bench to have breakout games while leading their respective teams to victory against the Lions. Constant Buccaneer blitzes resulted in four sacks, two interceptions, and six forced fumbles. Although Lions quarterback Eric Hipple had a good statistical day, completing 31 passes for 318 yards, the Tampa Bay defense's pressure prevented him from converting his opportunities into points. The win broke Tampa Bay's 19-game road losing streak.|$|E

The brothers were given trials back at Mansfield Town, but while Rory joined Accrington Stanley, Michael returned to Barnsley on short-term deal and later had a similar contract at Derby County but never featured in either first team.

5|$|George Ivatt's 1945 {{report also}} {{recommended}} {{the removal of}} all streamlining casings and they {{were removed from the}} fitted locomotives from 1946 onwards. It had been found to be of little value at speeds below , and was unpopular <b>with</b> <b>running</b> shed employees as it caused difficulty of access for maintenance. The first step towards de-streamlining was carried out during the Second World War when many of the streamlined tenders had their side sheets cut away {{at the rear of the}} tender. Many photographs exist showing this measure. The removal of the streamlining proper commenced in April 1946 with No. 6235 City of Birmingham. All de-streamlining coincided with the fitting of smoke deflectors. No. 6243 City of Lancaster was renumbered as 46243 in April 1948 and as it was not de-streamlined until May 1949, when it became the only locomotive to carry its British Railways number while streamlined.|$|E
