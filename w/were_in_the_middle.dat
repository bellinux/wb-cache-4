5|$|Adams {{returned}} to management in April 1999 with Division Three team Brighton & Hove Albion. The club <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> {{of a financial}} crisis, which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status. His first full season as manager {{was a matter of}} consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year of}} success, the Devils <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of {{the pack}} {{for most of the}} 1995–96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He {{finished}} fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{had played}} several matches already, which was unusual as the Super Cup would {{normally}} {{have been the}} first significant match the two teams had played. Liverpool had been forced to enter the first qualifying round of the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, despite being champions. They had failed to finish in the top four during the 2004–05 FA Premier League, which would ensure Champions League qualification. UEFA granted them special dispensation to enter the competition as holders. Meanwhile, CSKA Moscow <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of their domestic season. At the time of this match they were second in the 2005 Russian Premier League, seven points behind leaders Lokomotiv Moscow.|$|E

5|$|Both {{teams were}} well into their {{respective}} domestic competitions. São Paulo's domestic season had finished {{two weeks before}} the final. They finished the 2005 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A in 11th position after 42 games, they won and lost 16 games each and drew 10. Liverpool <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of their domestic season, they were competing in the 2005–06 Premier League. They were second in the table and won their last match before the competition 2–0, against Middlesbrough. The victory meant Liverpool had gone 10 matches without conceding a goal, which equalled a club record.|$|E
5|$|Food Circus: The Food Circus was a {{food court}} in the former armory, later named the Center House, and {{recently}} renamed The Armory (2012) as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current arrangement with a stage and a large open space for dancing, events, and temporary booths, many food booths <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the room {{as well as at}} the edges. There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E

He also helped many Indonesian intellectuals, including Deliar Noer and sociologist Selo Soemardjan, obtain education in the United States. Several of Kahin's students and associates, including Herbert Feith, went on to establish similar programs at the universities where they subsequently taught.|$|E
5|$|Tulsa's offense focused heavily {{upon the}} running game; they {{finished}} ninth {{in the country}} in rushing yards (3440) and sixth {{in the country in}} rushing touchdowns (41). Tulsa had three running backs who achieved over 700 yards rushing: junior Trey Watts (959), junior Ja'Terian Douglas (857), and senior Alex Singleton (765). Singleton also led the team and the conference and ranked sixth nationally with 21 rushing touchdowns. In the passing game, junior quarterback Cody Green totaled 2592 passing yards and 17 touchdowns, both of which <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the pack nationally. Green's leading receiver was sophomore Keyarris Garrett, who amassed 67 receptions for 845 yards and 9 touchdowns, all of which led the team.|$|E

5|$|After {{signing a}} three-year contract, worth $850,000 per {{year with the}} Canucks on May 4, 2006, Bourdon earned {{a spot on the}} team's 2006–07 opening roster. He played his first NHL game on October 10, 2006 against the Minnesota Wild, but after playing nine games and scoring no points, he was sent again to the QMJHL for further development. On January 8, 2007, Bourdon was again traded in the QMJHL, with Moncton sending him to the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in {{exchange}} for Mark Barberio and a first round selection in the 2007 QMJHL draft. As a Screaming Eagle, Bourdon lost in the QMJHL semi-final against his former team, Val-d'Or. He finished the 2006–07 QMJHL season with 20 points in 36 games. When the Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs, they sent Bourdon to play five games for the Manitoba Moose, who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the AHL playoffs. He was held pointless through five AHL playoff games. Including his participation in the 2007 World Junior Championships, Bourdon played for five different teams throughout the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus {{published}} a heliocentric model {{in his work}} De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were {{on the opposite side}} of the sky from the Sun whenever they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Chapman {{averaged}} over 50 for the University {{and scored}} three centuries, although his growing reputation meant some critics {{felt he had}} underachieved. He once again played in the University match against Oxford, and for the Gentlemen against the Players, and impressed commentators. Some critics suggested he, along with other promising University players, should play for England; the Test side <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a series against Australia which was lost 3–0, {{in the course of}} which an unusually large number of players were selected. Chapman once more appeared for Berkshire in August, scoring 468 runs and taking 19 wickets. At the end of the season, he was selected by Archie MacLaren in a match at Eastbourne, playing for an all-amateur non-representative England team against the undefeated Australian touring team. In a match which became famous in later years, MacLaren's team became the first to defeat the tourists, although Chapman was not successful personally. Chapman finished the season with 954 runs at 39.75.|$|E

25|$|The {{accident}} {{caused a}} second green-white-checker {{which began with}} McMurray still leading. On lap 196, an eighth caution flag and third attempt was carried out, as Jimmie Johnson moved up, was clipped by Greg Biffle, and then smashed into the inside wall on the back straightaway. The race was then {{set up for the}} third green-white-checkered with McMurray still the leader on lap 198. At the white flag Harvick was pushing McMurray to the tri-oval. Once they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the tri-oval on the last lap, Harvick got McMurray just loose enough to turn left to get below under his car, but unlike the previous year, McMurray gave Harvick adequate room. Harvick pulled ahead and beat McMurray to the line by 11 one-thousandths (0.011) of a second over McMurray, snapping Harvick's 115 race winless streak.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of May, Kỳ's forces began to force the issue and {{gradually}} wore down the Struggle Movement as the rebel I Corps forces were worn down, despite some American objections that his aggressive attacks had the potential to cause too much collateral damage. At one stage, Kỳ's forces ended up in a skirmish with American forces, and later, the Americans <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a stand-off between the Vietnamese factions regarding a mined bridge. As Kỳ's forces took back Da Nang and Huế in street fighting, Struggle Movement supporters saw American intervention as being pro-Kỳ and anti-US riots resulted in some American buildings being burnt down.
