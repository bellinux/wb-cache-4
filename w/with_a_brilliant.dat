It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E

5|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and electropositive metal. With a standard reduction potential of −1.90V for the Th4+/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium turnings ignite and burn <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated {{with varying degrees of}} the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish in air, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.|$|E

A huge, fan-shaped cloud of what looked like black smoke rose to a great height. It was crossed and crisscrossed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> electrical display, which the people of Manila at first took for lightning.

25|$|Countess de Ficquelmont met Alexander Pushkin during fall 1829 {{and often}} {{invited him to}} her Saint Petersburg Palace. They became friends.

Even if the lady is not named, no doubt she is Countess de Ficquelmont. Ficquelmont's palace is also {{believed to be the}} frame for the old Countess' palace in Pushkin's story The Queen of Spades. Pushkin would also have depicted his own feelings for Dolly through Hermann's love for Lise. However, historian Leonid Grossman has said Pushkin only saw himself as a new Boccaccio. Indeed, the relationship between Countess de Ficquelmont and her husband was perfect.|$|E
25|$|P-38s {{were popular}} contenders {{in the air}} races from 1946 through 1949, with brightly colored Lightnings making {{screaming}} turns around the pylons at Reno and Cleveland. Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier {{was among those who}} bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make it stand out as an air racer and stunt flyer. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the Confederate Air Force, bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it White Lightnin; he reworked its turbo systems and intercoolers for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F style air intakes for better streamlining. White Lightnin was severely damaged in a crash landing during an air show demonstration and was bought, restored and repainted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> chrome finish by the company that owns Red Bull. The aircraft is now located in Austria.|$|E

25|$|Bellamy {{opened his}} {{account for the}} 2009–10 season with a goal in City's 4–2 win over Arsenal on 12 September 2009, before setting up Shaun Wright-Phillips for City's 4th goal, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> run from his own half. He {{followed}} that up a week later with two goals against Manchester United in a 4–3 derby defeat. His first was a brilliant 20-yard strike {{from the edge of}} the 18-yard box, his second came after Rio Ferdinand gifted possession to Martin Petrov, who played the ball through to Bellamy who rounded United keeper Ben Foster, to make the score 3–3 in the first minute of injury-time. The former goal was later named Goal of the Month for September 2009. After the match a fan invaded the pitch but was dealt with by stewards quickly. While the fan was being escorted from the field, TV footage showed that Bellamy slapped the fan in the face. He was given a warning by the FA about his future conduct, however Manchester City stated they would not discipline Bellamy, instead offering their support to him.|$|E
25|$|In 1902 {{he moved}} to that bastion of Toryism, The Morning Post, {{described}} {{as one of the}} 'organs of intransigence' by Stephen Koss, to work as a foreign correspondent, first in the Balkans, and then in Russia, where he was witness to the 1905 revolution in St Petersburg. He then went on to Paris, before returning to London in 1908, where the agreeable life of a man of letters <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> reputation awaited him.' In the intervening period Reginald had been published in 1904, the stories having first appeared in the Westminster Gazette, and all this time he was writing sketches for the Morning Post, the Bystander, and the Westminster Gazette. He kept a place in Mortimer Street, wrote, played bridge at the Cocoa Tree Club, and lived simply. Reginald in Russia appeared in 1910, and The Chronicles of Clovis was published in 1911, and Beasts and Super-Beasts in 1914, along with many other short stories that appeared in newspapers not published in collections in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the clinical aspects of his client's case, trying to understand what he should have done differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted they could have done more frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to pull through temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E

Alger was considered a military strategist and stood with President Lincoln on the battlefield surveying the Union supplies and while pursuing the enemy on July 8, he was severely wounded at Boonesborough, Maryland. He participated in General Sheridan's Valley Campaigns of 1864 in Virginia. On June 11, 1864, at Trevillian Station, he captured a large force of Confederates <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>brilliant</b> cavalry charge. Alger resigned from the army on September 20, 1864. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Alger for the award of the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from June 11, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 12, 1866.

Nevertheless, Benjamin faced difficulties {{that he could do}} little about. [...] The Confederacy lacked sufficient soldiers, trained officers to command them, naval and civilian ships, manufacturing capacity to make ships and many weapons, and powder for guns and cannon. [...] The Union had these things, and moved to block the South's access to European supplies, both by blockade and by buying up supplies the South might have secured. Other problems included drunkenness among the men—and their officers—and uncertainty as to when and where the expected Northern invasion would begin. Further, Benjamin had no experience of the military, or of the executive branch of the government, placing him in a poor position to contradict President Davis.|$|E
