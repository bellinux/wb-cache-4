Kissy eventually sleeps with Bond and becomes pregnant, and hopes that Bond will propose marriage after she finds {{the right time to}} tell him about her pregnancy. Bond reads scraps of newspaper and fixates on a reference to Vladivostok, making him <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> far-off city is the key to his missing memory; he tells Kissy he must travel to Russia to find out.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
25|$|Flutie {{entered the}} USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many began to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, {{as his first}} two {{professional}} passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, {{for a total of}} 174 yards, while running for 51 yards.|$|E

25|$|While {{directing}} The Outlaw, Hughes became {{fixated on}} a small flaw in one of Jane Russell's blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. Richard Fleischer, who directed His Kind of Woman with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty {{of dealing with the}} tycoon. In his book, Just Tell Me When to Cry, Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable mood swings made him <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> film would ever be completed.|$|E
25|$|Egyptologists such as Thomas Schneider, Michael Haase, and Rainer Stadelmann <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{compiler}} of the Turin Canon {{actually took}} into account that the cattle count was performed biennially {{during the first half}} of the Old Kingdom period, whilst tax collection during the 19th dynasty was held every year. In sum, all these documents would prove that Khufu ruled for at least 26 or 27 years, and possibly for over 34 years, if the inscription in the relieving chambers point to a biennial cattle count. Indeed, if the compiler of the Turin Canon did not take into account a biennial cattle count, it could even mean that Khufu ruled for 46 years.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the city}} {{administration}} has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings. As much as a third of historic Moscow has been destroyed {{in the past few}} years to make space for luxury apartments and hotels. Other historical buildings, including such landmarks as the 1930 Moskva hotel and the 1913 department store Voyentorg, have been razed and reconstructed anew, with the inevitable loss of historical value. Critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws: in the last 12 years more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down, several of those dating back to the 17th century. Some critics also <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures, which include many works by architect Konstantin Melnikov and Mayakovskaya metro station.|$|E

Lucille tries to help Leo with his appeal, but reveals crucial information to Craig, provoking a fight between Leo and Lucille ("Do it Alone"). Lucille then finds Governor Slaton at a party ("Pretty Music") and attempts to advocate for Leo. She accuses him of either being a fool or a coward if he accepts the outcome of the trial as is. Meanwhile, Tom Watson approaches Hugh Dorsey and tells him that he will support his bid for governor should he choose to make it.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to many of}} the DC Talk's other singles, the Christian message of [...] "Between You and Me" [...] – the importance of forgiveness and confession – is heavily implied, although it is not blatantly stated in terms of any specific religion. The only mention of God is featured during the breakdown of the song, which is absent in the radio edit. This removal of God from the song caused some fans of the band to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> group's record label made a [...] "conscious effort to remove any overt Christian content from the song." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 20th century, Virginia Radley {{declares}} that Reflections [...] "although not so striking in imagery {{as is the}} 'Eolian Harp,' still has much to recommend it in this respect [...] The impression left with the reader that the cottage and its surroundings are inestimably lovely, quiet, and peaceful is a paramount one, while the dead lines [...] do not move the reader at all, except to make him <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> move from Clevedon {{for the cause of}} humanity was a necessary one." [...] Richard Haven argues that the poem's image of the moral path is weak because [...] "the returned traveller can only dismiss his ascent to another mode of being as a pleasant but useless memory".|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{seize the}} {{opportunity}} presented by More, John Marshall ducked[...] [...] [...] Without questioning the soundness or propriety of Marshall's decision, {{it is worth}} noting that the Court had previously entertained criminal appeals from the district without raising any such jurisdictional problem. One might reasonably <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Court wanted to avoid a decision on the merits. By March of 1805, the repeal question had lost its political immediacy, and the impeachment strategy of the Jeffersonians had faltered. There was little to be gained in reopening the sores of the repeal battle. And Marshall may have felt that he had had his say on the critical matters of principle with his opinion in Marbury.|$|E

500|$|On 3 April, {{after days}} of {{difficult}} travel, Nansen privately began to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> pole might, after all, be out of reach. Unless the surface improved, their food would not last them to the pole {{and then on to}} Franz Josef Land. [...] The next day they calculated their position at a disappointing 86°3'; Nansen confided in his diary that: [...] "I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time." [...] After making camp on 7 April Nansen scouted ahead on snowshoes looking for a path forward, but saw only [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon". He decided that they would go no further north, and would head for Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land. Nansen recorded the latitude of their final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees (169.6 nautical miles, or 314km) beyond Greely's previous Farthest North mark.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrasting}} Miles with Peter Parker, Bendis has depicted different {{conflicts and}} anxieties for the character. Right after acquiring his superhuman abilities from a spider bite {{at the home}} of his uncle, Aaron, whom Miles admires but he does not initially know is a career criminal, Miles' father, Jefferson, explains to Miles that before Miles was born, Jefferson and Aaron were thieves who spent time in prison, and that while Jefferson reformed when he got older, Aaron has not. According to Bendis, this gives Miles cause to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> traits that lead to criminal behavior are hardwired into his DNA, leading him to question whether he is essentially a good person or not, and what his future holds for him. These issues further haunt Miles after he becomes disillusioned with Aaron, and Aaron dies from an accidental explosion triggered during a battle between the two of them, saying, [...] "You are just like me" [...] to Miles before dying.|$|E
500|$|According to Cynthia Lennon, {{when the}} group walked past the Maharishi {{on the way to}} their taxis he looked [...] "very biblical and {{isolated}} in his faith". The Maharishi reportedly said, [...] "Wait, talk to me". After leaving the ashram, the taxis kept breaking down, leading the Beatles to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Maharishi had placed a curse on them. The car that the Lennons were in suffered a flat tyre and the driver left them, apparently to find a replacement tyre, but did not return for hours. After it grew dark the Lennons hitchhiked a ride to Delhi and took the first available flight back to London, during which John drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia. The Harrisons were not ready to go home, so they travelled to other Indian cities and spent time with Ravi Shankar. Harrison said when he got dysentery he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi, but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets. Harrison later said he had never intended to stay for {{the second half of the}} course in Kashmir and that he thought Lennon wanted to get back to his relationship with Ono.|$|E

500|$|After {{ending his}} playing career for good, Motley asked Brown about a {{coaching}} {{job with the}} team. Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill – the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, {{he worked as a}} whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant. [...] "When I heard of the hiring of a new assistant, I began to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> full reason {{is whether or not the}} time is ripe to hire a Negro coach in Cleveland on the professional level," [...] he wrote. Art Modell, the Browns' owner, responded by saying the team filled its coaching positions based on ability and experience, not race. [...] "We are represented by scouts at every major Negro school. And we now have 12 Negroes signed for the 1965 season," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{criticism}} of the game was its numerous technical glitches. Adam Diamond of Isthmus was {{not happy with the}} pathfinding, writing, [...] "I often found myself traveling solo through a dungeon, my companions spread out far behind me, leaving me vulnerable to attack. What's the point of having henchmen if they're not there to protect you?". [...] Some reviews compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to , a previous Obsidian game that had received similar complaints. The bugs were described as disruptive to gameplay and [...] "downright infuriating", and one reviewer encountered a [...] "showstopper bug" [...] in the initial retail version that prevented him from playing the game past a certain point. The bugs were said to negatively affect NPC AI, camera operation, and pathfinding. One review stated [...] "The launch–to–load time is fairly long so be prepared to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> game has crashed or is loading." [...] Obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs, but later reviews still described the glitches as a serious problem. 1UP.com's review, written two weeks after the game's release, stated [...] "But the sad truth is that NWN2 shipped in a pretty messy state, and even after a couple patches (as of this writing), the biggest problems remain." ...|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager. He is remembered for helping bring about [...] "The Oriole Way", Baltimore's {{tradition}} of excellence. The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport and {{the skills needed to}} play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who kept in touch with Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was because you could learn from him, no matter how long you had been in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, only a little more than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days. Yet Ripken's example makes you <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> century, not Senior, has lost its way." [...] Since his death, no Oriole has worn Cal Sr.'s number 7, although the number has not been officially retired.|$|E
