What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century.

Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: [...] "Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum protect Charles, king of the Franks, was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.|$|E

5000|$|Lenin's 1915 article [...] "On the Slogan for a United States of Europe" [...] enlarges {{the scope}} of the idea to apply to the whole {{capitalist}} formation. The article explicitly states that [...] "uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence the victory of socialism is possible first in several or even in one capitalist country alone." [...] In Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, Lenin applied the idea of uneven development to argue that political and economic competition between advanced capitalist states inevitably occasions hegemonic transitions, or changes in the <b>world</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of dominant and subdominant states. This was an early Marxist antecedent to the later developed power transition and hegemonic stability theories. As stated by Lenin:the only conceivable basis under capitalism for the division of spheres of influence, interests, colonies, etc., is a calculation of the strength of those participating, their general economic, financial, military strength, etc. And the strength of these participants in the division does not change to an equal degree, for the even development of different undertakings, trusts, branches of industry, or countries is impossible under capitalism. Half a century ago Germany was a miserable, insignificant country, if her capitalist strength is compared with that of the Britain of that time; Japan compared with Russia in the same way. Is it [...] "conceivable" [...] that in ten or twenty years' time the relative strength of the imperialist powers will have remained unchanged? It is out of the question.In the 1920s and 1930s, Trotsky increasingly generalised the concept of uneven and combined development to the whole of human history, and even to processes of evolutionary biology, as well as the formation of the human personality - as a general dialectical category.|$|E

40|$|In many {{peripheral}} countries, remittances {{are becoming}} {{an extremely important}} source of external financial flows. In spite of their several desirable effects (e. g. structural growth, stability over time, direct positive impact on poor and middle-income families, etc.), remittances are hardly used for investment and productive purposes; rather they tend to prompt temporary consumption and even imports, exacerbating the trade deficit. In this paper, it is investigated how Microcredit Financial Institutions (MFIs) could connect to remittances flows, so as to boost self-reliance and entrepreneurship, thereby contributing to poverty reduction and widely shared economic growth. A policy trying to channel remittances to microcredit is evaluated {{in terms of its}} differentiated appeal for different kinds of migrants. A world-wide analysis of remittances and microcredit diffusion is mapped into a graph of the hierarchical structure of the world, based on previous original works on core, peripheral, semi-peripheral, and independent countries. The results show that remittances significantly deviate from the pattern of both trade revenues and foreign direct investments. Remittances are shaking the world structure by arriving where the others do not. Quite similarly, the number of MFIs is higher the lower the ranking in the <b>world</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> In particular, the exceptional position of Bangladesh in both remittances and microcredit is paralleled by its almost unique position in the <b>world</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> In microeconomic terms, remittances are characterized by asymmetric information and moral hazard, which reduces their amount and the share sent through official channels. MFIs could boost overall remittances and take a share in them by offering innovative quadrilateral relations to remittance sender, remittance receiver, micro-loan borrower. Indeed, there is a high level of compatibility between microcredit and remittances mechanisms in terms of the people involved, the centrality of private initiative, the dimension of the transaction, the time horizon. In particular, there exists a small but growing sub-group of emigrants that could devote significant sums to fund MFIs in the perspective of receiving back the capital with interests when they come back (or go) to the developing country. The legal, risk-bound, competitor-driven problems of the proposed mechanism of connection are given remedies and an outline of time-path for implementation. In macroeconomic terms, the wider and more flexible aggregate supply due to the private entrepreneurial activities funded by MFIs would increase the potential GDP and would improve the working of the Keynesian multiplier triggered by remittances, thus reducing inflationary tensions and trade unbalances. A more equilibrated and fairer growth path can then be attained. The countries where this proposed policy has the largest potential for success might include not only India, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka but also Ethiopia, Nigeria and the Philippines. Among the countries dominated by Germany, Egypt, Morocco, Viet Nam, Colombia and Mexico are particularly well placed to grasp this opportunity, especially if an adequate assistance is offered to them...|$|E

Stratification itself may mean, however, both the remedy, but also the demise of systems, by exacerbating social inequalities. The database includes the evolution of gross domestic product per capita for different time frames at European level and worldwide. The main methods employed in processing database are the indices method and expectation values of position (quartile values) used to assess the structure of Europe and world countries according to the size of the gross domestic product. In Europe, for a century, stratification has increased visibly. If in 1913, the richest country in Europe achieved a GDP per capita of 3. 94 times higher compared to the poorest country, in 2013 the ratio is 13. 82 to one. The status of key statistical indicators that characterize the polarization of the world by size of gross domestic product, demonstrates that stratification is less pronounced inside continents, becoming however severe, worldwide. In this regard, it is alarming that in 1994, 75 % of world countries were making only 7 % of the GDP per capita in the richest country (Monaco). Given that information has now become increasingly more fluid, one can include among beneficiaries, the least developed countries. Circulation of information is, however, under the command of polarizing forces, belonging to the same great powers of the world.

40|$|For {{most of the}} Twentieth Century, East Asia {{was among}} the least {{urbanized}} parts of the world; {{now it is a}} region where cities are growing the most rapidly and becoming increasingly important centers regionally {{and in terms of the}} global urban hierarchy. Tokyo is unquestionably a key "global city," with Hong Kong probably following not far behind, and Seoul and Taipei also moving up in the world city ranks as crucial national articulates of highly successful newly industrialized countries (NICS). At the other end of the spectrum, the teeming cities of the poor in southeast Asia seem to epitomize the appellation of Third World megacities. All the urban churning and foment that accompanies these dramatic transformations raise many questions. The very diversity of development trajectories and urban forms, functions and dynamics in the region is a caution against facile and premature attempts at generalization. But sensitivity to historical and cultural nuances and appreciation for variation also should not force social scientists to abandon a search for some comprehensive conceptual framework to understand the global dynamics of urbanization and (under) development. This paper approaches this problems sensitized to the theoretical notion of global cities, worlds cities, and global urban hierarchies. These terms are only theoretically meaningful (and empirically useful) if we think about cities in global urban networks and in the context of their places in the larger structure of the world-system. After laying out a conceptual framework, we provide some preliminary ideas about how East Asian urban patterns–and particular cities–might fit into the schema. Extending the conventional discourse of global city analysis, the discussion l also focuses on those swelling metropolises in southeast Asia that are at the bottom of the <b>world</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> and suggests that perhaps we need to return to old debates about dependent/peripheral cities and the relationship between urbanization and underdevelopment. Mindful that oversimplified images that flatten the diversity of urban trajectories in different countries and regions are unhelpful, we call for a more theoretically informed sociological analysis of comparative urban patterns and processes...|$|E
40|$|No processo escolar de formação de leitores e escritores há um movimento ativo do sujeito com o texto, sendo o {{professor}} interlocutor e mediador desse processo. A presente pesquisa pôde verificar como a legitimação do conhecimento de mundo de sujeitos jovens e adultos com pouca ou nenhuma escolarização, em sala de aula, possibilitou o autorreconhecimento da condição de cada um como leitores e escritores. Para chegar a esse achado, investiguei práticas de leitura e escrita em uma classe de educação de jovens e adultos (EJA), buscando relacioná-las aos usos cotidianos da leitura e da escrita na vida dos sujeitos dessa classe. Busquei auxílio em contribuições teóricas de autores do campo da EJA, e de outros, cujos estudos são referência na área da leitura e da escrita e da formação de leitores e escritores, do mesmo modo que fui auxiliada na compreensão de como me valer de procedimentos metodológicos, para melhor capturar as revelações da prática pedagógica, durante o período de observação empreendido na classe. A abordagem teórico-metodológica adotada, de natureza qualitativa, contou com observações sistemáticas e instrumentos como o diário de campo, entrevistas semiestruturadas e uma ficha perfil dos sujeitos da pesquisa. Dispondo desses diversos recursos, pude perceber o processo de formação de leitores e escritores em uma turma já alfabetizada do Programa de Educação de Jovens e Adultos (PEJA) do município do Rio de Janeiro. Como reflexão final de meu estudo, arrisco afirmar que as práticas pedagógicas de leitura e escrita propostas pela professora na turma investigada rompiam com a lógica abissal (como nomeada por SANTOS, 2009), uma vez que as atividades levavam em conta a realidade e os conhecimentos dos sujeitos, não se restringindo a saberes escolares, considerados pela lógica hegemônica de hierarquia de mundo, como os únicos válidos. Outras questões, entretanto, nessas práticas de leitura e escrita puderam ser questionadas, como o fato de as atividades serem individuais, em maioria, apesar dos debates permanentes realizados no coletivo. Também o diálogo prioritariamente se dava entre professora e alunos, e não entre pares, o que restringia a horizontalidade da interlocução entre sujeitos. Por fim, reflexiono quanto à lógica escolar de organização do Programa, em que os avanços na aprendizagem têm sequência serial, o que põe em cheque concepções de continuum na EJA e, em última instância, do direito a aprender por toda a vida. It is {{well known}} that there is an active movement of the subject towards the text, involving the training of readers and writers in school, the teacher being both interlocutor and mediator in the process. Through this investigation, it was possible to demonstrate how the knowledge of the world brought to the classroom by young and adult learners with little or no schooling is legitimized, enabling them to acknowledge their status as readers and writers. To take hold of this finding, a research in reading and writing practices in a youth and adult education classroom (EJA) was carried out, with the purpose of relating them to the practices of reading and writing in those learners daily lives. I have resorted to theoretical contributions from reference studies in reading and writing acquisition and also in the training of readers and writers, that were produced by authors in the field of EJA as well as other areas. Classroom observation also helped us to develop {{a better understanding of the}} importance of resorting to methodological procedures as a means to grasp the revelations of the pedagogical practice. The theoretical-methodological approach adopted is of a qualitative kind. It made use of instruments such as a field diary, semi-structured interviews and a profile card, i. e., a card meant to register each subjects profile, besides systematic observation. These instruments were useful to prompt us to perceive what was going on in the readers and writers education process inside a classroom which integrated the Youth and Adult Education Program (PEJA) in that particular municipality of the State of Rio de Janeiro. I dare say that the reading and writing teaching practices proposed by the teacher in the classroom under investigation represented a break from abyssal logic (as nominated in Santos 2009), since the activities carried out took into account the learners life conditions and their own knowledge, not restricting themselves to the school selection of contents, which are looked at by the hegemonic logic in the <b>world</b> <b>hierarchy</b> as the only legitimate knowledge. Nevertheless, other issues related those reading and writing teaching practices could be questioned. One of them is the fact that most of the activities were done individually, although debates were conducted permanently with the participation of the whole group. Furthermore, the dialogues involved primarily teacher and students, instead of students and their peers. This practice limited the horizontal interaction among subjects. Finally, I think that the organization of the Program was inspired in the school logic, which requires that the learning process advances along a serial sequence, thus questioning the concept of continuum maintained by EJA and, ultimately, the students right to lifelong education...|$|E
40|$|I {{presented}} {{my paper}} on Tuesday, July 3, {{in the section}} “Other Horizons”, which dealt with organizing in more flattened ways. 				 The conference {{as a whole was}} focused on trying to rethink how we might reformulate a critical analysis of capitalism and how the way we organize reinforces capitalism. There were some interesting analyses of capitalism, and capitalist ways of organizing, but no answers to either a different economy, or how we might organize differently in this different economy. Every conference I’ve been at {{in the last ten years}} seems to be struggling with the same problem: without being able to redefine the kind of economy we want, we seem unable to redefine the kind of organizing which would bring that about, or exemplify the kind of economic organization we want in our larger society. What seems to be the most promising critique remains the analysis which focuses most precisely on fairness in organizing. The best paper, ‘Back to the future for diversity: A manifesto for less modesty, more bravado”, I attended focused on the point that by being fair, we bring about a more fair society, since how we organize is a way of divvying up the spoils. With Susan Harwood,the author, I intend to discuss setting up a stream at the next Gender Work and Organization conference in 2009, to examine how we might organize in less hierarchical ways. It’s impossible to understand how to organize cooperatively without focusing on ‘sexual difference’, the French philosopher Luce Irigaray’s category for what has not yet been thought within our symbolic structures, but which we must think if we are to confront how patriarchy and hierarchy mutually reinforce each other. An absence of attention to sexual difference in favour of a belief that both women and men can occupy the place of the sexually indifferent individual despite the presence of patriarchy, a belief which maintains that symbolically women are the same as men and experience the processes of organizing in exactly the same way, obscures rather than clarifies how we as women and men might organize in participatory, contiguous or side by side ways to get things done. Without confronting this ruse of the [masculine] neutral, or the rhetoric of the individual without a sex who is in reality male, without ensuring that cooperation means the contiguous organizing of sexual difference next to sexual difference, the female subject next to the male subject who equally act on and define the <b>world,</b> <b>hierarchy</b> inevitably reasserts itself, and cooperation, with its emphasis on the full participation of equals and the equal involvement of all, is subverted. Given my focus on these symbolic categories of [sexually indifferent] sameness and [sexual] difference as they underlie our assumptions about how we can achieve the egalitarian workplace, what interested me in my study of five worker cooperatives in Buenos Aires in May 2006 were two inextricably intertwined questions concerning how organizing cooperatively could be achieved in the face of hierarchy and patriarchy. First, how comprehensively did the men and women workers think about hierarchy in all its manifestations? What did they mean organizationally when they talked about equality and workers as equals, as ‘more than workers, less than bosses’? How did the women and men working in these cooperatives struggle to embody in their organizing processes and strategies the ethos of cooperation—learned as they said ‘in the tent’ [...] among and between equals who were not the same, who were different, and who experienced the processes of organizing differently? As the workers often proudly informed me, these were worker coops where all decision makers were elected and everyone was paid the same. It wasn’t only the ‘one member, one vote’ enshrined in the general assemblies and in the elections of coordinators, but that ‘we are all members of the cooperative’: all jobs were equally necessary, all were equally valuable, and therefore all were worthy of being paid the same. But elected general assemblies and coordinators and equal pay for all jobs were only part of how worker cooperatives struggled to interpret what cooperation meant in practice. Secondly, how did the workers confront how patriarchy circulates in these ostensibly egalitarian ways of organizing, where everybody was treated the same, everyone could be elected to positions of authority, everyone was paid the same? More specifically, how did the worker coops deal with [sexual] difference, that women and men are not substitutable [...] that they are equals who are different, and who experience differently the processes of organizing? How did the coops deal with this unacknowledged maleness of the supposedly sexually neutral or sexually indifferent individual, what Irigaray calls the unacknowledged reign of the masculine neutral, which must be confronted if cooperative organizing, with its emphasis on full participation, full involvement, is to succeed? How did the women and men challenge not only the hierarchy which cooperative organizing seeks to dismantle, but the patriarchal privilege that circulates simultaneously in our organizing processes, and which, unless confronted, inevitably reconstitutes hierarchical modes of organizing? These are the questions which will guide this study. Academic & Professional Development Fund (A&PDF...|$|E
