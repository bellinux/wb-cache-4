30|$|The Declaration of Helsinki {{was adopted}} by the 18 th <b>World</b> <b>Medical</b> Association General <b>Assembly</b> in 1964 and {{recently}} amended in 2013 [5]. It states the “Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects”, including protecting the life, health and privacy of all patients or healthy subjects, guaranteeing voluntary and informed participation, and requesting an external ethical review of the research projects and the appropriate registration of clinical trials in a public database in order to minimize the risk of selective reporting of results and to avoid unnecessary duplication of research projects. According to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), registration is mandatory for all prospective studies, comparative or not, that expose the subjects to a health-related intervention (i.e. surgical procedure or drug administration) and evaluate its outcome. The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) [6] lists the registries that have been tested and approved by the World Health Organization and accepted by the ICMJE. ClinicalTrials.gov is equally accepted as a data provider to ICTRP.|$|R
40|$|On 5 August 1968, {{publication}} of the Harvard Committee's report {{on the subject of}} “irreversible coma” established a standard for diagnosing death on neurological grounds. On the same day, the 22 nd <b>World</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Assembly</b> met in Sydney, Australia, and announced the Declaration of Sydney, a pronouncement on death, which is less often quoted because it was overshadowed by the impact of the Harvard Report. To put those events into present‐day perspective, the authors reviewed all papers published on this subject and the World Medical Association web page and documents, and corresponded with Dr A G Romualdez, the son of Dr A Z Romualdez. There was vast neurological expertise among some of the Harvard Committee members, leading to a comprehensible and practical clinical description of the brain death syndrome and the way to diagnose it. This landmark account had a global medical and social impact on the issue of human death, which simultaneously lessened reception of the Declaration of Sydney. Nonetheless, the Declaration of Sydney faced the main conceptual and philosophical issues on human death in a bold and forthright manner. This statement differentiated the meaning of death at the cellular and tissue levels from the death of the person. This was a pioneering view on the discussion of human death, published as early as in 1968, that should be recognised by current and future generations...|$|E
40|$|Ethical {{principles}} {{for research in}} human beings were discussed 43 {{years ago in the}} <b>World</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Assembly</b> and they were written down into a document, known since then as the Helsinki Declaration. With their initiative and revisions, it was considered that research has taken a big step in the protection of human beings who are participate in clinical trials which are essentials in the generation of knowledge about health and disease. These principles were defined in the Belmont Report: Autonomy, respect, and beneficence. Thirty years after the Helsinki Declaration, new critics to human research originate in the society due to embarrassing episodes like data distortion in large clinical trials 1, confirming the need to register protocols in public databases before starting any research in humans 2. Hidden data about adverse drug reactions, the unfavorable results for sponsors of unpublished research, unauthorized protocol modifications by researchers without ethical committees consent, and the duplication of papers obtained by the same researchers are examples of unethical attitudes of researchers and sponsors. Medical journals cannot publish the results of all submitted research, and there is a trend towards the publication of papers with positive results 3. Excluding unpublished research in meta-analyses could affect the benefits of any intervention from a reduction of 28 % to an increment of 24 % 4. This incident affects scientific evidence, puts the patients at risks, and is disapointing to all the volunteers in clinical trials with the conviction to serve the humanity. Additionally, ethical committees approve research proposals and regulate their progress, but they cannot control the publication of their results. In these circumstances, the registry of clinical trials protocols has been promoted as well as their results in public databases, which could be used to verify objectives, avoid duplicate clinical experiments and be adopted for systematic reviews, even if the results are not published. The critics to these systems are diverse and valid in some circumstances; however, their results will depend on the joint efforts of each {{of the participants in the}} research processes. The ethical committees must promote and request this registry at the time of protocol approval; the regulatory entities must demand it in the case of solicitation for approval of a new drug or medical equipment; and the editors at the time of article submission to scientific journals. The editors of the journals affiliated to the International Committee of Medical Journals Editors (ICMJE) declared their demand of trial registration, which makes the assumption that this tendency will be universal. There are various sites to make this registry, each one with different grades of development. Among those are recognized www. clinicaltrials. gov sponsored by the United States National Library of Medicine, www. controlled-trials. com sponsored by Biomed Central Limited in Europe, and in Latin America www. latinrec. org hosted by the International Clinical Epidemiological Network (INCLEN), Universidad Javeriana from Colombia, and the Instituto de Investigaciones de la Clínica Reina Sofía with the support of the Centro Iberoamericano de la Colaboración Cochrane. Colombia Médica, as a member of the ICMJE, will request clinical trial proof of registration in at least one public database of the protocol approved by ethical committees on or after June 1 2006 as a requisite to start the editorial process of submitted manuscripts. The Ottawa Declaration could be used to review the principles of clinical trials registry and to verify if the proposed protocol needs to be listed in public records 6. It is hoped that these efforts will mean the transparency of scientific research deserved by the society. In personal terms, we hope to find less «Instead of» kind of research, which means: results with minimal transcendence are published instead of the unaccomplished principal outcome...|$|E
40|$|U 20. stoljeću Avedis Donabedian, utemeljitelj znanosti o kvaliteti medicinske skrbi, definirao je pojam kvalitete medicinske skrbi, uveo čimbenike usporedbe, preporučio određivanje standarda kvalitete i pokazatelja (indikatora) kvalitete na razini ustroja, provedbe i ishoda skrbi. Počeci akreditacije datiraju iz 1913. godine osnivanjem American College of Surgeons sa svrhom promoviranja koncepta bolničkih standarda; 50. -ih godina prošlog stoljeća osnovana je International Commision on Accreditation of Health Care Organization (JCAHO). Zatim je slijedilo razvijanje kanadskog akreditacijskog sustava (Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation - CCHSA), danas poznatog kao Accreditation Canada, australskog (Australian Council on Healthcare Standards International - ACHSI), da bi 80 -tih i 90 -tih godina započeo intenzivniji razvoj akreditacijskih sustava u Europi i svijetu. Proces procjene zdravstvenih tehnologija započeo je prije 30 -tak godina u Americi, a u Europi 1980. godine osnutkom prve nacionalne HTA agencije u Švedskoj. Agencija za kvalitetu i akreditaciju u zdravstvu, kao javna, neovisna i neprofitna ustanova osnovana je 2007. godine temeljem Zakona o kvaliteti zdravstvene zaštite kojim je i definirana njena uloga u procesu praćenja kvalitete zdravstvene zaštite, akreditacije nositelja zdravstvene djelatnosti, te postupku provođenja procjene zdravstvenih tehnologija u Republici Hrvatskoj. Cilj je ovoga rada dati pregled dosadašnjih aktivnosti Agencije od ljeta 2009. godine, kao i budućih aktivnosti na navedenim područjima, ukazati na potrebu edukacije osnovnih korisnika i dionika u navedenim procesima te prikazati međunarodnu suradnju i aktivno sudjelovanje u europskim projektima. Avedis Donabedian {{defined the}} quality of care as the kind of care, which is {{expected}} to maximize an inclusive measure of patient welfare, after taking into account the balance of expected gains and losses associated with the process of care in all its segments. According to the <b>World</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Assembly,</b> physicians and health care institutions have an ethical and professional obligation to strive for continuous quality improvement of services and patient safety with the ultimate goal to improve both individual patient outcomes as well as population health. Health technology assessment (HTA) is a multidisciplinary process that summarizes information about the medical, social, economic and ethical issues related to the use of a health technology in a systematic, transparent, unbiased, robust manner, with the aim to formulate safe and effective health policies that are patient focused and seek to achieve the highest value. The Agency for Quality and Accreditation in Health was established in 2007 as a legal, public, independent, nonprofit institution under the Act on Quality of Health Care. The Agency has three departments: Department of Quality and Education, Department of Accreditation, and Department of Development, Research, and Health Technology Assessment. According to the Act, the Agency should provide the procedure of granting, renewal and cancellation of accreditation of healthcare providers; proposing to the Minister, in cooperation with professional associations, the plan and program for healthcare quality assurance, improvement, promotion and monitoring; proposing the healthcare quality standards as well as the accreditation standards to the Minister; keeping a register of accreditations and providing a database related to accreditation, healthcare quality improvement, and education; providing education in the field of healthcare quality assurance, improvement and promotion; providing the HTA procedure and HTA database, supervising the healthcare insurance standards, and providing other services in the field of healthcare quality assurance, improvement, promotion and monitoring, according to the Act. Formal activities of the Agency in the field of HTA actually began in summer 2009. In the field of quality and accreditation, the plan and program of healthcare quality assurance, improvement, promotion and monitoring was finished and published in October 2010; preparation of the healthcare quality standards as well as the accreditation standards is still in process, with the aim to start accreditation process at 10 hospitals in 2011. Education in the field of healthcare quality assurance, improvement and promotion has been established as a continuous process from the beginning. The Agency is member of the International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua) and participates {{in the work of the}} European Accreditation Network (EAN). In the field of HTA, the Agency has established international collaboration and support, which resulted in its appointment and participation in the European network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) Joint Action Project as a EUnetHTA Partner, as well as its membership in the international society, HTAi. TAIEX project has been approved as a two-day workshop in December 2010. The Croatian HTA Guidelines have been issued with the aim to start the HTA process and reports that should serve as recommendations, as a support to policy-makers at the national level, in particular the Croatian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and Croatian Institute of Health Insurance, in making evidence-informed decisions on the strategic planning, investment, management and implementation of technologies in health care, on funding (reimbursement) and coverage of health technologies, and at hospital level on the request from hospital directors and policy teams. In conclusion, establishment of all these measures in Croatia is by no means an easy and quick process, however, we do believe that it is feasible through continuous and close collaboration of all those involved...|$|E
