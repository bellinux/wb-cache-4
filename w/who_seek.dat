5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe.

Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it.
