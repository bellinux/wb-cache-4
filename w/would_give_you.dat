[...] <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the best in the house. You ought to go, to see how happy the human race can be. It is a fine, rich valley, about thirty miles from Port Platte; heavily timbered with mahogany all round; well watered; flowers so beautiful; fruits in abundance, so delicious that you could not refrain from stopping to eat, till you could eat no more. My sons have laid out good roads, and built bridges and mills; the people are improving, and everything is prosperous.|$|E
500|$|The new Madness song [...] "NW5" [...] (then still titled [...] "NW5 (I <b>Would</b> <b>Give</b> <b>You</b> Everything)") and a re-recorded {{version of}} [...] "It Must Be Love" [...] were {{featured}} in the German film Neues vom Wixxer in. The two songs were released in Germany as a double A-Side, {{and both of them}} were turned into music, which – besides members of the film's cast – featured Suggs, Chas Smash, Woody and stand-in guitarist Burdette. A re-recorded version of [...] "NW5" [...] was released as a single on 14 January 2008 in the UK reaching no. 24 – this recording featured original Madness guitarist Chris Foreman, who had rejoined the band in time for the 2006 Christmas tour, but had not participated in the original recording of the song.|$|E
500|$|Mills' {{management}} style {{was influenced by}} a number of managers he played under, including John Barnwell, Brian Clough, Alan Hinton, Howard Kendall, Brian Little, David Pleat, Russell Slade and Neil Warnock. He learned simplicity from Clough, saying: [...] "He never did complicate anything. Football is a simple game and Cloughie was no coach, he didn't confuse us with sessions straight out of the manual". Like Clough, Mills has been praised for his man management skills and Daren Fulford, his reserve-team manager at Tamworth, said: [...] "If he felt you had made a mistake, he <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a rollicking but if he was pleased with you he would always give kind words". Fulford also commented on Mills' thoroughness, saying he wanted information on each players' performances after the reserves played.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence Taylor was {{the second}} of three sons born to Clarence and Iris Taylor in Williamsburg, Virginia. His father worked as a {{dispatcher}} at the Newport News shipyards, while {{his mother was a}} schoolteacher. Referred to as Lonnie by his family, Taylor was a mischievous youth. His mother said that [...] "e was a challenging child. Where the other two boys would ask for permission to do stuff, Lonnie...would just do it, and when you found out about it, he <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a big story." [...] Taylor concentrated on baseball as a youth, in which he played the position of catcher, and only began playing football at the advanced age of fifteen. He did not play organized high school football until the following year (eleventh grade), and was not heavily recruited coming out of high school.|$|E
500|$|The track {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Ken Barnes of USA Today described the song {{as being a}} [...] "hopelessly sappy ballad oozing with fuzzy sentiments. I'd say it's more like caterpillars." [...] Frank Kogan of The Village Voice, citing the lyrics, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> anything baby, just make my dreams come true/Oh baby you give me butterflies" [...] wrote [...] "so, would he give her, like, caterpillars in exchange? birds?" [...] and added that what grabs his attention about a song like [...] "Butterflies" [...] is not the [...] "melody but the weirdly ringing wrench-against-faucet clang on the backbeat." [...] Christie Leo of the New Straits Times gave the track a more positive review, calling the song a [...] "luxuriant" [...] ballad. Pop music critic Robert Hilburn, writing for the Los Angeles Times, described [...] "Butterflies", and another song from Invincible ("Speechless"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". A journalist of the same publication felt that track was about romantic [...] "jitters".|$|E
500|$|Although {{they never}} {{finished}} below third place from 1952 through 1960, the [...] "Go-Go White Sox" [...] were a team which thrived on speed, defense and pitching rather than hitting, and Pierce struggled for offensive support throughout {{his time with}} the club. Both Richards and Lopez – who became Chicago's manager in 1957 – placed a low emphasis on offense, with Lopez expressing his philosophy that [...] "all a team really needed was pitching and defense, because if you didn't allow the other team to score, eventually they <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a run, and you'd win the game." [...] Nellie Fox, who was also Pierce's roommate, turned to him on one occasion when the White Sox picked up a run following a scoring drought and said, [...] "Here's your run. Now {{go out there and}} hold it." [...] Although AL teams averaged 4.46 runs per game from 1949 through 1961, and the White Sox averaged 4.53 runs in games started by their other pitchers, they averaged only 4.20 runs in Pierce's starts – a figure which drops to 4.07 if the two-month scoring outburst in 1956 is discounted; in over two thirds of his losses with Chicago (105 of 152), and fully one third of his starts (130 of 390), they scored two or fewer runs. They averaged 3.7 runs in his 1953 starts, and 3.6 runs in his 1955 starts; even in 1959, when the pennant-winning White Sox averaged 4.29 runs per game, they averaged only 3.36 runs in Pierce's starts. By 1955 it was regularly noted that Chicago's offensive struggles were placing undue pressure on the pitching staff, wearing them out with [...] "one tense game after another, never having a comfortable margin that might permit a little breather now and then"; Pierce was described as [...] "the unluckiest pitcher in the majors" [...] that year {{due to the lack of}} scoring. But in contrast, when he had a reasonable level of offensive backing he was far more successful, posting a record of 30–11 when Chicago scored four runs and 99–10 when they scored five or more; from September 1951 through May 1958, he was 71–6 when they scored at least four runs and 55–1 when they scored at least five.|$|E

2500|$|To {{time the}} drop, Norden used an idea already in use on other bombsights, the [...] "equal distance" [...] concept. This {{was based on}} the {{observation}} that the time needed to travel a certain distance over the ground would remain relatively constant during the bomb run, as the wind would not be expected to change dramatically over a short period of time. If you could accurately mark out a distance on the ground, or in practice, an angle in the sky, timing the passage over that distance <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> all the information needed to time the drop.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the loss}} {{of many of his}} {{defenders}} in Rome because of Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Galileo was ordered to stand trial on suspicion of heresy in 1633, [...] "for holding as true the false doctrine taught by some that the sun is the center of the world", against the 1616 condemnation, since [...] "it was decided at the Holy Congregation [...] on 25 Feb 1616 that [...] the Holy Office <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> an injunction to abandon this doctrine, not to teach it to others, not to defend it, and not to treat of it; and that if you did not acquiesce in this injunction, you should be imprisoned".|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Liverpool manager George Kay in January 1951 due to health reasons, Hodgson was among the hopefuls who were interviewed for the manager's job at Anfield. [...] Don Welsh was eventually appointed, while Hodgson was admitted to hospital {{a couple of months}} later but his [...] "throat complaint" [...] was deemed inoperable. [...] He returned to his home in Burslem after a month in hospital and a few days later, with a promising managerial career still in its infancy, he died of cancer on 14 June 1951, at the age of just 47. [...] Port Vale legend Roy Sproson had Hodgson as his first boss: [...] "Gordon Hodgson was a fair chap. [...] He <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a rollicking one minute and then it would be forgotten. [...] Everybody liked him and his loss was so sad." [...] His benefit match was held against Port Vale's local rivals Stoke City on 1 October 1951, Vale lost the game 2–1. [...] £383 was raised for his dependants.|$|E
