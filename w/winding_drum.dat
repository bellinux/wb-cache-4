2500|$|A {{distinct}} form of traction engine, characterised by {{the provision}} of a large diameter <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> driven by separate gearing from the steam engine. [...] Onto the drum a long length of wire rope was wound, which was used to haul an implement, such as a plough, across a field, while the engine remained on the headland. This minimized the area of land subject to soil compaction.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> {{was either}} mounted {{horizontally}} (below the boiler), vertically (to one side), or even concentrically, {{so that it}} encircled the boiler. [...] The majority were underslung (horizontal), however, and necessitated {{the use of an}} extra-long boiler to allow enough space for the drum to fit between the front and back wheels. [...] These designs were the largest and longest traction engines to be built.|$|E
2500|$|In 1875, the Drainage Commissioners spent £294 on a flash lock, {{which had}} a {{flagstone}} floor, a chamber constructed of white bricks, a timber guillotine gate, and a mechanism for raising the gate made from cast-iron, supported by a timber frame. The chamber was [...] wide, and the mechanism included a <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> with winding wheel, and cogwheels with ratchets. The timber frame was demolished in 1968 but the chamber still survives, some [...] upstream from the entrance gates.|$|E

2500|$|... 5 August 1976: First {{and only}} major breakdown. The air brake speed {{regulator}} of the chiming mechanism broke from torsional fatigue {{after more than}} 100 years of use, causing the fully wound 4-ton weight to spin the <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> out of the movement, causing much damage. The Great Clock was shut down {{for a total of}} 26 days over nine months– it was reactivated on 9 May 1977. This was the longest break in operation since its construction. During this time BBC Radio 4 broadcast the pips instead. Although there were minor stoppages from 1977 to 2002, when maintenance of the clock was carried out by the old firm of clockmakers Thwaites & Reed, these were often repaired within the permitted two-hour downtime and not recorded as stoppages. Before 1970, maintenance was carried out by the original firm of Dents; since 2002, by parliamentary staff.|$|E
2500|$|The scotch {{turbines}} produced (for example, on Plane 2 West) 235 horsepower using a 45-foot head {{of water}} and had a discharge rate of 1,000 cubic feet per minute. The <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> was 12 feet in diameter, and had a spiral grove of 3 inch pitch. The rope was fastened on both ends to the drum, {{and there was a}} clutch which allowed reversing the direction of the wheel. The plane had 2 lines of steel rails, with a [...] "gauge" [...] of 12 foot 4½ inches from center of rail to center. Rails were 3⅛ inches wide at top, 3½ inches high, and weighed 76lbs/yard. [...] Also, the cradles had a brake, if things went downhill too fast, as well as the plane-man who would put about ½ the amount of full power through the turbine, so that the boat would not go down too fast. The water was fed into the turbines from below, thus relieving friction on the bearings and balancing them. Some turbines were also reported to develop 704 horsepower.|$|E
50|$|In {{operation}} {{an empty}} boat would be {{loaded into the}} bottom cradle and a full boat would be loaded into the top cradle. A rope would {{be attached to the}} loaded top cradle and it would be drawn out of the water {{to the top of the}} incline using a small <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> driven by a steam engine. The main incline rope would then be attached to the cradle and the loaded boat would descend the incline, counterbalanced by an empty boat ascending on the other rail line. The speed would be controlled by a brake on the main <b>winding</b> <b>drum.</b> On reaching the summit a rope from the small <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> would be attached to the cradle to control its descent into the upper basin.|$|E

50|$|The first powered winding engines were {{stationary}} steam engines. The {{demand for}} winding engines was {{one factor that}} drove James Watt to develop his rotative beam engine, with its ability to continuously turn a <b>winding</b> <b>drum,</b> rather than the early reciprocating beam engines that were only useful for working pumps.|$|E

50|$|A {{stationary}} engine drives the <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> that hauls the wagons {{to the top}} of the inclined plane and may provide braking for descending loads. Only a single track and cable is required for this type. The {{stationary engine}} may be a steam or internal combustion engine, or may be a water wheel.|$|E

Ploughing Engine - the <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> {{is mounted}} below the boiler (the 'drum' {{on the side}} is {{actually}} a hose for refilling the water tank).

50|$|In a gravity balance system two {{parallel}} tracks are employed with ascending trains on one and descending trains on the adjacent track. A single cable {{is attached to}} both trains, wound round a <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> {{at the top of}} the incline to provide braking. The weight of the loaded descending cars is used to lift the ascending empties.|$|E
50|$|Although the loaded {{boats were}} {{travelling}} downhill, {{and so the}} plane was mostly worked by gravity, a small steam engine was also provided and drove the <b>winding</b> <b>drums.</b> This was of Adam Heslop's design, a twin-cylindered rotative beam engine, to a design patented in 1790. The remains of the brick boiler house and winding mechanism may be seen {{at the top of}} the incline.|$|R

50|$|They {{also built}} {{ploughing}} engines. Unlike the better-known Fowlers, the Howard used {{a pair of}} <b>winding</b> <b>drums.</b> This allowed a single engine and an anchored return pulley to plough, rather than the Fowler system that used a pair of engines, each one pulling alternately. The two drums were too large to fit in the usual position beneath the boiler and so were moved to a horizontal axle behind the engine's scuttle, {{with a pair of}} sheaves beneath the boiler to guide the cables.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed of}} the wagons was usually {{controlled}} {{by means of a}} brake that acted on the <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> {{at the head of the}} incline. The incline cable passed round the drum several times to ensure there was sufficient friction for the brake to slow the rotation of the drum - and therefore the wagons - without the cable slipping.|$|E
50|$|Three sets of gears on the winch {{create a}} gear ratio of {{approximately}} 1:113 so that 113 turns of the steam engine are required to turn the <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> with its steel cable just one full rotation, however this gives enough force to pull even a ship {{the size of the}} Maid of the Loch slowly out of the water.|$|E
50|$|Burrell's {{experimented with}} a system whereupon the <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> was mounted {{vertically}} on the boiler, this had the advantage that external stresses placed on the boiler were much reduced over the standard means of mounting the drum on the underside an engines boiler. This system was first patented by two agricultural engineers from nearby Fakenham, Percival Everitt and William John Adams. By arrangement Burrells built ploughing engines incorporating the Everitt and Adams <b>winding</b> <b>drum</b> arrangement and engines were supplied either as a pair with left and right drums or singly with a double drum for use with supplied roundabout tackle. In 1881 Everitt and Adams transferred commercial rights for the system to Burrells for royalties of £5 per engine sold, this type of engine then became known as Universal Type Ploughing Engines. This pattern of side drum mounting was never widely adopted and {{the limited number of}} engines produced most were sold overseas.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} [...] high {{pressure}} steam engines. For {{most of the}} ascent, the caissons balanced, but as the lower caisson entered the canal water, it gained buoyancy, and the final closing-up required the engines to operate at full power to bring the upper caisson to the canal. The engines operated two shafts carrying the [...] <b>winding</b> <b>drums,</b> geared to work in opposite directions, so as to achieve the counterbalancing of the caissons. The speed of ascent and descent was about , with a passage time of 5 to 6 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Victor-Charles Mahillon later {{adopted a}} system {{very similar to}} this. He was the curator of the musical {{instrument}} collection of the conservatoire in Brussels, and for the 1888 catalogue of the collection divided instruments into four groups: strings, <b>winds,</b> <b>drums,</b> and other percussion. This scheme was later taken up by Erich von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs who published an extensive new scheme for classication in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie in 1914. Their scheme is widely used today, and is most often known as the Hornbostel-Sachs system (or the Sachs-Hornbostel system).|$|R

50|$|An {{uncommon}} form {{of cable}} railway uses locomotives, {{fitted with a}} <b>winding</b> <b>drum,</b> to power the cable. With the cable or chain attached to the wagons to be drawn, but the drive to the drum disengaged, the locomotive climbs the slope under its own power. When the cable is nearly at its full extent, or when the summit is reached, the locomotive is fastened to the rails and the cable wound in.|$|E
