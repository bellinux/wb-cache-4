5|$|Beswick's mummified {{body was}} {{eventually}} bequeathed to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, {{where she was}} put on display and acquired the soubriquet of the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. The museum's collection was later transferred to Manchester University, when it was decided, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> the Bishop of Manchester, that Beswick should finally be buried. The ceremony took place at Harpurhey Cemetery on 22July 1868, more than 110years after her death; the grave is unmarked.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided {{to examine a}} single hill fort and its {{surrounding}} territory {{in an attempt to}} shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> the site's owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twentyseasons archaeologists spent examining the site, they looked at the defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of wattle and timber houses were discovered. It was the lengthiest investigation of any hill fort in western Europe.|$|E

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> King Philip II of Spain a {{group of}} Jesuits {{travelled}} to the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1568, some 30years after {{the arrival of the}} Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians and Mercedarians. The Jesuits established themselves in Lima in 1569 before moving east toward Paraguay; in 1572 they reached the Audience of Charcas in modern-day Bolivia. Because they were not allowed to establish settlements on the frontier they built chapter houses, churches and schools in pre-existing settlements, such as La Paz, Potosí and La Plata (present day Sucre).|$|E

5|$|Cortés {{arrived in}} Honduras in 1525, {{bringing}} livestock with him. Cortés claimed jurisdiction over Honduras, although its extent was still unknown. He rapidly imposed his {{authority over the}} rival Spanish factions there, {{as well as some}} native groups. He founded the settlement of Natividad de Nuestra Señora near Puerto de Caballos, settled fifty colonists there, and placed Diego de Godoy in charge. Cortés then sailed on to Trujillo. Conditions in Natividad were unhealthy, and half of the Spanish settlers rapidly succumbed to disease. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> Cortés, the rest moved inland to the fertile Naco Valley, where Sandoval had securely established a Spanish presence.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante began {{studying}} guitarists like Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, David Gilmour and Jimi Hendrix at eleven. He discovered Frank Zappa, whose work he would study for hours.

He {{dropped out of high}} school at sixteen <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> his parents and completion of a proficiency test.

He began taking classes at the Guitar Institute of Technology, but turned to punching in without actually attending and left shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Reich {{bought an}} {{oscillograph}} and attached it {{to friends and}} students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was a young Willy Brandt, the future chancellor of Germany.

Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> the hospital's director. Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in Experimentelle Ergebniße Über Die Elektrische Funktion von Sexualität und Angst (The Bioelectrical Investigation of Sexuality and Anxiety).|$|E

In 2007, the government of Canada offered a one-time ex gratia payment of $20,000 as compensation for Agent Orange exposure at CFB Gagetown. On July 12, 2005, Merchant Law Group LLP on behalf of over 1,100 Canadian veterans and civilians who were living {{in and around the}} CFB Gagetown filed a lawsuit to pursue class action litigation concerning Agent Orange and Agent Purple with the Federal Court of Canada. On August 4, 2009, the case was rejected by the court due to lack of evidence. The ruling was appealed.|$|E
5|$|William's feast day {{is celebrated}} on 8 June, {{the day of}} his death, {{although}} his veneration is largely localised to York. Traditional iconography and windows often depict William's crossing of the Tweed; some iconography shows him crossing in a boat. William's coat of arms traditionally depicts seven mascles or lozenges. St William's College, which was named for him is next to York Minster. It was established between 1465 and 1467 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> King Edward IV as the home for chantry priests of the Cathedral. His remains were rediscovered in the 1960s and are now in the crypt at York Minster.|$|E
5|$|Æthelred usually acted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> or in {{association}} with King Alfred, but occasionally he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite {{different from that of}} other duces, for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E

5|$|After Godwin left England, {{he went to}} Flanders, and {{gathered}} a fleet and mercenaries to force the king to allow his return. In the summer of 1052, Godwin returned to England and was met by his sons, who had invaded from Ireland. By September, they were advancing on London, where negotiations between the king and the earl were conducted {{with the help of}} Stigand, the Bishop of Winchester. When it became apparent that Godwin would be returning, Robert quickly left England with Bishop Ulf of Dorchester and Bishop William of London, probably once again taking Wulfnoth and Hakon with him as hostages, whether <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> King Edward or not. Robert was declared an outlaw and deposed from his archbishopric on 14September 1052 at a royal council, mainly because the returning Godwin felt that Robert, along with a number of other Normans, had been the driving force behind his exile. Robert journeyed to Rome to complain to the pope about his own exile, where Leo IX and successive popes condemned Stigand, whom Edward had appointed to Canterbury. Robert's personal property was divided between Earl Godwin, Harold Godwinson, and the queen, who had returned to court.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, 13-year-old Sanford Clark {{was taken}} {{from his home in}} Saskatchewan (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> his mother and {{reluctant}} father) by his uncle, 19-year-old Gordon Stewart Northcott. Northcott took Clark to a ranch in Wineville, California, where he regularly beat and sexually abused the boy — until , when the police took Clark into custody after his sister, 19-year-old Jessie Clark, informed them of the situation. Clark revealed that he was forced to help Northcott and his mother, Sarah Louise Northcott, in killing three young boys after Northcott had kidnapped and molested them. The police found no bodies at the ranch — Clark said they were dumped in the desert — but discovered body parts, blood-stained axes, and personal effects belonging to missing children. The Northcotts fled to Canada, but were arrested and extradited to the United States. Sarah Louise initially confessed to murdering Walter Collins, she later retracted her statement; Gordon, who had confessed to killing five boys, did likewise.|$|E
5|$|The RPF were {{in disarray}} {{by the time}} Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low. He later {{described}} the experience of meeting and taking charge of this demoralised and wounded group {{as one of the}} worst experiences of his life. He spent the following weeks with the senior officers gathering intelligence. By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting. He therefore withdrew most of the army from northeastern Rwanda, moving them to the Virunga mountains. Some soldiers remained behind as a decoy to carry out small-scale attacks on the FAR, who remained unaware of the RPF's relocation. Kagame knew that the rugged high altitude terrain of the Virungas offered considerable protection from attacks, even if the RPF were discovered there. The trek west took almost a week, and the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan army.|$|E
