25|$|Commonly, {{saturation}} diving allows professional divers to {{live and}} work at pressures greater than 50 msw (160 fsw) for days or weeks at a time. This type of diving allows for greater economy of work and enhanced safety for the divers. After working in the water, they rest and live in a dry pressurized habitat on or connected to a diving support vessel, oil platform or other floating <b>work</b> <b>station,</b> at approximately the same pressure as the work depth. The diving team is compressed to the working pressure only once, {{at the beginning of the}} work period, and decompressed to surface pressure once, after the entire work period of days or weeks.|$|E
25|$|The PCR {{method is}} {{extremely}} sensitive, requiring {{only a few}} DNA molecules in a single reaction for amplification across several orders of magnitude. Therefore, adequate measures to avoid contamination from any DNA present in the lab environment (bacteria, viruses, or human sources) are required. Because products from previous PCR amplifications are a common source of contamination, many molecular biology labs have implemented procedures that involve dividing the lab into separate areas. One lab area is dedicated to preparation and handling of pre-PCR reagents and the setup of the PCR reaction, and another area to post-PCR processing, such as gel electrophoresis or PCR product purification. For the setup of PCR reactions, many standard operating procedures involve using pipettes with filter tips and wearing fresh laboratory gloves, {{and in some cases}} a laminar flow cabinet with UV lamp as a <b>work</b> <b>station</b> (to destroy any extraneomultimer formation). PCR is routinely assessed against a negative control reaction that is set up identically to the experimental PCR, but without template DNA, and performed alongside the experimental PCR.|$|E
30|$|For example, Becker et al.

They concludes that the manufacturing system topology is therefore non-random and favours {{the existence of a}} few highly connected <b>work</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

These transfers were done by ISS commander Jeff Williams, flight engineer T.J. Creamer, shuttle commander George Zamka and mission specialist Stephen Robinson and took most of the day. Also during the day pilot Terry Virts continued working on getting the Cupola set-up for the robotics <b>work</b> <b>station.</b> He had a small problem installing some corner panels which are needed to hold the workstation. Spacewalkers Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick were busy reconfiguring the airlock for use by the station crew and later flights. They also transferred their spacesuits and tools back to the shuttle for the return trip home. After the rack transfers were done the crew completed some more transfers and passed the 75% complete mark. The space shuttle commanded by commander George Zamka and pilot Terry Virts completed a reboost of the station using its vernier thrusters.|$|E

A viewscreen was added to the observation lounge and a new set was created to represent the Ten-Forward lounge. The lounge was the final set to be designed for The Next Generation by Herman Zimmerman. He explained that [...] "Ten-Forward became the place where ordinary crew and the officers could co-mingle, and where aliens who were not allowed on the bridge could interact with other crew-members.

[...] His studio set-up was minimal, with only three primary pieces of equipment being utilized in making the album: an Akai MPC60 sampler, a Technics SL-1200 turntable and an Alesis ADAT tape recorder. The Akai MPC60 was particularly instrumental in the {{production of}} Endtroducing....., with the sampler being used for almost all composition. DJ Shadow has referred to the device as [...] "the instrument I took seriously in terms of becoming the best at it, or one of the best."

Data does not require life support to function and does not register a bio-signature. The crew of the Enterprise-D must modify their scanners to detect positronic signals in order to locate and keep track of him on away-missions. Another unique feature of Data's construction is the ability to be dismantled and then re-assembled for later use. This is used as a plot element in the episode [...] "" [...] where Data's head (an artifact excavated on Earth from the late 19th century) is reattached to his body after nearly 500 years. Another example is in the episode [...] "", where Data intentionally damages his body to break a high-current electrical arc, and then Riker takes his head to engineering to solve an engine problem. Data's officer's quarters is unique in that it does not contain any form of bed or bunk, nor bathing facility or bathroom, instead containing a <b>work</b> <b>station</b> with seats, eventually becoming also occupied by Spot, Data's cat.|$|E
2500|$|A {{ministerial order}} of January 1970 {{extended}} protection {{in cases of}} partial unemployment to home workers, while an ordinance of August 1970 fixed the conditions of health necessary for service in the merchant navy. A general provision of October 1970 determined in detail {{the circumstances in which}} the competent authority must take action {{on the basis of the}} act on the technical means of work. The requirement also stipulated the extent to which the technical standards established by national and international organisations can be regarded as “rules of the art.” In a directive of 10 November 1970, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs recommended to the higher authorities for work protection of the [...] "Lander" [...] to bring in the directive published, in agreement with the Ministry of Labour, by the German Engineers' Association on the evaluation of <b>work</b> <b>station</b> noise in relation to loss of hearing, in order to improve safeguards for workers against the noises in question. In September 1971, an ordinance was published concerning dangerous working materials; safeguarding persons using these materials against the dangers involved. In August 1971, a law came into force directed at reducing atmospheric pollution from lead compounds in four-stroke engine fuels. As a safeguard against radiation, a decree on the system of authorisations for medicaments treated with ionizing radiation or containing radioactive substances, in its version of 8 August 1967, was remodelled by a new Decree of 10 May 1971 which added some radionuclides to the list of medicaments which doctors in private practice were authorized to use.|$|E

The throughput of a bucket brigade on discrete <b>work</b> <b>stations</b> may be compromised due to blocking even if workers are sequenced from slowest to fastest. For a given work distribution on the stations we ¯nd policies that maximize the throughput of the line. When workers have very di®erent production rates, fully cross-training the workers and sequencing them from slowest to fastest is almost always the best policy. This policy outperforms other policies for most work distributions except for some cases in which limiting the work zones of workers produces higher throughput. In environments where the work can be adjusted across stations, we identify conditions for a line to prevent blocking...|$|R
