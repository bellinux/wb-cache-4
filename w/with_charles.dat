5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy built in the late 19th century. She was laid down in January 1889, launched in October 1891, and completed in 1896. Her design was unique and departed from earlier ironclad battleship designs by introducing a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns mounted on the centerline and the first use of Belleville boilers. She {{formed the basis for}} several subsequent designs, beginning <b>with</b> <b>Charles</b> Martel.|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought style {{battleship}} built in the French Navy; the previous Magenta-class ships were barbette ships, a type of ironclad battleship.

5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship <b>with</b> <b>Charles,</b> Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E

He took a preparatory class <b>with</b> <b>Charles</b> Louis Hinton, then studied <b>with</b> <b>Charles</b> Courtney Curran and George Willoughby Maynard, all of whom {{emphasized}} classical portraiture and figure drawing.
