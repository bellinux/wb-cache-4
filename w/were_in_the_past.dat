5|$|The {{population}} of 745,400 of the Iban people in Sarawak, based on 2014 statistics, {{makes it the}} largest ethnic group in the state. The Iban <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> a society that paid particular attention to social status, especially to those who displayed martial prowess {{as well as to}} those who demonstrated expertise in various fields such as farming and oratory. Specific terms were used to refer to those who belonged to particular social strata, such as the raja berani (rich and the brave), orang mayuh (ordinary people), and ulun (slaves). Despite modern influences, Iban still observe many of their traditional rituals such as Gawai Antu (festival of the dead) and Gawai Dayak (Harvest Festival).|$|E

25|$|Private CBC {{affiliates}} are not {{as common}} as they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> as many such stations have been purchased either by the CBC itself or by Canwest Global or CHUM Limited, respectively becoming E! or A-Channel (later A, now CTV Two) stations. One private CBC affiliate, CHBC-TV in Kelowna, joined E! (then known as CH) on February 27, 2006. When a private CBC affiliate reaffiliates with another network, the CBC has normally added a retransmitter of its nearest O station to ensure that CBC service is continued. However, due to an agreement between CHBC and CFJC-TV in Kamloops, CFJC also disaffiliated from the CBC on February 27, 2006, but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area. Former private CBC affiliates CKPG-TV Prince George and CHAT-TV Medicine Hat disaffiliated on August 31, 2008 and joined E!, but the CBC announced it will not add new retransmitters to these areas. Incidentally, CFJC, CKPG and CHAT are all owned by an independent media company, Jim Pattison Group. With the closure of E! and other changes in the media landscape, several former CBC affiliates have since joined City or Global, or closed altogether.|$|E

25|$|Calderón’s forces {{concentrate}} on taking down cartel members {{that have a}} high-ranking in the cartel {{in an attempt to}} take down the whole organization. The resulting struggle to fill the recently vacated position is one that threatens the existence of many lives in the cartel. Typically, many junior-level cartel members then fight amongst one another, creating more and more chaos. The drug cartels are more aggressive and forceful now than they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and at this point, the cartels hold much of the power in Mexico. Calderón relies heavily on the military to defend and fight against cartel activity. Calderón’s military forces have yet to yield significant results in dealing with the violent cartels {{due in part to the}} fact that many of the law enforcement officials working for the Mexican government are suspected of being corrupt. There is suspicion that cartels have corrupted and infiltrated the military at a high level, influencing many high-ranking generals and officers. Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission has received nearly 5,800 complaints regarding military abuse since the beginning of the drug war in 2006. Additionally, the National Human Rights Commission has completed nearly 90 in-depth reports since 2007, addressing the many human rights violations towards civilians that have occurred while the military officers were actively participating in law enforcement activities.|$|E

For his second-in-command he chose Lieutenant Charles Chipp, {{who had served}} {{with him on the}} Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William Nindemann, a [...] Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, [...] who had [...] many years' experience in whalers. [...] The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John Wilson Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E

I had sought the job because I believed the navy had deteriorated to the point where its weakness seriously threatened our future security. The navy's grave afflictions included loss of a strategic vision; loss of self-confidence, and morale; a prolonged starvation of resources, leaving vast shortfalls in capability to do the job; and too few ships to cover a sea so great, all resulting in cynicism, exhaustion, and an undercurrent of defeatism. The cult created by Admiral Rickover was itself a major obstacle to recovery, entwining nearly all the issues of culture and policy within the navy.|$|E

2500|$|The eight {{described}} {{species of}} Naultinus are {{found throughout the}} North and South islands of New Zealand and {{on a number of}} offshore islands. Historically, Naultinus species lived throughout the length of New Zealand, from the coast to as much as 1400 metres above sea level. However, all species have now undergone massive declines, and populations nationwide are fragmented and few (see [...] "Conservation") Four species; elegans, grayii, N. [...] "North Cape", [...] and punctatus are found only in the North Island. What was previously thought to be a distinct population of grayii, found only in the far north on the Aupouri Peninsula has been determined from genetic work in the early 2000s to be a new species, more closely related, in fact, to elegans. As of 2010, it is yet to be described but this is likely to change in the near future as several researchers advance taxonomic work on NZ's herpetofuana. Its common name is the [...] "yellow-lipped gecko". The remaining five species: [...] gemmeus, manukanus, rudis, stellatus, and tuberculatus are found only in the South Island. South Island Naultinus <b>were,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> placed in a separate genus called Heteropholis but this taxon was abandoned when new genetic research in the 1980s showed little phylogenetic basis for this taxonomic division.|$|E
