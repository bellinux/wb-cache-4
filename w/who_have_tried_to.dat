25|$|Terry Brink, {{a student}} of Alfred Adler, {{published}} an essay The case of Hitler (1975) in which he, similar to the above-mentioned authors, concluded that after a conscientious evaluation of all records there is not sufficient evidence that Hitler had a mental disorder. Many of Hitler's behavior must be understood as attempts to overcome a difficult childhood. However, many of the documents and statements that have been quoted in order to proof a mental illness were to be considered untrustworthy. Too strong consideration has been given, for example, to allied propaganda and to fabrications of people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> distance themselves from Hitler for personal reasons.|$|E

500|$|Operation Epsom {{has been}} {{analysed}} by many military historians and commentators. S. A. Hart wrote in 2007, that post-war publication of memoirs by Allied generals {{had led to}} disputes along national lines during the 1950s and 1960s, with American historians generally critical of Montgomery and {{the actions of the}} Anglo-Canadian forces, while [...] "pro-Montgomery" [...] historians set out to refute these criticisms. Also published during this period were the national official campaign histories, which were thoroughly-researched but avoided detailed critical analysis of the controversies. During the 1980s, revisionist writers concentrated on the perceived deficiencies of the Allies and since the late 1990s, two schools of thought have been revising the revisionists, some expanding on revisionist work, by providing a more detailed campaign analysis and those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> show that the techniques employed by the Anglo-Canadian forces were appropriate to conditions in Normandy.|$|E
500|$|Lucius's {{apparently}} solemn {{devotion to}} the Isis cult in this chapter contrasts strongly with the comic misadventures {{that make up the}} rest of the novel. Scholars debate whether the account is intended to seriously represent Lucius's {{devotion to the}} goddess, or whether it is ironic, perhaps a satire of the Isis cult. Those who believe it is satirical point to the way Lucius is pushed to undergo several initiations, each requiring a fee, despite having little money. Although many of the scholars <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> analyze the mysteries based on the book have assumed it is serious, the book may be broadly accurate even if it is satirical. Apuleius's description of the Isis cult and its mysteries generally fits with much of the outside evidence about them. S.J. Harrison says it shows [...] "detailed knowledge of Egyptian cult, whether or not Apuleius himself was in fact an initiate of Isiac religion." [...] In another of his works, the Apologia, Apuleius claims to have undergone several initiations, though he does not mention the mysteries of Isis specifically. In writing Metamorphoses, he may have drawn on personal experience of the Isiac initiation or of other initiations that he underwent. Even so, the detailed description given in Metamorphoses may be idealized rather than strictly accurate, and the Isis cults may have included many varieties of mystery rite. The novel actually mentions three distinct initiation rites in two cities, although only the first is described in any detail.|$|E

Davidson says that it is unclear where the nine worlds are located in relation to the tree; they could either exist one above the other or perhaps be grouped around the tree, but there are references to worlds existing beneath the tree, while the gods are pictured as in the sky, a rainbow bridge (Bifröst) connecting the tree with other worlds.

2500|$|The book's {{foreword}} by Malcolm Nance grounds {{the reader}} by giving {{background on the}} conclusions of the report. Nance emphasizes the significant necessity of a coherent plan to stem American terrorists from exiting the country and then returning again from war-torn zones in order to commit criminal acts back in their home country. Nance concludes his foreword writing, [...] "This Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel is a keystone study of ISIS's ability to recruit terrorists from or in their home nations to abandon all they have ever known and launch themselves as a virtually programmed corps of human guided weapons globally."

[...] Beauvoir discusses the lives of several women, some of whom developed stigmata. Beauvoir writes that these women may develop a relation [...] "with an unreal"— with their double or a god, or they create an [...] "unreal relation with a real being". She also mentions women with careers who are able to escape sadism and masochism. A few women have successfully reached a state of equality, and Beauvoir, in a footnote, singles out the example of Clara and Robert Schumann. Beauvoir says that the goals of wives can be overwhelming: as a wife tries to be elegant, a good housekeeper and a good mother. Singled out are [...] "actresses, dancers and singers" [...] who may achieve independence. Among writers, Beauvoir chooses only Emily Brontë, Woolf and ("sometimes") Mary Webb (and she mentions Colette and Mansfield) as among those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> approach nature [...] "in its inhuman freedom". Beauvoir then says that women don't [...] "challenge the human condition" [...] and that in comparison to the few [...] "greats", woman comes out as [...] "mediocre" [...] and will continue at that level for quite some time. A woman could not have been Vincent van Gogh or Franz Kafka. Beauvoir thinks that perhaps, of all women, only Saint Teresa lived her life for herself.
