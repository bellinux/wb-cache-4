Previous battlecruisers were built <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E

5|$|According to Hinchliffe, {{this is an}} {{incorrect}} statement. Hinchliffe based his account on Rumpelhardt's testimony who claims that Schnaufer was never taken to England. Rumpelhardt was released on 4 August 1945 and soon after Schnaufer was admitted {{to a hospital in}} Flensburg, ill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of diphtheria and scarlet fever. Interrogation had begun in late May 1945 by a team of twelve officers from the Department of Air Technical Intelligence (DAT), led by Air Commodore Roderick Aeneas Chisholm. The German prisoners were brought to Eggebek. Here they conducted a number of interviews with various members of the night fighter force.|$|E

5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{the failure}} of the English Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament {{declared}} itself capable of governing without the king's consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army moved into the English county of Northumberland. Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland, who was the king's commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces, despite Strafford being ill himself <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of gout and dysentery. The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War, had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne, where they defeated the English forces at the Battle of Newburn and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of Durham.|$|E

Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the British {{discovery}} of the iconic Charnia in 1957 that the pre-Cambrian was seriously considered as containing life. This frond-shaped fossil was found in England's Charnwood Forest, and due to the detailed geological mapping of the British Geological Survey there was no doubt these fossils sat in Precambrian rocks. Palaeontologist Martin Glaessner finally, in 1959, made the connection between this and the earlier finds and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of improved dating of existing specimens and an injection of vigour into the search many more instances were recognised.|$|E
5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
