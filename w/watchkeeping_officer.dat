The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea contains the rules which deal with traffic situations at sea, but despite the regulations collisions occur. The study has focused on two questions: What situations are perceived as the most difficult by the navigating officers? How are these situations solved by the navigation officers? The study has been carried out by using in-depth interviews with five Swedish <b>watchkeeping</b> <b>officers.</b> The officers have been asked about which factors make a traffic situation difficult and has described how they perceive specific difficult situations. To interpret the results, the study has a background chapter which complements the interviews.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Denizcilik, IMO tarafından tanımlandığı şekliyle dünyanın belki de en büyük uluslararası endüstrisi ve en tehlikelilerinden biridir. Modern gemilerin 5 000 kişiden fazla {{personel}} ve 500 000 tondan fazla petrol taşıyabildiği göz önüne alındığında gemi kazaları ve olaylarının ciddi can kayıplarına ve deniz çevresinin kirlenmesine neden olabileceği açıktır. E-Seyir; IMO nun bir işletim konsepti olup, gemide ve kıyıda konuşlu mevcut/yeni seyir araçlarının hepsini kapsayacak şekilde bütünleşmeyi hedeflemektedir. E-Seyir, denizde emniyet, güvenlik ve deniz çevresinin korunması için, bir rıhtımdan diğerine seyir ve ilgili hizmetlerin geliştirilmesi amacına yönelik olarak gemi ve kıyıdaki denizcilik bilgilerinin elektronik ortamda, uyumlu bir şekilde toplanması, bütünleştirilmesi, değişimi, analizi ve sunumudur. Konseptten uygulamaya geçmek üzere iki ana konu vardır. - Sistemin tüm bileşenlerini kullanıma hazır hale getirmek ve önemli seyir bilgilerinin gösterimini basitleştirerek bilgileri etkin kullanmak. - Yeni teknolojilerin mevcut seyir iletişim teknolojileri ve hizmetleriyle uyumlu kullanımını sağlarken, bu teknolojlileri yapısal bir şekilde birleştirmek. 2008 Temmuz ayında, IMO NAV Alt Komitesi nin 54 üncü oturumunda E-Seyrin Geliştirilmesi ve Uygulanması için Teklif Edilen Strateji onaylanmış olup, uygulama planının 2014 yılında kabul edilmesi beklenmektedir. Söz konusu stratejinin ana bileşenleri kullanıcı ihtiyaçlarının belirlenmesi, mevcut sistem yapısının analizi, mevcut ve ihtiyaç duyulan teknoloji arasındaki fark analizi ve maliyet ve risk analizidir. Henüz uluslararası düzenlemeleri hazırlık aşamasında olan E-Seyir konusunda IMO da alınacak kararlara, SOLAS a taraf ülkemiz de uymak zorunda olacağından yapılan bu çalışma ve araştırma ile; - E-Seyir konusu ile ilgilenen ve konu hakkında çeşitli uzmanlık alanlarında görev yapan ülkemizdeki paydaşlar için E-Seyir konsepti ile tarihsel gelişimleri mevcut ve ileride beklenen durumları ile E-Seyrin bileşenleri tanıtılmış, - Gelişmiş diğer bazı ülkelerdeki araştırmalara {{benzer bir}} araştırma yapılarak ülkemizdeki E-Seyir kullanıcılarının ihtiyaç, beklenti ve görüşleri belirlenmiş, - Söz konusu ihtiyaç, beklenti ve görüşler kapsamlı bir şekilde irdelenmiştir. - Ayrıca ulusal ve uluslararası platformlarda E-Seyir konusunda çalışma yapacak ülkemiz kurum ve kuruluşları ile temsilcilerine, yapacakları çalışmalarda farkındalık oluşturmaya ve katkı sağlanmaya çalışılmıştır. One {{of the purpose}} of this work is to introduce the E-Navigation concept and the components of E-Navigation. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) began discussions on E-Navigation in late 2005 recognizing the need for a strategy to ensure the effective and efficient utilization and integration of navigation technologies to improve safety, security, protection of the environment and efficient navigation. E-Navigation is an International Maritime Organization (IMO) concept of operation that aims to integrate existing / new shipboard and shore-based navigational tools in an ?all embracing? system. It has been defined as: [...] the harmonised collection, integration, exchange, presentation and analysis of maritime information onboard and ashore by electronic means to enhance berth to berth navigation and related services, for safety and security at sea and protection of the marine environment? In order to go from concept to implementation, there are two main challenges: - Ensuring the availability of all components of the system and using them effectively in order to simplify the display of crucial navigation-related information. - Incorporating new technologies in a structured way while ensuring that their use is compliant with the existing navigational communication technologies and services. In July 2008, a Proposed Strategy for the Development and Implementation of e-Navigation was agreed at IMO NAV 54. The implementation plan is expected to be adopted in 2014. The key components of the strategy are a statement of user needs, an analysis of existing system architecture, a gap analysis between existing and required technologies and a cost and risk analysis. The IMO e-navigation initiative is intended primarily to improve navigation safety and to reduce errors. Research into collisions and groundings has revealed that: the availability of suitable input to the decision-making process might have prevented many collisions or groundings; over half of collisions and groundings are caused by direct human error; and many <b>watchkeeping</b> <b>officers</b> appear to continue to make critical decisions on navigation and collision avoidance in isolation. E-navigation could greatly assist in addressing these issues by providing accurate, up-to-date, timely and shared information to mariners and shore authorities. Other benefits expected include greater efficiency and security in maritime transportation security, and enhanced protection of the marine environment. Electronic Navigation Chart (ENC), Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS), Automatic Idendification System (AIS), Vessel Traffic System (VTS), Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT), positioning techniques like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Long Range Navigation (LORAN) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), non hydrographic data and users are considered as the main components of E-Navigation under this work. The background information, status and future expectations of those components are discussed including their accuracies. The other purpose of this work is to define the user needs of our country. In order to achive this purpose a survey is done with the probable E-Navigation users. The experienced mariners are selected for the survey. The Canadian survey form is utilized for the mentioned application. The application is done by face to face interview or via email. The survey focused primarily on onboard user needs. The questionnaire is structured into three main sections: Maritime Communications, Human Machine Interface and Technical/Operational Enhancements The featured results of this survey are as follows; - Data transfer from the ship must be obligatory with the current satellite communication systems. All ships should be provided with have email technology for information transfer. - Satellite communication is expensive and not always reliable. - Mobile phones can be used efficiently to call pilots. - The key elements using in broad band communications are reliability, coverage, cost and safety considerations. Interruption in communication can be a problem. - Broad band communication facilities should be cheap or free of charge in order to meet short, medium and long range communication. - Wi-fi and mobile phones have limited coverage. While it can be adequate in some regions, it can be inadequate in some areas. - Reporting requirements are much and they can cause distraction during navigation functions. - The same information with different formats should be avoided. The standart formats should be agreed among all relevant authorities and they should share that information among each other. - The information from shore to ship should be prepared by as few as possible authorities as much intervention cause loosing time and more efforts. - The ship should report one authority and all relevant authorities should receive the information from there. - AIS should be used primarily for tracking and identifiying of the ships. - AIS application specific messages should be displayed on PPU, ECS and ECDISs. The information broadcasted by AIS should not be emergency messages. Some AIS messages should be acknowledged by voice. - AIS application specific messages are the best way to provide specific information (weather forecast, hydrography etc.) - Displaying real time information on navigation displays is an advantage in order to contribute the decision making process and safety of navigation but information overload should be avoided. Displaying of information should be selected by the users. - Displaying the information should be able to be selected by the user. Information should always be ready to be used. Mariner should decide which information is important and when it should be displayed (in an ECDIS as additinal layer etc.). - It will be useful that all navigation information is given together from one interface to the user. If it is not given from a suitable interface then it can cause that some information is not percepted by the user. - Recently GPS has vital important for the ships and there is no backup system if it fails. Turkey should be a party of a Project similar like Galileo or we should be member of another project with other states - Electronic versions of paper media shall save time in order to reach the information if it only comes from a reliable source. But the electronic documents should be designed user friendly and printable. Besides some paper documents are still needed as logbook and signed forms. - The purpose should be minimizing the workload, standardizing and simplifying the procedures. Agreement of mariners should be shought for what and how to be displayed. As Turkey {{is also one of the}} signatory states to SOLAS Convention, she also has to comply with the decisions taken by IMO. Taking this obligation into account with this works it is also aimed to contribute to establish awareness for the stakeholders and representatives of Turkey who are interested with E-Navigation and who participate the activities of E-Navigation in national or international domain. Moreover it is considered that this work will be usefull for the stakeholders if they take it into account in theie E-Navigation activities. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
