5|$|About half <b>way</b> <b>between</b> Englefield and Linwood was Holy Trinity Avonside, at {{the time}} a cob church. Guise Brittan was its churchwarden. The whole Brittan family had a close {{connection}} to the church, with Joseph Brittan helping to raise money for its construction, and his daughter Mary singing in the church choir. They faithfully attended church on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Because the A82 is a main through route, {{tourists}} are suggested {{to use the}} older Military Road instead, {{so as to avoid}} the coach and HGV traffic.

5|$|By early December 1916, {{construction}} of the railway had reached the wells at Bir el Mazar, the last water sources available to the EEF before El Arish. Bir el Mazar was about half <b>way</b> <b>between</b> Kantara on the Suez Canal and the Egyptian-Ottoman territorial border. British intelligence had reported Ottoman Army plans to strengthen the garrison at Magdhaba, by extending the railway (or light rail) south east from Beersheba (and Hafir el Auja) towards Magdhaba.|$|E

5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their <b>way</b> <b>between</b> these resources.|$|E

5|$|Development {{continued}} as lots were sold southward to present day Oak Street, {{about a third}} of the <b>way</b> <b>between</b> Broadway and the House of Refuge. The principal road through the suburb at this time was Central Plank Road, which became Third Street. The emerging area was called the Southern Extension by this time. Growth south of Oak was very slow until the Southern Exposition was held annually in the area from 1883 to 1887.|$|E

5|$|No. 1 Squadron (AFC) patrols {{found the}} Shunet Nimrin {{garrison}} {{still in place}} {{on the morning of}} 22 September, but Rujm el Oshir camp (to the east of Jericho, half <b>way</b> <b>between</b> the Jordan River and the Hedjaz railway) had been broken up, and fires burned west of the Amman railway station. Ain es Sir camp (south east of Es Salt, half <b>way</b> <b>between</b> the Jordan River and Amman) was found to be full of Ottoman troops, but at about midday the Ottoman garrison at Es Salt was hastily packing. Australian airmen reported the whole area east of the Jordan to be on the move towards Amman by between 15:00 and 18:00, when two Bristol Fighters bombed a mass of traffic at Suweile, half-way between Es Salt and Amman, and fired nearly 1,000 machine-gun rounds.|$|E

5|$|Columbia City station {{consists}} of two at-grade side platforms in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. <b>Way</b> <b>between</b> Edmunds and Alaska streets. The station is accessible from crosswalks at both streets, with the platforms running the entire length between the two. At both of the station's entrances are ticket vending machines and an ORCA card reader; beyond that lies the partially covered platform and waiting area, which includes seating and public art. The station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson, and incorporates references to Craftsman-style homes that populate the neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Industrial Revolution, agrarian writers sought a <b>way</b> <b>between</b> liberty and tradition; William Cobbett, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc were main exponents, while the founder of guild socialism, Arthur Penty, and cooperative movement advocate G. D. H. Cole are somewhat related. Empiricism continued through John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell, while Bernard Williams was involved in analytics. Authors from around the Victorian era include Charles Dickens, the Brontë sisters, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, H. G. Wells and Lewis Carroll. Since then England has continued to produce novelists such as George Orwell, D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, C. S. Lewis, Enid Blyton, Aldous Huxley, Agatha Christie, Terry Pratchett, J. R. R. Tolkien, and J. K. Rowling.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle <b>way</b> <b>between</b> the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E
5|$|NY195 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY11B in the hamlet of Nicholville within {{the town of}} Lawrence. It headed north out {{of the community and}} into a series of cultivated fields. About quarter of the <b>way</b> <b>between</b> Nicholville and Lavery's Corner, the fields gave way to forested areas, which themselves ceded to more fields near an intersection with Cady Road. NY195 continued on to Lavery's Corner, where it intersected with a pair of county highways and turned east toward Lawrenceville. On its way to Lawrenceville, the highway met Ferris Road, the last through route along NY195's routing excluding the roadway at its northern terminus. East of Ferris Road, NY195 curved northeast to enter Lawrenceville, where it ended at US11.|$|E

5000|$|The Scottish surgeon James Braid (who {{introduced}} the term [...] "hypnotism"), attempted to distinguish, in various <b>ways,</b> <b>between</b> {{different levels of}} the hypnotic state.

5|$|The July 1924 {{timetable}} showed eight {{passenger trains}} each <b>way</b> <b>between</b> Amlwch and Gaerwen, with the Red Wharf Bay railmotor operating to Llangefni {{three times a}} day. The extra Thursday service to Llangefni for the market was still included. By the summer of 1929, there were eight trains from Gaerwen to Amlwch, and seven in the other direction. One train to and from Amlwch no longer ran Thursdays, replaced with a second two return trip to Llangefni, operated by the railmotor. The loop at Llangwyllog now saw three pairs of passenger trains passing on weekdays, while the daily freight train would be shunted into sidings at Llangefni and Llanerchymedd to make way. Motor train services were back up to 24 single trips a day, including the Red Wharf Bay services.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{undertaking}} for Task Force 113 (now redesignated TF.57) was Operation Iceberg-offshore {{support for the}} US landings at Okinawa-which got under way on 1 April 1945. The force was subjected to sporadic Japanese kamikaze attacks, but the two ships emerged unscathed from these actions. Howe's anti-aircraft batteries also succeeded in shooting down an attacking kamikaze plane. The two ships' principal roles were air defence and land bombardment, the latter being carried out very accurately, particularly by Howe against anti-aircraft installations {{on the island of}} Miyako, half <b>way</b> <b>between</b> Okinawa and Formosa.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} served in general by around {{half a dozen}} trains each <b>way</b> <b>between</b> North Walsham, Mundesley and Cromer Beach. However, with no direct service to Norwich - the nearest city - the halt was little-used, and closed in 1953 {{as part of a}} package of early {{rationalisation}} measures undertaken by British Railways after nationalisation, which also involved the closure of the line from Roughton Road Junction to Mundesley. The coastal line, although highly picturesque, carried little traffic and its closure made sound economic sense to British Railways.|$|E
