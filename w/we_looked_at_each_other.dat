500|$|After two weeks, Worsley {{began to}} worry about the lack of {{sightings}} and advised Shackleton he could not calculate their position to less than [...] accuracy. As a result, Shackleton opted to aim for the western side of South Georgia which meant, given the prevailing winds, that if they missed their target they would be carried onto the east coast of the island. The following day, they began to observe drifting seaweed and seabirds circulating overhead, indicating the presence of land ahead. On 8 May, through mists and squalls, the crew sighted South Georgia's Cape Demidov, precisely in line with the course calculated by Worsley. He saw a [...] "...towering black crag, with a lacework of snow around its flanks. One glimpse, and it was hidden again. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with cheerful, foolish grins." [...] Sea and wind conditions were such that they were unable to {{make their way to the}} Norwegian whaling stations, some [...] away, on the east coast; instead they made for King Haakon Bay. Now out of drinking water, they were forced by the high seas to approach the rocky coast with care and heave to for the night. A gale blew strongly the following day and despite their best efforts, they stayed offshore for a further night. Conditions were much better on 10 May and after adverse winds caused failure of his first few attempts, Worsley carefully sailed the James Caird through a rocky reef guarding King Haakon Bay and onto the beach.|$|E

I think that's where Jim is really good -- he can piece a story together. It's just a good thing to have the tape rolling when you're recording me. The best example was when we wrote [...] "Cuts Like A Knife," [...] which was just literally a mumble. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> rolled the tape back, and it sounded like [...] "cuts like a knife," [...] so we started singing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Germany militant Darwinismus {{elevated}} Darwin to heroic status. When {{the eminent}} Freethinker Doctor Ludwig Büchner requested an audience {{he thought he}} was greeting a noble ally. To Darwin this was a grotesque misunderstanding, but he felt unable to refuse. Darwin's wife Emma Darwin expressed her expectation that their guest [...] "will refrain from airing his very strong religious opinions" [...] and invited their old friend the Revd. John Brodie Innes. On Thursday 28 September 1881 Büchner arrived with Edward Aveling. Darwin's son Frank was also present. Darwin wittily explained that [...] " [...] & I have been fast friends for 30 years. We never thoroughly agreed on any subject but once and then <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and thought one of us must be very ill".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, k.d. lang {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "Hallelujah" [...] on her album Hymns of the 49th Parallel. She has since sung it at several major events, such as at the Canadian Juno Awards of 2005, where it [...] "brought the audience to its feet for a two-minute ovation." [...] Lang also sang it at the 2006 Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame when Cohen {{was inducted into the}} Hall of Fame. Cohen's partner, singer Anjani Thomas, said: [...] "After hearing k.d. lang perform that song at the Canadian Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2006 <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and said, 'well, I think we can lay that song to rest now! It's really been done to its ultimate blissful state of perfection'." [...] Lang sang it at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, before a claimed TV audience of three billion.|$|E

50|$|One {{interpretation}} is that Magritte is demonstrating {{the line between}} individuality and group association, {{and how it is}} blurred. All of these men are dressed the same, have the same bodily features and are all floating/falling. This leaves us to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the men as a group.

5000|$|An {{accounting}} period {{is a period}} with reference to which United Kingdom corporation tax is charged. It helps dictate when tax is paid on income and gains.

She drew back.|$|R

30|$|Skill {{similarity}} {{from people}} skill data is computed {{based on the}} notion that if an employee has two skills, then a person may be trained from one to the other. Skill transition data are obtained from historical employee skill records as described in Sect.  3. As such, <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> skill and compute a profile for that skill consisting of the union of all skills possessed by all employees with that skill. Then, similarity between the profiles of two skills gives us a measure of the adjacency between them.|$|R
