5|$|On August 12, 2005, JALways Flight 58 {{operated}} by a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 from Fukuoka to Honolulu experienced left-wing engine trouble shortly after takeoff. The aircraft immediately returned to Fukuoka Airport. Some engine parts fell on the Sharyo district of Fukuoka and several people were slightly injured and parked car <b>windscreens</b> damaged.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} {{variability}} in the height {{and shape of the}} side windows, and the style of <b>windscreen.</b> One common design of <b>windscreen</b> was square-cornered, tapered in towards the top and curved around to the sides. Another was a two-piece flat <b>windscreen</b> with radiused outer corners. A third design used was a double-curvature <b>windscreen</b> with an arched top.|$|R

50|$|The curved {{sides of}} the Visa's <b>windscreen</b> enabled {{the use of a}} very large single wiper on the long narrow <b>windscreen.</b> The front of the revised car, was {{designed}} to aerodynamically reduce the deposition of dirt on the headlights, and {{to reduce the risk of}} stone chips to the headlights, bonnet and <b>windscreen.</b>|$|R
5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car <b>windscreens</b> had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an astrophysicist at Liège.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the eruption, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 340th Bombardment Group was based at Pompeii Airfield near Terzigno, Italy, just a few {{kilometres}} from the eastern base of the volcano. The tephra and hot ash damaged the fabric control surfaces, the engines, the Plexiglas <b>windscreens</b> and the gun turrets of the 340th's B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. Estimates ranged from 78 to 88 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Some {{elements}} of the station, including the size of internal support structures, the amount of glass panels, and {{the width of the}} roof, were eliminated or reduced to save $20 million in construction costs. Moving walkways and electric carts were both considered and rejected for the station because of engineering difficulties and cost. In 2017, the Port of Seattle began a $3.5 million capital program to improve the walk from the station to the terminal by installing <b>windscreens</b> and adding a cart shuttle service.|$|E
50|$|Standard and Tour Classic {{versions}} {{were initially}} made. The Standard model had four mufflers and no <b>windscreen</b> or sidebags, {{though they were}} available as accessories. The Tour Classic had four mufflers, a <b>windscreen,</b> and soft sidebags. In 1997 a Tourdeluxe version was introduced. The Tourdeluxe had two mufflers, a <b>windscreen,</b> and hard sidebags.|$|R
50|$|The first {{designs for}} the <b>windscreen</b> wiper are {{credited}} to Polish concert pianist Józef Hofmann, and Mills Munitions, Birmingham who also {{claimed to have been}} the first to patent <b>windscreen</b> wipers in England.At least three inventors patented <b>windscreen</b> cleaning devices at around the same time in 1903; Mary Anderson, Robert Douglass, and John Apjohn.

5|$|In Mumbai and Aurangabad, police {{rounded up}} more than 400MNS workers. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, MNS workers went on a rampage {{following}} the arrest of Raj, smashing windows and <b>windscreens</b> of eleven state buses. Thirteen rioters were arrested. They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets. He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious. When he gained consciousness the following day, {{he found himself in}} a hospital with both hands amputated. The injured, mainly hawkers, were treated at the Nashik Civil Hospital after they were beaten. Shops along Nashik Road closed down after the incident. Incidents of stone pelting on state-run buses were reported from the Nashik Road, Ambad, Ravivar Peth, and Gangapur areas. Bus services were severely curtailed and diverted via Nipani. In Amrawati, MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses, damaging several vehicles in the process. Though contingents of the Rapid Action Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed {{in many parts of the}} state, the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted hit-and-run methods of attack. More than 200activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik. Many activists went underground and coordinated with party activists from undisclosed locations.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{vehicles}} were mainly two wheel drive, chosen {{because they were}} lighter and used less fuel than four wheel drive. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, <b>windscreens</b> and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure desert tyres, sand mats and channels, plus map containers and a sun compass devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, {{while the rest of}} the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt wide-body (WB) trucks. From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step; because they were four wheel drive and heavier than the Chevrolets, they used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the range of a patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys Jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>windscreen</b> wipers operate {{together}} with a <b>windscreen</b> (or windshield) washer; a pump that supplies a mixture of water, alcohol, and detergent (a blend called windshield washer fluid) from a tank to the <b>windscreen.</b> The fluid is dispensed through small nozzles mounted on the hood. Conventional nozzles are usually used, but some designs use a fluidic oscillator to disperse the fluid more effectively.|$|R
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider <b>windscreens</b> to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of {{wind noise}} {{reduction}} {{were conducted on}} a box-shaped, subsurface <b>windscreen</b> made of closed cell polyurethane foam. The <b>windscreen</b> was installed in {{the ground with the}} lid flush with the ground surface. The wind was generated by means of a fan, situated on the ground, and the wind speed was measured {{at the center of the}} <b>windscreen</b> lid with an ultrasonic anemometer. The wind speed was controlled by moving the fan to selected distances from the <b>windscreen.</b> The wind noise was measured on a PCB Piezotronics 3 electret microphone. Wind noise spectra were measured with the microphone exposed directly to the wind (atop the <b>windscreen</b> lid) and with the microphone installed inside the <b>windscreen.</b> The difference between the two spectra comprises the wind noise reduction. At wind speeds of 3, 5, and 7 m/s, the wind noise reduction is typically 15 dB over the frequency range of 0. 1 - 20 Hz...|$|R
40|$|A good {{knowledge}} of the contact properties between the <b>windscreen</b> and the head during an impact is necessary to obtain a reliable pedestrian-vehicle crash simulation. Unlike {{other parts of the}} vehicle, the <b>windscreen</b> may crack as well as bend during an impact. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the behaviour of a head impact on a <b>windscreen</b> and to design a multibody contact model of <b>windscreen</b> impact which accounts for rate-dependent damping effects. Subsystem impact tests were used to define contact-impact characteristics that correctly account for damping. Two phases can be distinguished in these characteristics. The first part corresponds to the bending and the fracture of the <b>windscreen</b> whereas the second part corresponds to the bending of the <b>windscreen</b> once it is broken. The characteristics were then implemented in a multibody model and the subsystem impact tests were simulated in order to validate it by comparison with experimental tests. The results from the numerical <b>windscreen</b> model are consistent with the results from the subsystem tests. Comparison of head injury criterion (HIC) values gives an additional validation of the consistency of our model. Contact properties, multibody simulation, pedestrian-vehicle cras...|$|R

40|$|As modern {{passenger}} cars become increasingly quieter and comfort, automotive <b>windscreen</b> wiper {{noise and vibration}} become more noticeable. As {{a result of the}} market information survey, most complaints about the wiper concern operation noise. Wiper vibration and noise is classified into three main categories namely, squeal noise, chattering, and reversal noise. Squeal noise is a high-frequency vibration of about 1000 Hz. Chattering noise is a lowfrequency vibration of 100 Hz or less and reversal noise is an impact sound with a frequency of 500 Hz or less produced when the wiper reverses. Typically, noise and vibration study of the automotive <b>windscreen</b> wiper has been carried out by experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. This report describes evaluation of noise and vibration that generated by an automotive <b>windscreen</b> wiper using numerical approach via finite element method. In doing so, two types of test are conducted i. e. modal testing for individual wiper components and noise and vibration test to identify noise category for a selected passenger car <b>windscreen</b> wiper. Later, a 3 -dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model of the <b>windscreen</b> wiper assembly is developed. This FE model is then validated at the component level using modal analysis {{in order to ensure that}} dynamic characteristics of the FE model close to a real <b>windscreen</b> wiper. In order to evaluate characteristics of noise and vibration of the <b>windscreen</b> wiper, complex eigenvalue analysis that made available in ABAQUS is employed. It is found that the <b>windscreen</b> wiper generates noise at frequency around 11 Hz which is identified as chatter and the predicted frequency is fairly close with measured frequency obtained in the experiment. This chatter noise is dominated by bending mode of the wiper blade. Having found the characteristics of the <b>windscreen</b> wiper noise, several structural modifications are proposed to the rubber blade and simulated once again. There are three modifications that capable of preventing noise and vibration in the <b>windscreen</b> wiper. This finding could help car makers to design quiet and effective <b>windscreen</b> wiper and in turn to produce quieter and comfort {{passenger cars}}...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to provide a method to simulate the mechanical behavior of <b>windscreen</b> laminated glass. The polyvinyl butyral (PVB) laminated glass is manufactured by pressing a layer of PVB film in between two pieces of glass plates under the high temperature condition. In this study, <b>windscreen</b> models are developed using different combination of glass and PVB with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm & 10 mm). Then each <b>windscreen</b> model was impacted with standard adult headform under LS-DYNA environment and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. The results show that the behavior of <b>windscreen</b> developed with double layered shell elements of glass and PVB each with tied element connection simulates best the test results. Furthermore, the influence of fracture stress of glass on the above mentioned <b>windscreen</b> was investigated.
