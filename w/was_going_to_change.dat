He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E

[...] Auerbach said, [...] "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
500|$|After the Braves {{selected}} Ernie DiGregorio in the 1973 NBA {{draft to}} complement 1972 NBA draft selection Bob McAdoo, {{it was clear}} the team <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> to fast-paced offense to leverage DiGregorio's skills. [...] Hummer {{was more of a}} defensive player. [...] Prior to the 1973–74 NBA season, Hummer was packaged with a 1974 NBA draft 2nd round pick and a 1975 NBA draft 2nd round pick in a trade that sent him to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Gar Heard and Kevin Kunnert. [...] The deal was part of the resume that earned Donavan the NBA Executive of the Year Award. That season the 54–28 Dick Motta-coached 1973–74 Bulls team that he was traded to initially would make the playoffs, but the 36–46 Bill Russell-coached 1973–74 SuperSonics that he would finish the season with would not.|$|E

500|$|The {{other three}} episodes {{of the season}} did not match the viewership of [...] "Bop Gun", but they were {{nevertheless}} considered strong ratings for the show, better than past Homicide episodes and the average rating for L.A. Law. Homicides improved ratings in the Thursday night timeslot fueled speculation that L.A. Law might be canceled and Homicide would take its place. Warren Littlefield denied such claims, believing the success of one series did not necessarily have to mean the cancellation of the other. Despite Homicides improvement in the ratings, NBC did not immediately commit to a third season until the producers agreed to even more changes, including more prominent guest stars, more women in the cast and more life-affirming storylines. Outgoing cast member Polito publicly decried these changes, claiming the show <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> from a drama into a [...] "soap opera".|$|E
500|$|During the 2000–01 season, Richmond {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with a 21–6 record, finishing first in the CAA with a 12–4 record. The Spiders won ten of their final eleven games. [...] However, since Richmond <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> its athletic affiliation from the CAA to the Atlantic 10 the following season, it was ineligible for the 2001 CAA conference tournament. Only one team from the CAA had ever earned an at large bid to the NCAA tournament. [...] The Spiders wound up playing in the 2001 NIT, where they defeated West Virginia before losing to Dayton. [...] With one win and one loss Beilein stayed at [...]500 in the NIT, at 4–4. At {{the end of the}} season, Beilein declined an offer to coach at Rutgers. The victory over West Virginia is credited with being a large part of why Beilein was eventually hired at West Virginia.|$|E

We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I felt {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E

500|$|The Cassandra Cain {{version of}} Batgirl, {{depicted}} as a biracial character (Half White and half Chinese), is notable {{as one of the}} most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, [...] "Cassandra's racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent." [...] The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women, and Asian women in particular. The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the One Year Later event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership. When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: [...] "They didn't present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn't answer." ...|$|E

Also in that cast was a young Englishman named Archie Leach, who received as many good notices for his romantic appeal as Allen got for his comic work. Hammerstein retooled the show before bringing it to New York, replacing everyone but two women and Allen. Leach decided to buy an old car and drive to Hollywood. [...] "What Archie Leach didn't tell me," [...] Allen remembered, [...] "was that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his name to Cary Grant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alfred Vagts {{had already}} begun the {{discussion}} from an historical point of view, concentrating on the German/Prussian military experience. He was perhaps most influential with his definition of militarism, which he described as the state of a society that [...] "ranks military institutions and ways above the prevailing attitudes of civilian life and carries the military mentality into the civilian sphere." [...] Louis Smith, whose work pre-dated Huntington's, discussed issues of congressional and judicial control over the military as well as executive civilian control of military matters. However, all that discussion predated a general recognition that the American experience <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in the post-World War II era. Once {{it became apparent that}} the American military was going to maintain historically high levels of active-duty personnel, concerns about the differences between civilian and military cultures quickly came to the forefront. The ensuing debate can be generally divided into three periods with different emphases in each.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1964, Murray {{found out}} that WINS <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> to an all news format the {{following}} year. He resigned {{on the air in}} December 1964 (breaking news about the sale of the station and the change in format before the station and Group W released it) and did his last show on February 27 prior to the format change that occurred in April 1965. A year later, in 1966, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that AM and FM radio stations could no longer simply simultaneously broadcast the same content, opening the door for Murray to become program director and primetime dj on WOR-FM—one of the first FM rock stations, soon airing such djs as Rosko and Scott Muni in the new FM format. [...] Murray played long album cuts rather than singles, often playing groups of songs by one artist, or thematically linked songs, uninterrupted by commercials. He combined live in-studio interviews with folk-rock—he called it [...] "attitude music"—and all forms of popular music in a free-form format. He played artists like Bob Dylan and Janis Ian, [...] the long album versions of their songs that {{came to be known as}} the [...] "FM cuts". Al Aronowitz quotes Murray as saying about this formula, [...] "You didn't have to hype the record any more. The music was speaking for itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Lutz (1993), while AMC had {{its share}} of problems, it was far from being a bunch of [...] "brain-dead losers". He {{describes}} the [...] "troops" [...] at AMC as more like the Wake Island Marines in battle, [...] "with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy, they were able to roll out an impressive succession of new products". After first reacting with anger to the purchase, Chrysler managers soon anticipated the benefits. To further solidify the organizational competencies held by AMC, Lee Iacocca agreed to retain former AMC units, such as engineering, completely intact. In addition, AMC's lead engineer, François Castaing, was made head of all engineering at Chrysler. In an unthinkable strategic move, Castaing completely dismantled the entrenched Chrysler groups. In their place AMC's [...] "platform team" [...] was implemented. These were close-knit cross-functional groups responsible for the whole vehicle, as contrasted with Chrysler's highly functional structure. In this capacity, Castaing's strategy was to eliminate the corporate administrative overhead bureaucracy. This move shifted corporate culture and agitated veteran executives who believed that Chrysler's reputation as [...] "the engineering company" [...] was being destroyed. Yet, according to the popular press, by the 1980s Chrysler's reputation was totally shot, and in Lutz's view only dramatic action <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> that. In summary, Chrysler's purchase of AMC laid the critical foundation to help re-establish a strategy for its revival in the 1990s.|$|E

60|$|It {{was there}} on the stoep that he died. He had not been well, and one evening I was talking to him, and his mind went back to Oxfordshire and my mother. He spoke of her a good deal, saying {{that she had never}} been out of his mind for a single day during all these years, and that he rejoiced to think he was drawing near that land wither she had gone. Then he asked me if I remembered the night when Squire Carson came into the study at the vicarage, and told him that his wife had run away, and that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his name and bury himself in some remote land.|$|E

That Miss Rasmith has been telling her how much he is run after, and I could see that that settled it for Ellen as plainly as if she said so. More plainly, for there's enough of the girl in her to make her say one thing when she means another.

She refused March's offers of help, and remained quietly seated while he got out their wraps and bags. She returned with a hardy smile the cold leave Mrs. March took of her; and when a porter came to the door, and forced his way by the Marches, to ask with anxious servility if she, were the Baroness von-----, she bade the man get them. a 'traeger', and then come back for her. She waved them a complacent adieu before they mixed with the crowd and lost sight of her.|$|E
60|$|During {{the first}} ten days {{following}} the mailing of the letter Tracy's spirits had no idle time; they were always climbing up into the clouds or sliding down into the earth as deep as the law of gravitation reached.

He never could tell when the mood <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> and when it changed he couldn't tell {{what it was that}} had changed it. Sometimes she was so in love with him that her love was tropical, torrid, and she could find no language fervent enough for its expression; then suddenly, and without warning or any apparent reason, the weather would change, and the victim would find himself adrift among the icebergs and feeling as lonesome and friendless as the north pole. It sometimes seemed to him that a man might better be dead than exposed to these devastating varieties of climate.|$|E
60|$|We {{saw each}} other constantly. And though we had instinctively begun to be careful, I imagine there was some talk among our acquaintances. It is to {{be noted that the}} gossip never became riotous, for we had always been friends, and Nancy had a saving {{reputation}} for coldness. It seemed incredible that Maude had not discovered my secret, but if she knew of it, she gave no sign of her knowledge. Often, as I looked at her, I wished she would. I can think of no more expressive sentence in regard to her than the trite one that she pursued the even tenor of her way; and I found the very perfection of her wifehood exasperating. Our relationship would, I thought, have been more endurable if we had quarrelled. And yet we had grown as far apart, in that big house, as though we had been separated by a continent; I lived in my apartments, she in hers; she consulted me about dinner parties and invitations; for, since we had moved to Grant Avenue, we entertained and went out more than before. It seemed as though she were making every effort consistent with her integrity and self-respect to please me. Outwardly she conformed to the mould; but I had long been aware that inwardly a person had developed. It had not been a spontaneous development, but one in resistance to pressure; and was probably all the stronger for that reason. At times her will revealed itself in astonishing and unexpected flashes, as when once she announced that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> Matthew's school.|$|E
