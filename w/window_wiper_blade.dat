40|$|The {{goal with}} this thesis work was {{to specify the}} {{parameters}} that affect the wiper system cleaning quality of the windshield. The most important parameters were tested so that Volvo can optimise and state requirements on the cleaning system and surrounding details. After studies the parameters were reduced to the three following parameters: - <b>Wiper</b> <b>blade</b> wear - <b>Wiper</b> <b>blade</b> geometry - Windshield surface To get {{a better understanding of}} how these parameters affect the cleaning quality, following three products were tested: • SAFE SIGHT-concept. Small stripes that are supposed to clean and shape up the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> were applied to the windshield. • Coated windshield. A windshield with a hydrophobic coating was tested. The coating forms the water to droplets instead of film. The droplets flow away with the airflow. • Bosch Flatblade Technology. A new <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> with a flat spring design. Has many advantages compared to ordinary blades. The lack of joints and the even pressure over the blade is the most useful. The tests were made in a test rig and in company cars. Two inquiries were answered by the company car drivers about the cleaning quality with the SAFE SIGHT-concept. The tests gave the following results: The SAFE SIGHT stripes improved the cleaning quality but they peeled off too easy and caused some noise. After a longer time, they wore the blade that resulted in a decreased cleaning quality. The need of the wiper system is highly decreased with the coated windshield. This improves the active safety. However, the coating needs an increased durability and decreased cost. These new <b>wiper</b> <b>blades</b> from Bosch is remarkable good. The cost for these blades is higher compared to the ordinary blades but will decrease in the future when the product is introduced to the market. The coated windshield and the Bosch Flatblade Technology gave the best improvement to cleaning quality compared to ordinary wiper systems. The ordinary <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> showed wide stripes after 33000 cycles in the test rig. The new Bosch <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> showed no stripes at all after 119500 cycles. The coated windshield has been successfully tested and received by the test drivers. We recommend Volvo to further development and tests of the coated windshield and the Bosch Flatblade Technology.

40|$|As modern {{passenger}} cars become increasingly quieter, wiper operation vibration and noise become more noticeable. As {{a result of}} the market information analysis, most complaints about the wiper concern operation noise. Wiper vibration and noise is classified into three main categories namely, squeal noise, chattering, and reversal noise. Squeal noise is a high-frequency vibration of about 1000 Hz. Chattering noise is a low-frequency vibration of 100 Hz or less and reversal noise is an impact sound with a frequency of 500 Hz or less produced when the wiper reverses. This paper presents numerical studies on noise and vibration of an automotive <b>wiper</b> <b>blade.</b> A 3 -dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model of a <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> assembly is developed and then validated at the component level using modal analysis. Complex eigenvalue analysis available in ABAQUS is employed to determine stability of the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> assembly.

40|$|Abstract: The {{windshield}} wiper consists of 4 parts: a blade, an arm, a linkage and a motor. The <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> makes {{contact with the}} windshield and {{is designed to be}} operated normally at an angle of 30 ~ 50 degrees to the front glass. If the contact pressure between the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> and windshield surface is too high, noise and wear of the rubber will result. On the other hand, if the contact pressure is too low, the performance will do badly, since foreign substances such as dust and stains will not be removed well. The pressure and friction of the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> has a great influence on its effectiveness in cleaning the front window. This is due to the contact of the rubber with the window. This paper presents the dynamic analysis method to estimate the performance of the flat type <b>blade</b> of the <b>wiper</b> system. The <b>blade</b> has a nonlinear characteristic since the rubber is an incompressible hyper-elastic and visco-elastic material. Thus, Structural dynamic analysis using a complex contact model for the blade is performed to find the characteristics of the blade. The flexible multi-body dynamic model is verified by the comparison between test and analysis result. Also, the optimization using the central composite design table is performed...|$|R
