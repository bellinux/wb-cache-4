500|$|... "Get Together" [...] {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} Stardust's [...] "Music Sounds Better with You" [...] which also contain samples of Chaka Khan's song [...] "Fate". It also refers to Madonna's own songs like [...] "Holiday" [...] (1983) and [...] "Secret" [...] (1994). The song {{is set in}} common time with moderately fast dance groove tempo and a metronome of 126 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of A minor. Madonna's voice spans from A3 to A4. It follows in the chord progression of Em–F–G-Am throughout. The song's lyrics portray an anthem-like picture about the different possibilities of finding love on the dance floor. It includes an allusion to The SOS Band's 1980 single [...] "Take Your Time (Do It Right)" [...] in the line [...] "Baby <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all right." [...] The lyrics comes off as a conversation or an internal dialogue taking place between the listener and the singer.|$|E

500|$|Clarke's tenure {{marked a}} {{difference}} in policy: {{instead of trying to}} divide and rule and undermine the power of the hereditary chiefs, he granted considerable authority to them. He applied a similar approach to that of his previous work in Basutoland. His view was that the native people were [...] "better able to manage their own affairs than <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for them, though they need our help in international matters and in matters between white and black." [...] He gave special judicial functions to Hlubi of the Basotho, Mehlokazulu of the Ngobese and Mpiyakhe of the Mdlalose, enabling them to try certain cases referred to them by Resident Magistrates. In 1895, according to Harriette Colenso, the Zulu people approved of direct rule with Clarke as Resident Commissioner. However, when Clarke was appointed Resident Commissioner in Rhodesia in 1898, Charles Saunders replaced him and he bowed to pressure from settlers and officials to minimise Dinuzulu's influence over the Zulu people, especially during the Second Boer War.|$|E
500|$|Irvine {{scored the}} first {{points for the}} Jaguar team in the race, having failed to score up to that point. He {{described}} the race {{as one of the}} hardest in his Formula One career as his drink bottle did not function correctly along with suffering a blistered foot. He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six months or so to solve... hopefully <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. I felt a few laps before that something was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> In the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

500|$|The next morning, a {{news conference}} {{was held in the}} grand showroom. Giles {{emphasized}} the importance of the route as an indication of the future, both for civil and military aircraft. He warned: [...] "Now that we have proved that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> we must now remember that any future enemy will also be able to do it". LeMay declared that he wanted a second chance to prove that the B-29 was capable of flying 6,500 miles nonstop. He said, [...] "When we took off at Hokkaido we had a little headwind and expected it. However, all our information indicated that once we passed Fairbanks it would drop. We didn't need a tailwind. All we needed was a nice normal wind to arrive on schedule. The buffeting headwind averaged 70 mph" [...] (110km/h). After the reporters were finished, Giles presented all the airmen with the Distinguished Flying Cross. Giles told the men that each one could keep his personal military equipment as a memento of the flight, including parachutes. They were offered free rides home on military aircraft. Potts refused the parachute and the ride, telling Giles, [...] "Thank you, general, I think I'll take the train!" ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E

According to Corbyn, [...] "This war is about oil, control and a message {{to the rest of the}} world and region that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> if we want to". Kate Hudson, chair of the CND, called the military intervention [...] "utterly reprehensible" [...] and Galloway described the intervention as [...] "imperialist war-making". Anti-Gaddafi protesters, in turn, opposed those opposing the intervention. On March 21, approximately 150 people {{demonstrated in}} London in support of Gaddafi and protesting against the UK's intervention in Libya.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{films were}} more potent with propagandistic {{symbolism}} than others. [...] Fifth Column Mouse is a cartoon that through childlike humor and political undertones depicted a possible outcome of World War II. [...] The film {{begins with a}} bunch of mice playing and singing a song about how they never worry. [...] One mouse notices a cat looking in through a window, but is calmed when another mouse tells him that the cat cannot get inside. [...] The cat however, bursts in through the front door alerting a mouse that wears a World War II style air raid warden helmet and screams, “Lights out,” promptly turning off the main light. [...] The phrase, 'lights out,' was a popular saying during the war, especially in major cities to encourage people to turn off their lights to hinder targeting by potential enemy bombers. [...] The same mouse who said the cat could not get inside, ends up getting caught by the cat. [...] The cat tells him that he will not kill him, but will give him cheese if the mouse follows the cat's instructions. [...] During the dialogue between the two, the cat's smile resembles the Tojo bucktooth grin and it speaks with a Japanese accent. [...] Near the end, the cat screams “Now get going!” and the mouse jumps to attention and gives the infamous Nazi salute. [...] The scene cuts to the biddable mouse, now an agent of influence, telling the other mice that the cat is here to “save us and not to enslave us,” “don’t be naughty mice, but appease him” so “hurry and sign a truce.” [...] This message of appeasement and signing a truce would have been all too familiar to the adults in the theaters who were probably with their children. [...] The next clip is of the cat lounging on pillows with multiple mice tending to its every need. [...] However, when the cat reveals that he wants to eat a mouse they all scatter. [...] Inside their hole, a new mouse is encouraging the others to be strong and fight the cat. [...] The mice are then shown marching in step with hardy, confident grins on their faces with “We Did it Before and <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>it</b> Again” by Robert Merrill playing in the background. [...] Amidst the construction of a secret weapon, a poster of a mouse with a rifle is shown with the bold words “For Victory: Buy Bonds and Stamps.” [...] The mice have built a mechanical dog that chases the cat out of the house. [...] Before he leaves though a mouse skins the cat with an electric razor, but leaves three short dots and a long streak of fur on his back. [...] In Morse code, the letter [...] "V" [...] is produced through dot-dot-dot-dash. [...] As depicted in many pictures but made popular by Winston Churchill, the “V” for victory sign was a popular symbol of encouragement for the Allies. [...] The cartoon ends with the mice singing, “We did it before, we did it AGAIN!” ...|$|E
