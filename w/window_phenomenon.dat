Fourteen young male volunteer students were randomly divided into the placebo and jujube solution groups. All participants performed one circuit resistance exercise [9 stations/nonstop, 30 seconds for each station (10 - 14 repetitions), 3 sets with a 3 -minute active rest between sets, and an intensity of 75 % with one repeat maximum]. In an acute supplementation protocol, participants received either a placebo or a jujube solution (0. 5 g/kgbody weight in 2. 5 cc of distilled water) an hour before testing. Blood samples were collected 60 minutes before feeding, immediately after, and 2 hours after the exercise. In the short-term supplementation protocol, participants received either placebos or jujube solutions (0. 5 g/kgbody weight in 2. 5 cc of distilled water) {{for as long as}} 7 days at certain times and in a double-blind manner. Blood samples were collected 30 minutes before, immediately after, and 2 hours after the exercise. WBC, lymphocytes (LYM), and neutrophils (NEUT) were measured with a hematology auto analyzer. The WBC, LYM, and NEUT were not affected by both acute and short-term supplementation type; but WBC and NEUT was increased during exercise and also recovery period. However, NEUT:LYM ratio were not affected by acute supplementation type; but in short-term supplementation, when it increased in the placebo group during the recovery period, its alterations were insignificant in the jujube solution group (p= 0. 045). In conclusion, jujube solution loading during one week probably could inhibit acute stress resulted from relatively intense circuit resistance exercise and probably could protect from inflammation and open <b>window</b> <b>phenomenon</b> resulted from exercise.

40|$|Extremely-low-frequency {{magnetic}} fields {{are known to}} affect biological systems. In many cases, biological effects display `windows' in biologically effective parameters of the {{magnetic fields}}: most dramatic {{is the fact that}} relatively intense magnetic fields sometimes do not cause appreciable effect, while smaller fields of the order of 10 [...] 100 μT do. Linear resonant physical processes do not explain frequency windows in this case. Amplitude <b>window</b> <b>phenomena</b> suggest a nonlinear physical mechanism. Such a nonlinear mechanism has been proposed recently to explain those `windows'. It considers quantum-interference effects on protein-bound substrate ions. Magnetic fields cause an interference of ion quantum states and change the probability of ion-protein dissociation. This ion-interference mechanism predicts specific magnetic-field frequency and amplitude windows within which biological effects occur. It agrees with a lot of experiments. However, according to the mechanism, the lifetime Γ^- 1 of ion quantum states within a protein cavity should be of unrealistic value, more than 0. 01 s for frequency band 10 [...] 100 Hz. In this paper, a biophysical mechanism has been proposed that (i) retains the attractive features of the ion interference mechanism and (ii) uses the principles of gyroscopic motion and removes the necessity to postulate large lifetimes. The mechanism considers dynamics of the density matrix of the molecular groups, which are attached to the walls of protein cavities by two covalent bonds, i. e., molecular gyroscopes. Numerical computations have shown almost free rotations of the molecular gyros. The relaxation time due to van der Waals forces was about 0. 01 s for the cavity size of 28 angströms.

Hence, if long range dependence is not considered for synthesizing experimental network traffic, it will lead to incorrect assessments of performance evaluation in network system. This arises the need of a well synthesizing trace with long range dependence. In this thesis, we present a filter-based method for synthesizing self-similar network traffic. This method improves the well-known methods of Paxison Fourier Transform and Random Midpoint Displacement in that the length of the synthesized traffic sequence does not need to pre-specify, and also the synthesized sequence is always non-negative. Although our method may have the drawback of becoming non-self-similar when the generated trace is aggregated under a very large <b>window,</b> this <b>phenomenon</b> turns out to match the measured behavior of true network traffic, where the self-similar nature only lasts beyond a practically manageable range, but disappears as the considered aggregated window is much further extended. i In memory of my father...|$|R
