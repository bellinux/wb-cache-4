40|$|The heat of {{pyrolysis}} of beech and spruce {{wood was}} investigated {{by means of}} a differential scanning calorimeter. Wide variations were found for the heat of the primary pyrolysis process, depending on the initial sample weight and on the conditions used in the measurements. However, reporting the heat of the primary pyrolysis process versus the final char yield resulted in a linear correlation. This strong dependency of the heat of <b>wood</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> on the final char yield, that is in turn highly sensitive to the experimental conditions, can explain the uncertainty of the data for the heat of <b>wood</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> reported in the literature. A possible explanation for the variability of the heat of <b>wood</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> depending on the final char yield seems to be an exothermic primary char formation process competing with an endothermic volatile formation process. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|To {{improve the}} design and {{operation}} of a biomass gasifier, mathematical modelling is important and helpful. In this dissertation, the physical and chemical processes occuring in the gasifier are investigated, Three models for different proto-types and purposes are formulated. Balance Model: Chemical equilibrium is assumed in this model. The equilibrium compositions and adiabatic flame temperature are calculated by "equilibrium constant method" and "mass and energy balance". The simple algorithm can get convergence rapidly. Using this model, air, steam, oxygen, hydro and steam-external-heat-supplied gasification are studied under different operational conditions. One-Dimensional model for Circulating-Fluidized Bed Gasifier: The model {{is a combination of}} "balance model" and "Kinetic model". In the char oxidation zone, which is composed of circulating char and hot sand, balance model mentioned above is used to calculate the temperature and gas compositions. In the pyrolysis-reduction zone, kinetic model is developed, which incorporates mass and energy convervation, kinetics of <b>wood</b> fast <b>pyrolysis,</b> char reduction and water-gas shift reaction. The model can be used to predict the necessary dimensions for this kind of gasifier. One-Dimensional model for Up-Draft Gasifier: The important processes considered are conventive heat and mass transfer between gas and solid phase, heat conduction of the solid phase, kinetics of <b>wood</b> slow <b>pyrolysis,</b> char reduction, char oxidation and has phase reactions. The conduction term in the energy equation has empirically accounted for particle-particle radiative heat transfer by "effective thermal conductivity" of the solid phase. In the high-temperature packed-bed reactor, where gas and solid flow rate is low, the conductive and radiactive heat transfer may be as important as conventive heat transfer. The overlooking of these processes will cause numerical stiffness of the differantional equations describing mass and energy conservation. The set of second-order, non-linear differentional equations and auxiliary algebraic equations are integrated along the reactor height, yielding the temperature profile, gas composition and carbon conversion profile. Gas and solid phase residence time are also calculated. 本文应用固体生物质热化学转换基础理论研究的知识，结合化学热力学、化学动力学、流动与混合、传热与传质的有关知识，建立了固体生物质气化器的平衡模型、载汉床气化器一维数学模型和固定床气化器一维数学模型，应用上述模型，研究了各种气化方案的运行条件和气化效果，分析计算了载流床气化器和固定床气化器的合适的气化器尺寸，模型的建立对于发展固体生物质气化器的设计理论有重要的意义...|$|R

The applicability of the model in predicting actual biomass pyrolysis assessed by comparing the model to TGA experimental measurements. The comparison to experiments is done {{in relation to the}} mass loss characteristics of chips of varying sizes. The mass loss is of interest as it is a variable necessary in the coupling of reactor and particle models. Three reaction models were simulated and results compared to experimental data, namely, the reaction model developed by Park et al.

The objectives are to evaluate the influence of heating rates on pyrolysis products obtained from <b>wood</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> and to evaluate the influence of acid pre-treatment on pyrolysis products. Depending on the wood heating rates, pyrolysis can be categorized as Flash pyrolysis, Fast pyrolysis, and Slow pyrolysis. We have evaluated the volatile products obtained at different heating rates and the volatile products obtained from sulfuric acid pre-treatment by using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We have also performed thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of raw wood samples and sulfuric acid pre-treated wood samples of Yellow Pine to determine the changes in weight in relation to change in temperature. Our results indicated that by using the Flash, Fast, and Slow heating rates, the overall volatile products obtained from <b>wood</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> (i. e. the overall list of all the compounds obtained from different temperature ranges in <b>wood</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> by using different heating rates) were the same, but the volatile products obtained at different temperature ranges like Room temperature- 300 °C, 300 °C - 400 °C, and 400 °C - 500 °C in Flash, Fast, and Slow pyrolysis were different. Most of the volatile products obtained from the pyrolysis of untreated wood were phenols. Our results also indicated that the pretreatment of wood with sulfuric acid alters the charcoal properties and releases gaseous products including furan derivatives that are useful as fuels or fuel additives. The sulfuric acid (10 %) pretreatment of wood followed by slow pyrolysis produced maximum yield of charcoal, indicated by the lowest mass % decrease of 58. 234. The production of furan derivatives increased by using sulfuric acid pre-treatment, which is a good improvement for the production of Furanics, the furan based biofuels. The furan based biofuels are of increasing research interest because of their significant advantages over the first generation biofuels. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results indicated that the acid pre-treatment altered the decomposition rate of pyrolysis and lowered the onset of temperature for decomposition.
