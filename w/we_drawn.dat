Here were <b>we,</b> <b>drawn</b> together by mutual rage and the impulse toward cooperation, led off into forgetfulness by {{the establishment of}} a rude rhythm.

In ways the hee-hee council was an adumbration of the councils of primitive man, and of the great national assemblies and international conventions of latter-day man. But we Folk of the Younger World lacked speech, and whenever we were so drawn together we precipitated babel, out of which arose a unanimity of rhythm that contained within itself the essentials of art yet to come. It was art nascent.|$|E

60|$|One {{day we were}} {{becalmed}} among a {{group of}} small islands, most of which appeared to be uninhabited. As we were in want of fresh water, the captain sent the boat ashore to bring off a cask or two. But we were mistaken in thinking there were no natives; for scarcely had <b>we</b> <b>drawn</b> near to the shore when a band of naked blacks rushed out of the bush and assembled on the beach, brandishing their clubs and spears in a threatening manner. Our men were well armed, but refrained from showing any signs of hostility, and rowed nearer in order to converse with the natives; and I now found that more than one of the crew could imperfectly speak dialects of the language peculiar to the South Sea Islanders. When within forty yards of the shore we ceased rowing, and the first mate stood up to address the multitude; but instead of answering us, they replied with a shower of stones, some of which cut the men severely. Instantly our muskets were levelled, and a volley was about to be fired when the captain hailed us in a loud voice from the schooner, which lay not more than five or six hundred yards off the shore.|$|E

We pointed out that all kinds of {{published}} solutions could be concluded as three kinds of type techniques: explicit storage of multi-scale vector data, multi-scale spatial index, multi-scale vector data storage structure. Because there is more fertile soil to seed multi-scale spatial index method, we expatiated six kinds of multi-scale spatial index method, such as Reactive Tree, GAP-tree, Multi-Scale Hilbert R-tree, Multiple R-tree, and followed their development in recent years. According to our research experiments, we discussed their advantages and disadvantages, and provided some academic bases for their chosen and applications.

30|$|Through {{using the}} first-principle method as {{implemented}} in the CASTEP code, we have optimized four models which simulate the relative configurations of TiC in the W lattice. By using the total energy and enthalpy as the standard, we have analyzed the obtained results. We conclude that although there exists W–C interactions which weaken the Ti–C bonding, the Ti–C units tend to stay together to keep the structural character in the TiC structure. This provides {{an explanation for the}} experimental phenomenon of phase separation between W and TiC at nano-scale. However, we must point out that our conclusion is based on the relative smaller models which limit the choice of the supercell. Besides, our models involve only the chain configuration and the two atom Ti–C unit, therefore, it is worth further studies on more and larger realistic models to test the reliability of the conclusions that <b>we</b> <b>drawn</b> here.|$|E
30|$|Comparing the {{fracture}} geometry and production data of patterns (a), (c) and (d), the final production drops with {{the reduction in}} {{the fracture}} connectivity, although the synthesized length of the fracture increases. So when the complex geometry of the fracture network is considered, the fracture connectivity performs a more critical influence on the well performance than the facture half-length. Combined with the conclusion <b>we</b> <b>drawn</b> before, the efficiency of the fracture network, related to the complexity and connectivity, is a determining factor to the well production, and only considering the increase on the fracture half-length in the shale gas development may contribute little to the final recovery. On the other hand, both pattern (a) and pattern (b) are low in connectivity and production, but the final production of pattern (a) is higher, showing that the synthesized half-length of the fracture network is still positive to the fracture performance.|$|E

40|$|As {{supply chain}} {{management}} research and its adoption advance, new challenges are imposed for researchers and managers. Accordingly, the supply chain risk management (SCRM) has been a prominent field because it suggests strategies and action plans to mitigate these risks. On the other hand, {{it is observed that}} the coopetition concept advocates that two competing organizations can work together in some activities {{in the form of a}} strategic alliance, contributing to achieve maximum efficiency. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose the extension of this concept into the activities of SCRM, treating coopetition as an action that can be added to the risk management efforts in order to make supply chains more resilient. Thus, through an exploratory literature search that uses secondary data, <b>we</b> <b>drawn</b> two propositions that deal with the possibility of adding a coopetitor to reduce risks in supply chains and on the feasibility of balanced coopetition changes the profile of a supply chain to a resilient model. Although these propositions require further empirical verification, it is believed that this is a good start for discussions about the benefits and competitive advantages that the adoption of coopetition in risk management activities in supply chains can bring to organizations...|$|E
40|$|Heart Failure (HF) is {{an acute}} or chronic syndrome, that causes {{a lot of}} {{damaging}} effects to every system. The involvement of different systems is variably related to age and others comorbidities. The severity of organ damage is often proportional to the duration of heart failure. The typology of HF and the duration determine which organs will be affected and vice versa the severity of organ damage supplies precious information about prognosis and outcome of patients with heart failure. Moreover, a classification based not only on symptomatic and syndromic typical features of heart failure, but also on functional data of each system, could allow us to apply the most appropriate therapies, to obtain a more accurate prognosis, and to employ necessary and not redundant human and financial resources. With {{an eye on the}} TNM staging used in oncology, <b>we</b> <b>drawn</b> up a classification that will consider the different involvement of organs such as lungs, kidneys, and liver in addition to psychological pattern and quality of life in HF patients. For all these reasons, it is our intention to propose a valid and more specific classification available for the clinical staging of HF that takes into account pathophysiological and structural changes that can remark prognosis and management of HF...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, several {{advanced}} ICT infrastructures demand multicast services able to jointly {{provide a}} high degree of reliability and good performances despite of failure occurrences. The current practice to tolerate failures in such services mainly consists in the adoption of methods based on temporal redundancy, where messages are successfully delivered to all the interested destinations by means of retransmissions. However, in such methods, {{a high degree}} of reliability is typically obtained at the expenses of severe performance fluctuations and instability. On the contrary, approaches that make use of forward error correction imply a more performance-friendly behavior; however, the effective tuning of such approaches is a critical and challenging task, which has limited their applicability in large-scale multicast services. This paper is aimed at presenting a solution to resolve this issue by effectively tuning the redundancy degree to be applied, so as to be able to tolerate the losses affecting the multicast communications without an excessive, and un-needed, workload imposed over the network. To this aim, <b>we</b> <b>drawn</b> from the experience of layered multicast, commonly applied to multimedia content delivery, for addressing such tunability problem. Specifically, we detail how to apply layered multicast {{within the context of a}} well known multicast service and how to determine the correct redundancy degree to be applied. We also make use of extensive simulations to evaluate the quality of the proposed approach in terms of reliability, performance and overhead, and to compare it with the best retransmission-based approach available in the literature...|$|E
