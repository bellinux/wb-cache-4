5|$|Evolving {{methods of}} {{transportation}} and distribution led to declining business and {{the closing of the}} Union Stock Yards in 1971. National <b>Wrecking</b> Company negotiated a contract whereby National <b>Wrecking</b> cleared a 102-acre site and removed some 50 acres of animal pens, auxiliary buildings and the eight story Exchange Building. It took approximately eight months to complete the job and ready the site for the building of an industrial park.|$|E

40|$|The Museum Act (1969) gives legal {{protection}} to vessels <b>wrecked</b> or stranded before 1900.

5|$|Like {{the other}} New River settlers, Cooley did not buy land; he simply {{occupied}} {{the land in}} hope that the United States would eventually survey the area and grant ownership to the present settlers.

5|$|A play, The Doom Bar, about {{smuggling}} and <b>wrecking</b> {{was written}} in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush. Although there was no interest in London it was well received in America, and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York. A series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary wrecker Cruel Coppinger, culminating in a fire at Baltimore, caused the play to be considered cursed by America's actors' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make {{a crack in the}} dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a <b>wrecking</b> ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the <b>wrecking</b> ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E

25|$|The British Protection of <b>Wrecks</b> Act, enacted {{to protect}} {{historic}} <b>wrecks,</b> controls access to <b>wrecks</b> such as Cattewater <b>Wreck</b> {{which can only}} be visited or investigated under licence. The British Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 also restricts access to <b>wrecks</b> which are sensitive as war graves. The Protection of Military Remains Act in some cases creates a blanket ban on all diving; for other <b>wrecks</b> divers may visit provided they do not touch, interfere with or penetrate the <b>wreck.</b> In the United States, shipwrecks in state waters are regulated by the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act of 1987. This act is much more lenient in allowing more open access to the shipwrecks.|$|R
25|$|The team {{discovered}} three ancient <b>wrecks</b> to {{the west}} of the town of Sinop at depths of 100 m. <b>Wreck</b> A and <b>Wreck</b> C probably date to the late Roman period (2nd–4th century A.D.), while <b>Wreck</b> B probably dates to the Byzantine period (5th to 7th century A.D.).|$|R
5|$|On Ralph's death a second-cousin of dramatist William Congreve {{inherited}} the manor. The Congreve Family owned the estate {{at the time}} of the 1830 Swing Riots. The rioters marched across Aldermaston, <b>wrecking</b> twenty-three agricultural machines. Workers were so frightened by the riots that they left their machinery in the open in an attempt to limit additional damage. Around the same time, the River Kennet (along the north side of the estate) was made navigable between Reading and Newbury.|$|E

5|$|The {{main belt}} armour would {{normally}} taper {{to a lesser}} thickness {{along the side of}} the hull towards bow and stern; it might also taper up from the central citadel towards the superstructure. The deck was typically lightly armoured with 2 to 4inches of steel. This lighter armour was to prevent high-explosive shells from <b>wrecking</b> the superstructure of the ship.|$|E
50|$|So-called <b>wreck</b> masters {{used to be}} {{employed}} in the Danish coastal communities, in order to oversee, report on and collect valuables from new <b>wrecks.</b> A former <b>wreck</b> masters home can be experienced at the <b>Wreck</b> Master's Farm near Rubjerg Knude on the North Atlantic coast for example. The last <b>wreck</b> master here left in 1992. A few <b>wreck</b> masters are still appointed in Denmark, but nowadays the job also includes observations and reporting on oil spills, pollutions, vandalism, etc., and they work in close cooperation with the police.|$|R
5000|$|A team of {{maritime}} {{archaeologists and}} volunteer divers {{led by the}} South Australian Government’s State Heritage Branch located the <b>wreck</b> site in April 1986.

50|$|The <b>wreck</b> {{was found}} in 1972 during a {{magnetometer}} survey by a boat operated by a subsidiary of Mel Fisher's Treasure Salvors, Inc. (Fisher's company was searching for the Nuestra Señora de Atocha and other ships of the 1622 Spanish treasure fleet that had <b>wrecked</b> along the Florida Keys in a hurricane.) Two anchors and a cannon {{were found on the}} first visit. The <b>wreck</b> was visited again in 1973. Some artifacts were collected from the <b>wreck,</b> including bilboes, iron shackles that were used to restrain slaves. When they realized that the <b>wreck</b> was likely a slave ship, not a treasure ship, the company reburied the artifacts and pieces of the ship's hull that they had exposed and left the site. In 1983 through 1985 Henry Taylor, sub-contracting with Mel Fisher's company, excavated the <b>wreck</b> (known as the English <b>wreck)</b> with the assistance of archaeologist David Moore. The <b>wreck</b> was identified when a bronze ship's bell carrying the inscription The Henrietta Marie 1699 was found at the <b>wreck</b> site. Survey and excavation of the <b>wreck</b> site has continued at intervals.|$|R
5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, <b>wrecking</b> her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{original}} music video, {{directed by}} Samuel Bayer, depicts the band performing {{in a home}} being destroyed by a <b>wrecking</b> ball in a metaphor for divorce.

5|$|There {{are also}} four {{different}} game types: Championship, Race Practice, Time Trial, and Multi Player. In Championship, players {{compete in a}} league of seasons consisting of four races and, in <b>Wrecking</b> Racing, a Destruction Derby match. In Race Practice, players practise a race, while Time Trials consists of a race against the clock. Multi Player allows up to nine players to race individually. After all have finished, a league table showing their placings is displayed.|$|E

25|$|The <b>wreck</b> {{is rapidly}} {{disintegrating}} due to natural rusting. The dive boats {{that rely on}} the <b>wreck</b> for their livelihood are also tearing the <b>wreck</b> apart by mooring the boats to weak parts of the <b>wreck,</b> leading to parts of the <b>wreck</b> collapsing. For this reason, in December 2007 the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA) a non-governmental organisation installed 32 permanent mooring buoys and drilled holes in the <b>wreck</b> to allow trapped air to escape. During this work, the vessel was closed off to recreational diving. However, as of 2009, none of these moorings remain as the blocks themselves were too light (resulting in ships dragging them), and the lines connecting the moorings to the <b>wreck</b> were too long (meaning with the strong currents in the area, people would find it impossible to transfer from the mooring to the actual <b>wreck).</b> As a result, all boats now moor off directly to the <b>wreck</b> again.|$|R
