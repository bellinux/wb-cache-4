40|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that people who drive for work purposes engage in less safe driving practices than other drivers. This issue was examined by surveying 204 people who drive for work purposes, from four different organisations. It was predicted that work-related drivers would report more unsafe driving behaviours in a <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> in comparison to their personal vehicle. In support of this prediction, the participants reported higher crash involvement rates in their <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> (per kilometre travelled) than their personal vehicle. The participants were also less likely to engage in vehicle checking practices in their <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> compared with their personal vehicle. Contrary to prediction, participants reported that they were less likely to speed or engage in dangerous driving in a <b>work</b> <b>vehicle</b> than their personal vehicle. There was also {{some evidence}} that the fleet safety policies and practices in place within each organisation had a positive impact on driver behaviour. The results obtained in this study both confirm and challenge popular beliefs regarding work-related drivers. Replication of these findings with a larger sample of drivers across more diverse vehicle fleets is an important area for future research...|$|R

50|$|The Online Heists update was {{a highly}} {{anticipated}} feature of Grand Theft Auto Online. After numerous delays, the update launched on 10 March 2015, suffering some initial technical difficulties due to the increased user load. Ill-Gotten Gains Part 1, released on 10 June 2015, added additional vehicles, clothing items and weapon decals. Some gameplay features were also affected, such as a redesign of the in-game car websites, {{the addition of a}} first-person vehicle hood camera in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions, and the ability to cycle through targets when using lock-on missiles, among other minor changes. Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2, released on 8 July 2015, added vehicles and weapons. It also added the radio station The Lab, previously exclusive to the Windows version of the game, to all other versions. This was also the final update for both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, citing hardware limitations. Lowriders, released on 10 October 2015, added additional vehicles, available vehicle upgrades, weapons, clothing items and Benny's Original Motor <b>Works</b> <b>vehicle</b> shop. The update gave players the ability to obtain and customize Lowriders, including upgrades such as interior customization, hydraulics, and decals. The update also introduced the machete and machine-pistol weapons. Halloween Surprise, released on 29 October 2015 for a limited time, featured two new Halloween-themed vehicles, flashlight and additional masks and ornaments, along with slasher-themed Adversary Modes. They were available until 16 November 2015. The Festive Surprise update returned on 21 December 2015. In addition to the items available in the previous iteration, the new iteration added new festive themed clothes, fifteen new masks and a new car. The update also added a new Adversary mode on 23 December 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} equipped with eight unique bogie single-decked tramcars, {{designed by the}} GCR and built by Brush, to which four more were added in 1913, and a further four (built by the GCR themselves) in 1914. Four of the original cars were short-bodied, intended for through operation onto the Grimsby street tramways, {{but the majority of}} the fleet, at 43 feet 8 inches feet (16.51 metres) overall length, were by far the largest British trams until modern times: with 72 seats, they had a larger capacity than many contemporary double-deckers. Although relatively progressive for the period, the cars lacked what were already becoming refinements in Europe: they used trolley-poles not pantograph collectors and they lacked any means of coupled or multiple-unit operation, thus failing to exploit the main labour-saving qualities of modern tramcars. The cars had wooden swing-back lateral seats throughout their lives. They had a central luggage and goods compartment (known locally as [...] "The Horse Box") and handled milk, produce, and small consignments. All remaining cars were painted in BR ‘electric green’ after 1951, replacing LNER brown livery.After 1945 Grimsby Corporation promoted a 200-acre industrial estate west of the town and near the G&IER, {{and in the absence of}} any direct road workers at the new factories also relied on the tramway. To handle the extra passenger traffic British Railways acquired three single-decked bogie trams from Newcastle Corporation Transport in 1948 (the only cars on the line to have upholstered seats) and a further nineteen were bought in 1951 from the Gateshead and District Tramways Company, which had just ceased operation (one was dropped whilst being craned into the shed during delivery and destroyed, so only eighteen entered service). The ex-Gateshead cars had wooden longitudinal bench seats, allowing more standing room down the vehicles' centres. By then the four ‘short’ trams had been withdrawn, whilst four GCR-type cars and the ex-Newcastle trams were withdrawn by 1953: the undertaking had a maximum of 25 passenger trams in operation by 1954 out of 37 supplied (one of the Gateshead cars was adapted as a <b>works</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and given District Engineer’s number 320224, probably the highest ever carried by a tram anywhere).|$|E

40|$|Edinburgh is {{the capital}} of Scotland. The other main cities are Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen. In 1974 Scotland was divided into 12 regions and 53 districts. All heavy {{industries}} in Scotland declined through the 1980 s with the closure of many coal pits, as these heavy industries were based on coal. At present steel <b>works,</b> <b>vehicle</b> building, whisky making, oil service on the East Coast, textiles, agriculture and forestry, fishing and fish farming and tourism are the mainstay of the economy of Scotland. This paper deals with tourism in Scotland, especially its importance to the local economy. The contribution of tourism to GDP in Scotland is about 5 per cent and it accounts for 8 per cent of Scottish employment. This tourism needs to be sustainable, if the future society is {{to benefit from the}} activity of tourism. The paper considers the question of sustainable tourism and how Scotland will be able to achieve this. Sustainable tourism development in Scotland is an approach to achieve development goals with minimum depletion of natural resources and without depleting the cultural resources and degrading the environment. The long-term viability of the Scottish tourism industry is dependant upon the maintenance of natural, cultural and historical attractions. Without responsible management practices the tourism industry in Scotland can degrade the very fabric on which its future prosperity is based. The paper discusses how this responsible management may be brought about. The paper also demonstrates that because of the direct linkage between tourism activities in Scotland and the environmental quality in Scotland, sustainable tourism development in Scotland is not possible without careful planning by the government and full participation by the Tourism industry...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} a broad investigation of work-related road safety in South Australia in three distinct parts. In the first part, {{a review of}} national and international literature on work-related road safety is conducted. The second part {{presents a}}n analysis on the burden of work-related light vehicle crashes in South Australia for the years 2006 to 2010. Three separate methods of identifying <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> that were involved in South Australia crashes were utilised. Each of the methods identified {{a particular set of}} <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> which were then analysed separately. Despite this, the results from each method were reasonably consistent. Compared to non-work vehicles, the crash involved <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{were more likely to be}} newer, travel during daytime hours on weekdays, and be driven by males of working age. A large proportion of the <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> were found to consist of commercial-type vehicles such as utilities, vans, and station wagons, which are less likely to be fitted with safety features that are common on other light vehicles. Another finding was that <b>work</b> <b>vehicles</b> that crashed in the greater Adelaide metropolitan area between 6 am and 7 pm on a weekday while being driven by a person younger than 65, had a higher crash risk than non-work vehicles. No definitive reason for the increased crash risk could be identified. In the third part of the report, an analysis of the crash and injury experience of a large government light vehicle fleet in South Australia is presented. Information on the safety features of each vehicle that entered the government fleet between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2010 were obtained, along with details on crash involvement and total travel distance. Within the government fleet, the uptake of safety features over time was similar to that of the general vehicle fleet and even greater for some features such as electronic stability control and traction control. Analysis of the crash data (while controlling for total travel distance) revealed that the crash rate of the government fleet had reduced over time. With respect to the different safety features installed on each vehicle, it was found that those vehicles that were equipped with ESC or had a 5 -star ANCAP safety rating had a statistically significantly lower crash rate compared to those that were not.
