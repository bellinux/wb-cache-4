5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is {{the maximum number}} of linearly {{independent}} row vectors of the matrix, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent column vectors. Equivalently it is the dimension of the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank–nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix.|$|E

5|$|A {{theory that}} they were {{descendants}} of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the Andhra Ikshvaku (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath has failed to explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves Vashisthiputras of the Hiranyakagotra. The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as Harithiputras of Manavyasagotra in their inscriptions, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lineage as their early overlords, the Kadambas of Banavasi. This makes them descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas {{took control of the}} territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas.|$|E

5|$|Churchill Falls is {{a single}} {{underground}} generation station located on the Churchill River {{near the town of}} Churchill Falls and the Smallwood Reservoir in Labrador. It was constructed over a period of five to six years from 1966 to 1971–72 by the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation (CFLCo), though generators were installed after major construction was completed. The single generation facility cost C$946 million to construct and produced 5,225MW of power initially after all eleven generating units were installed. A station upgrade in 1985 raised the generating capacity to over 5,400MW. Hydro-Québec Generation owns a 34.2% interest in CFLCo, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> company that constructed the generating plant. However, Hydro-Québec has rights to most of the 5,400MW of power the station produces under a 65-year power purchase agreement, expiring in 2041.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} {{well-known}} Tertön Pema Lingpa of Bumthang, who founded many monasteries {{in various parts}} of Bhutan, was also instrumental in creating religious and secular dance forms from his conception of the 'Zandog Pelri' (the Copper Colored mountain), which was the abode of the Guru Padmasambahva (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place as the Paro Taktsang or Tiger's nest). This dance is performed in Paro as the Tsche festival. But it was during the time of Ngawang Namgyal of the Drukpa subsect, who fled Tibet to escape persecution by the opposing sect of the Gelugpa order (which dominated Tibet under the Dalai Lamas), that an administrative mechanism was established in Bhutan.|$|E

Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
5|$|Before the promotion's purchase, {{the final}} champions {{recognized}} by WCW were Sean O' Haire and Chuck Palumbo; {{they were also}} the first champions under the titles operation in the WWF. On November 18, 2001, the championship was deactivated after its use in the Invasion storyline. The title was unified with the WWF Tag Team Championship, and the final champions recognized by the WWF, were The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). The title was won in Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United States. Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) held the most reigns as a tag team (10), and Booker T held the most individual reigns (11), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of times the title was vacated. At 282 days, Doom's reign during WCW's NWA withdrawal was the longest in the championship's history. Overall, there were 143 title reigns.|$|E
5|$|First {{displayed}} in June 2012 at Computex, the Zenbook Touch series has touch screens {{to take advantage}} of the Windows 8 operating system. The Zenbook Touch series includes the UX31A <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the Zenbook Prime, but with a touch enabled screen, and the U500VZ, a 15inch model. A UX21A with a touch enabled screen was also demonstrated at Computex in June and officially announced in late August, though at the launch event on October23, 2012, only the UX31A and the U500VZ were displayed. The U500VZ is thicker than previous Zenbooks at 20mm (0.79") and uses a standard Ivy Bridge mobile processor rather than the ultra-low voltage CPUs used in other Zenbooks, thus technically pushing it out of the ultrabook category, although it still meets other ultrabook specifications. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the touch screen to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his trial of a Zenbook Touch at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price.|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo 64 version {{features}} two game types: Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, {{where the}} objective is to kill as many opposing players as possible; and Frag Tag, in which one random player is transformed into a monkey with no attacks and very little health. The monkey's task is to go to a specific point to return to their normal form and transform another random player into the monkey. Players gain points by killing the monkey and lose points if they die as the monkey. The Microsoft Windows version features three game types: Rok Match, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Deathmatch; Arena, where two players or teams must battle against each other in an arena setting. The winning player or team will have to face a new opponent. If the player or team loses, they will have to get in line and wait for their next turn to fight again; and Capture the Flag, where the goal is to capture opposing flags and return it to a team's base.|$|E

Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (Quanzhou) in China, or at Sin-Kilan, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
