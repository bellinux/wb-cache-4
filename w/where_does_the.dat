2500|$|Generally, simple {{programs}} {{tend to have}} a {{very simple}} abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things. [...] This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, <b>where</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs {{can be seen as a}} minimal example of emergence. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a brute-force search through all of the possible components for the best match.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Marshall concurred in Justice Stewart’s {{opinion on}} {{standing}} to sue but also was [...] "convinced {{there is no}} lack of judicial power to issue a preliminary injunction against the interim surcharge..." [...] He believed that, [...] "roperly viewed...the injunction at issue in this case amounts to {{nothing more than a}} legitimate effort by the District Court, following the Commission’s refusal to suspend the surcharge, {{to maintain the status quo}} pending final determination of the legality of the Commission’s action at the suspension stage in light of the requirements of NEPA." [...] He reasoned that, [...] "This Court has consistently adhered to the view that it will find federal courts to have been deprived of their traditional power to stay orders under review only in the face of the clearest evidence of a congressional intent to do so…. No such clear intent is to be found in the Interstate Commerce Act…." [...] The Commission also was not entitled to deference because it had special expertise in environmental matters. Consequently, [...] "the grant of preliminary relief here involves no such interference with the Commission’s initial exercise of its particular expertise... <b>where</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Interstate Commerce Act make provision for an accounting and 'refund' to the people of our Nation for the irreversible ecological damage that results from a rate increase which discriminates unreasonably against recyclable materials and has been allowed to take effect without compliance with the procedural requirements of NEPA?" [...] Citing Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U.S. at 17, Justice Marshall opined that Congress [...] "knew how to use apt words" [...] if it wanted to deprive the District Court of its historic power to enjoin agency actions to preserve its jurisdiction.|$|E
