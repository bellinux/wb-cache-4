5|$|As {{the race}} continues, {{several of the}} vessels are {{destroyed}} by explosions. The Doctor suspects that the crew aboard the Buccaneer, a 17th-century pirate ship, responsible {{as it was the}} closest vessel at the time of destruction. Turlough, while attempting to escape control of the Black Guardian, ends up aboard the Buccaneer, and meets the Eternal Captain <b>Wrack,</b> learning she too is working for the Black Guardian. He finds equipment aboard her ship that appears to be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian's voice nearby. Later, <b>Wrack</b> offers the Edwardian officers a reception aboard her ship. During the reception, Turlough demonstrates the equipment to the Doctor, while <b>Wrack</b> gifts Tegan with a tiara with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the Buccaneer nearing the Edwardian ship, and determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the tiara before <b>Wrack</b> can destroy the ship.|$|E
5|$|The islanders' {{livelihood}} {{was based}} on fishing (for white fish, herring and lobster), crofting (with up to 55 ha (0.21 sq mi) of arable and pasture land fertilised by <b>wrack</b> on which sheep, cattle, ponies, pigs and poultry were kept) and very dependent on the bounty provided by seabirds. For example, rent was payable to The MacNeil in fachaich or ‘fatlings’ - shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the race, {{the solar}} winds {{dissipate}} and the Buccaneer pulls ahead of the Edwardian ship. Not wishing to see <b>Wrack</b> win, the Eternals return the TARDIS to the Doctor, allowing him to travel to the Buccaneer. However, he is captured, and Wrack's first mate suggest that the Doctor and Turlough be thrown overboard. From the Edwardian ship, Tegan and the others watch as two bodies are ejected from the Buccaneer just before it crosses the finish line.|$|E

5|$|The smooth toadfish {{is found}} along Australia's eastern and {{southeast}} coast, from Moreton Bay in southeastern Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia {{as well as}} Kangaroo Island and Tasmania. It {{is one of the}} most abundant fishes in the muddy areas of Port Philip Bay. It generally lives in shallow water less than 3m (10ft) deep, often over mudflats in estuaries. In areas of seagrass beds, smooth toadfish are more commonly found in sand areas bordering on the seagrass patches. They are more commonly found in seagrass patches in water less than 1.5m (5ft) deep rather than deeper water of 3.5–6m (11–20ft). A South Australian field study on <b>wrack</b> and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing green algae.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{species in}} the North Sea include species of <b>wrack,</b> among them bladder <b>wrack,</b> knotted <b>wrack,</b> and {{serrated}} <b>wrack.</b> Algae, macroalgal, and kelp, such as oarweed and laminaria hyperboria, and species of maerl are found as well. Eelgrass, formerly common in {{the entirety of the}} Wadden Sea, was nearly wiped out in the 20th century by a disease. Similarly, sea grass used to coat huge tracts of ocean floor, but have been damaged by trawling and dredging have diminished its habitat and prevented its return. Invasive Japanese seaweed has spread along the shores of the sea clogging harbours and inlets and has become a nuisance.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships and}} their human crews are {{returned}} to Earth and the Guardians dismiss the other Eternals. It is {{revealed that the}} Doctor won the race, with <b>Wrack</b> and her first mate having suffered [...] "an unfortunate accident". The Doctor refuses the prize, but as Turlough helped the Doctor, he is entitled to {{a portion of the}} prize. The Black Guardian reminds Turlough of their bargain, and says that he can give up the diamond, or sacrifice the Doctor to gain both Enlightenment and the TARDIS. Turlough hurls the diamond at the Black Guardian, who vanishes in screams and flames. The Doctor points out that Enlightenment was not the diamond, but the choice itself.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing {{the story}} for Doctor Who Magazine's 200 Golden Moments special edition, Jeremy Bentham {{described}} it as being epic in scale, suggesting it played to the original strengths of the series; [...] "performance, period set design and claustrophobic mood...". He likens Enlightenment {{to the work of}} Stanley Kubrick, saying [...] "...it felt grand, it felt lonely, and yes, it felt epic." [...] On reappraising {{the story for}} the same magazine following its release on DVD, Gary Gillatt was equally as effusive, calling it [...] "...one of Doctor Who's finest serials." [...] He highlights the performance of Keith Barron as Captain Striker as being [...] "a master class of under-stated menace" [...] and [...] "pitch perfect", juxtaposing this with the over-the-top pantomime villainy of Lynda Baron as Captain <b>Wrack,</b> with the two captains balancing each other out perfectly.|$|E

The accompanying Doctor Who Confidential to [...] "Closing Time" [...] is entitled [...] "Open All Hours" [...] in honour of Baron's role in the sitcom of the same name. Radio 1 DJ Greg James appears in a non-speaking cameo role, as a man shopping for lingerie. His character was nicknamed [...] "Carlos". Alfie was portrayed by seven different babies, usually paired in twins, because of strict rules about baby hours. Several dummies were used as well. Corden, who was about to become a father, learned tips from the mothers.|$|E
500|$|Cumming came up {{with the}} idea that the Eternals would not blink and cast actors who she {{believed}} could provide detached performances. Cumming recalled Peter Sallis had played a similarly detached character in the 1974 BBC drama The Pallisers, and cast him in the role of Striker. Sallis was present during the rehearsals for the serial but when production was delayed he was unavailable for the new filming dates, being committed to filming Last of the Summer Wine and was forced to drop out of the production, being replaced by Keith Barron. [...] Lynda Baron was cast as Captain <b>Wrack,</b> having previously participated in Doctor Who in the 1966 serial The Gunfighters, as the voice that sings the [...] "Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon" [...] heard throughout that story. Tony Caunter, who had previously played Thatcher in The Crusade and Morgan in Colony in Space was given the role of Jackson, with Christopher Brown and David Rhule being cast as Marriner and Wrack's sidekick Mansell respectively. Similarly to Sallis, David Rhule was unavailable for the revised filming dates in January, so singer Leee John replaced him at short notice, despite having no previous acting experience.|$|E

2500|$|As Shakespeare's {{reputation}} rose, monuments {{began to}} be created in nationally significant locations. William Kent designed a statue for Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. The design was executed by the sculptor Peter Scheemakers and installed in 1740. Its creation was funded by Lord Burlington and Alexander Pope, among others. At least two fundraising events were led by {{the efforts of the}} Shakespeare Ladies Club: a benefit performance of Julius Caesar on April 28, 1738 at Drury Lane and a benefit performance of Hamlet on April 10, 1739 at Covent Garden. [...] There are carved heads on the pedestal, which probably depict Queen Elizabeth I, Henry V and Richard III. Shakespeare is depicted leaning on books and pointing to a scroll which has a slightly misquoted version of Prospero's lines from The Tempest about the globe dissolving to [...] "leave not a <b>wrack</b> behind". A variant of Kent's design was installed in a Glasgow theatre in 1764. It is now in the Theatre Royal in Dunlop Street.|$|E
