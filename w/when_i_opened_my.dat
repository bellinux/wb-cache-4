500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> eyes the room was spinning." ...|$|E

D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E

[...] In 1897, the Los Angeles Times published an article on Yoakum's claim that he had discovered a new method of [...] "X-Ray Prospecting" [...] for gold. [...] Yoakum {{reported that he had}} laid [...] a bit of gold-bearing quartz on the x-ray plate while taking an x-ray of a patient with a tumor. [...] The x-ray showed the location of the gold deposits in the quartz, and Yoakum proposed using x-rays in mine tunnels to [...] "ascertain decisively if gold is present, and if so, exactly where it lies and in what quantities." [...] Following this report, Yoakum became active in gold and copper mining. [...] In 1902, he ran a newspaper advertisement (pictured at left) offering stock at 25 cents a share in his new mining company. Yoakum later claimed that it was while traveling in Mexico, the location of his mining interests, that he spoke {{for the first time in}} [...] "tongues." [...] He reported: [...] "I was in the heart of Mexico in a church, speaking through an interpreter to the Mexicans and Indians, when suddenly a distinct rush of some might wind came upon me, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> mouth it was not English, but a beautiful smooth Castilian language, and for 20 or 30 minutes I held that large audience." ...|$|E

5000|$|Edward W.

Further, the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time. This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to.
