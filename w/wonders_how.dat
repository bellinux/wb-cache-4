5|$|Julianna Helt {{from the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda {{constantly}} <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> time travel could be possible. In When You Reach Me, Marcus helps Miranda {{realize that the}} three old ladies from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left. Marcus explains:"So the garden is where they appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised they would, then they would have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E
5|$|Marge is {{depressed}} that Homer {{takes her}} for granted. She calls Dr. Marvin Monroe's radio call-in therapy {{show and the}} doctor urges her to confront Homer, who hears the call on a radio at work, feels bad and <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> {{to change the way}} Marge feels about him. He goes to Moe's Tavern after work and, on Moe's advice, brings home a single rose and a box of chocolates. Marge's mood immediately softens, and Homer invites her to a dinner at a fancy restaurant, dancing, and spend a night at a motel.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to think that maybe a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E

After the inquest, Mrs Cayman and her husband want to know if Pritchard had any last words. Bobby says that he did not. Later, when talking with his friend Frankie (Lady Frances Derwent), Bobby remembers that Pritchard did have last words and writes to the Caymans to tell them.|$|E
25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie {{sitting on}} a log in the woods, crying {{about the state of}} her life. He comforts her and, as he escorts her back to the hotel, they come across one of the Polish women. He <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> much she saw. That evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room. Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying a spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

500|$|Some reports however {{indicate}} that the legend was not seriously accepted: Carlyle suggests one near-eyewitness French account amounted to [...] "not a recantation of an impudent amazing falsehood, but to some vague faint murmur or whimper of admission {{that it is probably}} false". Captain Diaz de Soria relates the story, probably apocryphal, that in 1840, the Prince of Joinville, while decorating the purported last survivor of Vengeur, would have told him [...] "we do this for the legend, my good man: nations, after all, live only of legends".

Over the course of several days, the two collect nuts in their little sacks for the coming winter and spring, and store the nuts in hollow tree stumps near their home. Timmy wears a red jacket he removes while working, and his wife wears a pink dress and apron. When the stumps are full, the couple make use of a tree-hole that once belonged to a woodpecker. The nuts rattle [...] "down [...] down [...] down inside", and Goody <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> they will ever retrieve them. Timmy reminds her he will be much thinner by springtime and will be able to pass through the little hole.|$|E

On listening to 'You Are Not Alone', one <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> many times Michael tried to tell himself, during his most desperate and anguished times, that he did have support in his life, from a higher power, or even friends and family, whether he actually believed it or not". Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described it as the best song on the album. Conversely, while Steve Holsey of Michigan Chronicle gave the album a positive review, he described the song as the worst on the album, calling the Kelly penned lyrics [...] "" [...] and below the standard set by Jackson's own lyrical skills. [...] "You Are Not Alone" [...] received an American Music Award nomination and a Grammy nomination both for [...] "Best Pop Vocal Performance".|$|E
500|$|When Munch <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> Romans become Italians, he asks when [...] "Friends, Romans, countrymen; lend me your ears" [...] {{turned into}} [...] "Hey, yo!"

Munch says, [...] "Great, let's arrest Axl Rose", a Guns N' Roses musician, when he is told the suspect in a murder is blond. During one scene, the detectives eat steamed crabs. This was {{deliberately}} included in the episode to reflect the culinary culture of Baltimore, where eating crabs is extremely popular. During a discussion about Pembleton, Crosetti compares him to the lone wolf character played by actor Gary Cooper in the 1952 western film High Noon; when trying to recall {{the title of the}} film, Crosetti said the character had a New York City type of attitude, prompting Lewis to believe he is referring to the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees, also starring Cooper.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri muses that Valhalla must {{be quite}} crowded, to which High {{responds}} {{by stating that}} Valhalla is massive and remains roomy despite {{the large amount of}} inhabitants, and then quotes Grímnismál stanza 23. In chapter 41, Gangleri says that Odin seems to be quite a powerful lord, as he controls quite a big army, but he yet <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> the Einherjar keep themselves busy when they are not drinking. High replies that daily, after they've dressed and put on their war gear, they go out to the courtyard and battle one another in one-on-one combat for sport. Then, when mealtime comes, they ride home to Valhalla and drink. High then quotes Vafþrúðnismál stanza 41. In chapter 42, High describes that, [...] "right at the beginning, when the gods were settling" [...] they had established Asgard and then built Valhalla. The death of the god Baldr is recounted in chapter 49, where the mistletoe that is used to kill Baldr is described as growing west of Valhalla.|$|E

500|$|Later, Andy helps Leslie {{clean the}} parks office and, {{after a few}} beers, they decide to toilet paper Greg's house.

However, the woman reveals she is Greg's actual mother, and that Greg hired a [...] "fake mother" [...] off of Craigslist {{to get him out of}} trouble. When she realizes Greg is not home, Leslie believes he is vandalizing the mayor statue. They go to the statue and catch Greg in the process; although Leslie wishes to have him [...] "locked up," [...] Dave points out he is still a minor and will likely only receive probation. Later, Leslie <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> Greg managed to trash the parks department. The episode ends with a flashback showing Greg sneaking into the department disguised as a janitor, hiding in a dumpster until everybody leaves, then vandalizing the office.|$|E
500|$|In 1988's Wonder Woman Annual #1, Kevin Mayer, {{brother of}} Diana's late {{publicist}} Myndi Mayer, {{shows up at}} her will reading, saying {{she was the only}} member of the family who didn't hate him for being gay. Mitch Sekofsky, mechanic for Task Force X, is a gay dad. Simon La Grieve, the organization's head psychiatrist, refers to this as his [...] "choice of sexuality" [...] and <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> Sekofsky's son is adjusting. Priest Kramer counsels Mitch and tells him that his homosexuality is a natural part of himself that does not conflict with Christian scripture. The early 1990s saw a few more LGBT minor characters portrayed in DC titles. John Constantine dealt with gay bashers in Hellblazer #6 and 7 and Swamp Thing #74 (1988). In the latter issue, Constantine, having jumped from a train at the end of Hellblazer #6, is found by gay bashers in a weakened state and severely beaten until rescued by Swamp Thing. While Constantine is not gay (he is bisexual and is mostly sexually active with women), some of his gay friends were beaten and hospitalized, and he tried to protect them. In this case, the gay bashers were working at the behest of the demon, Nergal. Both this run and The Sandman story arcs [...] and [...] arc featured elderly gay men. Transsexual themes were explored in [...] (1991) and in a 1992 storyline in Legion of Super-Heroes.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Billboard considered that Bowie had [...] "found his musical niche" [...] following songs like [...] "Fame" [...] and [...] "Golden Years" [...] but that [...] "the 10-minute title cut drags", while NME called it [...] "one {{of the most}} significant albums released in the last five years", later naming it the second greatest album of the year. Both magazines found the meaning of the lyrics difficult to fathom. Rolling Stone writer Teri Moris applauded the album's 'rockier' moments but discerned a move away from the genre, finding it [...] "the thoughtfully professional effort of a style-conscious artist whose ability to write and perform demanding rock & roll exists comfortably alongside his fascination for diverse forms... while there's little doubt about his skill, one <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> long he'll continue wrestling with rock at all". Circus, noting that Bowie was [...] "never one to maintain continuity in his work or in his life", declared that Station to Station [...] "offers cryptic, expressionistic glimpses that let us feel the contours and palpitations of the masquer's soul but never fully reveal his face." [...] The review also found various allusions to earlier Bowie efforts, such as the [...] "density" [...] of The Man Who Sold the World, the [...] "pop feel" [...] of Hunky Dory, the [...] "dissonance and angst" [...] of Aladdin Sane, the [...] "compelling percussion" [...] of Young Americans, and the [...] "youthful mysticism" [...] of [...] "Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud", concluding that [...] "it shows Bowie pulling out on the most challenging leg of his winding journey".|$|E

500|$|In the US, {{the film}} was not subject to any {{censorship}} at all, and was released virtually intact to AIP's usual mix of drive-ins and grindhouses. However, {{in an attempt to}} link the film with Roger Corman's earlier Edgar Allan Poe series of films, it was retitled The Conqueror Worm. Brief prologue and epilogue narrations (by Price) taken from Poe's poem were added to justify the new title. As Danny Peary noted in his Cult Movies book, the film went nearly unnoticed by critics during its US release: [...] "The few snoozing trade reviewers who saw it treated it as just another entry in AIP's Edgar Allan Poe series... and gave it such dismal notices that future bookings were scarce." [...] Hollywood Citizen News was appalled by the film: [...] "A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmaking... a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, one <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> it ever passed customs to be released in this country." [...] The trade journal Box Office noted that: [...] "Fans of the horror film will be glad to know that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiends... bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginable..." [...] Variety opined that [...] "Dwyer gives evidence of acting talent, but she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves's mediocre script and ordinary direction." [...] Despite the lack of critical support, the movie was a modest success stateside, earning $1.5 million for AIP according to Cinefantastique magazine. In his biography of Reeves, Benjamin Halligan claims the film made $10 million in the US.|$|E
