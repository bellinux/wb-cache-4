O experimento foi realizado na Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, localizada ao norte da cidade de Manaus, AM. No igarapé Bolívia foi instalado um posto fluviométrico (régua linimétrica e linígrafo); no local, foram instalados quatro piezômetros na zona ripária, {{perpendicular}} ao curso do igarapé. A porosidade variou no perfil do solo, alcançando valores acima de 0, 40 cm³/cm³. Os valores médios de condutividade hidráulica saturada ou infiltração básica (K) foram elevados e variaram de 89, 5 ± 12, 8 a 279, 5 ± 9, 0 mm/h. O nível d'água no igarapé oscilou entre 65 e 141 cm, no período de observação (novembro de 2005 a outubro de 2007). O piezômetro da camada profunda do solo, distante do curso d'água, variou entre 166, 2 e 304, 9 cm. As condutividades hidráulicas do solo saturado foram maiores nos pontos mais distantes do curso d'água, tanto na camada superficial quanto na profunda, determinando o comportamento hidrológico do lençol freático no local.

40|$|Hydroelectric {{developments}} have significantly altered the hydrology {{and the historical}} wetland cycle in the Saskatchewan River Delta (SRD) by reducing both long term and within year flood frequency. This research details the responses of SRD wetlands to <b>water</b> <b>level</b> manipulation and links it to the habitats selected by muskrats thus highlighting the conditions {{that should be the}} focus of wetland management. Following the partial drawdown (PD) in the fall of 2007, muskrat densities derived from mark recapture surveys did not differ between PD and full supply level (FSL) wetlands. On a per flooded area basis, PD wetlands supported residual muskrat population at similar densities as FSL wetlands during the years of the drawdown. The partial drawdown resulted in increased amounts of senescent vegetation in PD wetlands in 2008 and 2009, mainly affecting Carex and Typha vegetation classes. The result of habitat selection modeling was generally consistent with other studies of muskrats, although it was complicated by the habitat structure of these northern wetlands. Muskrats selected for rooted Typha with greater frequency than any other habitat, followed by rooted Equisetum. Ducks Unlimited Canada 2 ̆ 7 s records from 1979 to 1990 show that <b>water</b> <b>level</b> drawdowns were successful at increasing muskrat house densities in SRD wetlands. In the years after a drawdown muskrat house densities generally increased and peaked three years after a drawdown, however the ten year densities were unaffected. Low muskrat densities, and low recruitment in SMC wetlands compared to other northern deltas are likely due to degenerating wetland habitat conditions created by prolonged <b>water</b> <b>level</b> stabilization. Small <b>scale</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> manipulation efforts by various managers, most notably Ducks Unlimited Canada, have produced increases in muskrat populations.

The USACE total <b>water</b> <b>level</b> Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) in development will guide how to evaluate total <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> for USACE coastal missions...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the highest}} <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> input <b>water,</b> output water and {{rainfall}} at Baiyangdian Lake in recent 50 years, the characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changing and the corresponding reason are analyzed. Furthermore, combined with the upgrowth of Locusta Migratoria Manilensis Meyen, {{the effects of the}} <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes on outbreak of Locusta Migratoria Manilensis Meyen were studied on the aspect of yearly and monthly changes of <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> The result shows that the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> of Baiyangdian Lake fluctuantly decreased in recent 50 years; the monthly difference of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in a year became smaller; the reason was the decrease of input water from upriver. There exist more possibilities for Locusta Migratoria Manilensis Meyen to outbreak immediately after going back from the peak value and trough of <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Moreover, the comparatively low <b>water</b> <b>level</b> between May and October may accelerate the outbreak of Locusta Migratoria Manilensis Meyen. The conclusions are useful for controlling storage of water at Baiyangdian Lake, predicting and preventing the outbreak of Locusta Migratoria Manilensis Meyen...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{behaviors}} of the Yamula dam (on Kızılırmak River and far 35 km from Kayseri city in Turkey) were monitored by using geodetic measurements covering four periods of 1, 5 years. A developed deformation analysis technique {{was used to determine}} whether there was a relation between dam subsidence and reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising. Investigations indicated that there was an apparent linear relation between dam subsidence and reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising. In addition, there was evidence of reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising in the amplitude of displacement. So, reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising was regarded as a causative force in the formulation of the model. The analysis of reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising by the dynamic model clearly indicated that large <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising on the reservoir were an important triggering factor for the dam deformations. The developed model was capable of determining relations between vertical displacements and reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising in addition to displacements, velocities and accelerations of displacements. The model allowed interpretation of measured displacements including geodetic and reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> relationship...|$|R
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>levels</b> and <b>water</b> extents are {{essential}} information in flood monitoring and forecasting. Two experimental and complementary ways were explored {{in order to}} estimate <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and <b>water</b> extent and forecast them: 1) The estimation of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> through combining <b>water</b> extents derived from earth observation data with elevation from a Digital Elevation Model; 2) The estimation of flood extents with respect to <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> by combining <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> recorded at a reference gauge station with the corresponding water extents derived from earth observation data. The results are very promising. The average error of estimated <b>water</b> <b>level</b> near the Hukou gauge station (north of the Poyang Lake) is about 1. 26 meters using low and medium resolution ENVISAT products combined with 3 arc second SRTM DEM. Also, a first flood extent forecast map was estimated using ENVISAT low and medium resolution data and <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> recorded at Hukou gauge station...|$|R

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>level</b> {{monitoring}} {{is important}} for understanding the global hydrological cycle. Remotely-sensed indices that capture localized instantaneous responses have been extensively explored for <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstruction {{during the past two}} decades. However, the potential usage of the Palmer’s Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices for <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstruction and prediction has not been explored. This paper examines the relationship between observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and PDSI based on a soil-moisture water balance model and three ENSO indices for the lower Mekong River estuary on a monthly temporal scale. We found that the time-lagged information between the standardized <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and the ENSO indices that enabled us to reconstruct the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> using the ENSO indices. The influence of strong ENSO events on the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> can help capture the hydrological extremes during the period. As a result, PDSI-based <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstruction can be further improved with the assistance of ENSO information (called ENSO-assisted PDSI) during ENSO events. The <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstructed from the PDSI and ENSO indices (and that of remote sensing) compared to observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> shows a correlation coefficient of around 0. 95 (and < 0. 90), with an RMS error ranging from 0. 23 to 0. 42 m (and 0. 40 to 0. 79 m) and an NSE around 0. 90 (and < 0. 81), respectively. An external assessment also displayed similar results. This indicates that the usage of ENSO information could lead to a potential improvement in <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstruction and prediction for river basins affected by the ENSO phenomenon and hydrological extremes...|$|R
