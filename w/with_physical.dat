Among medical students, the higher the academic year in medical school the greater the association <b>with</b> higher <b>physical</b> and mental HRQoL. Higher GPA and absence of underlying medical conditions were associated <b>with</b> higher <b>physical</b> HRQoL while {{signs and symptoms of}} depression were associated <b>with</b> lower <b>physical</b> and mental HRQoL.|$|R

40|$|Understanding children’s {{decisions}} {{to include a}} child with a disability in activities is {{an important component of the}} social environment of children with disabilities. We examined preschool children’s understanding of the motor and social compe-tence of hypothetical children <b>with</b> a <b>physical</b> disability, children’s {{decisions to}} in-clude or exclude a peer <b>with</b> a <b>physical</b> disability in play activities, and children’s justifications of their inclusion/exclusion decisions. Children understood that a peer <b>with</b> a <b>physical</b> disability would have more difficulty with activities requir-ing motor skills than social skills and were more likely to include a peer <b>with</b> a <b>physical</b> disability when the activities required minimal motor skills. The role of typically developing children’s understanding of social contexts in peer relation-ships is discussed. There has been substantial attention to the role of inclusive educational setting...|$|R

5|$|Maltese courts became British {{subject on}} 5 October 1813, {{months before the}} Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony. At this point the British, under Governor Thomas Maitland, adopted a {{codification}} of a mixed system of Civil Law, which included Roman Law, Code Napoléon and continental law. Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted {{with the task of}} reforms. These reforms remain the basic of Maltes law today. By 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed <b>with</b> <b>physical</b> force.|$|E
5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical {{bases of}} network synthesis were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection <b>with</b> <b>physical</b> lines. The essence of network synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E
50|$|An ecosystem, {{originally}} {{defined by}} Tansley (1935), is a biotic community (or biocenosis) along <b>with</b> its <b>physical</b> environment (or biotope).

These relationships are an additional consideration to the interaction of each species <b>with</b> the <b>physical</b> environment.|$|R

5|$|Part of {{the problem}} was that Bordeaux may not have {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because it was out of range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that <b>with</b> <b>physical</b> deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Seneb was a dwarf {{who served}} as a {{high-ranking}} court official in the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, circa 2520 BC. Seneb was a person of considerable importance and wealth who owned thousands of cattle, held twenty palaces and religious titles and was married to a high-ranking priestess of average size with whom he had three children. His successful career and the lavishness of his burial arrangements are indicative of the acceptance given to dwarfs in ancient Egyptian society, whose texts advocated the acceptance and integration of those <b>with</b> <b>physical</b> disabilities.|$|E
