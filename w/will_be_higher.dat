25|$|A zone {{of rapid}} {{salinity}} increase with depth {{is called a}} halocline. The temperature of maximum density of seawater decreases as its salt content increases. Freezing temperature of water decreases with salinity, and boiling temperature of water increases with salinity. Typical seawater freezes at around −1.9nbsp&°C at atmospheric pressure. If precipitation exceeds evaporation, {{as is the case}} in polar and temperate regions, salinity will be lower. If evaporation exceeds precipitation, {{as is the case in}} tropical regions, salinity <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>higher.</b> Thus, oceanic waters in polar regions have lower salinity content than oceanic waters in temperate and tropical regions.|$|E

25|$|The {{spectrum}} of the scattered photons is termed the Raman spectrum. It shows {{the intensity of the}} scattered light as a function of its frequency difference Δν to the incident photons. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around Δν=0. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it.|$|E

The former head of the MTA, Thomas Prendergast, announced at the January 2017 board meeting that the plan would be explored in a field study to determine fares and the impact on existing service. The plan is intended to fill approximately 20,000 unused seats of existing trains to Atlantic Terminal and Penn Station (or about 50% to 60% of peak trains in each direction), {{while at the same time}} providing affordable service to people with long commutes.
