He died at 5:15 the following morning at St. Anthony's Hospital, never having regained consciousness after the operation.

The research for the sprawling historical novel created what Stephenson called [...] "data management problems", and he resorted to a system of notebooks to record research, track characters, and find material during the writing process.|$|E
