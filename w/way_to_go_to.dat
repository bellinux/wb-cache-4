25|$|At this {{critical}} juncture, however, the Peloponnesian line {{began to fall}} into disorder as ships broke line to pursue individual Athenian vessels. Seeing this, Thrasybulus turned his ships abruptly and attacked the Spartan left. After routing these ships, the Athenian right bore down on the Peloponnesian center, and, catching them {{in a state of}} disorganization, quickly routed them as well. The Syracusans on the right, seeing the rest of their fleet in flight, abandoned their attack on the Athenian left and fled as well. The narrowness of the straits, which ensured that the Peloponnesians had only a short <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> safety, limited the damage the Athenians could inflict, but by day's end they had captured 21 Spartan ships to the 15 of theirs that the Spartans had taken in the early fighting. The Athenians set up a trophy on Cynossema and put in at Sestos, while the Peloponnesians made their way back to Abydos.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of Orochimaru {{to the series}} was first suggested by Masashi Kishimoto's superiors {{in order to improve}} the series' popularity. Kishimoto believed the series grew personality based on the Chunin Exams story arc and wanted it to end normally with Shikamaru Nara's victory. However, he eventually accepted their advised and Orochimaru was set up to interrupt this arc. As one of the villains in the story, Kishimoto created Orochimaru as an antithesis to the protagonists' values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended {{to make it easier for}} the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In an interview, Kishimoto asserted that making the villains [...] "flamboyant" [...] was one of his [...] "guiding principles," [...] and attributed this to his desire to have the villains have a [...] "powerful aura." [...] When asked if Orochimaru was still good, Kishimoto answered that Orochimaru is [...] "truly evil" [...] and that he is one of the several [...] "hopeless evil characters" [...] that appear in the series. Originally Kishimoto planned to make Orochimaru's look androgynous. However, because of the concept of him being a strong antagonist, he made him more creepy. Of most of the characters, Orochimaru was hardest one to write. Kishimoto wanted wanted him to be a terrifying opponent, so he wondered if that was really the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> make him sound strong. Then I started thinking it was good like that, he's strong and creepy, and the creepyness started increasing.|$|E

Towards {{the end of the}} interview, Knight talked about his son, Pat, who had also been dismissed by the university, wanting an opportunity to be a head coach. Schaap, thinking that Knight was finished, attempted to move on to another subject, but Knight insisted on continuing about his son. Schaap repeatedly tried to ask another question when Knight shifted the conversation to Schaap's style of interviewing, notably chastising him about interruptions.

2500|$|The {{noticeable}} {{disparity between}} the University of Edinburgh's research capacity, endowment and international status on the one hand, and its ranking in national league tables on the other, is largely {{on account of the}} central role which 'student satisfaction' plays in the latter. The University of Edinburgh was ranked bottom in the UK for teaching quality by its students in the 2012 National Student Survey. According to The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2015, [...] "The university is trying to address undergraduates' concerns with a new personal tutor system and a peer support scheme. However, Edinburgh achieved an unwanted clean sweep of rock bottom rankings among universities in this year's National Student Survey (NSS) for questions to do with the promptness, usefulness and extent of academic feedback, suggesting the university still has a long <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> turn around a poor position". In the 2017 guide, Edinburgh fell to its worst ever position of joint 37th (placed with local Heriot-Watt University) in a domestic league table. The fall was attributed to lower NSS scores combined with a significant drop (78.6% to 73%) in the prospects of its graduates.|$|E

[...] He {{was impressed with}} the graphics and the isometric three-quarter top down view, but felt the game lacked a sense of grandeur. He concluded [...] "The game has all the elements of a great quest -- what keeps it a bit lacking though is that nothing you do in the game really feels all that important. It's an enjoyable time, but most of the battles and quests feel rather trivial." [...] Matt Casamassina scored all other versions of the game 7.5 out of 10, feeling the gameplay was too similar to, and not as good as, Zelda games; [...] "try as this game may to copy Zelda, it lacks the intuitiveness and polish of the franchise, and this drawback is noticeable." [...] However, he praised the combat and the graphics. He concluded [...] "it's a well-made adventure game that will absolutely provide a good amount of entertainment and satisfaction for those seeking it. But {{at the same time the}} title falls a little short thanks to a general lack of polish and overall difficulty [...] Recommended to hardcore Tolkien fans or to younger players after a fun adventure.
