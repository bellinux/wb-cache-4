5|$|The Parental Advisory label (abbreviated PAL) is a <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> first {{introduced}} by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1985 and later adopted by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 2011. It is placed on audio recordings in recognition of excessive profanities or inappropriate references, {{with the intention of}} alerting parents of potentially unsuitable material for younger children. The label was first affixed on physical 33 1/3 rpm records, compact discs and cassette tapes, and it has been included on digital listings offered by online music stores to accommodate the growing popularity of the latter platform.|$|E

Even the Southern Song's contemporary of the Jin dynasty {{to the north}} caught on to this trend and issued their own paper money. At the archeological dig at Jehol there was a printing plate found that dated to the year 1214, which produced notes that measured 10cm by 19cm in size and were worth a hundred strings of 80 cash coins. This Jurchen-Jin issued paper money bore a serial number, {{the number of the}} series, and a <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> that counterfeiters would be decapitated, and the denouncer rewarded with three hundred strings of cash.|$|E

40|$|Research on <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> {{printed on}} {{cigarette}} packages {{has shown that}} fear inducing health warnings might provoke defensive responses. This study investigated whether reformulating statements into questions could avoid defensive reactions. Smokers were presented with either <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> formulated as questions, textual <b>warning</b> <b>labels,</b> graphic <b>warning</b> <b>labels,</b> or no <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> Participants' smoking-related risk perception was higher after exposure to <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> formulated as questions or no <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> than after exposure to textual or graphic <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> These results indicate that reformulating statements into questions can avoid defensive responses elicited by textual- and graphic <b>warning</b> <b>labels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Alcohol <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> have {{a limited}} effect on {{drinking}} behavior, potentially because people devote minimal attention to them. We report findings from two studies in which we measured {{the extent to which}} alcohol consumers attend to <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on alcohol packaging, and aimed to identify if increased attention to <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> is associated with motivation to change drinking behavior. Methods Study 1 (N[*]=[*] 60) was an exploratory cross-sectional study in which we used eye-tracking to measure visual attention to brand and health information on alcohol and soda containers. In study 2 (N[*]=[*] 120) we manipulated motivation to reduce drinking using an alcohol brief intervention (vs control intervention) and measured heavy drinkers’ attention to branding and <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> with the same eye-tracking paradigm as in study 1. Then, in a separate task we experimentally manipulated attention by drawing a brightly colored border around health (or brand) information before measuring participants’ self-reported drinking intentions for the subsequent week. Results Study 1 showed that participants paid minimal attention to <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> (7 % of viewing time). Participants who were motivated to reduce drinking paid less attention to alcohol branding and alcohol <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> Results from study 2 showed that the alcohol brief intervention decreased attention to branding compared to the control condition, but it did not affect attention to <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> Furthermore, the experimental manipulation of attention to health or brand information did not influence drinking intentions for the subsequent week. Conclusions Alcohol consumers allocate minimal attention to <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on alcohol packaging and even if their attention is directed to these <b>warning</b> <b>labels,</b> this has no impact on their drinking intentions. The lack of attention to <b>warning</b> <b>labels,</b> even among people who actively want to cut down, suggests that there is room for improvement in the content of health warnings on alcohol packaging...|$|R
25|$|In June 2011 EPA, in {{cooperation}} with the Federal Trade Commission, issued its final ruling regarding the E15 <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> required to be displayed in all E15 fuel dispensers in the U.S. to inform consumers about what vehicles can, and what vehicles and equipment cannot, use the E15 blend. Both the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association complained that relying solely on this <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> is not enough to protect consumers from misfueling. In July 2012, a fueling station in Lawrence, Kansas became the first in the U.S. to sell the E15 blend. The fuel is sold through a blender pump that allows customers to choose between E10, E15, E30 or E85, with the latter blends sold only to flexible-fuel vehicles. , there are about 24 fueling stations selling E15 out of 180,000 stations across the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The delisting of {{saccharin}} led to legislation {{repealing the}} <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> requirement for products containing saccharin.

40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a leading}} risk factor for major diseases, particularly among young adults who increasingly engage in binge drinking. Since positive outcome expectancies play {{a pivotal role in}} alcohol consumption, we designed alcohol <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> tailored toward young adults’ outcome expectancies. The warnings were formulated as questions or as statements that were accompanied by a picture. We implemented the <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on young adults’ favorite alcohol beverages (beer and alcopops) and presented them in the laboratory. One-hundred twenty-two young adults participated in the study. One third of the sample received the <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> in question form, one third in statement form, and the final third received no <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> We assessed general outcome expectancies, individual outcome expectancies derived from a pre-study, and drinking intentions. The results of this experiment revealed that <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> presented as statements had no influence on individual and general outcome expectancies and drinking intentions. Warnings posed in the form of questions showed some effectiveness as they increased individual negative outcome expectancy perception. Although only partially effective, the <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> seem promising for future research...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionFor {{the past}} 20 years, {{there have been}} no changes to the text-only {{cigarette}} <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> in the United States. During this same time period, other countries placed large graphic <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on cigarette packages. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the reactions of U. S. young adult smokers and nonsmokers aged 18 to 24 years to Canadian cigarette label text and graphic warnings. The study focused on determining their perceptions and the potential impact of Canadian labels on smoking, and study participants were asked for suggestions for modifications of U. S. cigarette <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> so they would be effective for smoking deterrence and cessation. Methods During January and February 2002, 11 focus groups consisting of 54 smokers and 41 nonsmokers were conducted in the Detroit metropolitan area. Current smokers were defined as those who had smoked a cigarette within the past 30 days. Participants were asked about their knowledge and perceptions of current U. S. cigarette <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> and their impressions of Canadian cigarette <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> AnalysisA content analysis and a word index were applied to the transcripts of all focus groups to identify and clarify themes and domains that appeared in group discussions and to compare results across different groups. ResultsFocus group participants reported that Canadian cigarette <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> were more visible and informative than U. S. cigarette <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> Messages perceived to be relevant to smokers were considered effective. Education level did not appear related to how participants responded to <b>warning</b> <b>labels.</b> There were some differences for <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> that had sex-specific messages. DiscussionWarning labels are one component of comprehensive tobacco control and smoking cessation efforts. Stronger warnings on cigarette packages need to be part of a larger U. S. public health educational effort...|$|R
25|$|Fear about {{saccharin}} {{increased when}} a 1960 {{study showed that}} high levels of saccharin may cause bladder cancer in laboratory rats. In 1977, Canada banned saccharin due to the animal research. In the United States, the FDA considered banning saccharin in 1977, but Congress stepped in and placed a moratorium on such a ban. The moratorium required a <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> and also mandated further study of saccharin safety.|$|E

Queen collaborated with several top-name artist from the hip hop and reggaetón genres including Hector El Father, Fat Joe, Getto & Gastam, La India, Gran Omar and Mickey Perfecto, though this release {{does not have the}} collaborations. The tracks on the album were produced mainly by Rafi Mercenario. It also included guest production by the American producer, Swizz Beatz, and the Puerto Ricans Ecko and DJ Nelson.

25|$|On April 24, 2002, the Swedish National Food Administration {{announced}} that acrylamide {{can be found}} in baked and fried starchy foods, such as potato chips, breads, and cookies. Concern was raised mainly because of the probable carcinogenic effects of acrylamide. This was followed by a strong, but short-lived, interest from the press. On August 26, 2005, California attorney general Bill Lockyer filed a lawsuit against four makers of french fries and potato chips – H.J. Heinz Co., Frito-Lay, Kettle Foods Inc., and Lance Inc. – to reduce the risk to consumers from consuming acrylamide. The lawsuit was settled on August 1, 2008, with the food producers agreeing to cut acrylamide levels to 275 parts per billion in three years, to avoid a Proposition 65 <b>warning</b> <b>label.</b> The companies avoided trial by agreeing to pay a combined $3 million in fines as a settlement with the California attorney general's office.|$|E
50|$|In the United States <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> were instituted {{under the}} Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.

40|$|Background: The U. S. Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 {{requires}} updating of {{the existing}} text-only health <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on tobacco packaging with nine new warning statements accompanied by pictorial images. Survey and experimental research in the U. S. and other countries supports the effectiveness of pictorial health <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> compared with text-only warnings for informing smokers {{about the risks of}} smoking and encouraging cessation. Yet very little research has examined differences in reactions to <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> by race/ethnicity, education or income despite evidence that population subgroups may differ in their ability to process health information. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the potential impact of pictorial <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> compared with text-only labels among U. S. adul...|$|R
40|$|Warning {{labels on}} {{cigarette}} packages {{rely on the}} negative health aspects of smoking. For smokers, however, smoking is related to positive {{as well as to}} negative outcomes. Positive smoking outcomes are shown to be crucial in activating smoking behaviour. Thus, this study compared current health <b>warnings</b> with <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> contradicting positive outcomes. In a field study, 39 adult smokers were followed over a 5 -day period to investigate the effect of the different types of <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on actual smoking behaviour. Our results provide evidence that smokers, who received <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> contradicting positive outcome expectancies, smoked less than smokers, who received current health warnings. Thus, contradicting positive smoking outcomes on cigarette <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> may be an effective tool in smoking prevention and intervention...|$|R
500|$|Shortly {{after their}} {{formation}} in April 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) assembled {{a list of}} fifteen songs with deemed unsuitable content. Particular criticism was placed on [...] "Darling Nikki" [...] by Prince, after the daughter of PMRC co-founder Mary [...] "Tipper" [...] Gore recognized its references to masturbation. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) responded by introducing {{an early version of}} their content <b>warning</b> <b>label,</b> although the PMRC was displeased and proposed that a music rating system structured like the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system be enacted. The RIAA alternatively suggested using a <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> reading [...] "Parental Guidance: Explicit Lyrics", and after continued conflict between the organizations, the matter was discussed on September 19 during a hearing with the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Notable musicians, Frank Zappa, Dee Snider, and John Denver each testified at this hearing with strong opposition to PMRC’s <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> system, and censorship in general. Approximately two months after the hearing, the organizations agreed on a settlement in which audio recordings were to either be affixed with a <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> reading [...] "Explicit Lyrics: Parental Advisory" [...] or have its lyrics attached on the backside of its packaging.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, the now {{standard}} black-and-white <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> design reading [...] "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" [...] {{was introduced}} and {{was to be}} placed on the bottom right-hand section of a given product. The first album to bear the [...] "black and white" [...] Parental Advisory label was the 1990 release of [...] "Banned in the USA" [...] by the rap group 2 Live Crew. By May 1992, approximately 225 records had been marked with the warning. In response to later hearings in the following years, it was reworded as [...] "Parental Advisory: Explicit Content" [...] in 1996. The system went unchanged until 2002, when record labels affiliated with Bertelsmann Music Group began including specific areas of concern including [...] "strong language", [...] "violent content", or [...] "sexual content" [...] on compact discs alongside the generic Parental Advisory label. The Parental Advisory label was first used on music streaming services and online music stores in 2011. That year, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) revised its own music censorship policies to incorporate more prominent usage of the <b>warning</b> <b>label.</b>|$|E

40|$|Smokers {{often have}} (implicit or explicit) {{positive}} smoking outcome expectancies that motivate them to smoke. For instance, {{they may feel}} that smoking is relaxing, that it improves concentration, or that {{it is seen as}} cool and attractive by peers. These expectations are, for the most part, illusory. In order to counteract these expectations, we designed cigarette package <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> that contradicted common positive outcome expectancies. We investigated the effectiveness of our new <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> in two experiments. We first measured smokers' implicit attitudes toward smoking using an affective priming method and found that our new <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> changed positive attitudes into ambivalent attitudes. We then tested whether our <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> changed smokers' self-reported positive outcome expectancies and smoking behavior. Smokers presented with the new <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> immediately associated positive outcome expectancies less strongly with smoking and reported smoking fewer cigarettes in the 24 hours following the experiment. Explicitly taking the reasons for unhealthy behavior into account when trying to change people's habits could offer a valuable contribution to effective health campaigns...|$|R
40|$|Current <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> on {{cigarette}} {{packages are}} generally focused on long-term losses {{that can be}} incurred if one continues smoking. This study compares {{the effects of these}} <b>labels</b> against <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> that stress short-term losses of smoking as well as labels that stress short- and long-term benefits that can be obtained when one quits smoking. A 2 (message frame: gain vs. loss) × 2 (temporal context: short vs. long term) between-subjects experiment was conducted among 132 smokers, with attitude toward quitting smoking and intention to quit smoking, as well as information-seeking behavior and message recall, as the dependent variables. Findings were in line with theory regarding message framing and temporal discounting, showing enhanced effects of gain over loss frames and short-term over long-term consequences on <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> for attitudes and intentions. In addition, an interaction between message frame and temporal context was found. Especially, gain-framed messages showed stronger effects on intentions to quit smoking than loss-framed messages when <b>warning</b> <b>labels</b> concerned short-term outcomes. Findings suggest that current <b>warning</b> <b>labels,</b> with an emphasis on long-term negative health outcomes, should be reconsidered...|$|R

500|$|Playtex {{created a}} {{consumer}} products subsidiary, Playtex Products Inc., in 1960, which produced baby products, tampons and other consumer goods. It introduced and patented the first plastic tampon applicator in 1973. By 1975, the five largest tampon manufacturers began competing with multimillion-dollar advertising budgets and Playtex became the primary competitor to market-leader Tampax. Playtex introduced a scented tampon that was advertised with the slogan, [...] "When you're wearing a tampon you don't worry about odor. But should you?" [...] It added a <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> saying {{that some women}} may experience irritation from the chemicals after complaints were raised by Planned Parenthood. Tampon manufacturers, including Playtex, were sued for aggressively advertising and competing over absorbency, when some studies found that excessive absorbency leads to toxic shock syndrome.

The Herald Suns head {{reviewer}} Leigh Paatsch gave the film no stars, claiming the film tried {{to match the}} edginess of the 2007 comedy film Juno but was, [...] "way, way off the mark". He wrote, [...] "If you think the title screams 'Go watch something else', just wait until you get a load of this lame local production." [...] Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film {{was an example of}} [...] "just how bad local [...] films can get". In particular, he criticised the [...] "stiff" [...] performances, the [...] "woeful" [...] directing and the plot's implausibility. Variety magazine's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was [...] "sporadically amusing" [...] and lacked [...] "scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics". He praised the soundtrack and Castle-Hughes' portrayal of Sunni, but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and [...] "uninspired dialogue and direction". Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film's greatest downfall was that [...] "the jokes aren't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart". She complimented Toni Collette's performance but felt that [...] "her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance". Luke Goodsell, writing for Empire magazine, awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and deemed it to be deserving of [...] "an all-purpose <b>warning</b> <b>label</b> to stay the Hell away".|$|E

Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy.
