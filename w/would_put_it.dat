5|$|In 1999, the Muslim Wakf {{authority}} {{controlling the}} Islamic structures atop the Temple Mount began illegally excavating {{large amounts of}} fill from the former site of the Royal Stoa in order to construct a new access to the newly established (or, as the Waqf <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> restored and expanded) Marwani Mosque. Material dug from the site was dumped in the Kidron Valley, {{so that all the}} important information which could have been acquired through proper excavation of the material in its archaeological context has been lost forever. Trying to save what could still be saved, an operation to sift through the debris was started by Zachi Zweig and Gabriel Barkay. The ongoing Temple Mount Sifting Project has resulted in the recovery of many architectural fragments from the Second Temple buildings as well as remnants from all other historical periods since the First Temple Period.|$|E

The {{ship had}} been used in anti-submarine operations during the Cold War, was equipped with sidescan sonar, underwater video, water and sediment sampling instruments used in study of ocean and coastline. One of the major missions of the Bold was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials were dumped from dredging operations in U.S. ports. In 2013, the General Services Administration sold the Bold to Seattle Central Community College (SCCC), which demonstrated in a competition that they <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to the highest and best purpose, at a nominal cost of $5,000.|$|E

25|$|Tulsa's {{downtown}} was {{the site}} of projects anchored by BOK Center, including a $42 million renovation of the Tulsa Convention Center, a $20 million renovation of downtown streets, a $4 million renovation and expansion of a nearby parking garage, streetscape improvements, and art deco-style signs directing visitors to parking garages, public buildings, specialty districts, and entertainment venues. The arena is expected to host 148 major and minor events in its first year, which are anticipated to generate $1.5 million in tax revenue and $92 million in economic impact. SMG is expected to earn $6,553,250 in revenue, giving it a $285,498 annual profit. In its first four months of operation, BOK Center's ticket sales were nearly enough to reach Venues Todays top 20 worldwide rankings for total ticket sales in 2008 among venues seating 15,001-30,000. The arena reached $20 million in sales in 2008 and is projected to surpass at least $30 million in 2009, which <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> within the top 15 worldwide in sales according to the 2008 rankings.|$|E
25|$|Machiavelli is {{generally}} {{seen as being}} critical of Christianity as it existed in his time, specifically its effect upon politics, and also everyday life. In his opinion, Christianity, along with the teleological Aristotelianism that the church had come to accept, allowed practical decisions to be guided too much by imaginary ideals and encouraged people to lazily leave events up to providence or, as he <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> chance, luck or fortune. While Christianity sees modesty as a virtue and pride as sinful, Machiavelli took a more classical position, seeing ambition, spiritedness, {{and the pursuit of}} glory as good and natural things, and part of the virtue and prudence that good princes should have. Therefore, while it was traditional to say that leaders should have virtues, especially prudence, Machiavelli's use of the words virtù and prudenza was unusual for his time, implying a spirited and immodest ambition. Famously, Machiavelli argued that virtue and prudence can help a man control more of his future, in the place of allowing fortune to do so.|$|E

However, her request was denied by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in September 2009. James commented, [...] "Having Michael Jackson visit and moonwalk at this station was a huge deal not only for Brooklyn, but all of New York in the '80s [...] And renaming this station in his honor <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on the map and help ensure that people don't forget." [...] A source from the MTA commented that no subway stations in the MTA system are named or co-named after individuals, mostly because it could confuse riders. The MTA also declined to put a plaque in the station, due to MTA guidelines banning such a thing.|$|E

500|$|According to jazz writer Francis Davis, [...] "a modest {{commercial}} breakthrough seemed imminent" [...] for Coleman, {{who appeared}} to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as [...] "the surface consistency that <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the pop sphere". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners. Sound & Vision critic Brent Butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments, rock and funk drumming, and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre's fans preferred. The album later went out of print.|$|E

Since the beginning of time, {{the two of them}} had been in a cycle where Dark Gaia would break the planet apart, and Light Gaia <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> back together. Chip was released along with Dark Gaia, but because both of them were released prematurely, he lost his memory, and Dark Gaia was broken apart.

Eggman orders Dark Gaia to destroy Sonic, but it turns on him, knocking him away with one of its tentacles, and absorbs the power that turned Sonic into a Werehog, curing Sonic of lycanthropy, and uses that power to become Semi-Perfect Dark Gaia.|$|E
500|$|Basically {{home-grown}} {{and with}} {{roots in the}} early 17th-century court masque, though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from French opera, the spectaculars are sometimes called [...] "English opera". However, the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a genre at all. Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term [...] "opera", as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual. It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds, as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre-lover Samuel Pepys. The expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits. A fiasco such as John Dryden's Albion and Albanius would leave a company in serious debt, while blockbusters like Thomas Shadwell's Psyche or Dryden's King Arthur <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> comfortably in the black for a long time.|$|E

500|$|On 6 August 1773, {{eleven years}} after first meeting Boswell, Johnson {{set out to}} visit his friend in Scotland, and to begin [...] "a journey to the western islands of Scotland", as Johnson's 1775 account of their travels <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> The work was {{intended}} to discuss the social problems and struggles that affected the Scottish people, but it also praised many of the unique facets of Scottish society, such as a school in Edinburgh for the deaf and mute. Also, Johnson used the work {{to enter into the}} dispute over the authenticity of James Macpherson's Ossian poems, claiming they could not have been translations of ancient Scottish literature on the grounds that [...] "in those times nothing had been written in the Earse [...] language". There were heated exchanges between the two, and according to one of Johnson's letters, MacPherson threatened physical violence. Boswell's account of their journey, The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides (1786), was a preliminary step toward his later biography, Life of Johnson. Included were various quotations and descriptions of events, including anecdotes such as Johnson swinging a broadsword while wearing Scottish garb, or dancing a Highland jig.|$|E

In an interview with Carson Daly, Carey said, [...] "The Busta Rhymes duet...has become so successful and we always said I <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on my album as well." [...] The re-release also included [...] "There Goes My Heart", [...] "Got a Thing 4 You" [...] featuring Da Brat and Elephant Man, and [...] "The One (So So Def Remix)" [...] featuring Bone Crusher.

500|$|Jackson {{had begun}} taking painkillers, Valium, Xanax and Ativan {{to deal with}} the stress of the {{allegations}} made against him. A few months after the allegations became news, he had lost approximately 10pounds in weight and had stopped eating. According to Jackson, he had a tendency to stop eating when [...] "really upset or hurt" [...] and Elizabeth Taylor had to make him eat during this ordeal; [...] "She took the spoon and <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into my mouth." [...] He said that he eventually became unconscious and had to be fed intravenously. In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, he was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration and repeatedly slurred while speaking. He could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with and took several minutes to name some of his recent albums. His health had deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} canceled the remainder of his tour and flew with Taylor and her husband to London. When Jackson arrived at the airport, he had to be held up; he was then rushed to the home of Elton John's manager and afterwards to a clinic, but when he was searched for drugs on entry, 18 vials of medicine were found in a suitcase. Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic, and was put on a Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The singer's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was [...] "barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level". While in the clinic, he took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.|$|E
