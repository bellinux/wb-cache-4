40|$|Manufacturing {{process is}} a process of {{producing}} and creating a product with the use of technologies and machinery resources. In manufacturing process there are three dimensions, which are important in improving the system. These are cost, quality, and speed that can be considered as basics of every process. In this thesis speed of the manufacturing process is enhanced, which leads to reduction in cost as <b>well.</b> <b>Assembly</b> lines are the part of manufacturing process to convert raw materials into finished products. Considering optimization problems in assembly lines, applying genetic algorithms to the established model could lead to efficient manufacturing. Genetic algorithm is a programming search technique for maximizing productivity, minimizing inefficiency and reducing production time. This work presents an approach for developing simulation models used for optimization of production lines. The results are demonstrated using the assembly line which is located in FAST-Lab. at Tampere University of Technology. The simulation of the line is created to assess cycle times and utilization of workstations using MATLAB and SimEvents library. The optimization, in the context of presented work, is the process of locating and scheduling the products in the line achieving best timing to fulfil production orders. The workstations can be first balanced for better performance and then products are scheduled based on reduction of the production time...|$|E

40|$|In this work, I {{present the}} {{development}} of analytical solutions in the Laplace domain for a fully-penetrating, horizontal well producing at a constant flow rate or constant wellbore pressure {{in the center of}} a composite, cylindrical reservoir system with an impermeable outer boundary. The composite reservoir consists of two regions. The cylindrical region closest to the wellbore is stimulated, and the permeability within this region follows a power-law function of the radial distance from the wellbore. The unstimulated outer region has homogeneous reservoir properties. The current norm for successful stimulation of low permeability reservoir rocks is multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. The process of hydraulic fracturing creates thin, high permeability fractures that propagate deep into the reservoir, increasing the area of the rock matrix that is exposed to this low-resistance flow pathway. The large surface area of the high conductivity fracture is what makes hydraulic fracturing so successful. Unfortunately, hydraulic fracturing is often encumbered by problems such as high capital costs and a need for large volumes of water. Therefore, I investigate a new stimulation concept based upon the alteration of the permeability of a large volume around the producing <b>well</b> <b>assembly</b> from its original regime to that following a power-law function. I evaluate the effectiveness of the new concept by comparing it to conventional multi-stage hydraulic fracturing. The results of this investigation show that the power-law permeability reservoir (PPR) has a performance advantage over the multi-fractured horizontal treatment (MFH) only when the fracture conductivity and fracture half-length are small. Most importantly, the results demonstrate that the PPR can provide respectable flow rates and recovery factors, thus making it a viable stimulation concept for ultra-low permeability reservoirs, especially under conditions that may not be conducive to a conventional MHF treatment...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{evaluate}} {{the response of}} oceanic subsurface systems to thermal stresses caused by the flow of warm fluids through noninsulated well systems crossing hydrate-bearing sediments. Heat transport from warm fluids, originating from deeper reservoirs under production, into the geologic media can cause dissociation of the gas hydrates. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine whether gas evolution from hydrate dissociation can lead to excessive pressure buildup, and possibly to fracturing of hydrate-bearing formations and their confining layers, with potentially adverse consequences on the stability of the suboceanic subsurface. This study also aims to determine whether the loss of the hydrate [...] known to have a strong cementing effect on the porous media [...] in the vicinity of the well, coupled with the significant pressure increases, can undermine the structural stability of the <b>well</b> <b>assembly.</b> Scoping 1 D simulations indicated that the formation intrinsic permeability, the pore compressibility, the temperature of the produced fluids and the initial hydrate saturation are the most important factors affecting the system response, while the thermal conductivity and porosity (above a certain level) appear to have a secondary effect. Large-scale simulations of realistic systems were also conducted, involving complex well designs and multilayered geologic media with nonuniform distribution of properties and initial hydrate saturations that are typical of those expected in natural oceanic systems. The results of the 2 D study indicate that although the dissociation radius remains rather limited even after long-term production, low intrinsic permeability and/or high hydrate saturation can lead to the evolution of high pressures that can threaten the formation and its boundaries with fracturing. Although lower maximum pressures are observed in the absence of bottom confining layers and in deeper (and thus warmer and more pressurized) systems, the reduction is limited. Wellbore designs with gravel packs that allow gas venting and pressure relief result in substantially lower pressures...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} the way {{information regarding}} performance measurements is shared among employees {{working at the}} shop floor at Dalvich Optic in Sweden. This study is conducted because many companies failed to implement a system that facilitates daily performance measurements as they neglected the assembly operators’ role in decision making process. Companies focus on measuring wrong parameters and visualize information about performance measurements in wrong way. The {{purpose of this study}} is to demonstrate that new Information Technology (IT) artefacts are designed by experts for use by experts. IT artefacts are designed without taking into account assembly operators’ skills, education and experiences. Thus, limiting assembly operators’ ability to achieve daily production goals. Therefore, this study highlights the role of both assembly operators and visualizing information at the shop floor and their impact on performance measurements and productivity.   After analysis, this study develops a new IT artefact. The implementation of the new IT artefact at the company leads to a new leadership where management meet assembly operators in a daily basis, creating good environment for direct communication. As a result, the company increased its production by 50 percent compared to the previous year and it has doubled the production compared to 2010. The information about production status became visible and accessible to all employees since the information displayed through the new IT artefact was monitored in an easy-to- understand way. The presentation and visualization of information regarding productivity offered assembly operators and managers the possibility to react quickly when any disparity concerning goal achievement arose. As a result, the new IT artefact enhances assembly operators’ participation at the manufacturing process as <b>well.</b> <b>Assembly</b> operators took active role on manufacturing process since information about performance measurement was compiled and maintained by themselves; thus, positively influencing production outcomes. Furthermore, a new IT artefact created an arena where employees contributed to continuous improvements and problem-solving at work.   This study was conducted during a period of six months. Data was gathered through observations, interviews, and meetings with managers and assembly operators at a manufacturing plant. Furthermore, data from books, articles, and journals helped in analysing the way information was visualized and communicated in a manufacturing plant. ADR, Action Design Research method was used to design a new and simple IT artefact that considers employees’ skills, experiences and education. ...|$|E
