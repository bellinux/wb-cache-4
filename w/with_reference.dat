Crompton's first local authority was a Local board of health established in 1863; Established <b>with</b> <b>reference</b> to the Local Government Act 1858, Crompton Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township. Following the Local Government Act 1894, {{the area of the}} Local Board became the Crompton Urban District, a local government district within the administrative county of Lancashire. The urban district council was based out of Shaw/Crompton Town Hall, which opened on 28 December 1894.|$|E
5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} begun <b>with</b> <b>reference</b> to the nostril, {{which is}} easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which {{are called the}} nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along {{the top of the}} snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale.|$|E

5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) <b>with</b> <b>reference</b> to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E

Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands.

To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue.

5|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{analyses of}} the name must account for {{the origins of the}} different forms found in early sources Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), <b>with</b> <b>reference</b> to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from British Celtic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as * or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, already before English had become widely spoken in Britain.|$|E

5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely <b>with</b> <b>reference</b> to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, <b>with</b> <b>reference</b> to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
