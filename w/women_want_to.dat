25|$|Women are {{becoming}} more confident {{in the workplace and}} are trying harder to step up in their career. More and more of these <b>women</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fit into the management level by trying to emulate men via fashion and outward appearance to appear more masculine and powerful. Most of the higher position in the work field were occupied by man at that time, it is understandable that how womenswear is influenced by man’s figure and body feature to mock the general existing powerful image at that time. Hence, they would want garments that empower them and make them look more masculine in shape, thus making the woman appear to be more capable of higher level tasks and seem more professional by fitting in with the male majority. This would be accomplished with attributes such as wider shoulders with the aid of padding and larger sleeves.|$|E

In a June 1994 interview with TV Guide, in {{an article about the}} trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that [...] "he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films," [...] and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable [...] "all began as totally irredeemable villains." [...] Although he did not think that most <b>women</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers [...] "are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [...] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. [...] The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, [...] "Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists". [...] Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.|$|E

Mark Hogan of Spin called it [...] "a grasping EDM mess" [...] and [...] "all over the place"; he disliked the burqa lyrics, [...] "along with plenty of moments that bring to mind all the 'blog house' producers following {{in the path of}} Crystal Castles or Simian Mobile Disco circa 2007". Max Kessler of Paper gave [...] "Aura" [...] a lukewarm review; the song had [...] "all the classic Gaga attributes", including [...] "controversial and mildly clever lyrics set to a throbbing, almost-grating dance beat that's at times great and at times horrible". Its lyrics were controversial, with some Muslims accusing Gaga of degrading the burqa by sexualizing it.

2500|$|Musically, A Girl like Me reveals {{new types}} of musical genres {{compared}} to Rihanna's light and uptempo debut effort, Music of the Sun. Her goal on the album was to find songs that express the many things young <b>women</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say, but might not know how. In an interview, Rihanna said: [...] "Now I'm singing about experiences that I've gone through and stuff that other 18-year-old girls go through, so it's all about progression." [...] Reggae music, present in her debut album, subsequently continues into A Girl like Me. For the album, Rihanna used influences of different music genres, including rock music, while keeping the roots of her previous album, which where reggae and dancehall. The new effort also presents Rihanna's new side with some balladic elements. Although the album mostly follows the disco-ish mode of its predecessor, it was noted for its introduction of the rock genre to Rihanna's music, mostly represented by the rock and reggae mash-up [...] "Kisses Don't Lie", though Rihanna herself stated that the album is not overall driven by rock influence. In an interview, Rihanna commented: [...] "Growing up in Barbados, I wasn't exposed {{to a lot of}} rock music. We really love reggae and soca music and hip-hop. But when I moved to the United States last year, I was exposed to a lot of different types of music, rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [...] I love rock music." [...] Celia SanMiguel of Vibe [...] magazine wrote that A Girl like Me is [...] "a pop album, one informed but not bounded by Rihanna's Caribbean roots", and that it [...] "dispels any lingering notions of her as a dancehall-meets-R ambassador." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the album [...] "a record that almost identically" [...] veered between [...] "sunny dancehall/dub-pop", [...] "hip-hop-infused club bangers", and [...] "adult-oriented ballads".|$|E

The must is seconded by an internal imperative. Men and <b>women</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have a code of honour. In the army, for example, there is among the officers particularly, a tradition of courage, cleanliness and good form, more imperative than any law; in the little band of men who have given the world all that we mean by science, the little host of volunteers and underpaid workers who have achieved the triumphs of research, there is a tradition of self-abnegation and of an immense, painstaking, self-forgetful veracity. These traditions work. They add something to the worth of every man who comes under them.|$|E
60|$|We {{know that}} Mrs. Dall, an American lady, {{has taken up}} this subject, and {{has written a book}} on it, in which great good sense and honesty of purpose is shown. Mrs. Dall is a strong {{advocate}} for the increased employment of women, and I, with great deference, disagree with her. I allude to her book now because she has pointed out, I think very strongly, the great reason why women do not engage themselves advantageously in trade pursuits. She by no means overpraises her own sex, and openly declares that young women will not consent to place themselves in fair competition with men. They will not undergo the labor and servitude of long study at their trades. They will not give themselves up to an apprenticeship. They will not enter upon their tasks as though they were to be the tasks of their lives. They may have the same physical and mental aptitudes for learning a trade as men, but they have not the same devotion to the pursuit, and will not bind themselves to it thoroughly as men do. In all which I quite agree with Mrs. Dall; and the English of it is--that the young <b>women</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get married.|$|E

60|$|As to my {{using those}} manuscripts {{otherwise}} than in your service, I do {{not at all}} think of it, and I wish to say this. Perhaps I do not (also) partake quite your 'divine fury' for converting our sex into Greek scholarship, and I do not, I confess, think it as desirable as you do. Where there is a love for poetry, and thirst for beauty strong enough to justify labour, let these impulses, which are noble, be obeyed; {{but in the case}} of the multitude it is different; and the mere fashion of scholarship among women would be a disagreeable vain thing, and worse than vain. You, who are a Greek yourself, know that the Greek language is not to be learnt in a flash of lightning and by Hamiltonian systems, but that it swallows up year after year of studious life. Now I have a 'doxy' (as Warburton called it), that there is no exercise of the mind so little profitable to the mind as the study of languages. It is the nearest thing to a passive recipiency--is it not?--as a mental action, though it leaves one as weary as ennui itself. <b>Women</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be made to think actively: their apprehension is quicker than that of men, but their defect lies for the most part in the logical faculty and in the higher mental activities. Well, and then, to remember how our own English poets are neglected and scorned; our poets of the Elizabethan age! I would rather that my countrywomen began by loving these.|$|E
