In addition to characters having musical themes, areas of Hyrule are also associated <b>with</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> music. This has been called leitmotif in reverseâ€”instead of music announcing an entering character, it now introduces a stationary environment as the player approaches. In some locations, the music is a variation of an ocarina tune the player learns, related to that area.|$|E
5|$|Qidra is a rice dish {{named after}} the clay vessel and oven it is baked in. Rice is cooked <b>with</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> meat inside of the vessel, often using lamb, whole garlic cloves, {{garbanzo}} beans, cardamom pods, and various other spices such as, turmeric, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and cumin. Plain rice cooked in meat or chicken broth and flavored with mild spices including cinnamon is known as fatteh ghazzawiyyeh. The rice is layered over a thin markook bread known as farasheeh, smothered in ghee and topped with stuffed chicken or lamb. The meal is eaten with green peppers and lemon sauce.|$|E
5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water <b>with</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E

5|$|The Capitol Hill station's {{design was}} {{finalized}} in 2007 and 2008, during {{a series of}} public hearings and meetings with the city's design commission. Businesses and residents at the station site were moved after Sound Transit acquired properties in 2008, leaving vacant buildings that were temporarily filled <b>with</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> art coordinated by Sound Transit. Salvaging and recycling of materials in the vacant buildings began in late 2008, including a community event to remove small plants for re-planting by neighborhood residents; approximately 90 percent of material was recycled, and proceeds {{from the sale of}} scrap metal were used to provide hot meals to the homeless. Demolition of buildings on the station site began in March 2009, shortly before the formal groundbreaking for the University Link project, and was completed by August. Among the 20 demolished buildings were a three-story apartment building, a used book store, the Espresso Vivace coffee shop, a nail salon, and a copy shop. Many of the displaced and nearby businesses moved to the northern end of the Broadway district during construction, relying on mitigation funds from Sound Transit and the neighborhood's chamber of commerce.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{continued}} northeast, becoming {{large and}} wedge-shaped. It then passed {{just north of}} Fairview, completely destroying multiple homes and debarking numerous hardwood trees. Pieces of debris were found speared through vehicles in this area. The tornado then briefly passed through a section of Morgan County {{near the town of}} Hulaco, destroying several older block-foundation homes and snapping numerous large trees off at the base. The tornado then crossed into Marshall County and impacted the rural community of Ruth, just north of Arab. A large but poorly-anchored brick home was swept completely away in this area, with the debris scattered 100 yards from the foundation. Several large trees on the property were ripped out of the ground and missing, along with a trailer that was unable to be located {{at the time of the}} survey. Multiple other homes and structures were impacted in the Ruth area, and a gas station was completely destroyed. A shed was destroyed <b>with</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> large farm machinery stored inside thrown up to 20 yards away, a storage trailer was tossed 100 yards and found impaled by multiple planks of wood, and concrete power poles in the area were bent over. Arab's power grid was completely crippled by the tornado's effects, and many roads in the area were obstructed by downed trees and power lines. The tornado damaged and destroyed several other homes, garages, and sheds north of Union Grove before it crossed the Tennessee River, snapping numerous trees in a forested area before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|With a short {{timeframe}} {{to complete}} The Wrath of Khans special effects sequences, effects supervisor Jim Veilleux, Meyer, Jennings, Sallin and Minor worked {{to transform the}} written ideas for the script into concrete storyboards and visuals. The detailed sequences were essential to keep the film's effects from spiraling {{out of control and}} driving up costs, as had occurred with The Motion Picture. Each special and optical effect, and the duration of the sequences, was listed. By the end of six weeks, the producers determined the basic look and construction of nearly all the effects; the resulting shots were combined with film footage five months later. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) produced many of the effects, and created the new models; the Reliant was the first non-Constitution-class Federation starship seen in the series. Originally, the Reliant {{was supposed to be a}} Constitution-class starship identical to the Enterprise, but it was felt audiences would have difficulty distinguishing between the two ships. As the script called for the Reliant and Enterprise to inflict significant damage on each other, ILM developed techniques to illustrate the damage without physically harming the models. Rather than move the models on a bluescreen during shooting, the VistaVision camera was panned and tracked to give the illusion of movement. Damage to the Enterprise was cosmetic, and simulated <b>with</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> aluminum that were colored or peeled off. Phaser damage was created using stop motion. The script called for large-scale damage to the Reliant, so larger versions of the ship's model were created to be blown up.|$|E

25|$|The {{city had}} many more modest restaurants, where one could dine for 1.50 francs, without wine. Employees with small {{salaries}} could find many restaurants which served a soup and main course, with bread and a carafe of wine, for between fifteen and twenty-one francs a week, with two courses with bread and a carafe. For {{students in the}} Left Bank, there were restaurants like Flicoteau, on rue de la Parcheminerie, which had no tablecloths or napkins, where diners ate at long tables with benches, and the menu consisted of bowls of bouillon <b>with</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> meat. Diners usually brought their own bread, and paid five or six centimes for their meal.|$|E
