Combat is governed by a derivative of the Press Turn system used in : in Strange Journey, the relevant system is called the Demon Co-op System. If the player group strikes their opponent's weak point, any allied demon of the attacker's aliment will follow up with an unblockable attack which deals high damage.|$|E

5|$|Planning of {{a railway}} to connect Trøndelag and Jämtland, Sweden, started in 1869, {{with one of}} the {{proposals}} being to build a line from Trondheim via Verdal to Sweden. However, surveys along the Verdal alternative deemed it unsuitable, and instead the line was built via Stjørdalen and Meråker. To conform with Swedish standards, the line was built <b>with</b> <b>standard</b> gauge instead of the more common narrow gauge. The Meråker Line opened on 22 July 1882.|$|E

5|$|After Si Ronda, Lie and Tan {{collaborated on}} three further films.

Effendi continued to work with Tan's until 1932, when he left to head the cinema magazine Doenia Film. Momo continued acting until 1941, first with Tan's and later <b>with</b> <b>Standard</b> Film. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.

5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} <b>with</b> <b>standard</b> enemies.

Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E

However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.|$|E
