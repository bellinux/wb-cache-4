5|$|In the {{six years}} after Beulah, no {{seedings}} were conducted for several different reasons. In 1964, measurement and observation equipment <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to be used. The year after that, all flights were used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane clouds.|$|E
5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast {{to be placed in}} the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready,</b> and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E
5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{character}} and the program were announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000, though the program <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for use at that time. Despite the announcement generating {{a considerable amount of}} attention, little was heard regarding the project in subsequent months. The program was never officially released nor cancelled, though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002. The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Richard {{underwent}} a rehabilitation {{program with the}} aim of recovering from the effects of the stroke. He trained with the Astros and the Texas Southern University team, participating regularly in pitching and batting practice with both {{towards the end of the}} baseball season. After pitching in a few simulated games, Richard was placed on the 40-man active roster on September 1, 1981. Astros manager Bill Virdon thought Richard <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the horizontal stabilizer {{of the second}} prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by , but this {{was just one of}} numerous problems, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant. However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E

5|$|Maunsell's {{projected}} {{design of}} express passenger locomotive <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for introduction {{during the summer}} timetable of 1925, so a third batch of ten N15s was ordered for construction at Eastleigh. This batch {{was part of an}} outstanding LSWR order to rebuild 15 of Drummond’s unsuccessful 4-cylinder F13, G14 and P14classes 4-6-0s into 2cylinder H15class locomotives. Only the five F13s were converted to H15s; the remaining ten G14 and P14s (Nos.448457, renumbered E448E457) were rebuilt as N15s, implementing modifications to Urie’s original design.|$|E
5|$|Naylor had scouted Australia {{to get an}} idea of {{locations}} and finance costs, with pre-production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005. However, finding sufficient funding has been difficult. Naylor explained at a Red Dwarf Dimension Jump convention that the film had been rejected by the BBC and the British Film Council. Reasons given for the rejections were that while the script was considered to be funny, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1960 Butlin {{planned to}} open his holiday camp at Bognor, but because of {{flooding}} it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready.</b> Butlin offered his patrons {{the chance to be}} re-sited at Clacton or to stay and help complete the camp's construction. A number opted to stay and help, and received a free bottle of champagne as a reward. Once opened, the camp quickly became popular, accommodating around 5,000 campers and another 5,000 day visitors.|$|E

We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> strong enough to be as strong as Danton. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> strong enough to be as weak as Robespierre. There is only one thing, it seems, that we can do. Like a mob of children, we can play games upon this ancient battlefield; we can pull up the bones and skulls of the tyrants and martyrs of that unimaginable war; and we can chatter to each other childishly and innocently about skulls that are imbecile and heads that are criminal. I do not know whose heads are criminal, but I think I know whose are imbecile.|$|R

5|$|Prinzregent Luitpold was {{equipped}} with two sets of Parsons turbines on the outer shafts. It was intended that a single 12,000bhp Germania 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine would drive the center shaft. However, the diesel power plant <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> in time to be installed in Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts. On trials, Prinzregent Luitpold was approximately one half knot slower than her sisters.|$|E
5|$|Sesma's {{battalion}} of approximately 725 men and artillery camped {{on the opposite}} side of the Colorado, at a distance halfway between the two Texian camps. To prevent Sesma's troops from using the William DeWees log cabin, Sherman ordered it burned. Three Mexican scouts from Sesma's army were captured by Sherman's men, and although Sherman argued for an attack on Sesma's troops, Houston <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Forum, {{which in}} later decades became {{synonymous with the}} Canadiens, was opened in 1924 to house the {{expansion}} Montreal Maroons. The Canadiens were invited to inaugurate the arena as the natural ice surface at the Mount Royal Arena <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> to host NHL games. The team played the first game in Forum history on November 29, 1924, a 7–1 victory over the Toronto St. Patricks. The Canadiens took residence at the Forum in 1926, sharing it with the Maroons until the latter ceased operations in 1938.|$|E

From 1953 to 2012, the Blue Bombers called Canad Inns Stadium home; they have since moved to Investors Group Field. Due to construction delays and cost overruns, the stadium <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> {{in time for the}} 2012 CFL season, instead opening in 2013. The $200-million facility is also the home to the CIS' University of Manitoba Bisons and the Winnipeg Rifles of the Canadian Junior Football League.|$|E
5|$|The air {{groups of}} the sisters were {{decimated}} in the battle, which forced Zuikaku to return to Japan with Shōkaku for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier {{was able to take}} part in the Battle of Midway in June. En route to Japan, Shōkaku was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized as the weight of the water used to put out the fires had compromised her stability. Repairs took three months and she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for action until late August.|$|E

Buenos Aires did not send more provisions after the ousting of Alvear. San Martín proposed to resign and serve under Balcarce, if they would support the campaign. San Martín and Guido wrote a report in the autumn of 1816, detailing to the Supreme Director Antonio González de Balcarce the full military plan of operations.|$|E

The highest {{attendance}} at the ground was 12,721, which came against Sheffield United in an FA Cup match in 1931. York {{decided to move to}} Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club in 1932, as Fulfordgate was relatively inaccessible. The ground was sold and developed as a housing estate, and Eastward Avenue now lies at its former location.|$|E

5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E
