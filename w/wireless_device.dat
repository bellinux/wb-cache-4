25|$|Because {{the sounds}} are {{transmitted}} electronically, an electronic stethoscope {{can be a}} <b>wireless</b> <b>device,</b> can be a recording device, and can provide noise reduction, signal enhancement, and both visual and audio output. Around 2001, Stethographics introduced PC-based software which enabled a phonocardiograph, graphic representation of cardiologic and pulmonologic sounds to be generated, and interpreted according to related algorithms. All of these features are helpful for purposes of telemedicine (remote diagnosis) and teaching.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the OLPC {{project was}} heavily criticised over Red Hat's {{non-disclosure}} agreement (NDA) with Marvell concerning the <b>wireless</b> <b>device</b> in OLPC, {{especially in light}} of the OLPC project being positioned as an open-source friendly initiative. An open letter for documentation was inked by Theo de Raadt (a recipient of the 2004 Award for the Advancement of Free Software), and the initiative for open documentation has been supported by Richard Stallman, the President of the Free Software Foundation. De Raadt later clarified that he finds an issue with OLPC having proprietary firmware files that are not allowed to be independently re-distributed (even in the binary form) by third-party operating systems like OpenBSD, as well as receiving no documentation to write the necessary drivers for the operating system. De Raadt has pointed out that the OpenBSD project requires no firmware source code, and no low-level documentation to work on firmware, only requiring the binary distribution rights and documentation to interface with the said binary firmware that runs outside of the main CPU, a quite simple request that is generally honoured by many other <b>wireless</b> <b>device</b> vendors like Ralink. Stallman fully agreed with de Raadt's request to open up the documentation, since Stallman is known to hold an even stronger and more idealistic position in regards to the proprietary components, and requires that even the firmware that runs outside of the main CPU must be provided in its source code form, something de Raadt does not require. De Raadt later has had to point out that such more idealistic and less realistic position has instead been misattributed to OpenBSD's more practical approach to make it look unreasonable, and stood on record that OpenBSD's position is much easier to satisfy, yet it nonetheless remained unresolved.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} a more complex type of {{television}} remote control came in 1973, {{with the development of}} the Ceefax teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, colour intensity, etc. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a <b>wireless</b> <b>device.</b> So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977–1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.|$|E

40|$|Background: Advancements in {{wireless}} technology (e. g. {{cell phones and}} tablets) have opened new communication opportunities and environments for individuals with severe communication disabilities. The advancement of these technologies poses challenges to ensuring that these individuals enjoy equal access to this increasingly essential technology. However, a paucity of research exists. Objectives: To describe the nature and frequency with which South African adults with severe communication disabilities have access to and use <b>wireless</b> <b>devices,</b> {{as well as the}} types of activities for which <b>wireless</b> <b>devices</b> are used. Method: Survey research was conducted with 30 individuals who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technology using the Survey of User Needs Questionnaire developed in the United States, and localized to the South African context. Results: All participants, despite their limited education, unemployment and low economic status, owned and/or used mainstream <b>wireless</b> <b>devices.</b> Slightly {{more than half of the}} participants (53. 3 %) needed adaptations to their <b>wireless</b> <b>devices.</b> Advantages of using <b>wireless</b> <b>devices</b> were highlighted, including connecting with others (through using text messaging, social networking, making plans with others, sharing photos and videos with friends), for leisure activities (e. g. listening to music, watching videos, playing games), and for safety purposes (e. g. to navigate when lost, using the device when in trouble and needing immediate assistance). Conclusion: These <b>wireless</b> <b>devices</b> offer substantial benefits and opportunities to individuals with disabilities who rely on AAC in terms of independence, social participation, education and safety/security. However, they still do not enjoy equal opportunity to access and use <b>wireless</b> <b>devices</b> relative to the non-disabled population. </p...|$|R

50|$|The push access {{protocol}} {{is independent of}} the transport used. PAP messages carry control information, {{and in the case}} of a push submission, also content and optionally client capabilities information. Control information includes command/response messages between the PPG and the Push Initiator, and parameters passed to the PPG for use in sending content to the <b>wireless</b> <b>device.</b> Examples of this type of information include the <b>wireless</b> <b>device</b> address, the delivery priority of the message, etc. This information is not normally delivered to the <b>wireless</b> <b>device.</b> Content is information that is intended for the <b>wireless</b> <b>device.</b> This information might be intelligible only to the <b>wireless</b> <b>device</b> (e.g. may be encrypted by the Push Initiator or may be application data for an application unknown to the PPG) or it may be recognisable by the PPG (e.g. HTML or WML). The PPG may be configured to perform some transformation on recognisable content (e.g. HTML to WML) for certain wireless devices. The other category of information is client capability information as specified in the User Agent Profile UAPROF. When more than control is carried in a message, the format of the message is a MIME multipart/related RFC2387 compound object. When only control information (e.g. for message responses) is carried in a message, the format of themessage is a simple application/xml entity. All information is transported within a single message body. In the multipart messages, the first entity contains all push related control information in an XML document, the second entity contains the content for the <b>wireless</b> <b>device,</b> the third entity, if present, contains UAPROF client capabilities. The format of the content entity is specified in PushMsg.|$|E
