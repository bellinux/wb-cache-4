50|$|The Heidelberg Tun (Großes Fass), or Great Heidelberg Tun, is an {{extremely}} large <b>wine</b> <b>vat</b> contained within the cellars of Heidelberg Castle. There have been four such barrels {{in the history of}} Heidelberg. In 1751, the year of its construction, the present one had a capacity of 221,726 litres (58,573.8125 U.S. gallons). Due to the drying of the wood its current capacity is 219,000 litres (57,853.6795 U.S. gallons). One hundred and thirty oak trees were reputedly used in its construction. It has only rarely been used as a wine barrel, and in fact presently enjoys more use as a tourist attraction, and also as a dance floor since one was constructed on top of the tun.|$|E

Storage containers for smelted metal were found {{as well that}} held far greater amounts than the town should have required. Large quantities of debris from flint and obsidian knapping, pottery making, metallurgy, and weapons manufacture indicate that the town had organized guilds which performed such tasks. Pottery found at the town typically has a characteristic black burnished exterior and reddish interior with either incised or raised designs.

50|$|Jaime Torres {{emigrated to}} Cuba in 1855. On the island {{he made his}} fortune through the flourishing oil {{industry}} and seaborne trade. In 1870 he returned home a rich man and went into business with his brother, a wine grower. Together they founded the family company, in Vilafranca del Penedès, in 1870. One of Jaime Torres’ ideas was to build a 600000 L <b>wine</b> <b>vat,</b> {{the largest in the}} world.During the Spanish Civil War the winery was bombarded, leaving everything in ruins, including the enormous vat. Miguel Torres Carbó, a fourth generation member of the family, rebuilt the winery in 1940 and started business up again. He brought an end to the sale of bulk wine and started to market it in labelled bottles. In the year of reconstruction, when France was under Hitler's control and unable to provide wine, Miguel Torres traveled to the United States to promote his wines. It was in this period that the brands Sangre de Toro, Viña Sol and Coronas first came into being.|$|E

The work reflects urban and rural environments, drawing on subject matter related to Permar's experience of living and working in diverse cultures. She invented the word 'webnitki' by combining the English word 'web' with the Russian word 'nitki', meaning 'threads'.|$|E

50|$|The 1965 thriller The Collector {{contained}} mild nudity of Samantha Eggar {{and added}} to the challenge to the blanket prohibition of nudity in films. That same year Paula Prentiss performed a strip-tease in the Woody Allen-scripted comedy What's New Pussycat?, which {{ended up on the}} cutting room floor but resurfaced on the pages of Playboy magazine; while Julie Christie appeared nude in the British drama film Darling. U.S. release prints of the film and even later U.S. video and DVD versions cut the nudity. In 1966, Michelangelo Antonioni's seminal film Blowup was the first English-language film to show a woman's pubic hair. Antonioni's mod-influenced murder-mystery contained a scene involving two girls undressing before being chased around a studio by a fashion photographer, who wrestles them to the ground and exposes their torsos. There are additional scenes depicting sexuality and partial nudity, as well as blatant drug use. The film was produced in Britain and released to American audiences by MGM without Production Code approval, the first mainstream motion picture containing nudity to be released by a major studio in the US, the first open defiance by a major studio of the Code. That same year the biblical epic based on the book of Genesis, The Bible: In the Beginning, was released by Twentieth Century Fox featuring a nude Adam and Eve sequence. Another epic, the historical film Hawaii (1966) featured scenes of topless native girls. John Frankenheimer's 1966 sci-fi thriller Seconds, starring Rock Hudson, contained an extended sequence of full frontal male and female nudity that was deleted from the original American release in which bohemian revelers dance and play in a <b>wine</b> <b>vat.</b>|$|E

This is the highest concentration of such work in one place. One of the centres of production was in Naples. the cloister orchards; and on the other hand the large kitchen, the cellars with their enormous <b>wine</b> <b>vats,</b> the laundries, and the huge external yards, where there were people working in the stables, ovens, stores, and at the olive oil mill.

40|$|Winemaking is {{a dynamic}} process, where {{microbiological}} and chemical effects may strongly differentiate products from the same vineyard and even between <b>wine</b> <b>vats.</b> This high variability means an increase in work in terms of control and process management. The winemaking process therefore requires a site-specific approach in order to optimize cellar practices and quality management, suggesting a new concept of winemaking, identified as Precision Enology.

At {{the top of the hill}} there was a huge entrance through a wooden gateway, which seemed to have been constructed with the intention of defying any intruders not provided with warlike ammunition. The gates were, indeed, open at the period of their visit, but it must be supposed that they were intended to be closed at any rate at night. Immediately on the right, as they entered through the gates, there was a large barn, in which two men were coopering <b>wine</b> <b>vats.</b> From thence a path led slanting to the house, of which the door was shut, and all the front windows blocked with shutters. The house was very long, and only of one story for a portion of its length. Over that end at which the door was placed there were upper rooms, and there must have been space enough for a large family with many domestics. There was nothing round or near the residence which could be called a garden, so that its look of desolation was extreme. There were various large barns and outhouses, as though it had been intended by the builder that corn and hay and cattle should be kept there; but it seemed now that there was nothing there except the empty vats at which the two men were coopering. Had the Englishmen gone farther into the granary, they would have seen that there were wine-presses stored away in the dark corners.|$|R

Until 1914, almost 300 men were employed at this quarry. From the other quarries came stone mainly used for making hewn stones for window and door walling and lintels, and also for making stone crocks for sauerkraut, <b>wine</b> press <b>vats</b> and fruit presses.
