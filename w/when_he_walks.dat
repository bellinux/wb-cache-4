At the time of sale, The Mail on Sunday said of Pike, [...] "Stooped and shrunken, his face looks like a weathered Easter Island statue and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> he shuffles unsteadily, bowed by a life of excess. Pike's powers are fading." [...] A 2008 Sky Living TV documentary also showed him and the hotel in an unfavourable light, and {{it appeared to be}} living on its past reputation.|$|E
500|$|Leterrier {{had planned}} to use {{prosthetic}} makeup and animatronics to complement the computer-generated imagery that was solely used in the previous film. The make-up artists who worked on [...] were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation, which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky [...] "not [...] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, {{and we talked about}} how <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [...] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [...]" [...] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3) was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic. An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however. Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Auster {{refers to}} Llull (as Raymond Lull) {{in his memoir}} The Invention of Solitude in the second part, The Book of Memory. Llull, now going under the name 'Cole Hawlings' and {{revealed}} to be immortal, is a major character in The Box of Delights, the celebrated children's novel by poet John Masefield. [...] He is also {{a major influence on}} the fictional character Zermano in Thomas Salazar's The Day of the Bees, and his name, philosophies, and quotes from his writings appear throughout the novel. In Roberto Bolaño's novel 2666, Amalfitano, a Chilean professor, thinks about [...] "Ramon Llull and his fantastic machine. Fantastic in its uselessness." [...] Adán, Leopoldo Marechal's protagonist of the novel Adán Buenosayres (1948), mentions Ramon Lulio <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> past a curtiembre (a leather-tanning shop): He says: [...] "Ramon Lulio, que aconsejaba no rehuir del olor de las letrinas a fin de recordar a menudo lo que da el cuerpo de si mismo en su tan frecuentemente olvidada miseria" [...] (Edición Crítica, Colección Archivos, 1997. Page 312) ("Ramon Llull advised not to shy away from the smell of outhouses, in order not to forget that which the body gives out in its often forgotten misery.") In William Gaddis' first novel, The Recognitions, the final paragraph of Chapter II alludes to [...] "Raymond Lully", as a [...] "scholar, a poet, a missionary, a mystic, and one of the foremost figures in the history of alchemy." [...] Llull is also mentioned in passing in Neil Gaiman's comic-book Calliope, an issue of the DC/Vertigo series The Sandman. In The Commodore, the 17th book in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series, Stephen Maturin remarks that his daughter [...] "...will learn Spanish, too, Castellano. I am sorry it will not be Catalan, a much finer, older, purer, more mellifluous language, with far greater writers — think of En Ramon Llull — but as Captain Aubrey often says, 'You cannot both have a stitch in time and eat it.'" ...|$|E
