30|$|Theoretically, {{the density}} {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations were performed with CASTEP [12]; the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) {{was used to}} deal with the exchange and correlation term. It is well known that the local density approximation (LDA) is normally inaccurate in describing the van der Waals-like interaction, and the advantage of GGA over LDA in this work is that the GGA will not lead to a strong bonding of the molecules as LDA does [13]. A plane wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 800  eV and pseudopotentials of the Troullier–Martins type and non-spin-polarized calculations were used in this study. The total system consisted of a 3 [*]×[*] 3 graphene supercell (18 C atoms) with a single molecule adsorbed and a distance of 16  Å between adjacent graphene layers. The Brillouin zone integration was performed <b>within</b> the <b>Monkhorst–Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> using 5 [*]×[*] 5 [*]×[*] 1  k points [14]. For the calculation of the density of states (DOS), a 20 [*]×[*] 20 [*]×[*] 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid and a Gaussian smearing of 0.05  eV were used [15].|$|R
30|$|For all structures, the <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> {{is used in}} the Brillouin zone with 2 × 2 × 10 for all the {{geometry}} optimization and total energy calculations [13]. For all relaxation calculations, the volume of cell is fixed and the structure considered are fully relaxed to accuracy where the self-consistent field was done with a convergence criterion of 2 × 10 - 5 eV/atom.|$|R

Special k points were generated with the 1 × 1 × 4 grid based on <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme.</b> Good convergence was obtained with these parameters. The total energy was converged to be 1.0 × 10 − 4 eV/atom in the optimized structure.|$|R
30|$|Energetics and {{electronic}} properties, {{density of states}} and band structures were computed for the pristine (pure) graphene surface, silver adsorbed on the hollow site, bridge site of the hexagonal ring {{as well as on}} the top site of the carbon atom in the hexagon of the 33 -atom graphene sheet. A kinetic energy cutoff of 350 eV was employed, and this choice gave fully converged calculations. Brillouin zone sampling was done using the 2 × 2 × 1 special k-point mesh employing the <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> [29].|$|R
30|$|All the {{predictions}} {{have been performed}} using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package and density functional theory [12]. The generalized gradient approximation [13] and a 450 -eV cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set were used. Pseudopotentials with 3 s 23 p 2, 1 [*]s 1, and 4 s 24 p 5 valence electron configurations for Si, H, and Br atoms were used, respectively. Following the <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> [14], Brillouin-zone integration was carried out at 9 [*]×[*] 9 [*]×[*] 1 [*]k-points, and 15 [*]×[*] 15 [*]×[*] 1 [*]k-points were used to obtain the electronic properties. The symmetry-unrestricted optimizations for geometry were performed using the conjugate gradient scheme until the largest Hellmann-Feynman force is smaller than 0.01 [*]eV/Å.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe CASTEP module of Materials Studio {{package was}} used for {{calculations}} of the structural, electronic and optical properties of pure and Cr 3 +-doped YAB. The exchange-correlation effects were treated within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> k-points grid sampling was set at 3 × 3 × 4 for the Brillouin zone (BZ). The plane-wave basis set energy cutoff was set at 340 eV; ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used for all chemical elements. The convergence parameters were as follows: total energy tolerance - 1 × 10 - 5 eV/atom, maximum force tolerance 0. 03 eV/nm, maximal stress component 0. 05 GPa and maximal displacement 0. 001 Å. Identification of the principal absorption peaks of the studied crystal was done. Influence of the 532 nm cw 300 mW laser beams on the observed absorptions is studied...|$|R
30|$|Our {{theoretical}} calculations {{are performed}} {{in the framework of}} density functional theory (DFT) [45] as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [46]. Valence wave functions are treated by the projector augmented wave (PAW) [47, 48] method that uses pseudopotential operators but keeps the full all-electron wave functions. The interlayer interaction is checked by various exchange-correlation energy functionals, including the local density approximation (LDA) [49], the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [50] generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and the PBE with vdW corrections: the vdW-D 2 functionals [51]. The plane-wave energy cutoff is set to be 400  eV. We have checked the convergence of k points, and a 5 [*]×[*] 5 [*]×[*] 1  k-sampling generated by the <b>Monkhorst–Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> [52] with Gamma centered for the Brillouin zone is adopted. The structural optimization is allowed to relaxed until the maximum force on each atom becomes at least less than 0.01  eV/Å and the maximum energy change between two steps is smaller than 10 − 5  eV. A vacuum layer of at least 20  Å is used.|$|R
30|$|The {{electronic}} {{structural analysis}} {{is carried out}} using the SIESTA 3.1 code, which performs fully self-consistent calculations solving the Kohn-Sham equations [28]. The Kohn-Sham orbitals are expanded using linear combinations of pseudo-atomics orbitals. The double-zeta polarized (DZP) basis set was chosen in this study. The calculations were done with the local density approximation (LDA), using the Ceperley-Alder correlation as parameterized by Perdew and Zunger [29]. The electron-ion interaction was treated by using norm-conserving, fully separable pseudo-potentials [30]. A cutoff of 200 Ry for the grid integration was utilized to represent the charge density. Two TCNQ molecules on and under the (4 [*]×[*] 4), (6 [*]×[*] 6), or (8 [*]×[*] 8) graphene supercell units were simulated for full relaxation of the systems. The Brilliouin zone was sampled by 20 [*]×[*] 20 [*]×[*] 1 [*]k-points using the <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> for electronic properties calculations. It is necessary {{to ensure that the}} z axis of the periodic supercell (normal to the graphene surface) is large enough so that there is negligible interaction between the two graphene sheets. A distance of 170  Å along the z axis is found to be sufficient to ensure the energy convergence for configurations.|$|R
3000|$|First {{principles}} calculations {{are performed}} by the VASP code [27]. The approach {{is based on an}} iterative solution of the Kohn-Sham equation of the density function theory in a plane-wave set with the projector-augmented wave pseudopotentials. In our calculations, the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation (XC) functional of the generalized gradient approximation is adopted. We set the plane-wave cutoff energy to be 520 eV and the convergence of the force on each atom to be less than 0.01 eV/Å. The optimizations of the lattice constants and the atomic coordinates are made by the minimization of the total energy. The supercells are used to simulate the isolated sheet and the sheets are separated by larger than 12 Å to avoid interlayer interactions. The <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> is used for sampling the Brillouin zone. In the calculations, the structures are fully relaxed with a mesh of 5 × 5 × 1, and the mesh of k space is increased to 7 × 7 × 1, in the static calculations. In the spin-polarized calculations, both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) states are constructed for the initial magnetic structures of the H-BC [...]...|$|R
30|$|The first-principles {{calculations}} {{are performed}} by the VASP code with projector augmented wave pseudopotentials and plane-wave basis sets [46, 47]. The cutoff energy of plane-wave basis is set to 500 eV, and a vacuum layer up to 15 Å is utilized to simulate the isolated 2 D sheet. The <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> is adopted to sample the Brillouin zone, which uses a 9 × 9 × 1 and 15 × 15 × 1 k-mesh in the relaxed and static calculations, respectively. During the structural relaxation, the Perdew-BurkeErnzerhof (PBE) exchange and correlation (XC) functional are used. All the lattice constants as well as atomic coordinates are fully optimized until the convergence of force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV/Å. The hybrid XC functional of Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) is also used in the band structure calculations, which adopts the HSE 06 form with a screening parameter of 0.11 bohr − 1 [48]. In view of the large computing resources required for the hybrid functional, HSE calculations are {{performed by the}} FHI-aims code with a numeric local orbital basis set [49]. We find that the two codes give consistent results despite of the basis set difference. The dynamical stabilities of nanosheets are studied by the Phonopy code [50], which is performed on a supercell with 4 × 4 units.|$|R
30|$|Because of {{the large}} surface area of pSiC, there are many {{potential}} sites for the attachment of various chemical species, such as O atoms, which were studied in this work. We analyzed {{the effects of the}} interaction of O atoms with the pore surface on the electronic structure by replacing pairs of H atoms on the passivated surface with O atoms. The changes in the electronic structure that arise due to two types of O bonding environments at the surface, single Si-O-Si or C-O-C bonds (bridge-bonded) and double Si[*]=[*]O or C[*]=[*]O bonds, were compared. The calculations of the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) of pSiC were performed using an ab initio density functional theory generalized gradient approximation scheme as described by a revised version of the RPBE [14] functional and norm-conserving pseudopotentials [15] as implemented in the CASTEP code [16]. We used a cutoff energy of 750 [*]eV and a highly converged k-point set according to the <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> [17] with grids of up to 3 [*]×[*] 3 [*]×[*] 6 [*]k points. All structures were optimized to their basal state by modifying the atomic coordinates and the supercell shape through the BFGS algorithm [18]. DFT is known to underestimate the band gap energy. This problem can be overcome using other approximations, such as GW; however, in this work, we focused on the relative energetic stability and electronic property differences between the pores and, hence, did not apply any correction.|$|R
30|$|The atomic {{positions}} of all structures are relaxed with residual forces smaller than 0.01  eV/Å. For the Brillouin-zone integration, we use only gamma {{point in the}} <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> special k-points <b>scheme.</b> The lattice constant of our model is calculated to be 2.56  Å, which is in agreement with experimental value [23]. To study {{the difference in the}} reconstructed structures after BN-pair missing, we consider (9 [*]×[*] 9) and (15 [*]×[*] 15) supercell in our calculations.|$|R
30|$|Our {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed by employing the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [42] {{which is based on}} the spin-polarized density functional theory [43], the plane wave basis, and the projector augmented wave (PAW) representation [44]. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation energy functional [45] within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is employed in the calculations (some comparative studies using B 3 LYP [46, 47] and HSE 06 [48] hybrid functionals are also presented when necessary). In order to accurately describe the van der Waals (vdWs) interactions between graphene and Cu(111) surface, the PBE functional with the vdWs correction (DFT-D 2) [49] is adopted. The cutoff plane-wave kinetic energy is set to be 500  eV. The Cu(111) surface was modeled by using a slab model that comprises seven Cu layers together with a vacuum spacing of about 20  Å. Different V coverages on Cu(111) and Gra/Cu(111) surfaces were modeled by using different supercells. For 1 / 9 ML and 1 ML of V coverages, we employed (3 [*]×[*] 3) and (1 [*]×[*] 1) surface unit cells, respectively. The <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> <b>scheme</b> [50] with a 24 [*]×[*] 24 [*]×[*] 1  k-mesh was used to sample the Brillouin zone integration for the (1 [*]×[*] 1) surface unit cell, while an 8 [*]×[*] 8 [*]×[*] 1  k-mesh was used for the (3 [*]×[*] 3) surface unit cell. During the optimization, the lowermost three Cu layers of the slab were frozen while the remaining atoms of the systems were fully relaxed until the force on each atom was less than 0.01  eV/Å. Vanadium atoms were adsorbed {{on one side of the}} slab. The dipole correction [51] is not considered in this study due to a negligible energy correction found on the basis of our calculations.|$|R
30|$|Our {{calculations}} {{are carried}} out by using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) package [24], {{which is based on}} density functional theory (DFT) and plane-wave pseudopotential method. The electron exchange-correlation energy is described in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form for the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [25]. The cut-off energy is set to be 600  eV for the plane-wave expansion of the wave functions. The Brillouin zone integration is represented by the <b>Monkhorst-Pack</b> k-point <b>scheme</b> with 9 [*]×[*] 9 [*]×[*] 1 and 5 [*]×[*] 5 [*]×[*] 1 grid meshes for the (1 [*]×[*] 1) unit cell and (4 [*]×[*] 4) supercell, respectively. The criterion of convergence of energy is chosen as 10 − 5 eV between two ionic steps, and the maximum force allowed on each atom is 0.01  eV/Å. The vacuum space along the z direction is taken to be more than 15  Å for the both 1 H-MoS 2 and 1 T-MoS 2.|$|R
