He receives a letter from his realtor saying that running a business from his condominium is in violation of his residence agreement, so he needs to find office space for the company.

500|$|In August 1987 Tennstedt, taken ill at a rehearsal, felt so unequal to {{continuing}} in his post that he resigned on the spot. He continued to appear with the LPO as a guest, {{with the title}} of [...] "conductor laureate"; in 1989 Richard Morrison of The Times wrote that the LPO still played better for Tennstedt than for anyone else. Tennstedt's resignation was a severe blow to the orchestra, {{and there was no}} obvious successor: Morrison observed that the best-known conductors – Barenboim, Riccardo Muti and Simon Rattle – with whom the orchestra was then associated were committed to other projects until the 1990s, and that possible contenders such as Semyon Bychkov and Franz Welser-Möst were largely unknown in London. No successor was appointed until 1990, when Welser-Möst was named as the new principal conductor. His tenure was controversial; he received the nickname [...] "Frankly Worse than Most" [...] and many harshly critical reviews. He brought with him a recording contract with EMI, but management turnover, financial stresses, and political disputes at the Southbank Centre at the time contributed to the difficulty of the <b>working</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in the orchestra. There were complaints that the orchestra's high standards of playing were not consistently maintained.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of taking}} the title of Lord Protector, John Dudley set out to rule as primus inter pares, the <b>working</b> <b>atmosphere</b> being more conciliar and less autocratic than under Somerset. The new Lord President of the Council reshuffled some high offices, {{becoming}} Grand Master of the Household himself and giving Somerset's former office of Lord Treasurer to William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester. The office of Grand Master entailed supervising the Royal Household, which gave Dudley the means to control the Privy Chamber and thus the King's surroundings. This was done via his [...] "special friends" [...] (as he called them), Sir John Gates and Lord Thomas Darcy. Dudley also placed his son-in-law Sir Henry Sidney and his brother Sir Andrew Dudley near the King. William Cecil {{was still in the}} Duke of Somerset's service when he gradually shifted his loyalty to John Dudley, who made him Secretary of State and thought him [...] "a most faithful servant and by that term most witty [...] councillor ... as was scarce like in this realm". In this position Cecil was Dudley's trusted right hand, who primed the Privy Council according to the Lord President's wishes. At the same time Cecil had intimate contact with the King because Edward worked closely with the secretaries of state.|$|E

40|$|The use of peroxyacetic acid (PAA) in the {{disinfection}} {{processes in}} the food industry or for medical purposes is increasing. As it {{is the product of}} the reaction of acetic acid (AA) and hydrogen peroxide (HP) and coexists with them, and {{given the fact that the}} chemical properties of these two substances are not very different from PAA, the sampling and analysis of this substance in <b>working</b> <b>atmospheres</b> is difficult. A specific sampling device was developed. It is composed of: (i) a cassette with quartz fibre filters impregnated with titanium oxysulfate hydrate for the sampling of HP followed by; (ii) a tube filled with silica gel soaked with methyl p-tolylsulfoxide for the sampling of PAA. The analysis of this silica gel was performed by liquid chromatography with UV detection of themethyl p-sulfone generated by the sampling of PAA. The conservation of the samplingmedia (before and after sampling) and its efficiency were also checked. From the results of sampling campaigns performed in various workplaces, the relative contributions of PAA, AA and HP to an exposure index, taking into account the atmospheric concentrations and the threshold limit values, were established. This calculation shows that the simultaneous determination of PAA and HP, which the method presented in this paper allows, provides a fairly good estimation of the exposure...|$|R

2500|$|Preference for Russian Revival did {{not mean}} aversion to Byzantine architecture. Alexander {{displayed}} a clear aversion to 18th century baroque and neoclassicism that he despised as symbols of Petrine absolutism; Byzantine architecture was an acceptable [...] "middle road". Byzantine-style architects of the previous reign formed a numerous school with loyal clients, including senior clergy. Paradoxically, the Byzantine school was concentrated in the Institute of Civil Engineers which also provided a department chair to Nikolay Sultanov, informal leader of Russian Revival and an advisor to Alexander III. Sultanov's graduate, Vasily Kosyakov, made himself famous by the Byzantine churches in Saint Petersburg (1888–1898) and Astrakhan (designed in 1888, built in 1895–1904), but was just as successful in Russian Revival projects (Libava Naval Cathedral, 1900–1903).

The object of {{investigation is}} obtaining the comparative toxicological and hygienic characteristics of boricide and components thereof and revelation of the physiological features of the action mechanism. The researchers have pioneered in quantitatively evaluating the combination effects produced by boricide in all phases of toxicometry, determined the maximum permissible concentration thereof in the <b>working</b> zone <b>atmosphere,</b> disclosed the hypothetical mechanism of the toxic effect and studied the physiological aspects thereof. The investigators have substantiated {{the possibility of using}} the boricide sanitary standards by the state sanitary inspection agencies for monitoring the content of boricide in the <b>working</b> zone <b>atmosphere.</b> They have also developed technical requirements for the production of boricide at the 'SERA' ('SULFUR') Rozdolskoye Corporation. The obtained investigation results have found application at the 'SERA' Rozdolskoye Corporation and the departments of hominal physiology and hygiene of the Lvov Medical Institute. The researchers' merit resides in expanding the knowledge about the mechanism of action of dithiocarbamates and enabling the state sanitary inspection agencies to use the elaborated sanitary standards and the results of calculation of the concentration of boricide contained in the atmosphere.
