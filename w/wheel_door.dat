The [...] "white package" [...] was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white [...] "saw blade" [...] wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3-point seat belts to replace the previous years' two-point lap belts. New tail lights, front bumper with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years' detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering <b>wheel,</b> <b>door</b> panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo.

50|$|The BH Persona {{shares the}} vast {{majority}} of its interior panels with the Iriz. The centre console, dashboard, steering <b>wheel,</b> <b>door</b> cards and transmission tunnel were carried over unchanged. However, Proton did introduce several minor additions and cosmetic changes, the most prominent of which being the dual-tone colour scheme, a contrast from the all-black interior of the Iriz. The lower-half of the dashboard, transmission tunnel, handbrake, cup holders, pillars and inner sections of the door cards are finished in a light grey or beige colour, while the top-half of the dashboard and outer frame of the door cards are in matte black. The new colour scheme is said to increase the impression of space and perceived quality, while also paying homage to the old CM Persona. There are ten storage compartments and seven cup holders in the BH Persona.|$|E
