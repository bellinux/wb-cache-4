25|$|Route X78 is {{a service}} which goes from Sheffield Interchange via Meadowhall, Rotherham and {{arriving}} 90 minutes later at Doncaster Frenchgate Interchange. From Monday to Saturday it operates every fifteen minutes {{during the day}} and every twenty minutes on Sundays and <b>week</b> <b>day</b> evenings.|$|E
25|$|Date {{and time}} values are ordered from the largest to {{smallest}} unit of time: year, month (or <b>week),</b> <b>day,</b> hour, minute, second, and fraction of second. The lexicographical {{order of the}} representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years. This allows dates to be naturally sorted by, for example, file systems.|$|E

30|$|The fifth {{step is to}} use {{the cluster}} {{technique}} in [25] to group the hours of <b>week</b> <b>days</b> or weekend days by season in order to obtain a clustered-value for each hour of the twenty-four hours in a day. Figures  2 b and 3 b depict the representative daily curve for <b>week</b> <b>days</b> and weekend days obtained by season.|$|R
50|$|BCal {{tried to}} work around these {{restrictions}} by using larger One-Eleven 500s in a low-density configuration featuring a first class section on <b>week</b> <b>days</b> and smaller, single-class One-Eleven 200s on week-ends. This enabled it to offer a higher frequency on <b>week</b> <b>days,</b> resulting in a more competitive schedule for business travellers while keeping within its allocated capacity share.|$|R
25|$|Masks have {{depicted}} the three races of Mexican history, indigenous, European and African. Masks with Asian features {{can sometimes be}} found along the Pacific coast, where immigrants from China and the Philippines settled. The majority of Mexican masks depict human male faces, especially those for Carnival, Holy <b>Week,</b> <b>Day</b> of the Dead and local saint festivals. Many of the human masks are realistic, and faithfully reproduce various facial types. Others are so stylized that facial figures are only suggested. Expressions {{vary depending on the}} character being portrayed.|$|E
25|$|ACTION resumed Route 11/11A to Canberra Airport's {{passenger}} terminal from the City bus interchange in 2017.

25|$|The Rev. Mr. Leslie, of Castlebellingham, who {{threatened}} the Gaelic league with his wrath for daring {{to hold a}} Feis on Sunday, has, we regret to say, found an imitator in a Catholic clergyman {{at the other side}} of Ireland – the Rev. Father Donor, of Shanagolden. This gentleman acted similarly towards the Gaelic League of Foynes, which proposed to hold its Feis on a Sunday, and to appease him the Feis was held on a <b>week</b> <b>day,</b> with the result that numbers of people were deprived from attending it. Although the Sunday fixture was abandoned to please him, neither Father Donor nor any of his curates attended the Feis.|$|E

25|$|Initially all {{meetings}} between the Norwegian and Soviet commissioners and their staff {{was held at}} the Storskog–Boris Gleb crossing. The Soviets quickly bought a small cabin to host meetings. If the meeting was initiated by the Soviets, it was held in the premises, while it was held outdoors if initiated by the Norwegians, unless circumstances dictated {{that it had to be}} held indoors. This caused the Norwegian authorities to build a conference room on their side of the border, which opened in 1956. Initially {{meetings between}} the two commissioners would be called by hoisting a flag or red lamp at the border, and the other country's soldiers would alert the commissioner, who would meet within two hours. Later a telephone connection was installed and the parties agreed on two hours each <b>week</b> <b>day</b> that they were to be available along with an interpreter. Initially the Soviet commissioner was based in Salmijärvi, but later moved to Nikel.|$|E
25|$|After the Conquest of the Aztec Empire, {{a number}} of Spanish historians noted {{indigenous}} religious rituals and ceremonies including those that used masks. The Spanish banned pre Hispanic religion but the evangelizers used the cultures’ propensity for masks and spectacle to propagate the new faith, through plays and dance. New dances evolved from the mystery plays and allegorical dramas used by evangelists. One {{of the most important}} was a pageant that reenacted the battles between Christians and Moors, which used masks to imitate the Moors. This dance was rapidly adopted by the indigenous and performed in indigenous languages. Other masked dances developed in relation to Holy <b>Week,</b> <b>Day</b> of the Dead and the Conquest of Mexico, as well as Carnival, a European festival introduced by the Spanish. The masks for characters such as Hernán Cortés, La Malinche, shepherds, devils, kings developed and became very diverse. Little is known about masks from the colonial era, but at least some came from the same workshops that produced saint images, which had sophisticated and realistic depictions of faces. Others were mostly likely made by those who sold or rented costumes to performers. Some may have been made by the dancers themselves. The developing dances and other masked events became part of a syncretism of Catholic and native traditions and belief, especially Carnival and Holy Week, with the first coinciding with the Aztec New Year and new agricultural cycle. In addition, many of the masks developed during this time mocked colonial overlords. For these reasons, a various times, masks and dances were forbidden by authorities from the 16th to 18th centuries.|$|E
500|$|At {{his young}} age, Middleton was {{required}} to complete a year of preparatory school before being enrolled in the four-year program at Mississippi A In essence he did a final {{year of high school}} while living in the dormitory and following the regimen of the students at the college. [...] The students were treated like cadets at a military academy, marching to and from all meals, and beginning their day with the first bugle call at 5:30a.m. Every <b>week</b> <b>day</b> was the same: cleanup and study time in the morning, march to breakfast, a usually short chapel call, classes from 8:30 to 4:00, broken only by lunch, athletics from 4:00 to 6:30p.m., dinner, and then study from 7:30 to 10:00p.m., followed by the playing of taps at 10:30, and lights out at 10:40. While Middleton did not particularly savor the military atmosphere, he settled into the routine, and the year passed quickly. [...] The highlight of his preparatory year came on 10 February 1905 when John Philip Sousa brought his band to A, attracting people from around the state, and packing the 2000-seat mess hall. The train that would take the band to its next stop was held up for over an hour as the concert was extended by repeated calls for encores.|$|E
