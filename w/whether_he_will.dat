5|$|In 2012, Warner Bros. {{announced}} that negotiations {{had been made}} to produce another installment, with the intention of having Will Smith reprise his role. In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled A Garden at the End of the World, described as a post-apocalyptic variation of The Searchers. Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay, they had the writer Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as the next film. Serving as a reboot of the story, the studio hopes to create a franchise of films. Will Smith, who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels, has not commented on <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> appear or not.|$|E

50|$|A {{group of}} dancers congregate {{on the stage}} of a Broadway theatre to {{audition}} for a new musical production directed by Zach (Michael Douglas). After the initial eliminations, sixteen hopefuls remain. Arriving late is former lead dancer Cassie (Alyson Reed) who once had a tempestuous romantic relationship with Zach but left him to take a job in Hollywood. Now she hasn't worked in over a year, and is desperate enough for work to even just be part of the chorus line. <b>Whether</b> <b>he's</b> <b>willing</b> to let professionalism overcome his personal feelings about their past remains to be seen.|$|R
5|$|On a {{cold day}} the fictional 304th New York Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Eighteen-year-old Private Henry Fleming, remembering his romantic reasons for enlisting {{as well as}} his mother's {{resulting}} protests, wonders <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> remain brave in the face of fear, or turn and run. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment's first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henry deserts his regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union's victory.|$|E
5|$|His first {{appearance}} outside Final Fantasy VII {{was as a}} selectable character in the fighting game Ehrgeiz. A redesigned Sephiroth also appears in the North American and European versions of Kingdom Hearts as an optional boss character in Olympus Coliseum. Lance Bass voiced Sephiroth in this game, while in subsequent titles he was replaced by George Newbern. In the Japanese re-release of the game, Final Mix, an additional scene was added in which Sephiroth fights Cloud, although {{the result of the}} fight is not revealed. Sephiroth {{was not included in the}} sequel , as director Tetsuya Nomura could not give him a storyline related to Cloud, and he feared negative fan response if Sephiroth did not have a notable role in the story. His third appearance outside Final Fantasy VII is as another optional boss in Kingdom Hearts II, where he is first encountered by the series' protagonist, Sora, and then Cloud, who is pursuing him. When Sephiroth battles Cloud, both of them disappear, with Sora believing that they went somewhere else to continue their fight. Nomura said that in this game, Sephiroth represents Cloud's dark side, in contrast to Tifa Lockhart, who represents his light side. Although Sephiroth does not appear in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, he is mentioned as a hero that Zack Fair aspires to be. The staff, however, did not know if they would portray him as a being of darkness as shown in other titles. Sephiroth's fourth outside appearance is in the Itadaki Street games Special and Portable, where he appears as an unlockable playable character. Due to Sephiroth's many appearances as a boss in the Kingdom Hearts series, Square Enix is not sure <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> return in Kingdom Hearts III as it would be redundant.|$|E

I don't think her father is guiltier than a great many other people who haven't been found out. But he has been found out, and he ought, {{for the sake of the}} community, to be willing to bear the penalty the law inflicts. That is his only hope, his salvation, his duty. Father's duty is to make him bear it <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> <b>willing</b> or not. It's a much more odious duty--" ...|$|R
25|$|The final scene's snowy {{landscape}} was filmed in New Zealand. The ending is deliberately ambiguous, {{and the audience}} is left with several questions: specifically, how much time has passed, if Dae-Su's meeting with the hypnotist really took place, whether he successfully lost the knowledge of Mi-do's identity, and <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> continue his relationship with Mi-do. In an interview with Park (included with the European release of the film), {{he says that the}} ambiguous ending was deliberate and intended to generate discussion; it is completely up to each individual viewer to interpret what isn't shown.|$|E
25|$|Later, Tigerclaw leads {{a band of}} rogues into ThunderClan camp, {{pretending to}} defend the Clan. During the battle, Tigerclaw corners Bluestar in her den and tries to kill her. Fireheart arrives {{just in time to}} save her, and he drives Tigerclaw away. Bluestar is shaken and shocked by Tigerclaw's mutiny, though she manages to {{announce}} Tigerclaw's exile from the Clan. With Bluestar having regained her trust over the cat that had exposed Tigerclaw's treachery, Fireheart is made deputy. The announcement of the position is made after moonhigh, which is against Clan tradition. Fireheart is unsure <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be a good deputy, but he is sure that he has not seen the last of Tigerclaw.|$|E
25|$|The rules {{may create}} social {{problems}} in some situations, {{especially for the}} widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the yibbum obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need {{to wait until the}} brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may opt out of the marriage. The widow would not know if the brother would even opt out of the marriage. Furthermore, in either event, by that stage the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, there is no time limit on the indication of the brother's intention as to <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother may already be married.|$|E
60|$|Then {{followed}} an endeavour {{on both sides}} to ascertain whether the inclination was a real earnest desire, or only fancy for the romance of mission work. The test might be <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> were <b>willing</b> to go wherever he might be sent, or only where he was most interested. Coley replied, that <b>he</b> was <b>willing</b> to work anywhere, adding that his sister Fanny could testify whether his desire were a real one of long standing or the mere outcome of a fit of enthusiasm.|$|R

500|$|In the conclusion, all {{the main}} {{characters}} are brought together before Prospero, who forgives Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian. Ariel is charged to prepare the proper sailing weather to guide the King's ship back to the Royal fleet and then to Naples, where Ferdinand and Miranda will be married. After discharging this task, Ariel will finally be free. Prospero pardons Caliban, who is sent to prepare Prospero's cell, to which Alonso and his party are invited for a final night before their departure. (It is, however, not made clear whether, after their departure, Caliban will remain on the island or <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be taken to Naples.) Prospero indicates {{that he intends to}} entertain them with the story of his life on the island. Prospero has resolved to break and bury his magic staff, and [...] "drown" [...] his book of magic, and in his epilogue, shorn of his magic powers, he invites the audience to set him free from the island with their applause.|$|E
500|$|Even so, {{the narrator}} pulls his chair {{directly}} in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He thinks for a moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. [...] The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. [...] The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a [...] "thing of evil" [...] and a [...] "prophet". Finally, he asks the raven <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical [...] "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the [...] "Plutonian shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven [...] "still is sitting" [...] on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted [...] "Nevermore".|$|E
500|$|Under {{the heading}} [...] "Transcendental Mediocrity", Jim Miller of Rolling Stone called Dark Horse a [...] "disastrous album" [...] {{to match the}} [...] "disastrous tour", and a [...] "shoddy piece of work". According to Miller, the musicians were [...] "merely {{competent}} studio pros" [...] and Harrison's guitar playing was [...] "rudimentary". In contrast with the praise that the same publication had lavished on Harrison for Living in the Material World the year before, Rolling Stones reviewer described Dark Horse as a [...] "chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver new 'LP product'", and stated: [...] "In plain point of fact, George Harrison {{has never been a}} great artist... the question becomes <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> ever again become a competent entertainer." [...] The NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Harrison's songwriting, production and vocals, particularly on two tracks dealing with his troubled personal life, [...] "Simply Shady" [...] and [...] "So Sad". Woffinden concluded: [...] "I find Dark Horse the product of a complete egoist – no one, you see, is in my tree – someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru... I'll repeat that this album is totally colourless. Just stuff and nonsense." [...] Writing in The Village Voice in January 1975, Robert Christgau bemoaned the album's [...] "transubstantiations" [...] and particularly derided the lyrics to [...] "Māya Love", [...] "in which 'window-pane' becomes 'window brain.' Can this mean that pain (pane, get it?) is the same as brain? For all this hoarse dork knows ..." ...|$|E
