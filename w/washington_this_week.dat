5000|$|According to the New York Times, the {{immediate}} Hamas claim of responsibility {{is out of}} the ordinary since in recent years Hamas has [...] "refrained" [...] from claiming responsibility for attacks. [...] However, the reduction in rocket attacks on Israel launched form Gaza had brought pressure on Hamas from Palestinian Arabs who question the group's commitment to fighting Israel. [...] According to the Wall Street Journal, the attack [...] "seemed aimed at torpedoing a new round of peace talks in <b>Washington</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> between Israel and the Palestinians." [...] Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority [...] "seized" [...] the attack as an opportunity to press an agenda; Israel demanded firm guarantees that a West Bank controlled by the Palestinian Authority would not be used a base for attacks on Israel, and the Palestinian Authority demanded that Jewish settlements be removed.|$|E
40|$|A guests—I’m {{very happy}} to be here today, even though I should really be in <b>Washington</b> <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> On Thursday, all my friends there will be {{gathered}} in the Uptown Theatre to celebrate the 25 th anniversary—I can’t believe it!—of 2001 : A Space Odyssey. Now, that movie provides a very good example of {{how difficult it is to}} predict the future. You may recall that in the film we showed the Bell System and PANAM; well, they’ve both gone, long before 2001. But I’m happy to see that the Hilton, which we also showed in 2001, is still here, though not yet in orbit! This proves how impossible it is to predict social and political developments: who could have imagined what’s happened in Europe during the last few years? However, we can, to some extent, anticipate technological developments by observing what's going on in science and engineering. But the problem there is predicting when things will happen, even though one can be quite certain that they will. A good example is provided by my 1945 paper on communications satellites, which I imagined would be large, manned space-stations. When I wrote that, World War II was still in progress, and I was working on Ground Controlled Approach Radar, which had the the...|$|E

40|$|Members of the U. S. House of Representatives {{are heading}} back to <b>Washington,</b> D. C., <b>this</b> <b>week</b> {{to vote on a}} $ 26 billion {{spending}} bill for education and Medicaid. This legislation has been debated for months and had gone through several incarnations, but last week the Senate passed the bill just before members recessed. The House, which was already recessed, is scheduled to return and vote on the measure tomorrow. The bill contains $ 10 billion for education and is focused on reducing the number of layoffs in local districts. If it passes, Illinois stands to receive an additional $ 400 million in federal education funding. We believe that if the spending measure becomes law, the Illinois General Assembly would have to come back to Springfield to pass a supplemental appropriation and these funds would likely be distributed through General State Aid. In addition to the education funds, approximately $ 16 billion is also contained in the spending bill for Medicaid, of which Illinois’ portion could be in excess of $ 500 million, which would free up pressure on other areas of state spending. This legislation must stil...|$|R
40|$|This week 2 ̆ 7 s summit aims to {{save the}} embattled {{healthcare}} overhaul {{through the power of}} persuasion, writes Lesley Russell in Inside Story HEALTHCARE REFORM is back on the agenda in <b>Washington</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> and in a big way. Since things came to an unexpected and screeching halt after the Massachusetts election, which cost the Democrats their super-majority in the Senate, the daily news on spiralling health costs has helped to drive the recognition that reform is imperative. To give one example: WellPoint’s Anthem Blue Cross in California, one of the largest health insurers in the state, announced early this month that it was about to hike health insurance premiums by as much as 39 per cent for individuals. A recent survey by the Center for American Progress shows double-digit hikes in insurance premiums implemented or pending in at least ten other states. Meanwhile, the five biggest health insurance companies in the United States have collectively reported a record profit for 2009, even as they covered fewer customers. The economic crisis is making it increasingly difficult for middle-class families to keep up their health insurance payments. Chairman Henry Waxman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee is set to hold hearings on this issue on 24 February [...] . Read the full article Photo: Talk Radio New...|$|E
