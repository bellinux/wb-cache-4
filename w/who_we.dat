5|$|Yeah, we {{were over}} the moon. We don't play ourselves, {{because most people}} won't know <b>who</b> <b>we</b> are, but they'll look like yellow {{versions}} of ourselves. We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. We just went to a studio and recorded it, but, yeah, we were really flattered.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of <b>who</b> <b>we</b> were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him <b>who</b> <b>we</b> were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

25|$|The {{real problem}} is what this movie says about us. When those Abu Ghraib {{pictures}} came out years ago, {{at least half of}} America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't <b>who</b> <b>we,</b> as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E
25|$|The reputed {{founders of}} ancient Gythium were Heracles and Apollo, who {{frequently}} appear on its coins {{or in other}} legends, and Castor and Pollux: the former of these names may point {{to the influence of}} Phoenician traders from Tyre, <b>who,</b> <b>we</b> know, visited the Laconian shores at a very early period. It is thought that Gytheio may have been the center of their purple dye trade because the Laconian Gulf had a plentiful source of murex. In classical times it was a community of Perioeci, politically dependent on Sparta, though doubtless with a municipal life of its own.|$|E
