Initial acquisition decisions influence the analysis and design of systems engineers, who face an increasingly complex and dynamic environment with significant impact on system life-cycle decisions and cost. This work utilizes a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach and the systems modeling language (SysML) to highlight the sharing of system model data with COSYSMO to provide an estimate of systems engineering costs. The document highlights the proposed methods compliance to cost estimation techniques, adherence and support to pre-Milestone A requirements of the DOD acquisitions process, and links to the Department of Defense Architectural Framework (DODAF). Application and documentation of the author's methods include a commonly used humanitarian aid effort scenario that incorporates traditional systems functional analysis of a single <b>water</b> <b>distiller.</b> The work's results demonstrate an ability for automated and semi-automated integration with COSYSMO from the system model in a web-based tool, conclude with challenges associated with external cost model integration, and suggest future areas of continued refinement and extensions.

Black Cumin (Nigella sativa L.) is annual important herbal plant in Rununculaceae Family that sense to salinity. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the Priming on seed germination of Black Cumin under saline stress. The experiment was carried out as factorial based on completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications. The experimental factors were salinity stress including: (0, 62. 2, 124. 2, 186. 2 and 248. 8 mM) and three levels of priming, seed primed with Kno 3 (0. 2 %, for the period of 72 hours), GA (500 ppm, during 48 hours) and hydro priming (<b>water</b> <b>distiller,</b> during 24 hours). A saline stress level treated by applies of NaCl, and for priming of distiller water use hydropriming technique. At the first stage, Black Cumin seed was treat and dried at 25 °C, then subjected to saline stress treatments for two week at room temperature. The results showed that priming technique had a significant effect (p≤ 0. 01) on seedling parameters. Among pretreatment, The Kno 3 had the most positive effect on germination coefficient (GC) and thus GA had the most positive effect on mean germination time (MGT). In order hand, these seeds at the minimum time had the most germination rate. Means comparing showed that the most and least rate of germination was obtained by KNO 3 and Hydro priming respectively. So under different level of saline stress, pretreatments of KNO 3 and hydro priming had useful effect on radical length, more lateral roots and higher proportion of root to plumule, and the most root and plumule fresh weight was obtain by hydro priming pretreatments. So pretreatment of 500 ppm GA reduced number of abnormal seedlings. The simple correlation coefficients showed that radical length with mean germination time (MGT) had significantly negative coefficient (R 2 =- 0. 726 **), with abnormal seedlings number had no significant coefficient and with other measured attribes had positive significant correlation. So MGT with measured parameter (except for number of abnormal seedlings and proportion of root to plumule dry weight), had significantly, negative coefficient correlation.

We evaluated whether Malaysian Tualang honey (AgroMas, Malaysia) was effective in reducing menopausal syndrome in ovariectomised female rats; an animal model for menopause. Methods The rats were divided into two control groups and three test groups. The control groups were sham-operated (SH) and ovariectomised (OVX) rats. The SH and OVX control rats were fed on 0. 5 ml of <b>distill</b> <b>water.</b> The rats in the test groups were fed with low dose 0. 2 g/kg (THL), medium dose, 1. 0 g/kg (THM) and high dose 2. 0 g/kg (THH) of Tualang honey in 0. 5 ml of <b>distill</b> <b>water.</b> The administration was given by oral gavage once daily for 2 weeks. The reproductive organs (uterus and vagina), tibia bone and aorta were taken for histopathological examination while serum for hormonal assays. Results Administration of Tualang honey for 2 weeks to ovariectomised rats significantly increased the weight of the uterus and the thickness of vaginal epithelium, restored the morphology of the tibia bones and reduced the body weight compared to rats in the ovariectomised group. The levels of estradiol and progesterone, in honey treated groups were markedly lower than that in the OVX group.

Metallic substrates behaved differently when immersed in the same lubricant for different time intervals. The four lubricants reacted differently with metallic surfaces.
