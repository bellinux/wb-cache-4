She has explained, [...] " [...] is shady, but you still love her. She's still vulnerable. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful, and when I {{was in high school}} it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't matter anyway." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of Mandel's famous characters, he {{described}} this as his favorite project: [...] "I {{had the most}} fun with it. Nobody inhibited me in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do and how I did it." ...|$|R
60|$|You cannot in {{the least}} tell what a help you are to me, in caring so much for my things and seeing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do in them. You are quite one of a {{thousand}} for sympathy with everybody, {{and one of the}} ten times ten thousand, for special sympathy with my own feelings and tries. Yes, that second column is rather nicely touched, though I say it, for hands and eyes of sixty-two; but when once the wind stops I hope to do a bit of primrosey ground that will be richer.|$|E

I was less his choice than his father's; and, though I thought {{we should have been}} very happy, {{it does not seem to}} be the leading of Heaven. I am so far his inferior in cleverness, and everything attractive, and have been made so like his elder sister, that it might not have been best for him. I want him to feel that, in beginning afresh, he is doing me no injury; and then in time, whenever I come home, it may be such a friendship as there was between our elders. That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> look forward to,--no, I don't think I look forward to anything. Good night, Aunt Melicent--I am so glad you like him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 34. In {{this and}} the two next {{following}} lectures, I shall endeavour therefore {{to show you the}} grave relations of human art, in these three functions, to human life. I can do this but roughly, as you may well suppose--since each of these subjects would require for its right treatment years instead of hours. Only, remember, I have already given years, not a few, to each of them; and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> tell you now will be only so much as is absolutely necessary to set our work on a clear foundation. You may not, at present, see the necessity for any foundation, and may think that I ought to put pencil and paper in your hands at once. On that point I must simply answer, [...] "Trust me a little while," [...] asking you however also to remember, that--irrespectively of any consideration of last or first--my true function here is not that of your master in painting, or sculpture, or pottery; but to show you what it is that makes any of these arts fine, or the contrary of fine: essentially good, or essentially base. You need not fear my not being practical enough for you; all the industry you choose to give me, I will take; but far the better part of what you may gain by such industry would be lost, if I did not first lead you to see what every form of art-industry intends, and why some of it is justly called right, and some wrong.|$|E
5000|$|Francis Poulenc {{literally}} sang her praises, considering her {{an equal}} to Paul Éluard and Max Jacob, {{found in her}} writing [...] "a sort of sensitive impertinence, libertinage, and an appetite which, carried on into song is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> express in my extreme youth with Marie Laurencin in Les Biches."

5|$|If I {{wanted to}} get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up. I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me put it that way.

5000|$|Eichinger defines {{his work}} as {{narrative}} sculpture: [...] "I am a narrative artist. The language I use is form and anatomy, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sculpt is romantic, emotional, and perhaps mythic art." [...] Eichinger's works are typically grouped into themes.|$|E
2500|$|Harvard {{economist}} and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers explains Hayek's place in modern economics: [...] "What's {{the single most}} important thing to learn from an economics course today? <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{the world}} was right," [...] she said, [...] "I could have this child and nobody would say anything. I could support it--I guess I can anyway. And when I'm not half crazy I want it. Maybe that's the reason <b>I</b> couldn't do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do just now. It's natural {{for a woman to}} want a child--especially a woman like me, who hasn't anybody or anything." ...|$|R

5000|$|Everyone's on the move. And so {{they need}} clothes that look right {{anywhere}} in the world, pack well, and are easy to care for. But most of all, today's women want clothes that make them look their best. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> give them.|$|E
50|$|Now <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{do is get}} to {{know them}} very well. I take them to dinner. I talk to them. I meet their wives. I find out what the hell the human {{material}} is that I'm dealing with, so that by the time I take an unknown he's not an unknown to me.|$|E

5000|$|... "He had {{a dreadful}} childhood, {{and as a}} result, had moments of deep melancholy," [...] Brooke recalled. [...] "But I think I made him happy. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> set out to do. I'd {{literally}} dance with the dogs, sing and play the piano, and I would make him laugh, something {{no one had ever}} done before. Because of his money, Vincent was very suspicious of people. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> cure him of." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hackford said of {{his film}} Ray: [...] "My proudest moments in Ray were in those 'chitlin' clubs. Ray Charles ended his life in concert halls, where people would go in tuxedos and quietly listen to a genius perform. But in these clubs, {{he had to get}} people up dancing. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> create was a little of that energy and exuberance. The great thing about music is when you can get people on their feet." ...|$|R

5000|$|Ellis {{has also}} noted the {{influence}} of the band's collective Christian faith: [...] "I do think that because I’m a Christian and we’re all Christians, regardless of whether we try not to make our music Christian...it just bleeds through because it’s who we are. I feel like it’s going to happen regardless of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> set out to do because God’s in me. I think it is in there, but you just have to look for it." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{found it}} M. Joseph Reinach {{particularly}} penetrating and persistent. It is an amusing but rather difficult exercise <b>to</b> recall <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> convey {{to him by}} way of a theory of Britain. He is by no means an uncritical listener. I explained that there is an [...] "inner Britain," [...] official Britain, which is Anglican or official Presbyterian, which at the outside in the whole world cannot claim to speak for twenty million Anglican or Presbyterian communicants, which monopolises official positions, administration and honours in the entire British empire, dominates the court, and, typically, is spurred and red-tabbed.

5000|$|One such {{misconception}} {{is shared}} {{in a scene}} where drummer Brendan Canty tells his bandmates how his sister's boyfriend believes that Fugazi lives in a house together without heat and subsisting on {{a steady diet of}} nothing but rice. Cohen has also said that [...] "one of the reasons why I work with Fugazi and they work with me is that we enjoy traveling through this madness.

50|$|<b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do is {{edit the}} films {{so that they}} will have a {{dramatic}} structure, that is why I object to some extent to the term observational cinema or cinéma vérité, because observational cinema to me at least connotes just hanging around with one thing being as valuable as another and that is not true. At least that is not true for me and cinema verité is just a pompous French term that has absolutely no meaning as far as I'm concerned.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Cloudy Rhodes and released on 14 June 2017. Rhodes said; [...] "I {{wanted to make a}} film where we witness the triumph of a young woman rising-up to the experience of love. I wanted Vera to be the protagonist of the film who falls from the night sky, out of the darkness into the light - her falling is a metaphorical representation of ‘falling in love’.
