Club graded {{the episode}} an A-, {{explaining}} {{he thought it}} must have been [...] "satisfying" [...] for those viewers tired of the [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] storylines. Murray also enjoyed two twists: that Olivia had to shut off the lights for real, and that Walter discovers he wrote the ZFT manual at the end. Jane Boursaw of AOL TV (previously TV Squad) opined that it was a [...] "really great episode that's probably worth another viewing to pick up more clues," [...] while the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson thought it [...] "managed to have a couple good twists to it." [...] Annalee Newitz of io9 praised [...] "Ability", remarking that [...] "overall, this was a terrific episode, and a great way to go into a show hiatus. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of payoff when we discovered why Olivia was being stalked by the ZFT weirdos, and we learned more about the Pattern than we had in a really long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Both schools {{sold their}} allotments of Music City Bowl tickets rapidly. Virginia Tech, which was {{attending}} its sixth consecutive bowl game, {{sold more than}} 9,000 tickets {{in the first week}} of sales. Alabama's tickets were primarily distributed to season-ticket holders. Of Alabama's 12,000 bowl tickets, 10,000 were reserved for season-ticket holders and only 2,000 were available for open purchase. These were sold on the first day of sales. By December 9, both Alabama and the game itself had sold their entire allotment of tickets. Virginia Tech had just 200 tickets remaining, and they were sold by the 10th. In an interview with a local newspaper, an official at the Virginia Tech ticket office indicated that demand for tickets was so great that [...] "We could have sold at least a couple thousand more. ... We were inundated for 3-4 days, and then, once Alabama was selected to play in the game, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more calls, and we were sold out." [...] Some fans were able to obtain tickets at the game via purchases from ticket scalpers.|$|E
500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They thought I was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill picking it up. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of}} the most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E

500|$|The Robot Masters {{featured}} {{in some of}} the previous Mega Man games were the result of design contests held in Japan, in which fans of the series would submit their character ideas to Capcom. Keeping with the tradition, Japan held a design contest for Mega Man 6. After the release of Mega Man 5, the magazine Nintendo Power held a similar contest in North America. Only eight out of the more than 200,000 worldwide character submissions for Mega Man 6 were accepted for the game. Six of the Robot Masters were designed by Japanese fans, while the remaining two (Knight Man and Wind Man) were designed by North American fans who entered the Nintendo Power contest. The North American cover of the game pays homage to the two designers by featuring their Robot Masters on it. [...] Inafune admitted that it was stressful when the last characters being designed for the game were not meeting with the development team's schedule. He concluded, [...] "For having hit a lot of roadblocks, I feel like <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> done for 6. The theme for our designs was 'The world is our stage,' and I really enjoyed bringing what I felt was the unique flavor of different countries into the game." [...] Yuko Takehara, credited as [...] "Yuko", composed the musical score for Mega Man 6. Takehara collaborated with several other composers for the follow-up Mega Man 7 in 1995.|$|E

Death threats against Weir and Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia. Gibson downplayed the death threats, saying, [...] "It wasn't really that bad. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of death threats to be sure, but I just assumed that when there are so many, it must mean nothing is really going to happen.

While most readers responded favorably to the comic, some took objection. Simon noted, [...] "When the first issue came out <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of... threatening letters and hate mail. Some people really opposed what Cap stood for." [...] The threats, which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices, proved so serious that police protection was posted with New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his support.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Morrison {{performed}} a series of concerts at the Dominion Theatre, London, opened by Herbie Armstrong with an acoustic set. Paul Charles, who managed Morrison's business affairs at the time, commented that [...] "The idea [...] was [...] 'come into town, do one show, get all the press down, get the radio and TV and record-company people' [...] My logic was, 'Look, with Van it's not just a rock & roll tour. It's not just here's the hits, here's the new record, please buy it, whatever.' It was a performance. ... A certain number of people would come back every night, [...] Van will not have a set-list that he adheres to religiously ... So I thought, 'Here's a way. Van is not having any singles. Van doesn't do TV. How can we get attention to him doing what he does?' Well, the best thing that he does is perform live. I think we did four [...] the first time. We ended up doing eleven [...] <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of coverage, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of attention, without him having to do something he didn't like." [...] Morrison's love of live performing was reignited by this set of concerts and he commented at the time that it was [...] "more like appearing in a play, going to the theatre and doing your job every day - which I prefer to touring because that's very fragmented and disorientating." [...] According to Johnny Rogan, these performances [...] "are still regarded by many as his most memorable since the glory days of the Caledonia Soul Orchestra. A concert on 3 to 4 April 1982 at the Grugahalle, Essen, Germany, was broadcast in many European countries as a TV/radio simulcast in the Rockpalast TV series by German TV station WDR. Seven of the songs that were performed were from Beautiful Vision.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010 Gauci formed Tune in Tokyo, an electro-pop {{and dance}} music band, with {{producer}} Paul Brandoli. As the group's lead singer, Gauci's look and sound had changed. She told the Daily Telegraph {{that she had}} changed her style after hanging out in Melbourne's gay dance clubs with musician, and her then-husband, Hamish Cowan (Cordrazine). Gauci explained, [...] "That's where I {{came out of my}} shell. I didn't have anyone telling me what to do. Tune in Tokyo is just one part of what I want to do. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of feedback straight away, which was great because it gave me confidence about the project". On 4 November 2010 they released their debut single, [...] "Dreamer", which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Clubs Chart. It was co-written by Brandoli and Gauci.

Finally I came here as an underdog, 10 points behind and had the nerves to keep calm, I did the job yesterday and today managed to win it also. I’m so happy for my team, so happy for the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to have not given up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E

In a case of successful quantum implementation of the model, expected benefits would be significant increase in speed, in miniaturization, in efficiency of performance, and in memory capacity, mainly because of additionally exploiting quantum-phase encoding.
