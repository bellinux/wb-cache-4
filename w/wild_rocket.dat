40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>rocket</b> (Diplotaxis tenuifolia) {{has become}} a very popular salad leaf due to its peppery taste. It {{is part of the}} Brassicaceae family and thus has a high level of {{homology}} at the DNA level to other Brassica species including Arabidopsis thaliana. The vernalization and photoperiodic requirements of <b>wild</b> <b>rocket</b> have not been reported to date. Photoperiodic experiments described here demonstrate that rocket is a facultative long day plant. To investigate the vernalization requirement, both seed and young plants were given vernalization treatments at 4 °C for different lengths of time. A rocket homologue of FLOWERING LOCUS C (DtFLC) was isolated and shown to functionally complement the Arabidopsis FRI+flc 3 null mutant. Whilst the expression of DtFLC was significantly reduced after just one week of cold treatment, cold treatments of two to eight weeks had no significant effect on bolting time of <b>wild</b> <b>rocket</b> indicating that rocket does not have a vernalization requirement. These findings illustrate that important fundamental differences can exist between model and crop plant species, such as in this case where down-regulation of DtFLC expression does not enable earlier flowering in <b>wild</b> <b>rocket</b> as it does in Arabidopsis and many other Brassica species...|$|E

In this work, the composition {{and the evolution of}} the phenolic compounds from different baby-leaf vegetables during refrigerated storage was studied. The phenolic compounds were extracted using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and the phenolic profile of each sample was analyzed and quantified by using LC-MS and LC-DAD methods, respectively, at the beginning {{and at the end of}} a 10 -day storage period. The baby-leaf vegetables studied included green lettuce, ruby red lettuce, swiss chard, spinach, pea shoots, watercress, garden cress, mizuna, red mustard, <b>wild</b> <b>rocket</b> and spearmint samples and a total of 203 phenolic compounds were tentatively identified and quantified. The main naturally phenolic compounds identified correspond to glycosylated flavonoids, with exception of green lettuce and spearmint leaves which had a higher content of hydroxycinnamic acids. Quantification of the main compounds showed a 10 -fold higher content of total phenolic content of ruby red lettuce (483 mgg- 1) in relation to the other samples, being the lowest values found in the garden cress (12. 8 mgg- 1) and <b>wild</b> <b>rocket</b> leaves (8. 1 mgg- 1). The total phenolic content only showed a significant change (p< 0. 05) after storage in the green lettuce (+ 17. 5 %), mizuna (+ 7. 8 %), red mustard (- 23. 7 %) and spearmint (- 13. 8 %) leaves.

40|$|Rocket is a leafy brassicaceous salad crop that {{encompasses}} two major genera (Diplotaxis and Eruca) and many different cultivars. Rocket {{is a rich}} source of antioxidants and glucosinolates, many of which are produced as secondary products by the plant in response to stress. In this paper we examined the impact of temperature and light stress on several different cultivars of <b>wild</b> and salad <b>rocket.</b> Growth habit of the plants varied in response to stress and with different genotypes, reflecting the wide geographical distribution of the plant and the different environments to which the genera have naturally adapted. Preharvest environmental stress and genotype also had an impact on how well the cultivar was able to resist postharvest senescence, indicating that breeding or selection of senescence-resistant genotypes will be possible in the future. The abundance of key phytonutrients such as carotenoids and glucosinolates are also under genetic control. As genetic resources improve for rocket it will therefore be possible to develop a molecular breeding programme specifically targeted at improving stress resistance and nutritional levels of plant secondary products.

40|$|Broccoli is a cool-season crop. It grows best between 15 ° and 17 ° C. Broccoli can {{withstand}} light frosts. It is primarily grown for its edible buds, high nutritional value and attractive appearance. Broccoli production has been decreasing in recent years. It is grown for fresh market and processing. Fresh market broccoli is of high value {{early in the}} season. Higher quality production occurs in cooler temperatures. The heads are tighter and larger. Higher temperatures cause rapid growth, loose heads and leafy clusters. Cole crops require 1 - 2 acre inches of water a week, {{depending on the size}} and developmental stage of the plant as well as the soil type. Cole crops are also sensitive to wet soil. It is important to grow these crops in well-drained soil. Broccoli grows best on light soils with good moisture-holding capacity and pH values between 6. 0 and 6. 8. Broccoli does well on soils with high organic matter. Large acreage in Oceana county is grown in sandy soils. (21) Broccoli can be grown from seeds (4 / 15 – 7 / 15) or transplanted (4 / 15 – 7 / 15) into fields. Transplants are ready in 4 to 5 weeks. Transplants generally mature earlier. Broccoli can mature in 45 to 60 days after transplanting, 60 to 75 days after direct seeding. Harvesting continues through the season.

Postharvest storage further affects the levels of both flavonoids and glucosinolates, with cyanidin increasing during shelf life and some glucosinolates, such as glucoiberverin, being reduced over the same storage period. In vitro assays using human colon cell lines demonstrate that glucosinolate-rich extracts of Eruca sativa cv. Sky, but not Diplotaxis tenufolia cv. Voyager, confer significant resistance to oxidative stress on the cells, which is indicative of the chemoprotective properties of the leaves from this species.

Downy mildew is a common disease of brassicas and closely related cruciferous crops. This thesis surveys downy mildew caused by Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. with focus on the rocket salad species. 	The susceptibility experiment was carried out to research the host specificity of plant parasitic Oomycetes Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. on rocket salad (<b>wild</b> <b>rocket,</b> Diplotaxis tenuifolia and cultivated rocket salad, Eruca sativa) and other chosen crops from the Brassicaceae family (broccoli, cauliflower, swede, oil seeds rape) at the seedlings stage. Seedlings were inoculated with different isolates (frozen plant material from 2008, diseased brassicas and closely related cruciferous crops from the fields in Norway and diseased cruciferous weeds grown close to the fields with the Brassicaceae family crops). The experiment {{has shown that the}} pathogen from a certain host plant species was more aggressive on plants of the same species. The pathogen from the host plant D. tenuifolia was significantly more aggressive on seedlings of D. tenuifolia. The pathogen from the host plant broccoli was more aggressive on broccoli seedlings, but was also capable to infect cauliflower, swede and oilseed rape. The pathogen from host plant swede was more aggressive on seedlings of swede, but disease was observed also on cauliflower and broccoli. 	The thesis also covers a survey of the survival of conidia in the air. The spores of Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. were exposed to solar radiation for different time intervals. Afterwards, the viability of these spores was evaluated. Results from the experiment indicate a certain decreasing trend in the viability of spores over the time of their exposure. 	The third experimental part surveys whether the overwintering structures of Hyaloperonospora (Peronospora) spp. in the soil can cause an infection on the seedlings of D. tenuifolia. The soil from the fields, where rocket salad was grown previous years, was sampled. An occurrence of the disease on the seedlings of D.  tenuifolia was observed.
