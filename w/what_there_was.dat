She later wrote, [...] "Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> to save, {{it occurs to me}} over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the Rhine with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well.' I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Eight Bells was {{exhibited}} in 1888, it was praised by critics who observed {{that it was}} more complex than a purely naturalistic rendering: [...] "For he has caught the color and motion of the greenish waves, white-capped and rolling, the strength of the dark clouds broken with a rift of sunlight, and the sturdy, manly character of the sailors at the rail. In short, he has seen and told in a strong painter's manner <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> of beauty and interest in the scene." [...] A later biographer wrote of the painting that the men [...] "performing their required tasks, immediately engage our confidence in their competence to deal effectively with any situation the treachery or violence of the sea may produce." ...|$|E

2500|$|Earle {{also argued}} the [...]fact {{that the new}} parkway would destroy {{property}} values through the Wheatley Hills region. Evidence was supportive to Smith that the project would, in fact, raise property values through the region. Smith also took a case with the parkway crossing through 'uninteresting farmland" [...] that would be destroyed. If the land does not exist according to Earle, Smith question <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> that would be destroyed. The final argument made was {{about the idea of}} Smith being selfish {{in the design of the}} parkway, which was rebuffed by claiming that the new parkway had help from many residents through Nassau County and that the amount of people opposing were blowing it out of proportion. Smith completed the letter that he would forward the info to the LISPC that some residents were ready to cooperate.|$|E

The moral majority sort of people picked up on the Satanic part of it. I mean, most of it was about stopping wars and that side of it, and some science fiction stuff. There wasn't that much Satanic stuff, and <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> it wasn't exactly for the devil or anything like that; it was just around at the time and we just brought it to people's attention." [...] In the documentary The Black Sabbath Story, Vol. 1, Butler expresses his frustration at how fans misinterpreted the band's lyrics, stating that [...] "for instance, on 'Hand of Doom' they'll pick up one sentence out of that and blow it up into this big thing, like as if we're telling everyone to go and shoot smack.

2500|$|The {{first film}} version of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, now lost, was {{released}} in 1928, starring Ruth Taylor (as Lorelei Lee), who took her role so seriously {{that as soon as}} the film was finished she married a millionaire named Paul Zuckerman and never worked again. From 1927 to 1929, Loos and Emerson traveled extensively, which was hard on Loos' health. All their winters were spent in Palm Beach, where Emerson would indulge in social climbing. There Loos met Wilson Mizner, a witty and charming real estate speculator and in some quarters – confidence man. Though they saw each other every day, the relationship, <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> of one, didn't last beyond Florida. Loos, starved of intellectual male companionship, was rumored to have stopped just short of having a full-blown affair. Emerson also suffered a return of his imaginary throat ailment, though he recovered quickly after his second round of Viennese [...] "pretend surgery".|$|E
2500|$|Many reviewers {{liked the}} game but couldn't {{recommend}} it due to bugs and the obvious unfinishedness of it. Many said Rust had potential. Matt Purslow, (PCGamesN) {{wrote in his}} review of Rust he was positive it will be worth the wait even if it's the end of 2015 before it's better than what {{it was at the}} beginning of 2014. His verdict was to wait. Matthew Cox (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) said it was good that the developers switched to the Unity engine in late 2014 due to the instability of the game. He found many glitches in the late 2014 version, including unresponsive animals, framerate issues and sometimes servers would randomly disconnect him. Cox said Rust had potential, and the performance issues had been regularly acknowledged in the dev blogs. Rob Zacny (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) said there was more respect and cooperation in the community, compared to <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a year ago [...] He said that after a few deaths, playing seems tedious and [...] "starts to feel like it [...] might be a punishment, rather than a goal".|$|E
2500|$|There Buechner {{realized}} {{the challenge of}} writing without the structure of school life around him. He describes the creation of his next novel, The Entrance to Porlock, as follows: [...] "...the labor of writing which was so painful that I find it hard, even now, to see beyond {{the memory of the}} pain to whatever merit it may have." [...] However, in 1968, Buechner received a letter from Charles Price, the chaplain at Harvard, inviting him to give the Noble Lectures series in the winter of 1969. His predecessors in this role were none other than Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and Buechner was both flattered and daunted by the idea of joining so august a group. When he voiced his concerns, Price replied that he should write [...] "something in the area of [...] "religion and letters."" [...] Thence came the idea to write about the everyday events of life [...] "as the alphabet through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to us. So The Alphabet of Grace was the title I hit upon, and what I set out to do was to try to describe a single representative day of my life in a way to suggest <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> of God to hear in it." [...] This process showed Buechner {{a way out of the}} frustration he had felt while writing The Entrance to Porlock: by drawing on his own experience, he found the means to convey his thoughts through his writing.|$|E
