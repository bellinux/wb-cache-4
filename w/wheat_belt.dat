40|$|The Loess Plateau in China {{is located}} in a typical summer rain region with a {{rainfall}} season. It is one of the <b>wheat</b> <b>belts,</b> and {{is located in}} semi-arid region with a large variation in precipitation. Thus, the authors analyze the year-to-year variation of precipitation and wind systems transferring the vapor into the Loess Plateau. Used data are monthly average precipitation, wind, geopotential height and vapor transport calculated by wind vector and specific humidity. The monthly average precipitation is analyzed for 14 years from 1979 to 1992 at 22 observation sites using the data provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The wind vector, geopotential height and vapor transport are analyzed based on the re-analysis data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR). The results are summarized as follows. There are some differences in rainfall system between July and August, which cause rainfall over the Loess Plateau. In high precipitation year, southeasterly wind originated from southwesterly monsoon can flow into the inland due to the poleward shift of subtropical jet stream in July. It transports a large amount of water vapor into disturbance with polar-front jet trough staying in the northeastward of the Loess Plateau. Under this convective instability, it is expected that convective clouds produce precipitation around the Loess Plateau. In August, water vapor is transported into the Loess Plateau by the convergence of low-level jet from the North Pacific subtropical high and southwesterly monsoon. On the other hand, subtropical jet stream shifts southward, flowing over the Loess Plateau and its ridge-line appears over Japan at upper troposphere in low precipitation year. Westward extending North Pacific subtropical high along the ridge-line tends to weaken the southeasterly arm of southwesterly monsoon into the Loess Plateau, while the Taiwan convergence zone is intensifies and southwesterly monsoon towards the Korean Peninsula is forced. Therefore, water vapor is transported into the Loess Plateau mainly from the East China Sea. This {{is expected to be the}} mechanistic process of low precipitation in the Loess Plateau...|$|R

40|$|Rural landscapes are {{presently}} undergoing {{a process of}} functional segregation which threatens to overcome all attempts at local decision making, inhibiting attempts at a transition to sustainability. The homogeneous <b>wheat</b> <b>belts</b> of North America and Europe, the plantations of postcolonial Africa, South East Asia and South America and the urban sprawl around our megacities are examples of this global tendency. The segregation trend {{has had a long}} history in Europe and has traditionally been balanced by the establishment of nature protection zones, designed to conserve valuable landscape resources by protecting them from exploitation. This has led to a problematic separation of our landscapes into A and B landscapes, or even landscapes and non-landscapes, where landscapes are protected areas with a high priority concerning protection and ecological management, and non-landscapes are all of the other areas of Europe, in which environmental management increasingly conforms to the principles of liberal economy. Based on a national study of privately owned largeholder manorial estates in Denmark including a detailed case study conducted in one of the survey areas, we conclude that transition to landscape sustainability is held back by two main inhibitors, which currently makes it a necessity for rural agency to act unsustainably: (1) The global liberalized legal system which supports individual private ownership to land and thus restrains large scale decision making at a spatial scale to match the ecological problems at hand; and (2) The global agri-industrial growth and competition regime, which demands a mounting one-sided focus on establishing competitive economies of scale in rural landscapes. Our results indicate that in areas where these two regimes of rural governance are repressed by other land use drivers, a transition to sustainability may become possible. This is the case in the privately owned manor landscapes, which are examples of an integrated land use strategy which has developed over centuries, made possible through stabile ownership conditions and a diversification of production activities. These landscapes integrate nature protection, agriculture, settlement and recreation in complex structures of management. They could serve as an example for future sustainable landscape planning at a larger scale, supported by regional regulation. The European Landscape Convention (ELC) supports such an alternative avenue of development, and can be considered a vision for more integrated types of landscape planning and management also outside protected areas (ELC 2000). The ELC highlights the common right to the landscape for all its inhabitants, and as such provides a singularly European approach to landscape planning which should be attempted at a larger scale on public lands in order to mitigate the democratically as well as ecologically dangerous influence of large scale agricultural capitalism...|$|R

In Australia clethodim is widely used to control the weed Lolium rigidum. However, clethodim-resistant Lolium populations have appeared over the last 5 years and now are present in many populations across the western Australian <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum) <b>belt.</b> An aspartate- 2078 -glycine (Gly) mutation in the plastidic ACCase enzyme {{has been identified as}} the only known mutation endowing clethodim resistance. Here, with 14 clethodim-resistant Lolium populations we revealed diversity and complexity in the molecular basis of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides (clethodim in particular). Several known ACCase mutations (isoleucine- 1781 -leucine [Leu], tryptophan- 2027 -cysteine [Cys], isoleucine- 2041 -asparagine, and aspartate- 2078 -Gly) and in particular, a new mutation of Cys to arginine at position 2088, were identified in plants surviving the Australian clethodim field rate (60 g ha− 1). Twelve combination patterns of mutant alleles were revealed in relation to clethodim resistance. Through a molecular, biochemical, and biological approach, we established that the mutation 2078 -Gly or 2088 -arginine endows sufficient level of resistance to clethodim at the field rate, and in addition, combinations of two mutant 1781 -Leu alleles, or two different mutant alleles (i. e. 1781 -Leu/ 2027 -Cys, 1781 -Leu/ 2041 -asparagine), also confer clethodim resistance. Plants homozygous for the mutant 1781, 2078, or 2088 alleles were found to be clethodim resistant and cross resistant to a number of other ACCase inhibitor herbicides including clodinafop, diclofop, fluazifop, haloxyfop, butroxydim, sethoxydim, tralkoxydim, and pinoxaden. We established that the specific mutation, the homo/heterozygous status of a plant for a specific mutation, and combinations of different resistant alleles plus herbicide rates all are important in contributing to the overall level of herbicide resistance in genetically diverse, cross-pollinated Lolium species...|$|R

The Bufort County Lumber Company opened in the northern section of town in the late 1890s employing 300 men and becoming one of the largest lumber companies in the south. By the late 19th century, a thriving tobacco market had been established as well. The railroads later followed to rapidly move these goods.

40|$|The {{revegetation}} of degraded {{and vulnerable}} land {{is a key}} objective of natural resource management policy in Australia. The production of woody energy crops could help to facilitate such revegetation, with examples including the cropping of mallee eucalypts in Western Australia and poplar and willow in Europe. This thesis seeks {{to add to the}} existing knowledge around woody energy crops for revegetation by exploring the applicability of these ideas to the Central West region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This includes analysis of the potential social, economic and environmental impacts of energy cropping in this region and the development of policy measures to guide the use of woody energy crops for revegetation. The results of two case studies in the NSW Central West are presented, one in the Central Tablelands and another farther west in the <b>wheat</b> and sheep <b>belt</b> around the town of Condobolin. These two regions have much in common, but also possess notable differences in land use, climate, topography, demographic trends and natural resource management priorities. The case study results suggest that different strategies are likely to be required for bioenergy-based agroforestry in each region. Woody energy crops appear closer to being competitive with typical agriculture in the Central Tablelands, where large-scale bioenergy options such as electricity generation or liquid fuel production may be viable due to the presence of existing timber industry residues. At Condobolin, energy cropping appears less competitive at present, but small-scale options involving wood pellets, briquettes or electricity may be viable for small groups of landholders with high levels of interest in mallee cropping. Recommendations are also presented on policy options {{that could be used to}} guide the development of bioenergy-based agroforestry in a sustainable manner. Policy development of this nature requires consideration of the differing issues, benchmarks and policy measures employed across the revegetation, plantation and bioenergy sectors. Key policy recommendations include measures to support landholders in the establishment of energy plantations, the tailoring of renewable energy incentive programs to promote bioenergy that contributes to revegetation goals and the use of land use planning regulations to mitigate negative land use impacts...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, and {{particularly}} {{in the northern part of}} the grain <b>belt,</b> <b>wheat</b> is grown in an extremely variable climate. The wheat crop manager in this region is faced with complex decisions on choice of planting time, varietal development pattern, and fertiliser strategy. A skilful seasonal forecast would provide an opportunity for the manager to tailor crop management decisions more appropriately to the season. Recent developments in climate research have led to the development of a number of seasonal climate forecasting systems. The objectives of this study were to determine the value of the capability in seasonal forecasting to wheat crop management, to compare the value of the existing forecast methodologies, and to consider the potential value of improved forecast quality. We examined decisions on nitrogen (N) fertiliser and cultivar maturity using simulation analyses of specific production scenarios at a representative location (Goondiwindi) using long-term daily weather data (1894 - 1989). The average profit and risk of making a loss were calculated for the possible range of fixed (i. e. the same every year) and tactical (i. e. varying depending on seasonal forecast) strategies. Significant increase in profit (up to 20 %) and/or reduction in risk (up to 35 %) were associated with tactical adjustment of crop management of N fertiliser or cultivar maturity. The forecasting system giving greatest value was the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) phase system of Stone and Auliciems (1992), which classifies seasons into 5 phases depending on the value and rate of change in the SOI. The significant skill in this system for forecasting both seasonal rainfall and frost timing generated the value found in tactical management of N fertiliser and cultivar maturity. Possible impediments to adoption of tactical management, associated with uncertainties in forecasting individual years, are discussed. The scope for improving forecast quality and the means to achieve it are considered by comparing the value of tactical management based on SOI phases with the outcome given perfect prior knowledge of the season. While the analyses presented considered only one decision at a time, used specific scenarios, and made a number of simplifying assumptions, they have demonstrated that the current skill in seasonal forecasting is sufficient to justify use in tactical management of crops. More comprehensive studies to examine sensitivities to location, antecedent conditions, and price structure, and to assumptions made in this analysis, are now warranted. We have examined decisions related only to management of wheat. It would be appropriate to pursue similar analyses in relation to management decisions for other crops, cropping sequences, and the whole farm enterprise mix...|$|R
