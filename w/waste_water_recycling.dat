40|$|The {{concept of}} green {{home is a}} part of green {{architecture}} having the objective of harmonizing the inhabitants and the environment. In the context of real estate housing areas, various housing products having natural themes, such as, green city, green garden, city with natural insights, natural city, and so on, are offered to the customers frequently. Most of those housing areas have put their concerns on customers' needs especially those that have natural themes. The problems are that, those housing areas are mainly aimed to customers with middle to high income. The question is that, how about the customers with middle to low income; don't they have the same rights to live in the housing areas with natural themes? Basically, green home concept may be implemented in the housing areas for customers with middle to low income especially those that are located in suburb areas where the availability of land area is still vast enough and inexpensive. Besides that, the structure and area of the houses are not always made in large size. Green home implementation is not always related to big-structured and spacious hoses. Basically, green home concept is an environmentally friendly house harmonized with the tropical climate of Indonesian nature. Green home concept prioritizes land area optimization, optimizing natural energy utilization efficiently, utilizing environmentally friendly building materials, efficiency in water utilization by using independent <b>wasted</b> <b>water</b> <b>recycling</b> system, good land absorption system, and also the provision of sufficient green open space and vegetation. The implementation of green home concept becomes an opportunity because it will create a convenient and cool micro climate and, at the same time, it becomes a challenge viewed from designing aspects to minimize the budget. ...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability ('green') {{stock market}} indices are {{intended}} {{to focus attention on}} environmental credentials, to reward superior performance and to help channel investments. Such indices often incorporate clean energy, <b>waste,</b> <b>water</b> and <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment, <b>recycling</b> and other 'pure play enviro' companies. This paper contends that in keeping with the philosophy of Green Economics, which advocates an expansive view of humankind's interaction with the environment, true environmental performance ('greenness') is indexed by the eco-sensitivity of mainstream businesses, by the level of stakeholder involvement and by the extent of information readily made available to society. Effective enforcement of environmental regulation requires contributions from all stakeholders concerned. With voluntary participation from businesses not readily forthcoming, and given the price-sensitivity of consumers, investors, through the incentive structures they face, could contribute to better enforcement of regulatory standards. Broad-basing the green index could be interpreted as recognising and rewarding the superior environmental performance of mainstream businesses and/or ensuring adequate representation in emerging markets, where a large number of 'pure play enviro' related instruments are unlikely to be listed. green economics; green stock markets; stock market indices; eco-sensitive business; emerging markets; environmental goodwill; sustainability; sustainable development; environmental performance. ...|$|R

Preliminary experiments are then conducted to test the concepts. Feed materials for the experiments are urine, feces, and wipes with the addition of reverse osmosis brine, the rejected portion of processed hygiene water.
