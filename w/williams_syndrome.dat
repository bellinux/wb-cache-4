50|$|<b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> is also {{marked by}} a delay in {{development}} of motor skills. Infants with Williams develop the ability to lift their heads and sit without support months later than typically developing children.

In young children, the observed motor delay is around five to six months, though some research suggests that children with <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> have a delay in development that becomes more extreme with age. Children with motor delays {{as a result of}} <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> are particularly behind in development of coordination, fine motor skills such as writing and drawing, response time, and strength and dexterity of the arms.

5000|$|<b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is caused}} by the {{deletion}} of genetic material from a portion of the long (q) arm of chromosome 7.

This region includes more than 20 genes, and researchers believe that the characteristic features of <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> are probably related to the loss of multiple genes in this region.|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Microdeletion syndromes are {{characterized}} by small (< 5 Mb) chromosomal deletions in which one or more genes are involved. These are frequently associated with multiple congenital anomalies. The phenotype {{is the result of}} haploinsufficiency of genes in the critical interval. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique is commonly used for precise genetic diagnosis of microdeletion syndromes. This study was conducted to assess the role of FISH in the diagnosis of suspected microdeletion syndrome. Methods: FISH was carried out on 301 clinically suspected microdeletion syndrome cases for the confirmation of clinical diagnosis using non-commercial probes. Of these, 177 cases were referred for 22 q 11. 2 microdeletion, 42 cases were referred for <b>William</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 38 cases were referred for Prader Willi/Angelman and 44 cases were referred for other suspected microdeletion syndromes. Results: FISH was confirmatory in 23 cases only (7. 6 %). There were 17 cases of 22 q 11. 2 microdeletion, four cases of Prader Willi syndrome and two cases of <b>William</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Interpretation & conclusion: We conclude that FISH should not be the method of choice for clinically suspected microdeletion syndromes. We propose to follow strict clinical criteria for FISH testing or preferably to follow better methods (genotype first approach). Whole genome screening may be used as first line of test and FISH may be used for confirmation of screening result, screening of family members and prenatal diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Developmental disorders of arithmetical ability are frequently seen in children of normal intelligence who have no known medical history of relevance. A recent study reports an incidence of 4 %. Three forms of the disorder have previously been identified, relevant {{to the structure of}} the underlying cognitive system. One of these involves disproportionate difficulty in the acquisition of arithmetical facts and tables. This project addresses several questions emerging from cognitive psychology, regarding fact retrieval, which can be addressed by studying those with selective difficulties. The specific aims and objectives of the study were : to determine whether fact retrieval seems to be an automated system devoid of semantic activation; to determine whether quality of fact retrieval is related to speed of counting and/or short term memory span; to determine whether there is delayed speed of access to arithmetical facts in those with number fact disorders; to determine whether spatial dyscalculia is evident among children with developmental disorders of arithmetic, including those with spatial problems in non-arithmetical systems; to conduct an exploratory investigation of the developmental arithmetical disorder seen in <b>William's</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Main Topics : The dataset contains the results from testing the normal children, the children with Turner's Syndrome, the children with number fact developmental dyscalculia and the children with <b>William's</b> <b>Syndrome</b> on a range of psychological measures.

5000|$|Among the {{hallmark}} traits {{of individuals with}} <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an apparent lack of social inhibition. Dykens and Rosner (1999) found that 100% of those with <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> were kind-spirited, 90% sought the company of others, 87% empathize with others' pain, 84% are caring, 83% are unselfish/forgiving, 75% never go unnoticed in a group, and 75% are happy when others do well. [...] Infants with <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> make normal and frequent eye contact, and young children with Williams will often approach and hug strangers. Individuals affected by <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> typically have high empathy, and are rarely observed displaying aggression. In regards to empathy, they show relative strength in reading people's eyes to gauge intentions, emotions, and mental states.

50|$|Adults and {{adolescents}} with <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> typically achieve a below-average height and weight, compared with non-affected populations. As individuals with <b>Williams</b> <b>syndrome</b> age, they frequently develop joint limitations and hypertonia, or abnormally increased muscle tone.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{literature}} review is to explore the trajectories of hippocampal-dependent memories in typical and atypical populations. Memory {{is linked to the}} development of neural circuitry within the brain. The development of synaptic connections aid in the ability to process and consolidate memories. At the system level, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory processing and hippocampus-dependent memory has a protracted development. A memory system stores "features and attributes" of concepts so that retrieval of information is efficient and able to be produced through language. This allows for features to be placed into representations, forming congruent memories, that are then able to be retrieved and later expressed. In conclusion, Hippocampal dysfunctions result in memory deficits. These deficits are specific to different memory profiles. For example, the Down syndrome population has issues with associating an object with a location; <b>William</b> <b>syndrome</b> population has issues with inhibition and recall; lastly, the Autism Spectrum Disorder population has issues with projecting themselves into an fictional scenario and complex-information processing...|$|R
