Both the central government and state governments would jointly endeavour to achieve this objective at the earliest. Consumers, particularly those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> pay a tariff which reflects efficient costs {{have the right to}} get uninterrupted twenty four hours supply of quality power. About 56% of rural households have not yet been electrified even though many of these households {{are willing to pay for}} electricity. Determined efforts should be made to ensure that the task of rural electrification for securing electricity access to all households and also ensuring that electricity reaches poor and marginal sections of the society at reasonable rates is completed within the next five years. India is using Renewable Sources of Energy like Hydel Energy, Wind Energy, and Solar Energy to electrify villages.|$|E

500|$|During {{the reign}} of the second Qajar shah, Fat′h Ali Shah Qajar, we observe the {{beginning}} of a shift in political culture from the Safavi concept of rule. The Islamic component of the ruler was de-emphasized, if not completely abounded. This shift coincides with the first archaeological surveys of Europeans in Iran and the re-introduction of the past glorious pre-Islamic history of Iran to Iranians. Fat'h Ali Shah tried to affiliate his sovereignty with the glorious years of pre-Islamic Iran. Literary evidence and documents from his time suggest that the sun in the lion and sun motif was the symbol of the king and a metaphor of Jamshid. Referring to Rostam, the mythical hero of Iran in Shahnameh, and the fact that lion was the symbol of Rostam, the lion received a nationalistic interpretation. The lion was the symbol of heroes of Iran <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> protect the country against enemies. Fat'h Ali Shah addresses the meanings of the signs in two of his poems: ...|$|E

2500|$|On 13 May 1938, {{while riding}} his {{motorcycle}} {{down the streets}} of Tokyo, a very intoxicated Sorge clashed into a wall and was badly injured. As Sorge was carrying around notes {{given to him by}} Ozaki at the time, had the police discovered the documents his cover would have been blown, but a member of his spy ring was able to get the hospital to remove the documents before the police arrived. In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan was due to over-zealous officers in the Kwantung Army and there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war with the Soviet Union. Unaware that Berzin had been shot as a [...] "Trotskyite" [...] in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938 reading: [...] "Dear Comrade! Don't worry about us. Although we are terribly tired and tense, nevertheless we are disciplined, obedient, decisive and devoted fellows <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> carry out the tasks connected with our great mission.
