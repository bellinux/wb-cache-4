25|$|Kovel follows Marx's {{theories}} about the contradiction between use values and exchange values. As he explains in The Enemy of Nature, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> selling {{in order to keep}} buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Kovel stresses that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities – such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence – are unrewarded, while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.|$|E
500|$|Approaching {{the end of}} the season, Benfica had {{a three-point}} lead over Sporting in the league table. Their next {{opponent}} was Penafiel, whom they played at their home ground. With the stadium packed with Benfica fans, Penafiel surprised Benfica and beat them 1–0, costing them first place. After the game, Trappattoni said, [...] "It was good game but I did not expect this outcome. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> morale because Saturday we have a important game. There we will decide who is stronger." ...|$|E

Macdonald was appointed chief whip, and his previous role as Shadow Justice Minister {{was given to}} Graeme Pearson. Baillie was moved from Health to Social Justice and Welfare. Boyack kept her role in Local Government and Planning. Speaking about the reshuffle, Lamont said, [...] "We have made {{a great deal of}} progress in the last 18 months but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> moving forward." ...|$|E

50|$|Ávalos {{said the}} men kept {{hope of a}} {{survival}} by pulling together to beat hunger, thirst and desperation underground. “As a group <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> faith, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> hope, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> all believe that we would survive,” he said. Franklin Lobos, a former professional footballer, {{said he and his}} fellow miners had acted like a great football team. “We pulled together when things got rough, when there was nothing, when we needed to drink water and there wasn’t any to drink. We pulled together when there was no food, when you just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> eat a teaspoon of tuna because there was nothing else. That really bonded us,” he said.|$|R
5000|$|Hubbard said <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> moving {{because there}} were so many people after him.

Daley {{was a member of the}} Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. On January 17, 2006, during Daley's fifth term, at a joint press conference with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich calling for a statewide ban on semi-automatic assault weapons, Daley said, [...] "If we are really to make the progress that we want, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the most dangerous weapons that are right here off of our streets." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryder {{reunited with}} Heathers screenwriter Daniel Waters for the surreal black comedy Sex and Death 101 (2007). The story follows the sexual odysseys of {{successful}} businessman Roderick Blank, played by Simon Baker, who receives a mysterious e-mail {{on the eve}} of his wedding, listing all of his past and future sex partners. [...] "We will be doing a sequel to Heathers next", Ryder stated. [...] "There's Heathers in the real world! <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going!" [...] In a more recent interview Ryder was quoted as saying on the speculation of a Heathers sequel: [...] "I don't know how much of the movie is official; it's a ways away. But it takes place in Washington and Christian Slater agreed to come back and make an Obi-Wan-type appearance. It's very funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|For what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{in mind is}} {{that the}} mother and the unborn child are not like two tenants in a small house, which has, by unfortunate mistake, been rented to both: the mother owns the house. The fact that she does adds to the offensiveness of deducing that the mother can do nothing from the {{supposition}} that third parties can do nothing. [...] But it does more than this: it casts a bright light on the supposition that third parties can do nothing.|$|E

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|R

I {{told her}} we'd been married two years--I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say that, you know, because of baby--only your people wouldn't hear of it, because you {{was only a}} student"--she {{pronounced}} it stoodent--"and so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it a secret, but they'd given way now {{and we were all}} going down to stay with them in the summer." ...|$|R
2500|$|Collins {{begun the}} 2010–11 season in good form and {{has stated that}} he needs to keep {{performing}} well if he is to hold his left back position."There is a lot of competition here now in every area on the pitch, so the lads who are playing at the moment, like myself, know <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> performing.

2500|$|Bachmann {{also spoke}} of the delegation's visit to Islamabad to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Aziz {{at the same time}} as the siege of Islamic fundamentalists at the Lal Masjid mosque {{elsewhere}} in the city. She reported that [...] "The group [...] had to travel in armored vehicles and was constantly accompanied by Pakistani military... We were all able to see extremely up close and personal what it's like to be in a region where fighting is occurring. We constantly felt like we were in need of security." [...] Bachmann told reporters upon her return that [...] "the dangers posed by Islamic terrorism in Iraq, Britain and Pakistan justified the continued American military presence in Iraq." [...] She said [...] "We don't want to see al-Qaida get a presence in the United States. Al-Qaida doesn't seem to show any signs of letting up. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> that in mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{criticism}} {{was described by}} Jeremy Packer as an ad hominem attack on the stereotypical biker in service of a [...] "rear-guard line of defense" [...] of Western cultural and aesthetic values, perceived to be overrun by the [...] "spiritually poor, oversexed, and insane." [...] Such criticism was rebuked by Washington Post columnist Geneva Overholser as [...] "dusty foolishness," [...] a foot-dragging reaction to progress, in which some critics were hypocritically denouncing popular works in public while, in private, secretly enjoying the greater accessibility and relevance that was bringing in huge crowds, {{to the benefit of}} both museums and the public. [...] Curator and Guggenheim director Thomas Krens defended the premise of the show saying, [...] "We can't focus on Monet and minimalism too much. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the intellectual vitality of the institution sharp, and I think the bikes do that. They vary the rhythm of the museum and pique your curiosity about what the next show might be. This show isn't meant to be a thumb of the nose at art." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{hauled in}} {{the ladder and}} dropped down till we was just above {{the reach of the}} animals, then we let down a rope with a slip-knot in it and hauled up a dead lion, a small tender one, then yanked up a cub tiger. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the {{congregation}} off with the revolver, or they would 'a' took a hand in the proceedings and helped.|$|R

500|$|Film author Patrick Webster {{considers}} Kubrick's {{methods of}} writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical auteur theory of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming.
