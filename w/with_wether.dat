40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} {{limit the}} growth, production {{and welfare of}} goats but there are few reliable sources of information for recommending management practices across flocks. The effects of animal species (Angora goat, Merino sheep, mixed-grazed goats and mixed-grazed sheep at the ratio of 1 : 1) and stocking rate (SR: 7. 5, 10, 12. 5 animals/ha) on gastrointestinal parasitism were determined in a replicated experiment on improved annual temperate pastures in southern Australia, from 1981 to 1984. Detailed monitoring of gastrointestinal nematodes was undertaken on animals before, during (five times per year) and {{at the conclusion of}} studies using faecal strongyle egg counts (WEC) and total worm counts. Sheep had a greater proportion of nematodes as Teladorsagia spp. and goats a greater incidence of Trichostrongylus spp. Both goats and sheep developed resistance to Nematodirus spp. during the experiment. WEC was similar in goats and sheep {{at the start of the}} experimental period but, thereafter, was consistently greater in goats than in sheep. While WEC was highly related to total worm count, the regressions for sheep and goats were different. Increasing the SR increased the WEC of goats and mixed-grazed goats but not of sheep. During the experiment, WEC declined at 7 and 10 animals/ha but increased at 12. 5 /ha. Mixed grazing with goats provided beneficial effects for sheep at all stocking rates, but the effects for goats were dependent on the stocking rate, being beneficial at 7. 5 and 10 /ha but harmful at 12. 5 /ha. The WEC of separately grazed goats were generally higher than the WEC of mixed grazed goats. The WEC of mixed sheep were lower than those of separately grazed sheep. During the experiment, the WEC of mixed grazed sheep declined faster than the WEC of separately grazed sheep but the WEC of separately grazed goats at 12. 5 /ha and of mixed grazed goats at 10 and 12. 5 /ha increased. Under the environmental and pastoral conditions examined, Angora wether goats should not be grazed at SR above those recommended for wether sheep. In the present study, the impact of gastrointestinal-nematode infections in goats was reduced at lower SR. Further, mixed grazing of Angora wether goats <b>with</b> <b>wether</b> sheep at or below the recommended SR resulted in reduced gastrointestinal parasitism for both sheep and goats, compared with monospecific grazing conditions. Goats did not represent a gastrointestinal-nematode hazard to sheep. © 2014 CSIRO...|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{farming in}} the UK is {{characterized}} by a crossbreeding system where ‘Longwool’ sire breeds are mated with hill dam breeds, with the crossbred (F 1) ewe lambs retained for mating to terminal sires. The F 1 wether and terminal-sire cross lambs are marketed for meat. At selection, F 1 females are typically assessed visually for type traits relevant to dam lines, and these traits could be considered as goal traits. Their offspring and their male sibs derive their value from carcass traits. This study investigated the genetic relationships between type (subjective) and carcass (objective) traits in F 1 lambs, and their potential impact on genetic improvement within this production system. Bluefaced Leicester rams were crossed with Scottish Blackface and Hardy Speckled Face ewes to produce F 1 (‘Mule’) lambs. The wether lambs (no. ¼ 2197) were selected for slaughter at a target condition (a carcass fat score of 2 / 3 L) and a number of live and carcass traits were measured. Carcass dissection data were collected on approximately one-third of these wether lambs. The ewe lambs (no. ¼ 2423) were measured for similar live traits but at a fixed age (195 ^ 5 · 5 days). In addition, they were subjectively assessed for a number of functional and type traits. Genetic parameters among these traits were then estimated. Heritabilities for the ewe traits were generally moderate (0 · 18 to 0 · 31) and genetic correlations between the traits were variable, with some moderate to high correlations (favourable in direction) of growth/carcass traits with overall type traits. Live weight at slaughter in wethers was highly correlated to live weight at constant age in ewes (r ¼ 0 · 72). In the wethers, live, cold carcass and lean weight had moderately high heritabilities (between 0 · 26 and 0 · 46), and were positively correlated with slaughter age ($ 0 · 79). However, age at slaughter in wethers was highly negatively correlated with growth/carcass and overall type traits in ewes (between 20 · 45 and 20 · 97), perhaps reflecting differences in maturity in lambs measured at a target fatness versus age. The correlations of most other type traits in ewes <b>with</b> <b>wether</b> traits were non-significant. These results show that the subjectively assessed type traits (at least as measured in this study) will not deteriorate, and some will in fact be improved, in a selection programme aiming to improve carcass merit...|$|E

40|$|The growth, wool {{production}} and teeth eruption of animals from five genotypes [Poll Dorsetgrowth (PDg) × Border Leicester × Merino (BLM); PDg × Merino (M); Poll Dorsetmuscling (PDm) × M; M × M; BL × M] were evaluated {{over the age}} span of 4 to 22 months of age. In total, 16 sires were used to generate the animals and these were selected for growth based on estimated breeding values (EBVs), apart from one group (PDm) which was selected for muscling based on EBVs. In total, 595 animals were slaughtered at 4, 8, 14 or 22 months of age. The birthweight of lambs born to BLM ewes was 0. 6 kg heavier (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) than those born to Merino ewes, and wether lambs were 0. 2 kg heavier than ewe lambs (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The yearling weight (YWT) EBV {{had no effect on}} birthweight. There were significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) differences between genotypes for predicted weaning weight at 4 months of age, with a range of 10. 6 kg among the groups. The PDg × BLM were the heaviest (37. 8 ± 0. 7 kg) and the Merino the lightest (27. 3 ± 0. 8 kg). Wether lambs were 2. 0 kg heavier (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) than ewe lambs at weaning. The YWT EBV had no effect on weaning weight. There was a significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) interaction between the age at slaughter and genotype for final liveweight of each age group. The PDg × BLM were the heaviest at each age and the Merinos the lightest, and for the oldest animals, the BLM were significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) heavier than PDm × M, whereas at younger ages this was not the case. The significant interaction (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) between sex and age at slaughter reflected the increasing difference in liveweight between the sexes as age at slaughter increased. There was also a significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) interaction between the YWT EBV and age at slaughter. The overall coefficients were – 0. 01, 0. 14, 0. 34 and 0. 65 for slaughter ages 4, 8, 14 and 22 months, respectively, indicating that in young animals there was no effect of sire YWT EBV on liveweight, but as the animals aged there was an increasing effect such that progeny of sires with high sire YWT EBV were heavier. This effect was evident within all genotypes. There was a sire breed effect on fleece weight and total wool weight (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) with Merino-sired hoggets producing 0. 4 kg more wool than Border Leicester-sired hoggets and 1. 5 kg more than Poll Dorset-sired hoggets. There was a weak genotype effect on time to erupt the first permanent incisor, which if modelled as a proportion of Border Leicester (0, 1 / 4, 1 / 2) was significant (– 34 ± 12 days, P 3 ̆c 0. 05), Border Leicester earlier than not Border Leicester.

40|$|Declining Iamb {{consumption}} {{remains a}} major problem facing the Australian prime Iamb industry. For Iamb to retain its market share and to remain a viable commodity in the future, leaner Iambs must be produced and marketed. Recent industry initiatives therefore focussed upon the production and marketing of Iambs to meet carcass specifications of 18 - 26 kg with a fat depth of 6 to 15 mm at the GR site. Emphasis was placed upon the production of lean carcasses weighing more than 22 kg, which are otherwise referred to as Elite Iambs. The development of production, management and marketing systems to produce and market Iamb carcasses of Elite Iamb specifications, both domestically and overseas, {{was the focus of}} this research program. The major objective of this experiment was to determine the potential of producing high and consistent quality meat from cryptorchid and wether Iambs meeting carcass specifications for Elite Iambs when slaughtered from six to eighteen months of age. One hundred and sixty three second cross Poll Dorset x Border Leicester/Merino cryptorchid and wether Iambs, born in May 1991 at Rutherglen Research Institute, Rutherglen, were grown and managed on annual pasture at an average liveweight of 50 kg prior to slaughter. Lambs were allocated to one of seven slaughter groups and finished every two months from 6 to 18 months of age and the influence of sex, age and nutrition on carcass composition, meat quality attributes and fat quality and consistency of cryptorchid and wether Iambs examined. Cryptorchid and wether Iambs slaughtered from 8 to 18 months of age produced carcasses meeting targeted specifications of greater than 22 kg with 6 - 15 mm of fat at the GR site. Lambs slaughtered at six months of age did not achieve the target liveweight of 50 kg at slaughter due to poor seasonal conditions which influenced the quality and availability of annual pasture in spring 1991. Cryptorchid Iambs had a lower dressing percentage and produced carcasses with a lower GR measurement than wethers at a cold carcass weight (CCW) of 23. 5 kg. Cryptorchid Iambs exhibited growth rate advantages over wethers only when nutrition and seasonal conditions did not limit Iamb growth. When compared at the same fasted liveweight, cryptorchid Iambs deposited less internal fat than wethers. Cryptorchid carcasses also had a lower proportion of subcutaneous fat present on all primals, higher proportions of soft tissue and bone in the hindquarter and the EMA of the M. longissimus thoracis was significantly larger compared <b>with</b> <b>wethers</b> at a CCW of 23. 5 kg. The proportion of CCW in the leg, chump and ribloin was not significantly influenced by Iamb sex. Nutritional management of lambs significantly influenced the proportion of subcutaneous fat on all primals. Meat quality was significantly influenced by Iamb sex however results obtained did not suggest that meat from cryptorchid Iamb carcasses was of inferior quality compared <b>with</b> <b>wethers</b> as only small differences in tenderness, intramuscular soluble collagen content, meat flavour, meat colour, intramuscular fat content and cooking loss were found. In addition, age and nutrition significantly influenced meat quality, however, consistent relationships were not found. The incidence of yellow soft subcutaneous fat was higher in cryptorchid Iamb carcasses than those from <b>wethers</b> <b>with</b> cryptorchids also producing subcutaneous fat with significantly higher levels of total unsaturated fatty acids and lower levels of stearic, palmitic and total saturated fatty acids compared <b>with</b> <b>wethers.</b> Age and nutrition also influenced the fatty acid composition of subcutaneous fat with Iambs fed lupins having significantly higher linoleic acid levels in subcutaneous fat. However, the magnitude of these differences did not explain differences found in fat quality and consistency between cryptorchid and wether carcasses slaughtered at different ages. Significant, though small, differences were found due to sex in both the triglyceride and phospholipid components of intramuscular fat. As higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in the phospholipid component of intramuscular fat compared with cryptorchids, this may affect the keeping quality of meat from wether carcasses. Finally, although significant differences due to age were found in the fatty acid composition of intramuscular fat, these differences were not consistent with age and more likely reflected differences in nutritional management between slaughter groups. This study demonstrated that cryptorchid and wether Iambs turned off at heavy market weights on an improved plane of nutrition over a 12 month period produced carcasses meeting Elite Iamb specifications and yielded high quality, tender meat.

40|$|Testosterone {{is known}} to act {{differentially}} on skeletal muscle from different regions. Two genes likely to mediate the testosterone effect are insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), an important growth regulator acting in an autocrine and paracrine way, and androgen receptor (AR), as receptor density could account for differential muscle growth. Another muscle-specific gene that {{may play a role}} in differential muscle growth is myostatin, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, shown to be a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the expression of these three genes in two different skeletal muscles in sheep. East Friesian x Dorset sired ram lambs born from Dorset ewes were used in a 2 x 4 factorial experiment. Eighteen sets of twins were assigned to four age groups corresponding to 77, 105, 133 and 161 days of age and one individual from each set was castrated at birth. Total RNA was extracted from samples of semitendinosus (ST) and splenius (SP) muscles collected at the time of slaughter. Insulin-like growth factor I mRNA was measured using competitive reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Androgen receptor and MSTN mRNA were measured by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) with standard curves. Splenius muscle weight was greater than semitendinosus muscle weight in rams compared <b>with</b> <b>wethers</b> at 105, 133 and 161 days (p = 0. 05, p = 0. 04 and p = 0. 02).

No difference was found in the MSTN mRNA level between the two muscles in rams and wethers at any age.

Lambs fed a basal concentrate diet plus sodium bicarbonate had the highest average feed intake, the highest pH and Lowest lactic acid level for the first ten days, but went off-feed after buffer removal (Trial I). The lambs receiving buffer plus rumen fluid had the highest overall average feed intake for the trial. Basal fed lambs went off-feed {{the second day of the}} trial at which time rumen and urine pH decreased and lactic acid levels increased. Lambs given rumen fluid developed diarrhea, went off-feed, had low rumen pH and total VFA values and elevated lactic acid levels in the rumen. Significant correlations occurred between rumen pH and acetic to propionic acid (P <. 05) and acetic to butyric (P <. 10) acid ratios. Also, lactic acid and feed intake were correlated (P <. 05). A negative correlation (P <. 01) between rumen pH and lactic acid levels also existed. Lambs fed buffered rations had the highest average intake, ADG, rumen pH at the second collection and final total VFA levels (Trial II). Lambs given buffer plus rumen fluid and those fed basal rations performed similarly overall, but basal fed lambs went off-feed. A negative correlation (P <. 05) was found between rumen pH and total VFA. Rumen pH and acetic to propionic acid (P <. 01) and acetic to butyric (P <. 05) acid ratios were correlated. Calcium hydroxide added to the ration reduced feed intake and ADG in Trial III. Calcium hydroxide plus rumen fluid resulted in improved gains and feed efficiency. Average pH at the second collection was increased by this treatment. The sodium bicarbonate group had the highest overall feed intake but rumen pH decreased after buffer withdrawal. Correlations between rumen pH and acetic to propionic were the same as in Trial I. Steers fed a buffered ration and given rumen fluid had lower rumen pH values, but higher feed intake and ADG than steers fed a buffered ration (Trial IV). Average pH was increased significantly (P <. 05) in both groups, by the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the ration. The lactic acid level was higher in the buffer plus rumen fluid group. Negative correlations (P <. 05) in this trial existed between rumen pH and lactic acid and rumen pH and total VFA levels. There were no significant differences in average feed intake, ADG or average feed conversion in Trial V. Although rumen pH was increased by addition of buffers to the diet both groups went off-feed when the buffers were removed. There were negative correlations (P<. 01) between rumen pH and total VFA levels and total VFA levels and lactic acid. Also, rumen pH and lactic acid were correlated (P <. 01). In Trial VI there were no significant differences in animal performance. Rumen pH in the buffer plus rumen fluid group was higher than that of the basal fed group. Average rumen pH, total VFA levels and acetic to propionic acid ratios were significantly (P <. 01) lower at the end than at the beginning of the trial for both groups. Rumen pH and acetic to butyric acid ratios were correlated (P <. 01). Rumen pH and total VFA were negatively correlated (P <. 05). The buffer fed group had a higher average intake than the basal fed group in Trial VII. One steer in the basal fed group developed acute indigestion on the second day of the trial. Rumen pH decreased and lactic acid level increased at that time.

Treatments were: (1) untreated wheat straw offered ad libitum {{on top of a}} basal diet (B) consisting of hay (0 · 25) and grass pellets (0 · 75) (UWS), (2) ammoniated wheat straw offered ad libitum plus B (AWS) and (3) ammoniated wheat straw offered at a restricted level plus B (AWS-). B was offered as a maintenance diet for both species and AWS- was only studied in steers. Voluntary intake of AWS zvas higher than that of UWS. No significant differences emerged between whole rations UWS and AWS with regard to energy digestion (ED), energy metabolizability (ρ = metabolizable energy (ME) I gross energy (GE)) and losses of digestible energy (DE) in urine and methane (average 187 J/KJ DE), but the efficiency of utilization of ME for growth (kg) was significantly higher for AWS than for UWS. ED and ρ of the straw part of the ration was significantly higher for AWS than for UWS. AWS- and AWS did not differ significantly with regard to ED, ρ and DE losses in methane and urine. Steers had a higher intake per kg 0 · 75 per day than wether sheep. Across species, digestible energy intake (DEI) of the whole ad libitum fed diets was related to live weight (M) 0 · 946 (s. e. of exponent 0 · 0152).

The study was carried out <b>with</b> 27 Polwarth <b>wethers</b> throughout five 28 -day periods, in a completely randomized experiment, which included three paddocks per treatment and three tester animals per paddock. Forage mass varied from 2878 to 6580 kg of DM/ha and was directly related to forage allowance. Leaves proportion (mean of 23 %) and leaves growth rate (mean of 25 kg of DM/ha/day) varied between experimental periods in a similar rate for all treatments. Stocking rate varied from 652 to 2428 kg of LW/ha/day and was higher for the lowest forage allowance treatment. Individual BW gain (mean of 9. 7 g/day) or gain per area (mean of 406 g/ha/day) were only affected by experimental periods. Forage intake was neither affected by treatments nor by periods (mean of 1042 g of DM/day).

40|$|Profiles of LH and FSH {{levels and}} {{pituitary}} LH responses to exogenous luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) have been characterized in rams, castrated rams (wethers), and <b>wethers</b> implanted <b>with</b> testosterone. Rams were castrated when adult, and, {{at the time}} of castration, two groups of <b>wethers</b> were implanted <b>with</b> either four or eight testosterone capsules. Rams showed random pulses of LH and testosterone which were temporally related. The number of LH and testosterone pulses per 24 hours cliffeIed. among rams, giving rise to luge differences in the mean levels of these hormones. Mean FSH levels and pituitary LH responses to LHRH also differed among rams and were positively correlated to differences in LH levels. All three nonimplanted wethers showed a rhythmic pulsatile pattem of LH secretion and had elevated mean LH and FSH levels. There were, however, appreciable differences between <b>wethers</b> <b>with</b> regard to mean LH and FSH levels and pituitary LH responses to LHRH. Both four and eight testosterone capsules were effective in suppressing pulsatile LH secretion and mean LH and FSH levels in two out of three wethers. In a third animal within each of these groups, however, LH and FSH profiles and LH responses to LHRH were characteristic of nonimplanted wethers.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{appreciated}} that well managed leafy pasture will provide sufficient energy and protein for high milk production. However, because of seasonality of pasture production there are periods in the year when the supply of pasture is deficient. Hay and silage are used to supplement pasture during these periods of shortages on New Zealand dairy farms, but are limited {{in their ability to}} maintain high levels of milk production, particularly early in lactation. Thus recourse may have to be made to the use of concentrates to maintain milk production during periods of pasture shortage. The limited amount of experimental work conducted in New Zealand on the use of concentrates (Hancock, 1953; Wallace, 1957) indicated that their use may be worthwhile. However, information on the effects of supplementing pasture with concentrates under controlled (indoor) experimental conditions is non-existent under New Zealand conditions. Results obtained by overseas workers on the effect of concentrate feeding on milk production suggest that responses have been most erratic, especially when concentrates have been fed with pasture. In general these responses were less than would have been expected on the basis of feeding standards. Reports on supplementary feeding of dairy cows by Corbett and Boyne (1958), MacLusky (1955) and Seath et. al. (1962) suggest that the concentrated fed acted as a substitute for pasture. In all of these experiments, however, the intake of pasture was measured by indirect methods. Taking the above points into consideration two experiments were conducted. The first one was a small grazing experiment with the object of studying the effects of concentrates on milk yield and composition and to obtain experience in the problems of experimentation in a simple continuous trial using 16 Friesian cows. The other experiment involved nine Jersey cows and was mainly designed to study the effect of feeding concentrates on voluntary intake of pasture. This experiment consisted of a 3 x 3 Latin square replicated three times, with squares being run concurrently. Measurements of milk yield and milk composition were also carried out. Additional information was obtained on the rate of passage of feedstuffs with some of the cows, on digestibility of feeds <b>with</b> sex <b>wethers,</b> and rumen fermentation studies with four (extra) fistulated cows...|$|R
40|$|The study {{estimated}} heritability for lamb {{growth and}} carcass performance, hogget ewe wool production, and worm egg count among crossbred progeny of maternal breed sires, {{as well as}} the genetic and phenotypic correlations among the traits. The data were from crossbred progeny of 91 sires from maternal breeds including Border Leicester, East Friesian, Finnsheep, Coopworth, White Suffolk, Corriedale, and Booroola Leicester. The sires were mated to Merino ewes at 3 sites over 3 years (and also Corriedale ewes at one site), with 3 common sires used at each site and year to provide genetic links. These sheep comprised part of the national maternal sire central progeny test program (MCPT) to evaluate the genetic variation for economically important production traits in progeny of maternal and dual-purpose (meat and wool) sires and the scope for genetic improvement. The matings resulted in 7846 first-cross lambs born, <b>with</b> 2964 <b>wether</b> lambs slaughtered at an average age of 214 days, and wool data from 2795 hogget ewes. Data were analysed using univariate mixed models containing fixed effects for site, year, sex and type of birth and rearing, dam source and sire breed, and random terms for sire and dam effects. Heritabilities and genetic correlations were estimated based on variances from progeny of 70 sires by fitting the same mixed models using a REML procedure in univariate and multivariate analyses. Estimates of heritability were low for lamb growth traits (0. 07 – 0. 29), meat colour and meat pH (0. 10 – 0. 23), and faecal worm egg count (0. 10), moderate for carcass fat and muscle traits (0. 32 – 0. 47), and moderate to high for wool traits (0. 36 – 0. 55). Estimates of direct genetic correlations among liveweights at various ages were high and positive (0. 41 – 0. 77) and those between liveweights and most carcass and meat quality traits were small and varied in sign. Liveweights were moderately to highly positively correlated with most wool traits, except fibre diameter (– 0. 28 – 0. 08). The study indicates that there is genetic variation for wool, growth, carcass, and meat quality traits, as well as for faecal worm egg count, with scope for selection within Australian maternal sire breeds of sheep...|$|R

The {{results of the current}} project - involving a programme of survey and excavation of multiple sites throughout the island - go some way towards answering some of these questions. An early monastery on Inchmarnock has long been considered likely given teh range of early carved stones that have been unearthed {{from time to time in}} and around the site ofthe medieval church. The key artefact associated with this early settlement is the large collection of inscribed slate. This is the largest assemblage fo such material from anywhere in the British Isles and it is of particular importance because of its implications for monastic schooling and design. Among the inscriptions is a unique survival, a line of verse from a hymn that formed part of the Antiphonary of Bangor, a late seventh-century liturgical commonplace book. The same stone also gives us our first evidence for the informal, non-monumental use of ogham alongside Latin.

Three growing <b>wethers,</b> <b>with</b> average body weight of 43 ± 2. 29 kg, {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three experimental diets, i. e. oaten hay without supplement (C), diet C + barley-urea (CB), and diet C + faba (CF), according to latin square design (3 x 3). Results of the experiment indicated that PD excretion for C was lower (P = 0. 07) than that of CB and CF (2. 84 vs 6. 08, 7. 67 mmol/d). Absorbed PD and estimation of MN supply for C was less (P = 0. 07) than those of CB and CF, namely 1. 26 vs 6. 64, 8. 80 mmol/d and 0. 91 vs 4. 8, 6. 30 g N/d respectively. However, the efficiency of MN synthesis was similar, whether the calculation was based on digestible organic matter fermented in the rumen, DOMR (g MN/kg DOMR, P = 0. 20) or based on N intake (g MN/g N intake, P = 0. 40).

40|$|Although {{mechanisms}} regulating nutrient partitioning {{and milk}} synthesis {{are not fully}} understood in ruminants, recent studies in lactating monogastric animals {{have shown that the}} vagus nerve modulates secretion of various hormones that are implicated in the short- and long-term control of nutrient partitioning. Therefore, the overall aim {{of this study was to}} examine the role of the vagal innervation of the GI tract on insulin and oxytocin release and milk yield in sheep. In a series of experiments described in this thesis, the effect of vagotomy was studied in ewes and wethers by comparing the responses of vagotomized animals (i. e. abomasal, pyloric, duodenal and hepatic branches sectioned) with control (sham-operated) animals. Insulin release in response to a bolus injection of glucose was studied in lactating ewes (Chapters 2 and 4) or wethers (Chapters 3 and 5). The differences in responses were not significant in the experiments described in Chapters 3 and 4. However, the release of insulin from the pancreas in response to glucose injection was significantly (P < 0. 05) suppressed in the vagotomized animals used in the experiments described in Chapters 2 and 5. Moreover in the experiments <b>with</b> <b>wethers</b> (Chapter 5), insulin secretion in response to glucose bolus injection was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher when administered 2 h (i. e. fed state) following feeding than 22 h (i. e. fasting state). In addition, postprandial insulin concentrations were significantly (P < 0. 05) lower in the vagotomized wethers than in the sham-operated wethers, but insulin secretion in the vagotomized wethers was apparently unaffected by plane of nutrition, despite significantly (P < 0. 05) higher blood glucose levels in wethers on the HP intake. The insulin concentrations were, however, higher (P < 0. 05) in the control group of wethers fed on the high plane (HP) of nutrition than those fed on the low plane (LP) of nutrition (Chapter 5). Insulin was released in response to the sight and/or ingestion of food, cephalic phase insulin release (CPIR), without any significant changes in blood glucose concentrations. However, the increase in insulin concentration was significantly (P < 0. 05) suppressed in both vagotomized wethers and ewes in comparison with control animals (Chapters 5 and 6). Suckling increased plasma insulin concentrations in the sham-operated ewes but not in the vagotomized ewes (Chapter 6), although the difference in the concentrations between the two groups was not statistically significant (P < 0. 09). Milk and fat yields were significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced for one day and two days, respectively, in the vagotomized ewes compared with those of sham-operated controls, but was restored over the next 2 - 3 days (Chapter 2). Milk yield was not different between the two treatment groups in the second study (Chapter 4). Suckling-associated plasma oxytocin concentrations were significantly (P < 0. 01) lower in the vagotomized ewes than in the sham-operated control ewes, although the difference was not statistically significant when corrected for baseline values (Chapter 4). In the next experiment (Chapter 6), oxytocin concentrations between the two treatment groups of ewes were not significantly different. However, in this experiment, suckling caused a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in oxytocin concentrations from the baseline values in the sham-operated ewes fed and suckled simultaneously but not in the vagotomized ewes fed and suckled simultaneously. Vagotomy significantly (P < 0. 05) increased digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen in wethers, although food intake was not different between the two treatment groups (Chapter 3). In conclusion, the findings in wethers (Chapter 5) agree with those in lactating ewes (Chapters 2 and 4) and, indicated that the effect of vagotomy on insulin release in response to glucose injection is more apparent over a short period (i. e. 2 - 4 h; Chapters 2 and 5) following feeding than after a longer period (i. e. 6 - 22 h; Chapters 4 and 5). This suggested that the pancreatic β-cells are more sensitive soon after feeding, because the vagal inputs reaching the β-cells from the GI tract are higher due to the recent consumption of food. The finding that post-prandial insulin concentrations in the vagotomized animals of HP group were significantly reduced, despite their significantly higher blood glucose levels, provide further evidence that the vagus nerve is a major determinant for sensitizing pancreatic β-cells. Furthermore the vagal innervation of the GI tract plays a major role in CPIR, and also appears to play an important role in insulin release during suckling in sheep. The concentrations of oxytocin measured in these experiments suggest that vagotomy interferes with oxytocin secretion although differences between vagotomized and sham operated ewes were often non significant. However, the data suggest that feeding stimulates OT secretion. It is possible that the failure to achieve consistent differences in milk ejection and hence removal in these studies may have been partly masked because of the anatomical features of the mammary gland of the ewe. Finally the activity of the vagus nerve influences the digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen in sheep...|$|R
40|$|In {{this survey}} we concern ourself <b>with</b> the question, <b>wether</b> {{there exists a}} fix-free code for a given {{sequence}} of codeword lengths. For a given alphabet, we obtain the Kraftsum of a code, if we divide for every length the number of codewords of this length in the code {{by the total number}} of all possible words of this length and then take summation over all codeword lengths which appears in the code. The same way the Kraftsum of a lengths sequence (l_ 1, [...] ., l_n) is given by ∑_i= 1 ^n q^-l_i, where q is the numbers of letters in the alphabet. Kraft and McMillan have shown in kraft (1956), that there exists a prefix-free code with codeword lengths of a certain lengths sequence, if the Kraftsum of the lengths sequence is smaller than or equal to one. Furthermore they have shown, that the converse also holds for all (uniquely decipherable) codes. [In this survey a code means a set of words, such that any message which is encoded with these words can be uniquely decoded. Therefore we omit in future the "uniquely decipherable" and write only "code". ] The question rises, if Kraft's and McMillan's result can be generalized to other types of codes? Throughout, we try to give an answer on this question for the class of fix-free codes. Since any code has Kraftsum smaller than or equal to one, this answers the question for the second implication of Kraft-McMillan's theorem. Therefore we pay attention mainly to the first implication...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} aerobic {{exposure}} of grass silages on short-term feed intake and preference by goats was studied. Eight grass silages differing in dry matter (DM) (25 % and 33 %), chop length (short and long) and compaction pressure at ensiling (0. 1 MPa and 0. 2 MPa) {{were exposed to}} air for eight days. Chemical analyses were conducted in 2 -day (d) intervals (d 0, d 2, d 4, d 6 and d 8 after silo opening) for proximate constituents, fermentation products and other volatile compounds as well as determination of microbiological status (yeasts, moulds and aerobic mesophilic bacteria). Furthermore, d 0 - to d 8 -silages were stored anaerobically in vacuum-sealed plastic bags for use in preference trials. After aerobic exposure, eight preference trials <b>with</b> Saanen-type <b>wethers</b> (n= 5) were carried out, where each possible two-way combination of silages and a standard hay (n= 15) was offered for 3 h. Data were analyzed using the SAS procedure Multidimensional Scaling, analysis of variance and correlation analysis between silage characteristics and DM intake (DMI). All silages were aerobically stable during the examination time. In trials with 33 % DM-silages, DMI decreased at d 6 or d 8 (in each of two trials) of aerobic exposure. Silage that {{had been exposed to}} air for 8 d was avoided in each case with a reduction (mean±standard deviation) of 50 ± 6. 7 % in comparison to the freshest silage. Low-DM silages showed signs of malfermentation with higher concentrations of butyric acid and ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N). Both DMI and the impact of aerobic exposure on DMI were lower. Mean decrease in DMI after 8 d of aerobic exposure was 20 % (± 11. 0 %). Products from protein and amino acid degradation (NH 3 -N, butyric acid) were negatively correlated to DMI (r=− 0. 55 and − 0. 59; P< 0. 001). It was concluded that in well-fermented silages, aerobic exposure for a length of time that is of practical relevance does {{have a negative impact on}} short-term DMI and preference by goats, even if silages are at an apparently low stage of deterioration. It is assumed that goats can detect subtle differences caused by aerobic exposure, sometimes even before an increase in temperature or changes in chemical composition occur. After a 1 -d exposure of each variant, goats were able to differ between forages and showed preference or avoidance for different silages, with a high correlation between initial and total DMI. Therefore, results showed the potential for 30 min measurements in short-term preference trials, as goats remember post-ingestive feedback from the adaptation period...|$|R
40|$|Objective This {{study was}} to examine in vivo digestibility, {{nitrogen}} balance and ruminal fermentation of tamarind (Tamarind indica) kernel powder extract residue (TKPER) compared to soybean products and by-products in wethers. Methods Four <b>wethers</b> <b>with</b> initial body weight (BW) of 51. 6 ± 5. 5 kg were assigned in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to investigate nutritional characteristics of TKPER, dry heat soybean (SB), dry soybean curd residue (SBCR) and soybean meal (SBM) feeding with ryegrass straw (R) at a ratio of 1 : 1 at 2 % of BW in dry matter (DM) on a daily basis. Results The digestibility of DM, crude protein, and ether extract (EE) of TKPER-R diet were 57. 0 %, 87. 0 %, and 86. 0 %, respectively. Higher non-fiber carbohydrates digestibility was observed in TKPER-R diet (83. 2 %) than in SB-R diet (73. 9 %, p< 0. 05). Wethers fed the TKPER-R diet had lower retention of nitrogen (N) and ruminal ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) contents at 4 h after feeding than those fed the SBM-R diet (p< 0. 05), which had values similar to the SB-R or SBCR-R diet. The TKPER feeding had higher propionate (C 3) and lower butyrate content, as well as lower acetate to propionate ratio (C 2 :C 3) in rumen fluid than SBM feeding at 4 h after feeding (p< 0. 05).
