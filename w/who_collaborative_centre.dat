40|$|Currently, noncommunicable {{diseases}} (NCD) {{are responsible}} for almost two-thirds of all deaths globally. Of the 57 million global deaths in 2008, 36 million, or 63 % were due to NCDs, principally cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases. These four groups of diseases share {{more or less the}} same risk factors (tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol). As the impact of NCDs increases and as populations age, annual NCD deaths are projected to continue to rise worldwide. Based on a series of papers commissioned by WHO, and global consultations conducted between 2008 and 2010, key research priority areas have been identified and included as part of a prioritized research agenda for noncommunicable disease. The Agenda, included in this publication, focuses on translational and health system research to expand implementation of proven cost-effective interventions and research to enable affordability of high-cost but effective technologies in the context of various resource settings. The research priorities included in this publication have been developed by an extensive network of experts from Member States, <b>WHO</b> <b>Collaborative</b> <b>Centres,</b> research and public health institutions and other partners involved in prioritizing, implementing and funding research projects. The main target audience for the WHO NCD Research Agenda comprises ministries of health, ministries of research, science and technology, development and donor agencies, research institutions, NCD research alliances, policy-makers, the research community, health professionals, nongovernmental organizations and civil society entities...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Italy {{few cases}} of rickettsioses have been {{reported}} in travellers and autochthonous cases are attributed predominantly to Rickettsia conorii, the agent of Mediterranean spotted fever. METHOD: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate some epidemiological and clinical features of tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsiosis acquired abroad or in Italy. Serum specimens collected prospectively from patients with suspected rickettsioses were tested by immunofluorescence assay. A definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of positive serological test results at the <b>WHO</b> <b>collaborative</b> <b>centre</b> for rickettsial diseases, Marseille, France. We compared the clinical features of patients with confirmed rickettsioses and those showing typical clinical symptoms/signs without definitive diagnose.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this review}} is to discuss the {{situation}} of alveolar echinococcosis in France, {{in the light of}} the current knowledge on its transmission patterns in the world, especially Europe. An important risk of higher contamination of the rural environment may be suspected from newly reported cases of infected foxes or voles in several countries where the disease was not found before. Furthermore, the increase of prevalence rate in foxes in Bade-Würtemberg (Germany) and Franche-Comté (France), traditionally endemic, is also in support of this new trend. Urban foxes and the spreading of infected foxes to cities may also be the cause of the extension to urban and suburban areas of a disease which was believed to be limited to rural areas. The setting up of an epidemiosurveillance system for fox (dog, cat) populations is currently in progress. It will be grounded on coprotests (ELISA, PCR) for the detection of E. multilocularis material in definitive hosts faeces and on sampling based on the multiscale analysis of the characteristics of landscapes favourable to transmission. A register of human cases has been established at the European level (<b>WHO</b> <b>collaborative</b> <b>centre</b> of the University of Franche-Comté and University of Ulm and Hohenheim). Unfortunately, the evolution of the parasite distribution and of the risks of exposure in France is unrecognised. Progress in surveillance and prevention could be expected if health authorities would attribute higher priority to this disease...|$|E
40|$|Steven B. McMahon, PhD (Moderator) Steven McMahon is Professor of Cancer Biology in the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. He {{also serves}} as Jefferson’s first Associate Provost for Programmatic Research. In his role as Associate Provost, Dr. McMahon {{facilitates}} collaborative research projects among Jefferson faculty, {{as well as between}} our faculty and their regional, national and international colleagues. Dr. McMahon has also held a number of leadership roles within Jefferson’s Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, including serving as Deputy Director during the most recent renewal of its National Cancer Institute designation. Dr. McMahon obtained his undergraduate degree from Albright College and his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania. He conducted fellowship training at Princeton University and accepted his first faculty position at The Wistar Institute. Dr. McMahon joined Jefferson’s Department of Cancer Biology in 2006. His research program has focused on understanding how the deregulation of transcriptional programs contributes to human cancer. Much of this work has focused on biochemical and molecular genetic analyses of the MYC oncoprotein, the p 53 tumor suppressor and the epigenetic enzymes that they utilize to reprogram the transcriptome of incipient tumor cells. Dr. McMahon’s research has been recognized by awards from the ACS, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, AACR, V Foundation, and the Falk Medical Research Trust. Dr. McMahon has served on the editorial boards of a number of journals in the fields of Cancer and Biochemistry. Similarly he has served on advisory panels making research funding recommendations for the NIH, DOD, ACS and NCI in the US and for the national cancer agencies of Canada, Italy, Belgium, Finland, France, Austria and the United Kingdom. Isidore Rigoutsos, PhD Dr. Rigoutsos is the founding Director of the Computational Medicine Center at Jefferson. He is a Professor in the Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, and has joint appointments in the Department of Cancer Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He {{is also a member of}} Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center. Prior to joining Jefferson in 2010, Dr. Rigoutsos spent 18 years at IBM 2 ̆ 7 s Thomas J. Watson Research Center, where he co-founded the Computational Biology Center in 1992. In parallel with his IBM tenure, Dr. Rigoutsos was a Visiting Faculty at MIT 2 ̆ 7 s Dept. of Chemical Engineering for a decade (2000 - 2010). He is a member of the Editorial Boards of several academic journals that focus on Genomics, Molecular Biology, and Computational Biology. He has authored or co-authored many peer-reviewed journal and conference articles in two fields (Computer Science and Biology/Medicine), and written many book chapters. He is named inventor or co-inventor on 27 US Patents. Since 2002, Dr. Rigoutsos has been studying the molecular biology of short non-coding RNAs with a particular emphasis on microRNAs (miRNAs), miRNA isoforms (isomiRs), transfer RNA (tRNA), and tRNA fragments (tRFs). His research activity focuses on discovering novel regulators and elucidating how they mediate post-transcriptional regulation. Over the years, Dr. Rigoutsos’ laboratory made several key contributions to the field. Central to Dr. Rigoutsos’ work is “transcriptomic heterogeneity” (TH), a concept that he introduced. In TH, disease is associated with differences in the RNA molecules that are produced from a given segment of DNA. This is unlike genomic heterogeneity where disease is associated with variations in the DNA template. Matthias J. Schnell, PhD Matthias Schnell studied Biology in Stuttgart-Hohenheim in Germany and completed his PhD thesis at the Federal Research Center for Virus Diseases of Animals in Tuebingen, Germany.
