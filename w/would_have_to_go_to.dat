5|$|At Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, EVA Air has {{introduced}} the EVA Air Check-in Kiosks at T2, counters 6A, allowing passengers {{to check in}} and print their boarding passes electronically, since December 2009. The kiosks are currently available at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport. Over time, EVA will install these counters in airports in China and other international EVA Air destinations. Outside of Taiwan, it is only currently available in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Osaka. Previously, if passengers were to check in for an EVA Air flight, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> an airline representative at the counters.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E

5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge his crime, and then <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, {{he would have to}} write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Tafari was {{diagnosed}} with hepatitis C. As he was poor he had no US health insurance, and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a UK citizen. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive medical treatment under the English National Health Service (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English squatting laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the middle ages, allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ squats (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) squats, such that property owners <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> court to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.|$|E
25|$|The {{new school}} had {{challenged}} the medical establishment. Jordan's {{aim was to}} reduce the burden of costs that were placed on students who otherwise <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> London {{if they wanted to}} obtain a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons or a licence from the Society of Apothecaries. As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practising outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would comply with the requirements of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured programme of study of a type unavailable outside the capital and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship.|$|E

25|$|In 1763 Steuben {{had been}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} future French Minister of War, Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain in Hamburg. They met again in Paris in 1777. The Count, fully realizing the potential of an officer with Prussian general staff training, introduced him to Benjamin Franklin. Franklin, however, was unable to offer Steuben a rank or pay in the American army. The Continental Congress had grown tired of foreign mercenaries coming to America and demanding a high rank and pay. Promoting these men over qualified American officers caused discontent in the ranks. Von Steuben <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> America strictly as a volunteer, and present himself to Congress. Steuben left these first meetings in disgust and returned to Prussia. Steuben found waiting for him allegations that he engaged in homosexual relationships with young men while {{in the service of}} Prince Josef Friedrich Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. The allegations were never proven, but Steuben knew they would stymie his chances at an officer's position in Europe. Threatened with prosecution for his alleged homosexuality, Steuben returned to Paris. Rumors followed him from Prussia to America that he was homosexual, but there never was an investigation of von Steuben and he received a Congressional pension after the war.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{race of the}} Chase for the Sprint Cup at Chicagoland, Harvick would start {{at the rear of}} the field due to unapproved body modifications, but quickly moved back up to the front within 30 laps. He would be put a lap down due to an {{untimely}} caution while Harvick was on pit road, because he did not beat the leader, Martin Truex Jr., to the start-finish line. He never got back on the lead lap for the remainder of the race, and ultimately finished 20th. Harvick's third win of the season would come at the very next week at Loudon, where he passed Matt Kenseth on a late-race restart with 7 laps to go. Next week at Dover, Harvick would have a broken trackbar and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the garage but he was already locked into the next round due to his win at New Hampshire. The next week at Charlotte, Harvick would win the pole and would lead 155 laps before having electrical problems on lap 154 at the same time Joey Logano had a tire problem and hit the wall. Coming into Kansas, Harvick sat 12th in the Chase standings, and would be in a must win situation to make the round of 8, but that was no problem for Harvick as he would dominate the race along with Matt Kenseth, until Kenseth would fade after tapping the wall. Harvick would lead 267 laps to victory, late in the race, Carl Edwards, would get the lead and lead several laps, but after a few cautions and restarts, Harvick would get back the lead and while Edwards and Kyle Busch would battle hard for 2nd place, Harvick would pull away to get his 4th win of the season, and advance into the Round of 8 in the Chase but he would officially get eliminated in the Round of 8. He would wrap up his 2016 season by winning the pole and finishing 3rd at Homestead-Miami.|$|E
500|$|On April 2, 1987, {{a meeting}} with Gray was held in DeConcini's Capitol office, with Senators Cranston, Glenn, and McCain also in attendance. The {{senators}} requested that no staff be present. DeConcini started the meeting with a mention of [...] "our friend at Lincoln". Gray told the assembled senators {{that he did not}} know the particular details of the status of Lincoln Savings and Loan, and that the senators <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the bank regulators in San Francisco that had oversight jurisdiction for the bank. Gray did offer to set up a meeting between those regulators and the senators.|$|E

[...] To his relief, the explosion of the first atomic bomb went off without such drama, in what he later described as [...] "a foul and awesome display". He turned to Oppenheimer and said, [...] "Now we are all sons of bitches." ...|$|E
500|$|Structural {{problems}} with the undercroft of the garden were discovered in the early 21st century and the garden was closed and fenced off in 2004. The memorial remained fenced off for seven years and fell into disrepair as the city council lacked the funds {{to carry out the}} necessary repairs, though access was granted to representatives of the Royal British Legion to lay wreaths during Remembrance Sunday services. The journalist Martin Bell remarked on the condition of the memorial in 2007: [...] "to find a war memorial in a state like that you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Iraq".|$|E
500|$|Robert Baer, {{a former}} CIA officer, {{said that the}} agency would be {{outsourcing}} intelligence and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Jordanians [...] "because we simply cannot, as blond haired blue eyed Americans, cannot get into these camps." [...] He said the attack would make the CIA more reluctant to engage with informants. He added that the attack {{would have been a}} huge setback for the CIA's intelligence collection in Afghanistan. [...] "You're talking about an institutional nightmare," [...] said Tim Weiner, author of the book [...] Former 9/11 Commission chairman Lee H. Hamilton predicted that the attack would forever change how the CIA handles informants. [...] "They will never forget this lesson," [...] he said.|$|E
