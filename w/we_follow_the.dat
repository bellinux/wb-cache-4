Rodriguez denied all of the allegations {{at a press conference}} the next day; [...] The New York Times quoted him as saying [...] "We know the rules, and <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> rules." [...] The University of Michigan Athletic Department's compliance office notified both the NCAA and the Big Ten Conference of its intentions to investigate itself. [...] Unlike the University of Michigan basketball scandal where all of the participants had left the school by the time the investigation completed and punishment was handed down, many of the athletes involved in this scandal are still students at the University of Michigan; failure to cooperate with the investigation might result in the NCAA revoking the athletes eligibility to participate in athletic competitions. In November, the university revealed its finding that the team failed to file the proper paperwork to document the team's training schedule.|$|E
500|$|Fodor {{has made}} many and varied criticisms of holism. He {{identifies}} the central problem {{with all the}} different notions of holism as {{the idea that the}} determining factor in semantic evaluation is the notion of an [...] "epistemic bond". Briefly, P is an epistemic bond of Q if the meaning of P is considered by someone to be relevant for the determination of the meaning of Q. Meaning holism strongly depends on this notion. The identity of the content of a mental state, under holism, can only be determined by the totality of its epistemic bonds. And this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility:If people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance, and if <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> holism of meaning and individuate intentional states by way of the totality of their epistemic bonds, the consequence will be that two people (or, for that matter, two temporal sections of the same person) will never be in the same intentional state. Therefore, two people can never be subsumed under the same intentional generalizations. And, therefore, intentional generalization can never be successful. And, therefore again, there is no hope for an intentional psychology.|$|E

2500|$|Sign {{languages}} −− (for example, Nepali Sign Language) {{should also}} generally be considered ergative in the patterning of actant incorporation in verbs. In sign languages {{which have been}} studied, classifier handshapes are incorporated into verbs, indicating the subject of intransitive verbs when incorporated, and the object of transitive verbs. (If <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Semantic Phonology" [...] model proposed by William Stokoe (1991) this ergative-absolutive patterning also works {{at the level of}} the lexicon: thus in Nepali Sign Language the sign for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a manual alphabet handshape च /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the Nepali word TEA चिया /chiya:/) being incorporated as the object.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Sherira Gaon (987 CE), in {{a letter}} written to {{the heads of the}} Jewish {{community}} in Kairuan (Tunisia), has disclosed somewhat about the authority of the Tosefta in relation to the Mishnah. There, he writes: [...] "We do not follow the opinion of R. Ḥiya, as expressed in a Baraita, if he disputes with Rebbe [...] For example, let us suppose that a certain halacha had originally been a matter of dispute between R. Meir and R. Yosi; but Rebbe [...] decided to record in the Mishnah only R. Meir's opinion [...] Had R. Ḥiya then come along, in the Tosefta, and stated that the halacha had been originally a matter of dispute - even though it has now been reported anonymously - <b>we</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> Mishnah rather than take up the episode which places the rabbis at variance. Whenever R. Meir and R. Yosi disagree, the halacha follows R. Yosi. Nevertheless, since in the Mishnah, Rebbe [...] mentioned only R. Meir's opinion, we follow R. Meir." ...|$|E
