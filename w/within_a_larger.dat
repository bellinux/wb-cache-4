5|$|In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered. After initial {{observations}} led to {{the belief}} it was larger than Earth, the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune, and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet. As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> population, it kept its status until 2006.|$|E
5|$|June 24, 2010: A tornado briefly {{touched down}} in {{downtown}} Bridgeport, embedded <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> area of strong wind damage which downed trees and damaged several buildings. 9 roofs were damaged causing {{the city to}} declare a state of emergency. The National Weather service confirmed it as an EF1 tornado, estimating it to be 100 yards wide with winds of at least 100mph. The damage was especially concentrated to {{the east end of}} Bridgeport and the Lordship section of Stratford. Both areas were declared states of emergencies for at least 24 hours after the storm hit.|$|E

Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E
5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim {{that it was in}} use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured {{in the center of the}} green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> blue disk or a small yellow disk <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.|$|E

Belton {{has been described as a}} compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. The house has also been described as the most complete example of a typical English country house; the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes. Only Brympton d'Evercy has been similarly lauded as the perfect English country house.|$|E
5|$|Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his {{comprehensive}} Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa {{in section}} Collybia, {{in addition to}} the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia: C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{intellectual}} pursuits, the gentry exhibited {{habits and}} cultured hobbies which marked their social status and refinement. The erudite term of enjoying {{the company of}} the 'nine guests' (九客, jiuke)—an extension of the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar—was a metaphor for accepted gentry pastimes of playing the Chinese zither, playing Chinese chess, Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine. The painted artwork of the gentry shifted dramatically in style from Northern to Southern Song, due to underlying political, demographic, and social circumstance. Northern Song gentry and officials, who were concerned largely with tackling issues of national interest and not much for local affairs, preferred painting huge landscape scenes where any individuals were but tiny figures immersed <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> context. During the Southern Song, political, familial, and social concerns became heavily embedded with localized interests; these changes correlate with the chief style of Southern Song paintings, where small, intimate scenes with a primary focus on individuals was emphasized.|$|E

5|$|The British High Commissioner's role became {{that of an}} {{ambassador}} following Singapore's independence from Britain and merger with Malaysia in 1963. Apart from that {{the executive branch of}} the Singapore Government remained largely unchanged, although now it governed a state <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> federation. However, with effect from 9 August 1965, Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became a fully independent republic. On separation from Malaysia, the Singapore Government retained its executive authority, and the executive authority of the Parliament of Malaysia ceased to extend to Singapore and vested in the Singapore Government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia, also ceased to be the Supreme Head of Singapore and relinquished his sovereignty, jurisdiction, power and authority, executive or otherwise in respect of Singapore, which revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore. The Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 then vested the executive authority of Singapore in the newly created post of President, and made it exercisable by him or by the Cabinet or by any Minister authorized by the Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{bay bolete}} was first named as Boletus castaneus ß badius (i.e. a {{subspecies}} of Boletus castaneus) by Elias Magnus Fries in 1818. Fries later renamed it as {{a variety of}} Boletus castaneus in 1828, before assigning it distinct species status in his 1832 work Elenchus Fungorum. The fungus has been transferred to several genera in its taxonomic history: Rostkovites by Petter Karsten in 1881; Viscipellis and Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1886 and 1888, respectively; and Suillus by Otto Kuntze in 1898. In 1931, Edouard-Jean Gilbert reclassified it in the genus Xerocomus, and many sources still list it thus. Review of Xerocomus strongly suggested it was polyphyletic, and the genus was not accepted by some mycologists. The stickiness of its wet cap distinguishes the species from others classified in Xerocomus, and hence it was left in Boletus until Alfredo Vizzini placed it in its own genus in 2014. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that Imleria badia is related to B.pallidus and B.glabellus; the three species form a clade known informally as the badius clade <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder Boletineae. Other clades within the group include the Tylopilus, porcini (= Boletus sensu stricto) and Strobilomyces clades, {{as well as two}} other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus (the taxa designated as Xerocomus species in this clade are not Xerocomus species and require new taxonomic designations) and Xerocomellus.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no obvious}} visual {{evidence}} of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl, but in 1929 aerial black-and-white images by Charles Lindbergh revealed {{what appeared to be}} a rectangular plot. In the early 1970s the National Park Service (NPS) developed a remote sensing program to further investigate the area using color video imagery. When enhanced and viewed in black-and-white, the video revealed a well-defined grid pattern <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> rectangular section of land near Chetro Ketl. The NPS employed two types of ground level remote sensing devices to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the alluvium of the canyon floor. A soil density study proved inconclusive, but a magnetometer identified a rectangular feature , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh's aerial photographs. The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron-bearing clays in the plots, with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence. Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion. They determined that had the plots been under heavy alluvium they would not have been detected.|$|E
