5|$|For {{many poor}} {{women and men}} whose <b>work</b> <b>hours</b> have {{reached the point where}} they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking.

5|$|In 2016, Boston was {{estimated}} to have 667,137 residents (a density of 13,841 persons/sq mile, or 5,344/km2) living in 272,481 housing units— an 8% population increase over 2010. The city is the third most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million residents. Some 1.2million persons may be within Boston's boundaries during <b>work</b> <b>hours,</b> {{and as many as}} 2million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.|$|E

40|$|Background: Since the {{inception}} of the eighty-hour <b>work</b> week, <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions have incited considerable debate. <b>Work</b> <b>hour</b> policies were designed to prevent medical errors and to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. It is unclear whether <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> restrictions have been helpful in medicine in general and in orthopaedic surgery specifically. This systematic review of the literature was designed to determine the success of these restrictions in terms of patient mortality, medical errors, and complications. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to determine if <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> rules have improved patient and systems-based outcomes and reduced physician errors as measured by mortality, medical errors, and complications. A random effects model was utilized to determine whether patient mortality rates were improved under the new rules. Results: The odds of patient death before implementation of the <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> rules were 1. 12 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 07 to 1. 17) times those after implementation. These differences were consistent across disciplines. The data con-cerning medical or surgical complications before and after the institution of the <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> rules were mixed. There was little information in these studies concerning direct medical errors. The odds of death in nonteaching cohorts were not significantly different from that in teaching cohorts. Conclusions: There appears to be a decrease in mortality following the institution of <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> rules. The difference seen in teaching cohorts is not significantly different from that in nonteaching cohorts. It is unclear whether this dif...|$|R

5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before <b>work</b> <b>hours</b> possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular <b>work</b> <b>hours.</b> Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.|$|E

Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of soccer (football) {{in the neighborhood}} flourished after the Southwest Houston Soccer Association {{was established in the}} 1990s. Prior to its establishment, a few adult teams existed, but no youth league. In 1995, Silvia Ramirez, a soccer coach, said in a newspaper article that a lack of confidence in English language abilities and long <b>work</b> <b>hours</b> prevented many area residents from creating soccer leagues. The same article quotes citizens who believe that playing soccer prevented them from joining gangs. In 2007, Diana De La Rose, principal of Jane Long Middle School, said that soccer was popular among Gulfton-area students. In 2010 the Houston Dynamo soccer team proposed the construction of a stadium near Gulfton. Instead the BBVA Compass Stadium began construction in East Downtown.|$|E

He later switched from the instruction of Benton Redford, a National Champion, to a team in Federal Way, WA called Pattisons Team Extreme and became a national inline speedskating champion and record holder himself. His father used Inline Speedskating to fill his spare time. Ohno's days were spent with morning swimming practices, followed by schooling, and finally skating practices in the afternoon.|$|E

5|$|The company {{feared the}} unionization attempt and hired labor spies {{to follow the}} union leaders and {{determine}} their plans. The company leadership thought the AASEREA's demands were unreasonable, and believed it to be unfair for the employees' wages to exceed the income the business provided its shareholders. The union men discovered the spies and attacked and injured them. This began a rapid rise in tensions. Less {{than half of the}} company's employees had joined the AASEREA, denying Thorpe's committee enough support from the company's employees to enforce a strike. The AASEREA instead sought assistance from other Indianapolis unions. On October 30, a letter signed by Thorpe {{and other members of the}} committee was sent to Robert L. Todd, President of the Traction and Terminal Company. In the letter he made a series of demands, including wage increases, reduced <b>work</b> <b>hours,</b> and the reinstatement of men fired for joining the union. The committee informed the company that the demands had to be met if a strike was to be averted.|$|E
50|$|It {{is largely}} felt that actual duty hours (opposed to {{reported}} duty hours) {{have not changed}} substantially: prior {{to the implementation of}} <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> regulations, residents were already working an average of 82 hours per week. Many studies rely on self-reported hours, but significant bias to under-report duty hours exists for a few important reasons: One is that statutes do not provide whistleblower protections to residents who report <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> violations. Second, the penalty for <b>work</b> <b>hour</b> violation is loss of accreditation, which would adversely affect medical residents and prevent them from becoming board certified. Finally, some residents may be pressured by their residency programs to underreport hours or even punished if they do not.|$|R
