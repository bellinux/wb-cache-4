5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{to protect the}} uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E

Hillis at one point administered an injection to try to make Stein more comfortable, with Stein saying to him [...] "that feels better Doc". Seconds later, Stein slipped into unconsciousness; despite the efforts of Stewart Hillis, he was pronounced dead approximately half an hour after the final whistle.|$|E

Later, thinking Josh is ill, Liz goes to order some soup and on her way, sees Josh. He meets with a producer from The Daily Show, which angers Liz, who decides to help Jack negotiate. When Josh and his agent return to negotiate, believing that an offer from the Daily Show <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> Jack promptly reveals {{that he was able}} to get the offer from the Daily Show pulled and thus leave Josh with no negotiating power. Jack then offers Josh the same terms as his previous contract, but Liz, upset that Josh was not made to suffer for his [...] "betrayal" [...] by speaking with another show, orders Josh to start doing the worm.|$|E

As each chief signed, Hobson said [...] "He iwi tahi tātou", meaning [...] "We are [...] one people". Two chiefs, Marupō and Ruhe, protested {{strongly}} against the treaty as the signing took place but they eventually signed and after Marupō shook the Governor's hand, seized hold of his hat which <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and gestured to put it on.|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{offers from}} A.S. Roma and A.C.

This caused a commotion in Udine as enraged Friulians flocked {{to the streets in}} protest against the Italian federation and the federal government. Historical reasons would make them shout [...] "O Zico, o Austria!" [...] ("Either Zico or Austria"). At the end of the controversy, the deal went through and though leaving Flamengo fans in sadness, Zico made the Friulians fans finally dream of better days.|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, {{while the}} [...] "Issue of Mosul" [...] <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> Sheikh Said began to {{organize}} the Sheikh Said Rebellion. Sheikh Said was a wealthy Kurdish tribal chief of a local Naqshbandi order. He emphasized the issue of religion; he not only opposed {{the abolition of the}} Caliphate, but also the adoption of civil codes based on Western models, the closure of religious orders, the ban on polygamy, and the new obligatory civil marriage. Sheikh stirred up his followers against the policies of the government, which he considered anti-Islamic. In an effort to restore Islamic law, Sheik's forces moved through the countryside, seized government offices and marched on the important cities of Elazığ and Diyarbakır. Members of the government saw the Sheikh Said Rebellion as an attempt at a counter-revolution. They urged immediate military action to prevent its spread. The [...] "Law for the Maintenance of Public Order" [...] was passed to deal with the rebellion on 4 March 1925. It gave the government exceptional powers and included the authority to shut down subversive groups, but was repealed on 4 March 1929.|$|E

2500|$|At 8:05pm EDT, {{the letter}} drafted {{earlier in the}} day was delivered. The message read, [...] "As I read your letter, the key {{elements}} of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) You would agree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba." [...] The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be [...] "delayed." [...] With the letter delivered, a deal <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> However, as Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to [...] "have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there." ...|$|E
