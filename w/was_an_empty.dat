5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} home {{to at least one}} al-Qaeda leader before bin Laden. Operational chief Abu Faraj al-Libi {{reportedly}} moved his family to Abbottabad in mid-2003. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him. However, this account was exposed as an outright lie by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> field. A courier told interrogators that al-Libi used three houses in Abbottabad. Pakistani officials say they informed their American counterparts {{at the time that the}} city could be a hiding place for al-Qaeda leaders. In 2009 officials began providing the U.S. with intelligence about bin Laden's compound without knowing who lived there.|$|E

500|$|As it happened, al-Muttaqi {{was persuaded}} by the emissaries of Tuzun, who protested his loyalty, {{to return to}} Iraq, only to be seized, blinded and deposed on 12 October and {{replaced}} by al-Mustakfi. Al-Mustakfi reconfirmed al-Ikhshid's governorship, but by this point it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> gesture. According to J. L. Bacharach, although the 13th-century historian Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi reports that al-Ikhshid immediately took the bay'a and read the Friday prayer in the new caliph's name, based on the available numismatic evidence, {{he appears to have}} delayed recognition of both al-Mustakfi and his Buyid-installed successor al-Muti (r. 946–974) for several months by refraining from including them in his coinage, in an act that was a deliberate and clear statement of his de facto independence from Baghdad.

500|$|Pinhole camera: The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{observed}} that the spaces between the leaves of trees acted as tiny pinholes which cast {{the image of a}} partial solar eclipse onto the ground. He also used a metal plate with a small pinhole to project an image of a solar eclipse onto the ground. The ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (c. 470 BC– c. 391 BC)—founder of Mohism during the establishment of the Hundred Schools of Thought—lived just before the time of Aristotle and it was in his Mojing (perhaps compiled by his disciples) that a pinhole camera was described. The Mojing stated that the [...] "collecting place" [...] (pinhole) <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> hole [...] "like the sun and moon depicted on the imperial flags," [...] where an image could be inverted at an intersecting point which [...] "affects the size of the image." [...] The Mojing seems to be in line with the Epicurean theory of light traveling into the eye (and not vice versa like in Pythagoreanism), since the Mojing states that the reflected light shining forth from an [...] "illuminated person" [...] becomes inverted when passing through the pinhole, i.e. [...] "The bottom part of the man becomes the top part (of the image) and the top part of the man becomes the bottom part (of the image)." [...] In his Book of Optics (1021), Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) wrote of his experimentation with camera obscura, which was followed by Shen Kuo (1031–1095), the latter who alluded that the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Duan Chengshi (died 863)—in his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang—described inverted images of Chinese pagodas.|$|E
