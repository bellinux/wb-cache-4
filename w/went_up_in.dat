The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.|$|E
5|$|Several Indian trails {{spanned the}} state along the general {{path of the}} modern freeway. After statehood, several of these were {{converted}} into plank roads that later became {{some of the first}} state highways. In the 1920s, five of these were added to the United States Numbered Highway System: US Highway2 (US2), US10, US24, US25, and US27. In the 1950s, a Michigan Turnpike was proposed as a tolled, controlled-access highway in the Lower Peninsula. After passage of the Federal Highway Act of 1956, this turnpike proposal was shelved as a free Interstate Highway was planned. Construction started in 1957, signs <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1959, and I-75 was completed in 1973. Since completion, the freeway has been upgraded with the construction of the Zilwaukee Bridge near Saginaw and improved connections to the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|While {{the human}} and {{property}} losses were staggering, the cultural loss is still felt today. The University of Copenhagen library was without a doubt the greatest and the most frequently mentioned of such. 35,000texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in the flames. Original works from the historians Hans Svaning, Anders Sørensen Vedel, Niels Krag, and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists Ole Worm, Ole Rømer, Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost. Atlas Danicus by Peder Hansen Resen and the archive of Zealand Diocese <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames as well. The archive of the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day the fire started.|$|E

5|$|As {{foreseen}} by Secretary Laird, {{fallout from}} the incursion was quick in coming on the campuses of America's universities, as protests erupted against {{what was perceived as}} an expansion of the conflict into yet another country. On 4 May the unrest escalated to violence when Ohio National Guardsmen shot and killed four unarmed students (two of whom were not protesters) during the Kent State shootings. Two days later, at the University at Buffalo, police wounded four more demonstrators. On 15 May city and state police killed two and wounded twelve at Jackson State College (now Jackson State University) in Jackson, Mississippi. Earlier, on 8 May 100,000 protesters had gathered in Washington and another 150,000 in San Francisco on only ten days notice. Nationwide, 30 ROTC buildings <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames or were bombed while 26 schools witnessed violent clashes between students and police. National Guard units were mobilized on 21 campuses in 16 states. The student strike spread nationwide, involving more than four million students and 450 universities, colleges and high schools in mostly peaceful protests and walkouts.|$|E
5|$|Bernese troops {{under the}} command of Sigmund von Erlach then {{advanced}} from Bern to the Aargau to meet the forces of Zürich. Under this double pressure, the peasants' resistance collapsed. Von Erlach's troops numbered about 6,000 men and 19 cannons. The operation was a veritable punitive expedition: the troops plundered the villages along their way and even razed the defenses of the small town of Wiedlisbach, which lost its town privileges and was declared a village again. On June 7, 1653, the Bernese army met with a troop of about 2,000 men of Leuenberger's army who were on their way back from Wohlenschwil. The peasants retreated to Herzogenbuchsee, where they were defeated by von Erlach's troops; the little town <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames {{in the course of the}} battle. Niklaus Leuenberger fled and went hiding, but he was betrayed by a neighbour and was apprehended by the Bernese district sheriff Samuel Tribolet on June 9, 1653.|$|E

25|$|Porter {{could not}} get many of his ironclads over the falls at Alexandria. Colonel Joseph Bailey {{designed}} Bailey's Dam, to which Banks soon gave night-and-day attention. Several boats got through before a partial dam collapse. An extra upriver dam provided additional water depth, allowing the march to resume. When the Federals left Alexandria, the town <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames, the origins of which are disputed. Because the Confederates had already burned most of the cotton, many speculators at Alexandria were disappointed.|$|E

The destruction was enormous; dozens of farms <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames, with damage later estimated at ten million guilders (US$3.77 million). The bloodshed lasted beyond the German capitulation in the Netherlands and Denmark on 5 May 1945 and even beyond Germany's general surrender on 8 May 1945.

The first of the huge black fifteen-story oil platforms, a feature of the seascape south of Santa Barbara for fifty years, <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1958.

The third ball was too quick: it screamed past Bradman's bat and thudded into the gloves of Leonard Waterman. The fourth was as fast, and hit Bradman on his underbelly. The impact knocked his bat off, leaving him in agony. It took him time, but {{he got back to}} his feet. Then came the bouncer, a really quick one.

25|$|In {{the first}} decade of the new century many more large {{institutional}} buildings went up. The city built Public Bath No. 2 and Engine House No. 5 on Fourth between South Pearl and Franklin in the 1904–05 period. Across the street, St. Ann's matched it with a large convent in 1908. All these buildings showed at least the influence of the newer Colonial Revival style. Sometime during this period, the Arts and Crafts-style apartment building at 82–84 Morton <b>went</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> 1929, the district came full circle when its youngest contributing property, the John B. Howe Branch Library, was built in an unrestrained embrace of that style at the northeast corner of Clinton and Schuyler, its design meant to complement the Schuyler Mansion across the street.|$|E
