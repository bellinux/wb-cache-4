25|$|For {{a dog to}} be {{considered}} for a Police Department, they must first pass a basic obedience training course. They must be able to obey the commands of their handler without hesitation. This allows the officer to have complete control over how much force the dog should use against a suspect. Dogs trained in Europe are usually given commands in the country's native language. Dogs are initially trained <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>language</b> for basic behavior, so, it is easier for the officer to learn new words/commands, rather than retraining the dog to new commands. This is contrary to the popular belief that Police Dogs are trained in a different language so that a suspect cannot command the dog against the officer.|$|E
500|$|A {{major issue}} during Dixon's tenure in the Senate was the {{admission}} of the Nebraska Territory to the Union. Specifically, the question hinged upon {{the issue of whether}} or not slavery would be allowed in the state. Under the Missouri Compromise, slavery was prohibited in the territory. Because of this, the southern states opposed its admission. In an attempt to allay southern fears, Stephen Douglas introduced a bill in January 1854 that included a provision that [...] "all questions pertaining to slavery in the territories, and in the new states to be formed therefrom are to be left to the people residing therein, through their appropriate representatives." [...] Douglas hoped to placate southerners <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>language,</b> which allowed for the possibility of legalized slavery in the potential state without specifically addressing the issue of the Missouri Compromise.|$|E
2500|$|Orthodox Jewish prayers include, {{in every}} prayer service {{and at the}} times when {{corresponding}} sacrifices would have been offered in the Temple, a prayer for its reconstruction and resumption of sacrifices. The morning prayer service also includes a study session of the daily Temple ritual and offerings as a reminder, including detailed study of the animal sacrifices and incense offerings. The service also contains the daily and special-occasion psalms the Levites used to sing in the Temple. Following the weekday Torah reading there is a prayer to [...] "restore the House {{of our lives and}} to cause the Shekhinah (Divine Presence) to dwell among us", and the Amidah contains prayers for acceptance of [...] "the fire-offerings of Israel" [...] and ends with a meditation for the restoration of the Temple, [...] "And may the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing, as in former days and ancient times" [...] (Malachi 3:4). In addition, the theological and poetic language of Hebrew is filled with words with dual connotations, which are both literal references to elements of Temple architecture or ritual, and also have metaphorical theological and poetic meanings regarding the relationship between the worshipper and God. Translations and commentary on prayers <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>language</b> tend to discuss both meanings in Orthodox Judaism. (Examples of dual-meaning words: deshen refers to both the ashes left after a burnt-offering, and also means [...] "acceptance with favor"; kodesh refers to [...] "the Holy", i.e. the Sanctuary portion of the Temple, and also means [...] "holy" [...] generally; and chatzrot refers to the courtyards of the Temple, and also connotes nearness to God; [...] "korban" [...] means both [...] "sacrifice" [...] and [...] "drawing near".) ...|$|E
