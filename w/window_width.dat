40|$|Abstract Generally, trend {{detection}} algorithms {{over the}} data stream require expert assistance in some form. We present an unsupervised multiscale data stream algorithm which detects trends for evolving time series {{based on a}} data driver data stream. The raw stream data clustering algorithm is incremental, space dilating and has linear time complexity. The evolving stream is incrementally explored {{on a number of}} windows. Whenever a change occurs, we switch the analysis on this driver data stream in order to detect the new aggregated patterns and the new best selection of <b>window</b> <b>widths</b> among an exponential base set. The <b>window</b> <b>widths</b> are detected using a slightly modified version of an incremental SVD procedure. We apply this clustering algorithm to a free public NYSE stock exchange financial data feed, investigating incrementally the developing trends during the current crisis data from 2007 to 2009.

The idea of local linear regression is to fit locally a straight line (or a hyperplane for higher dimensions), and not the constant (horizontal line). After fitting the line, the estimation [...] is provided by the value of this line at X0 point. By repeating this procedure for each X0, one can get the estimation function [...]Like in previous section, the <b>window</b> <b>width</b> is constant Formally, the local linear regression is computed by solving a weighted least square problem.|$|E
5000|$|Creating a {{spectrogram}} {{using the}} FFT is a digital process. Digitally sampled data, {{in the time}} domain, is broken up into chunks, which usually overlap, and Fourier transformed to calculate {{the magnitude of the}} frequency spectrum for each chunk. Each chunk then corresponds to a vertical line in the image; a measurement of magnitude versus frequency for a specific moment in time (the midpoint of the chunk). These spectrums or time plots are then [...] "laid side by side" [...] to form the image or a three-dimensional surface, or slightly overlapped in various ways, i.e. windowing. This process essentially corresponds to computing the squared magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of the signal [...] — that is, for a <b>window</b> <b>width</b> , [...]|$|E
30|$|First, {{the energy}} window setting around 84  keV was evaluated. We focused on image noise and {{contrast}} in image quality of Ra- 223 SPECT {{because of the}} limited injected dose. As studied in Sr- 89 imaging [17], we evaluated the impact of characteristic X-rays of lead (75  keV (Kα) and 85  keV (Kβ) [18]) on image quality of Ra- 223 SPECT by comparing the energy <b>window</b> <b>widths</b> between ±[*] 20 % and ±[*] 10 %.

5000|$|The {{gap-filling}} {{version of}} SSA {{can be used}} to analyze data sets that are unevenly sampled or contain missing data (Kondrashov and Ghil, 2006; Kondrashov et al. 2010). For a univariate time series, the SSA gap filling procedure utilizes temporal correlations to fill in the missing points. For a multivariate data set, gap filling by M-SSA takes advantage of both spatial and temporal correlations. In either case: (i) estimates of missing data points are produced iteratively, and are then used to compute a self-consistent lag-covariance matrix [...] and its EOFs and (ii) cross-validation is used to optimize the <b>window</b> <b>width</b> [...] and the number of leading SSA modes to fill the gaps with the iteratively estimated [...] "signal," [...] while the noise is discarded.|$|E
50|$|We {{can compare}} the S {{transform}} and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). First, a high frequency signal, a low frequency signal, {{and a high}} frequency burst signal {{are used in the}} experiment to compare the performance. The S transform characteristic of frequency dependent resolution allows the detection of the high frequency burst. On the other hand, as the STFT consists of a constant <b>window</b> <b>width,</b> it leads to the result having poorer definition. In the second experiment, two more high frequency bursts are added to crossed chirps. In the result, all four frequencies were detected by the S transform. On the other hand, the two high frequencies bursts are not detected by STFT. The high frequencies bursts cross term caused STFT to have a single frequency at lower frequency.|$|E
50|$|When {{a single}} column of 24 pixels is scanned across {{a line of}} text, all of the {{information}} is acquired. However, with the sense of touch, people are capable of perceiving two dimensional images. Bliss wondered if the reading rate would be higher if more than one column of 24 pixels were used, and if so, how many columns would be appropriate? Experiments with the computer simulation determined that reading rate increased dramatically up to 6 columns, which was a <b>window</b> <b>width</b> of about one letter space and this was about the maximum number of columns that could be placed on one finger. Jon Taenzer, one of Bliss’ Stanford graduate students, ran visual reading experiments on the same computer simulation and determined that for visual reading, reading rates continued to increase up to a <b>window</b> <b>width</b> of up to about 6 letter spaces. This led to a number of experiments toward trying to increase the tactile reading rate by increasing the number of columns in the tactile screen so more than one letter would be in view at a time. Instead of moving the text across only the index fingertip, tests were run with a screen wide enough for both the index finger and the middle finger to be used so two letters could be simultaneously tactually sensed. In another experiment the moving belt of text was run {{down the length of the}} fingers, rather than across them. The only approach that showed any promise of increasing the reading rate was when both index fingers were used, rather than the index finger and the adjacent middle finger. However, the use of both index fingers was incompatible with the design concept of using one hand to control the camera while the other hand sensed the tactile screen. The Optacon design was therefore based on an array of 24-by-6 pixels in both the camera retina and bimorph array.|$|E

40|$|Perceived {{synchrony}} {{of visual}} and auditory signals {{can be altered}} by exposure to a stream of temporally offset stimulus pairs. Previous literature suggests that adapting to audiovisual temporal offsets is an important recalibration to correctly combine audiovisual stimuli into a single percept {{across a range of}} source distances. Healthy ageing results in synchrony perception over a wider range of temporally offset visual and auditory signals, independent of age-related unisensory declines in vision and hearing sensitivities. However the impact of ageing on audiovisual recalibration is unkonwn. Audiovisual synchrony perception for sound-lead and sound-lag stimuli was measured for fifteen younger (22 - 32 years old) and fifteen older (64 - 74 years old) healthy adults using a method-of-constant-stimuli, after adapting to a stream of visual and auditory pairs. The adaptation pairs were either synchronous or asynchronous (sound-lag of 230 ms). The adaptation effect for each observer was computed as the shift in the mean of the individually fitted psychometric functions after adapting to asynchrony. Post adaptation to synchrony, the younger and older observers had average <b>window</b> <b>widths</b> (±standard deviation) of 326 (± 80) and 448 (± 105) ms, respectively. There was no adaptation effect for sound-lead pairs. Both the younger and older observers however perceived more sound-lag pairs as synchronous. The magnitude of the adaptation effect in the older observers was not correlated with how often they saw the adapting sound-lag stimuli as asynchronous nor their synchrony <b>window</b> <b>widths.</b> Our finding demonstrates that audiovisual synchrony perception adapts less with advancing age...|$|R
50|$|The first {{modification}} to the FRFT {{to allow}} analysis of aforementioned non-stationary signals came as the short-time FRFT (STFRFT). The {{idea behind the}} STFRFT was segmenting the signal by using a time-localized window, and performing FRFT spectral analysis for each segment.Since the FRFT was computed for every windowed segment of the signal, the STFRFT was able to provide a true joint signal representation in both time and FRFT domains.However, the drawback is that the STFRFT has the limitation of a fixed <b>window</b> <b>width</b> which needs to be fixed a priori; this effectively means {{that it does not}} provide the requisite good resolution in both time and FRFT domains. In other words, the efficiency of the STFRFT techniques is limited by the fundamental uncertainty principle, which implies that narrow windows produce good time resolution but poor spectral resolution, whereas wide windows provide good spectral resolution but poor time resolution. Most of the signals of practical interest are such that they have high spectral components for short durations and low spectral components for long durations.|$|E
30|$|According to Fig. 9, {{increase}} the <b>window</b> <b>width</b> increases the testing accuracy. When the <b>window</b> <b>width</b> is short, e.g. 10  ms, classification accuracy is relative low due to inadequate learning. Meanwhile, {{when the time}} <b>window</b> <b>width</b> reaches a certain value, the accuracy stays high and becomes stable. Thus, in this case, 40  ms is determined as the optimal time <b>window</b> <b>width,</b> which guarantees the high accuracy with acceptable learning time.|$|E
