25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people <b>who</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; <b>who</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

The European Union and the United Nations claim to be stopping these types of human rights violations, save for a few violations committed by some western governments (e.g. the CIA's extraordinary rendition programme). The PRC holds the opinion, though, that many alleged negatives about democratic society are a direct result of an excess of individual freedom, saying that too much freedom is dangerous.|$|E

Its title derives from Justice Holmes' admonition, in his dissenting opinion in United States v.

Holmes wrote that [...] "if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those <b>who</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> us but freedom for the thought that we hate." ...|$|E
500|$|J. R. R. Tolkien's essay [...] "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics", {{initially}} delivered as {{a lecture}} in 1936, {{is regarded as}} a formative work in modern Beowulf studies. In it, Tolkien speaks against critics who play down the monsters in the poem, namely Grendel, Grendel's mother, and the dragon, in favour of using Beowulf solely as a source for Anglo-Saxon history. Tolkien argues that rather than being merely extraneous, these elements are key to the narrative and should be the focus of study. In doing so he drew attention to the previously neglected literary qualities of the poem and argued that it should be studied as a work of art, not just as a historical document. Later critics such as Hugh Magennis <b>who</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Tolkien on this point have cited him to defend their arguments.|$|E

500|$|The poem is {{traditionally}} ascribed to Faltonia Betitia Proba {{largely on the}} assertion of Isidore, who noted {{that it was the}} product of a woman named Proba who was the wife of a man named Adelphus (Proba, uxor Adelphi, centonem ex Vergilio ... expressit). However, the classicist and medievalist Danuta Shanzer has argued that the poem was written by Anicia Faltonia Proba, a late-fourth- and early-fifth-century noblewoman and the granddaughter of Faltonia Betitia Proba. Shanzer and those <b>who</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> her have developed the following arguments to support their claims: They argue that lines 13–17 of De laudibus Christi resemble lines 20–24 of the later poem Carmen contra paganos, reportedly written after Faltonia Betitia Proba's death. They assert that the poem must have been written after 387, because it alludes to a debate about the date of Easter which took place that year. They see Jerome's allusion to the poem as a reference to a living individual (Anicia Proba) and contend that Faltonia Betitia Proba died during the war between Magnentius and Constantius, which occured in AD 351 and is alluded to in the invocation of De laudibus Christi. Finally, they argue that Anicia Proba must have written the poem, since the author is referred to as [...] "mother of the Anicians" [...] in a later manuscript and the [...] "eminent Roman Mistress" [...] in another (titles only Anicia Proba would have received).|$|E
500|$|Whether the NVA {{actually}} {{planned to}} capture Khe Sanh {{and whether the}} battle {{was an attempt to}} replicate the Viet Minh triumph against the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu has long been a point of contention. Westmoreland believed that the latter was the case and this belief was the basis for his desire to stage [...] "Dien Bien Phu in reverse". Those <b>who</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Westmoreland reason that there is no other explanation as to why Hanoi would have committed so many forces to the area instead of deploying them for the Tet Offensive. The fact that the North Vietnamese only committed about half of their available forces to the offensive (60–70,000), the majority of whom were members of the NLF, is cited in favor of Westmoreland's argument. Other theories argued that the forces around Khe Sanh were simply a localized defensive measure in the DMZ area, or that they were serving as a reserve in case of an offensive American end run in the mode of the American invasion at Inchon during the Korean War. However, North Vietnamese sources claim that the Americans did not win a victory at Khe Sanh but they were forced to retreat to avoid destruction. The NVA claimed that Khe Sanh was [...] "a stinging defeat from both the military and political points of view": Westmoreland was replaced two months {{after the end of the}} battle and his successor explained the retreat in different ways.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of Christians <b>who</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> creeds, the most significant area of departure is the rejection by the LDS Church of certain parts of ecumenical creeds such as the Nicene Creed, which defines the predominant view of the Christian God as a Trinity of three separate persons in [...] "one essence".
