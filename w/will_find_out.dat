Then, with a metronome as his guide in tempo, he practiced scales in all keys—always in a light staccato—until he could play them with absolute precision, in both time and tune.

2500|$|Langford of AfterElton.com was {{conflicted}} by the storyline's beginning.

Langford opined that Akingbola and Astill had chemistry, that the characters' scenes were [...] "intense and combustible," [...] and that the fight and following kiss were [...] "terrifically done, full of passion and heat and rage". However, he expressed concern that the same type of storyline had been attempted in soap operas on multiple occasions. Langford concluded: [...] "If the usual template is followed from here there will be weeks of denials and more fighting. I suspect that Malick and Dan will eventually embark on a secret affair, Chrissie <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>out,</b> there will be more denials and fighting and at some point Dan will accept who he is. Still, despite the tired storyline, the characters are complex and appealing and the writing is solid enough to make me overlook that."

The Federal Government talks about this and the banks also talk about it. But I want to state here that the banks have not been helpful. They always say money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is over and above the worth of the loan. So, the banks are not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to the SMEs; but you <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and you are talking about empowering 2,000 people with loans. What is that? So, the banks are paying lip service to funding SMEs." ...|$|E
