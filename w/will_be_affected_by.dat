5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for the autopilot. Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E
5|$|This {{ability to}} provide {{real-time}} tissue loading data allows the computer to indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile change, so the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} decompress at any specific depth provided the ceiling is not violated, though the decompression rate <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called for by a decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected. This provides the diver with an unprecedented flexibility of dive profile while remaining within the safety envelope of the algorithm in use.|$|E

The representation giving rise to such a legitimate expectation may either be an express promise given on behalf of an authority, or the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue.

25|$|Along the {{efficient}} emission path calculated by Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) (referred to by Fisher et al.., 2007), the long-run global average temperature after 500 years increases by 6.2°C above the 1900 level. Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) stated their {{concern over the}} potentially large and uncertain impacts of such a large environmental change. It {{should be noted that}} the projected temperature in this IAM, like any other, is subject to scientific uncertainty (e.g., the relationship between concentrations of GHGs and global mean temperature, which is called the climate sensitivity). Projections of future atmospheric concentrations based on emission pathways are also affected by scientific uncertainties, e.g., over how carbon sinks, such as forests, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> future climate change. Klein et al. (2007) concluded that there were few high quality studies in this area, and placed low confidence in the results of cost–benefit analysis.|$|E
25|$|The document, {{published}} in December 2016, seeks for Scotland {{to remain a}} member of the European Single Market to allow the Economy of Scotland to benefit from free trade deals across the remaining 27 European Union nations. Furthermore, it seeks that remaining within the European Single Market would be beneficial for trade across the entire United Kingdom, whereby it benefits the economies of both Scotland and the United Kingdom as well as benefiting the wider economy and trade of the European Union. Within Scotland's Place in Europe, the Scottish Government highlights that there are several ways that Scotland could retain its membership of the European Single Market, but most notably by becoming an independent sovereign country within the EU which is the preferred option of Sturgeon and the wider SNP led-Scottish Government. Other than trade and single market membership, Sturgeon advocates the importance of the rights of EU nationals currently working and residing within Scotland and that there rights and liberties are protected post-Brexit. As immigration and border controls remain a reserved matter, Sturgeon has called on strong working with Prime Minister Theresa May and the UK Government to ensure this is achieved. Other issues set in the document include protection over laws and legislation which affects Scotland, protection of worker's rights and entitlements, a review of the devolution settlement in Scotland that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> Brexit such as farming and fishery industries and additional powers granted to Scotland to protect and promote Scottish interests.|$|E
