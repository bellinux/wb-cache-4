40|$|When I {{first arrived}} in Australia as a backpacker in the mid- 1980 s my job {{possibilities}} included negotiating {{a job as a}} governess on a remote station through an agency, and, when a café proprietor offered me a job, just a few minutes later finding myself alone in her house confronting a vast mound of laundry and other housework with no terms discussed and no prospect of lunch. I had applied to be a waitress but I felt like a slave. I did not know much about Australia or service jobs at that stage and neither of these positions stuck. I never worked in a bar although the Aussie barmaid might best illustrate the Australian stereotype of female service as Dianne Kirkby has shown in her recent work (Barmaids: A History of <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> <b>Work</b> in Pubs, Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1997). It is interesting to place such experiences in the context of Barry Higman s excellent new book. For all the male and macho impressions of the pioneering male conquering the alien landscape of the outback, in fact colonial Australia had a very high proportion of women in the workforce. Yet the concept of service somehow sits oddly with the egalitarianism of Australian culture. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a famous environmental tree-hugger movement, widely known as the Chipko movement, of the Indian Hindu region of Garhwal in the Central Himalayas, the relation of Garhwali women to the forest has been described by various international actors. A critique of previous presentations is the starting point of this thesis, which explores the meaning of the forest in women s lives, and various connections made between women and forests in the Garhwali peasant society. The study may contribute to a richer understanding of the logics behind locally based metaphors connecting women to nature: The forest is women s maternal home, is a locally crafted metaphor used in environmental awareness campaigns. The study suggests that this metaphor does not imply ideas of essential links between women and forests, and in stead looks at the relation broadly in terms of everyday and life-cycle experiences, social arenas and social structures based on kinship practices, social values, religious beliefs and aspects of local cosmology. The exploration reveals that the forest {{is one of the few}} arenas in and through which women may find expression for their identities and belongings, and relief for their subordinate social positions. As a consequence parts of the thesis may be read as a discussion of social structures, and the relationships between power, agency and resistance. Through the presentation, local ideas about <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>work,</b> social bonds, landscape and world views are explored. After a theoretical and geographical introduction, chapter two presents the village and its environments through a focus on the organization of the daily life of women in the village. Femininity is thus described in terms of women s actions and agency in the social and natural working environment, and the forest is presented as one of several social arenas. Chapter three explores the meanings of a home for Garhwali peasant women, through a presentation of kinship structures and marriage practices. Chapter four explores the forest and its relationship with the female in relation to a larger cultural framework. In chapter five the spirits and emotions of the forest are brought into the village courtyards, when possession rituals performed to appease forest goddesses are explored. Through them, female experiences and views on society are given strong representations in public village performances...|$|E

Nojautuen kriittiseen miestutkimukseen ja perhetutkimukseen tässä tutkimuksessa puretaan käsityksiä avioeron, miesten, kodin ja sosiaalisten ongelmien yhteenkietoutumisesta. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan sitä, mitä koti merkitsee eronneille miehille. Kiinnostuksen kohteena on myös se, mitä miehet tekevät kodissa ja millä tavoin miehet toimivat kotiin liittyen. Tutkimuksessa avioero nähdään kodin muutoskohtana, joka tuo esiin itsestään selvänä ja arkisena pidetyn kodin ulottuvuudet. Tulokset osoittavat, että koti merkitsee eronneille miehille vahvasti perhesuhteita ja läheissuhteita. Ne ovat usein ajallisesti jatkuvia. Miehet puhuvat kodistaan lasten, lastenlasten, elämänkumppanin, vanhempien, isovanhempien, ystävien, sisarusten, naapureiden ja lemmikeiden kannalta. Etenkin omat lapset ovat miehille kodin kiintopiste. Koti on miehille levollisen olemisen, mielihyvän ja työnteon paikka. Kodin puhtaus on miehille tärkeää, ruoanlaitto merkitsee harrastusta ja monet miehistä ovat kiinnostuneita kodin sisustamisesta. Iäkkäästä ja huonokuntoisesta vanhemmasta huolta pitäminen on muutamille miehistä osa kodin arkea. Tutkimustulosten mukaan mieheyden ihanteiden ja miesten perhe-elämän välille on syntynyt jännitteitä ja murtumisia, joita miehet kotiin liittyvällä toiminnallaan haastavat. Isien kannustaminen vanhempainvapaiden ja perhevapaiden käyttämiseen löytää kaikupohjaa tutkimuksen tuloksista, jotka osoittavat isänä olemisen tärkeyden miehille. Myös omaishoivan järjestämistä voidaan pohtia tutkimustulosten valossa, jotka tuovat esiin miehen iäkkäälle vanhemmalleen antaman huolenpidon kodissa. Vaikeissa elämän muutostilanteissa koti voi olla miestä kiinnipitävä tekijä. Tämä ilmenee siten, että miehet löytävät itselleen selviytymiskeinoja kodin arjesta. Tutkimus perustuu laajaan haastatteluaineistoon, miesten kodistaan ottamiin valokuviin, miesten piirtämiin kotihistoriaviivoihin sekä tutkijan havaintoihin miesten kodeista. Tutkimus kuuluu sosiaalityön oppialaan. This study {{deals with}} the homes of {{divorced}} men. The home is a location of strong beliefs related to gender. It {{is seen as the}} place of women, while the public sphere is the place of men. Previous social scientific research has approached divorced men primarily as a social problem. The home of a divorced man has also been defined as a problem. Parallel to these viewpoints we need research that does not approach divorced men and the home by defining them as problems. The dissertation examines what men do at home and men s actions involving the home. The study also seeks to find out what meanings men attach to the home. Men s activity related to the home and the meanings that they attach to the home are approached from the viewpoint of the men themselves. Although the research subjects are divorced men, the study does not deal with divorce or separation after co-habitation. Divorce is defined as a moment of change during the man s life course. It is assumed that the dimensions of home, so far regarded as self-evident, natural and mundane, are revealed by divorce. The research data consists of interviews with men, photographs related to the home taken by men, home history lines drawn by men and the researcher s observations in the homes of men. The principal data set consists of the interviews with men. For this study, nineteen men who had experienced divorce or separation after co-habitation were interviewed in their homes. Each of them was interviewed several times. The data was gathered in 2003 2005. The interviewees are mainly of middle age; the youngest was twenty-eight and the oldest seventy-four years old. The men live in urban and rural areas in Southern and Northern Finland. The study is descriptive in nature, and strives to understand the process of attaching meanings by men. The foremost theoretical angle applied is the theory of gender in critical studies on men and masculinities. The study is also located in the fields of social scientific family research, home studies and feminist geography. The study is part of the soci! al work research tradition which studies phenomena from the viewpoints of well-being and coping. The central concept in the study is men s home practices. The aim is to determine the discursive and material dimensions of men s home practices. The practices are examined from the viewpoints of space, objects and social relationships. The meanings that men attach to the home are approached through the viewpoints of temporality and the locations of homes. The meanings attached to the home are also examined by means of a framework consisting of the mental, spatial and social dimensions of the home. The results are analysed from the viewpoints of gender, power and differences between men. The data is analysed with data-driven analysis. The study shows that men have multiple homes. For men, the home means several locations and spaces lived in in the course of time. In describing their actions involving the home, men primarily start out from the perspective of today, but also from the viewpoints of past and future. Men go through phases of re-evaluating and rearranging the home during periods of change in their life course. These periods include divorce, as well as the death of someone close or an increased substance abuse. Men also have to rearrange their homes as their children grow up. For men, the home is strongly a place of family ties and close relationships. The social relationships related to the home continue across time and also involve several generations. Men speak of their homes from the perspectives of their partners, their children and grandchildren, parents and grandparents, friends, siblings, neighbours and pets. In particular, children make a home for men. The practices of fatherhood are a ! natural way for men to act in the home. For some men, looking after an aged and frail parent is a self-evident part of daily life at home. The home is a place of restful existence, pleasure and work for men. Men s home practices consist of micropractices of everyday life. They are also strongly related to power. Men act autonomously at home, and they regard the activity of their life partners at home as something self-evident and natural. In the descriptions of men who have families, housework appears to take care of itself as if automatically. Men who live alone describe housework in detail. Cleanliness at home is important for men, cooking is seen as a hobby, and many men are interested in interior decoration. The study dismantles the conception that the problems of divorce, men, home and social problems are intertwined. Divorced men have a variety of close relationships and everyday resources. The study reveals the life history of a divorced man and the continuity and stratified nature of his life. Differences between men are linked to the men s home practices and the meanings attached to the home in multiple ways. Gender, intersecting with age, functional ability, social class, generation, marital status and local culture, is visible in men s home practices in many ways. The study shows that men s home practices and the meanings that they attach to the home differ according to social class. The class divisions between men can be seen particularly in relation to lifestyle, income and place of residence. In everyday life at home, men act differently according to their social, cultural and material resources. This is revealed as, for example, differences in the men s forms of accommodation and home environments, different consumption habits related to the home and their possibilities of realising dreams related to the home. The study shows that men do not live a home typical for men. Men do not describe their homes through gender, and they infrequently categorise domestic objects as either feminine or masculine. Nor do men speak of housework as <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>work.</b> On the other hand, men do attach gendered meanings to the home, in that their childhood, their (grand) mother and home are intertwined in their descriptions. Men speak of the men in their childhood as builders of houses, skilled craftsmen and persons who are outsiders to the home. These discourses related to the home are linked to the personal life history of each man, but also culturally recognisable and gendered. The study leads to the conclusion that a broader perspective of understanding the multiple relationships between men and home is needed. Tensions and ruptures have been created between masculine ideals and men s family lives, and they are challenged by the men s home practices. Studying men and home is important because it will enable us to see men as resources in the home and as active agents in close relationships. From the viewpoint of family policy and equality in housework it would be important to note that men regard a life shared with a partner and women s domestic activity as self-evident. The study poses challenges for further research. Men s multiple social relationships associated with the home should not be seen as simply consisting of family relationships. In addition, the biographical, temporally continuous dimension of various close relationships should be better taken into account...|$|E

40|$|The rescue crews {{have been}} searching for the woman for nearly a week. Hurricane Katrina devastated Hancock County, the southernmost point in Mississippi, and the woman had stayed through the storm in her beach house. There is little hope of finding her alive; the search teams know she is gone because the house is gone. Late {{at night in the}} art {{classroom}} of the school that is serving as the county s emergency operations center, Craig Harvey is discussing the search with the center s commander. Harvey is the Chief Operating Officer of a unique company called NVision Solutions Inc., based at NASA s Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, only a couple of miles away. He and his entire staff have set up a volunteer operation in the art room, supporting the emergency management efforts using technology and capabilities the company developed through its NASA partnerships. As he talks to the commander, Harvey feels an idea taking shape that might lead them to the <b>woman</b> <b>s</b> location. <b>Working</b> with surface elevation data and hydrological principles, Harvey creates a map showing how the floodwaters from the storm would have flowed along the topography of the region around the <b>woman</b> <b>s</b> former home. Using the map, search crews find the <b>woman</b> <b>s</b> body in 15 minutes. Recovering individuals who have been lost is a sad reality of emergency management {{in the wake of a}} disaster like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But the sooner answers can be provided, the sooner a community s overall recovery can take place. When damage is extensive, resources are scattered, and people are in dire need of food, shelter, and medical assistance, the speed and efficiency of emergency operations can be the key to limiting the impact of a disaster and speeding the process of recovery. And a key to quick and effective emergency planning and response is geographic information. With a host of Earth-observing satellites orbiting the globe at all times, NASA generates an unmatched wealth of data about our ever-changing planet. This information can be captured, analyzed, and visualized by geographic information systems (GIS) to produce maps, charts, and other tools that can reveal information essential to a wide variety of applications including emergency management. Knowing precise, real-time information about the size, location, environmental conditions, and resulting damage of an event like a flood or wildfire as well as the location and numbers of emergency responders and other resources contributes directly to the effectiveness of disaster mitigation. The need for such information is also evident when responding to homeland security threats, such as a terrorist attack. Recognizing the value of its geospatial information resources for this and other purposes, in 1998 Stennis and the state of Mississippi partnered to form what became the Enterprise for Innovative Geospatial Solutions (EIGS) industry cluster, supporting the growth of remote sensing and GIS-based research and business. As part of EIGS, several companies partnered with NASA through dual use and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts. Among those was NVision...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD takes a social constructionist approach (see Burr, 2003) to explore how professional women in Sri Lanka make sense of and enact their careers. By explaining career through the recursive relationship between social context and individual agency, this study adds new insights into existing understandings of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers which are dominated by psychological models of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> development over their lifespans (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005; Pringle and Dixon, 2003). Most importantly this study which addresses <b>women</b> <b>s</b> experiences in Sri Lanka fulfils a significant gap in the extant literature which has paid only little attention to careers in South Asian nations. This study is based on qualitative interviews (see King, 2004) conducted with 24 professional Sri Lankan women: eight in early career, eight in mid-career and eight in late career (see O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005). All respondents aspired to reach the highest possible level in their organisations hierarchies and therefore continuously engaged with work organisations, home and family and wider contextual structures in Sri Lanka in pursuit of achieving their career goals, contributing towards maintaining and/or transforming these social structures in the process. Based on these findings I developed a theoretical framework to understand <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in a dynamic and contextually significant manner. This framework highlights eight different strategies women use to develop their careers which has four possible social outcomes. In illuminating specifically what women do to advance their careers within their social contexts and with what implications this framework makes {{a significant contribution to}} the careers literature which gives only little attention to individuals career strategies. Moreover by appreciating both social context and individual agency as explanations of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers this model refrains from taking an overly deterministic (see McRae, 2003; Crompton, 2011) or voluntaristic (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005) stance to conceptualising <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development. Second, I outline a South Asian model of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development highlighting family, moral notions, religious philosophies and wider belief systems such as astrology and horoscopes as central constituents of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers. I highlight how these understandings could be used to identify blind spots in existing literature and further develop prevailing ideas of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in the West. Specifically I argue that traditional notions do not altogether disappear as societies develop (see Gerth and Mills, 1991), but rather individuals use these notions to walk towards modernity. Finally I conclude the thesis by outlining how scholars could develop my work further, calling upon authors to bring moral character, traditional notions and enchantment back to the careers field.

O trabalho de campo apontou para uma supervalorização do trabalho remunerado, este reconhecido como o maior valor para ambas; a secundarização de todas as outras esferas da vida como relações sociais, familiares e afetivas; e a renúncia a tudo que pudesse significar impedimento ou dificultador para a ascensão profissional. This study aims {{to assess}} the {{trajectory}} of the two women who occupied the Presidency of the Federal University of Goiás (UFG) since its founding fifty years ago; focusing on the impediments and/or facilitating factors of the female ascension to the highest University position. Maria do Rosário Cassimiro was the UFG President from 1982 to 1985, and Milca Severino Pereira held the position between 1998 and 2005. This thesis discusses the impediments and facilitating elements of the female career advancement, the gender discrimination at the public arena, the relevancy of people s subjective choices, the legitimacy of male supremacy and served to guide {{the interpretation of the}} researched empiric data. The data was acquired through semistructured interviews. And the thesis was written as narrative interview form. The field research pointed to an overvalue of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> paid <b>work,</b> which was recognized by both, being of the highest importance. Therefore, other aspects of their life such as social, emotional and family relations were lived as secondary priority as they made choices renouncing all that could be an obstacle to their professional advancement...|$|R
40|$|The paper explores {{interfaces}} {{between gender}} and land reform with specific reference to <b>women</b> <b>s</b> ability to access land and participate in land reform processes during the fast tract land resettlement programme in Zimbabwe. Statistics indicating beneficiaries of A 1 and A 2 resettlement models were abstracted from the national quantitative data base {{on the fast track}} land reform programme compiled by the Presidential Land Review Committee in 2003 and interviews with members of district and provincial land identification and allocation committees and beneficiaries of land. The paper posits that lack of a gender numeric target, diverse and non-specific land allocation criteria countrywide may have derailed <b>women</b> <b>s</b> ability to access land. <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> stake in land reform may have been compromised following the ideological transition from land reform targeting the landless to e-conceptualizing land reform to establish a new crop of indigenous large-scale farmers...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{empirical}} {{studies have found}} that American workers report longer hours than workers in other highly industrialized countries, and that the highly educated report the longest hours relative to other educational levels. This paper analyzes disparities in working hours by gender and education levels in 17 high- and middle-income countries in order to assess whether this finding holds cross-nationally. In contrast to many prior studies of working time, we use a measure of weekly rather than annual hours worked, which we argue provides a better window on the discretionary time available to individuals and households. We find that: 1) average weekly male hours in the United States do not appear exceptional, with averages exceeding 40 hours per week in both the U. S. and most western European countries; 2) U. <b>S.</b> <b>women</b> <b>work</b> longer hours than women in most other rich countries; 3) the within-country difference in average hours by education is not uniform, with higher-income countries more likely to show the U. S. pattern, and middle-income countries showing the reverse pattern, with the less educated reporting longer hours. We conclude by assessing some possible macro-level explanations for this variation, including per capita GDP, tax rates, unionization, and earnings inequality...|$|R
40|$|There {{are still}} {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} rights {{of men and women}} in most of southern Africa, and this is exacerbated by the discrepancy between written and actual practice, not to mention the lop-sided application of the law. In Botswana, the Emang Basadi <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> Association has researched the problem of land and property grabbing, including livestock and houses, after the death of a spouse or when a couple separates. This book s sometimes harrowing accounts of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> experiences, provided by victims and observers, lead into an analysis of the causes of property grabbing. The accounts and analysis, and the practical recommendations for legal reform, worth following in other countries, make for an exemplary book.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} and analyse some foreign <b>women</b> <b>s</b> perspectives on their first meeting with the Swedish school and to identify and illuminate patterns and processes on different levels that facilitate respectively obstruct {{the development of their}} school careers. The women arrived in Sweden in their teens and attended Swedish upper secondary school, completed their education with good results, applied for and were enrolled as students at University. The <b>women</b> <b>s</b> descriptions are studied as individual interpetations. Description and analysis are based on symbolic interactionalism, based on the concepts interaction, empathy, self- image, confirmation and congruousness/ incongruousness. Also conceptions focusing on schooling are required. These conceptions are connected to the symbolic interactionalistic perspective and to Code theory by Bernstein. Conceptions used are career turning points, integration and inclusion, motivation, framing, and visible and invisible pedagogy. The school years and school careers have been affected by, and are thus related to, migration. The descriptions are analysed within the dimensions of ethnical background, gender and class. The material consists of thematically structured in-depth interviews with twelve women. The interviews were subsequently constructed as case-studies. Interactive patterns on structural, institutional and individual levels were identified in the analyse. And in an adjustment process were three conceptions identified; teachers confirmation, modified adjustment and motivation.. They describe central conditions that contribute {{to the creation of the}} <b>women</b> <b>s</b> successful school careers. Although the <b>women</b> <b>s</b> school careers have been successful, their way through the school system has, for most of them, been problematic. Not only the Swedish language but also the pedagogy made it harder for the women to carry out their school careers. Analysis points towards the fact that the school as an institution, with the unvisible pedagogy of classroom work with different working methods and relationships than the women have been used to, obstructed the <b>women</b> <b>s</b> school career...|$|R
