Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect <b>when</b> <b>energized</b> with electricity) to create intricate patterns over {{the frame of the}} bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that the lights are mobile.|$|E

2500|$|The {{monopolar}} instrument {{called an}} [...] "active electrode" [...] <b>when</b> <b>energized,</b> requires {{the application of}} another monopolar instrument called a [...] "dispersive electrode" [...] elsewhere on the patient's body that functions to 'defocus' or disperse the RF current thereby preventing thermal injury to the underlying tissue.

However virtually all currently available RF electrosurgical systems are designed to function with isolated circuits - the dispersive electrode is directly attached to the ESU, not to [...] "ground". The same electrical current is transmitted across both the dispersive electrode and the active electrode, {{so it is not}} [...] "neutral". [...] The term [...] "return electrode" [...] is also technically incorrect since alternating electrical currents refer to alternating polarity, a circumstance that results in bidirectional flow across both electrodes in the circuit.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe need of {{a better}} {{mechanical}} behaviour and the stabilization of coated conductors for applications, as Magnets, cables or Fault Current Limiters, has motivated the lamination of tapes with stainless steel or copper alloys, increasing so the elastic modulus of the conductors and their mechanical performance.

50|$|The {{reversing}} valve has two states, relaxed and energized. The energized state is typically achieved by applying 24 volts AC, which {{is commonly used}} in HVAC. The heat pump can be designed by the manufacturer to produce cooling or heating with the {{reversing valve}} in the relaxed state. When the reversing valve is energized, it will produce the opposite conditioning. In other words, a reversing valve installed {{in such a way}} as to produce cooling when relaxed will produce heating <b>when</b> <b>energized.</b> Likewise, a reversing valve installed to produce heating when relaxed will produce cooling <b>when</b> <b>energized.</b>|$|E

40|$|The surface {{characteristics}} of materials can be investigated by analyzing their spectral response <b>when</b> properly <b>energized</b> by a suitable source. <b>When</b> the <b>energizing</b> source is represented by a light spectra of known characteristics, the surface response can be evaluated using a spectrophotometric approach. The analysis of the detected spectra can give useful information concerning the material characteristics and/or surface properties and status. This latter aspect is utilized {{in the present study}} to set-up a procedure aimed at recognizing particulate solid products belonging to material waste streams. The technique is particularly powerful because its utilization is not linked to the dimension of the image field of the object being investigated. Furthermore the process is flexible since the results of the analysis are influenced by the spectral {{characteristics of}} the light source and the acquisition set-up. A great amount of data (one spectra for each investigated element), together with their form (gray tone along a line) represents the analytical challenge to this procedure. In this paper, the above aspects will be analyzed and critically discussed with reference to specific particulate solid waste material sorting...|$|R

50|$|More precisely, a Rotary Variable Differential Transformer (RVDT) is an {{electromechanical}} transducer {{that provides a}} variable alternating current (AC) output voltage that is linearly proportional to the angular displacement of its input shaft. <b>When</b> <b>energized</b> with a fixed AC source, the output signal is linear within a specified range over the angular displacement.|$|E
50|$|By comparison, {{incandescent}} lamps have a brief warm-up <b>when</b> <b>energized,</b> {{followed by a}} cool-down period when power is removed. These delays result in smearing and blurring of detail of objects partially illuminated during the warm-up and cool-down periods.

50|$|They {{are widely}} used in the {{hydraulics}} industry. These valves make use of electromechanical solenoids for sliding of the spool. Because simple application of electrical power provides control, these valves are used extensively. However, electrical solenoids cannot generate large forces unless supplied with large amounts of electrical power. Heat generation {{poses a threat to}} extended use of these valves <b>when</b> <b>energized</b> over time. Many have a limited duty cycle. This makes their direct acting use commonly limited to low actuating forces.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, after {{examining}} {{an example of}} an electric induction coil made by German instrument maker Heinrich Daniel Ruhmkorff, which produced a small two-inch (50 mm) electric spark <b>when</b> <b>energized,</b> Ritchie perceived that it could be made more efficient and produce a longer spark by redesigning and improving its secondary insulation. His own design divided the coil into sections, each properly insulated from each other. Ritchie's first induction coil produced a spark 10 inches (25 cm) in length; a later perfected model produced a bolt two feet (60 cm) or longer in length.|$|E
40|$|High Impedance Faults (HIFs) are {{undetectable}} {{by conventional}} protection technology under certain conditions. These faults occur <b>when</b> an <b>energized</b> conductor makes undesired {{contact with a}} quasi-insulating object, such as a tree or a road. This contact restricts {{the level of the}} fault current to a very low value, from a few mA up to 75 A. In solidly grounded distribution networks where the value of the residual current under normal conditions is considerable, overcurrent devices do not protect against HIFs. However, such a protection is essential for guaranteeing public security, because of the possibility of reaching the fallen conductor and the risk of fire.

50|$|Inrush current, input {{surge current}} or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Alternating current electric motors and transformers may draw several times their normal full-load current <b>when</b> first <b>energized,</b> {{for a few}} cycles of the input waveform. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance. The selection of overcurrent protection devices such as fuses and circuit breakers is made more complicated when high inrush currents must be tolerated. The overcurrent protection must react quickly to overload or short circuit faults but must not interrupt the circuit when the (usually harmless) inrush current flows.|$|R

50|$|Any {{polyphase}} system, {{by virtue}} of the time displacement of the currents in the phases, makes it possible to easily generate a magnetic field that revolves at the line frequency. Such a revolving magnetic field makes polyphase induction motors possible. Indeed, where induction motors must run on single-phase power (such as is usually distributed in homes), the motor must contain some mechanism to produce a revolving field, otherwise the motor cannot generate any stand-still torque and will not start. The field produced by a single-phase winding can provide energy to a motor already rotating, but without auxiliary mechanisms the motor will not accelerate from a stop <b>when</b> <b>energized.</b>|$|E
50|$|A small motor can {{be started}} by simply {{plugging}} {{it into an}} electrical receptacle or by using a switch or circuit breaker. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motorstarter or motor contactor. <b>When</b> <b>energized,</b> a direct on line (DOL) starter immediately connects the motor terminals directly to the power supply. Reduced-voltage, star-delta or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a voltage reduction device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. In smaller sizes a motor starter is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use magnetic contactors. Very large motors running on medium voltage power supplies (thousands of volts) may use power circuit breakers as switching elements.|$|E
25|$|Inrush {{current or}} input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform <b>when</b> first <b>energized</b> or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|R
