5|$|While {{the human}} and {{property}} losses were staggering, the cultural loss is still felt today. The University of Copenhagen library was <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> the greatest and the most frequently mentioned of such. 35,000texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in the flames. Original works from the historians Hans Svaning, Anders Sørensen Vedel, Niels Krag, and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists Ole Worm, Ole Rømer, Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost. Atlas Danicus by Peder Hansen Resen and the archive of Zealand Diocese went up in flames as well. The archive of the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day the fire started.|$|E
5|$|The {{colourful}} Buhl altarpiece is {{the work}} of a group of followers of Martin Schongauer, who drew their inspiration both from his woodcuts and from his paintings, especially the Altarpiece of the Dominicans, now kept in the Unterlinden Museum. The Buhl painters closely followed their model's designs, but on a larger scale and in a simpler and technically cruder manner. While it is not documented that the altarpiece was commissioned by the convent of Saint Catherine, the closeness to the designs of Schongauer but also, to a lesser degree, of Caspar Isenmann (the panel depicting the Flagellation of Christ is reminding of the same scene in the altarpiece of St Martin's Church) indicate <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> that it has been painted in Colmar; furthermore, both Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula, who figure prominently in the Crucifixion scene, were particularly venerated by the Dominican sisters of Saint Catherine.|$|E
5|$|As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht {{refuses to}} {{mobilize}} the Reserve Army until he knows <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> that Hitler is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder which side they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E

5|$|GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann {{opened his}} review by calling Burnout 3: Takedown {{one of the}} best racing games of all time, noting that it stood out among contemporaries in the diverse and {{expanding}} genre. He felt the quality of the game was high enough to recommend it to gamers who were impartial to driving games. Edge magazine regarded Burnout 3 to be Criterion's finest work to date; they thought the studio had demonstrated their proficiency by revising the series structure and dynamic. They were also mindful of how Burnout 3s offered a fun and exhilarating experience while other developers were prioritising realism in their games. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer wrote that the addition of significant gameplay mechanics had helped craft one of the most addictive racing games ever made. GamesTM awarded it a perfect score; they proclaimed that Burnout 3 was <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> the greatest racing game ever made and described playing it as the most fun they had ever had in the genre. GameSpy reviewer Miguel Lopez, who also awarded the game a perfect score, remarked that it was possibly the best arcade racer ever made.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E
25|$|GB's minds were however firmly {{planted on}} the 3rd game, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> the title decider. GB went a goal down at 26:56 before Newcastle's Teresa Lewis opened the account for GB on the half hour mark.|$|E

25|$|<b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt,</b> {{the best-selling}} offshoots of {{industrial}} music are industrial rock and metal; Ministry and Nine Inch Nails both recorded platinum-selling albums. Their success {{led to an}} increase in commercial success for some other post-industrial musicians; for example, the Nine Inch Nails remix album Further Down the Spiral, which included contributions from Foetus and Coil, was certified gold in 1996.|$|E

Kitchener posted {{the best record}} in the OHL in 1983–84 with 106 points, proving <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> they were worthy being chosen to host the Memorial Cup tournament. The Rangers were led by John Tucker as the OHL's most outstanding player, Wayne Presley as the top scoring right winger, and Shawn Burr was the rookie of the year.|$|E

Prince Frederick Adolf proposed to her in the garden at Drottningholm Palace, and: [...] "She laughed and accepted <b>without</b> <b>a</b> moments <b>doubt,</b> amused and flattered.

25|$|I {{never saw}} {{anything}} so blatant as Meckiff's action as, with the swell {{of the crowd}} in his ears, he came up that afternoon full pelt from the bottom end towards the pavillion...the English press camp were outspoken to a degree {{and at least one}} Australian, Jack Fingleton, writing in the Sunday Times, thought Meckiff should have been called... England had a grievance, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wayang kulit, or shadow puppets, are <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> {{the best}} known of the Indonesian wayang. Kulit means skin, and refers to the leather {{construction}} of the puppets that are carefully chiselled with very fine tools, supported with carefully shaped buffalo horn handles and control rods, and painted in beautiful hues, including gold. The stories are usually drawn from the Hindu epics the Ramayana, the Mahabharata or from the Serat Menak, (a story about the heroism of Amir Hamza).|$|E

25|$|The trifolium villa, {{named after}} a clover-shaped room that was <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> used as a triclinium, is the largest private house {{excavated}} so far at Dougga. The house had two storeys, but there is almost nothing left of the upper storey. It stands {{in the south of}} the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly interesting because {{of the way in which}} it is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.|$|E
25|$|Al-Zahawi’s {{early works}} took on more simplistic designs, extenuated by {{smoother}} lines, colorless texture (lacking stain), and relatively uniform spaces. This {{began to change}} when Al-Zahawi was introduced to primitive art, especially African Art through visits to the British Museum among other galleries and museums. <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> African sculpture had a profound influence on his art thereafter. He would later travel and live in Africa (1965-1967) as a civil servant for the United Nations’ mission in the Congo, only serving to reinforce his love and admiration of African art.|$|E

25|$|Sánchez Mejías {{was born}} in 1891 in the Calle de la Palma, Seville. He {{was the son of}} a rich and stern doctor who insisted that he follow in his footsteps, but he never studied medicine. He {{received}} his high school diploma (bachillerato) by examination as an adult. Before, in the Escolapios (Catholic schools) he played truant in order to play at bullfighting with other children, among them José Gómez, years later called Joselito, the greatest bullfighter of all time and <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> the most important influence in the life of Ignacio Sánchez.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Marcia Clark {{published a}} book about the case titled <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doubt</b> (1998). Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.|$|E

The President also said that he support Trump’s policy of “no-interference” on other countries affairs. He added “Today, America elected its new President. The strongest policy he has announced so far is to stop America’s efforts to meddle in global affairs. America needs to stop policing the entire world. This, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt,</b> is a very good principle”.|$|E
