Two wasps may engage in this activity by holding their antennae out-stretched, grasping each other, and falling from the nest. The wasps never actually hit the ground. Instead they separate in mid-air, return to the nest, and repeat this process until a winner is determined. This behavior is especially likely {{in the event that}} a stranger attempts to take over a nest while the dominant female is away. When the dominant female returns, she will [...] "fight" [...] this individual, often for several hours and possibly even a couple days, to determine <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> charge of the nest.|$|E

We pick up a fresh squad here, twenty hardened troopers from a cavalry regiment usually stationed at Abbeville. They have had work to do in this town, which is a hot-bed of treachery.

6000|$|Probably between {{contiguous}} {{nations that}} have {{mastered the art of}} war, instead of the pouring clouds of cavalry of the old dispensation,[37] this will be the opening phase of the struggle, a vast duel all along the frontier between groups of skilled marksmen, continually being relieved and refreshed from the rear. For a time quite possibly there will be no definite army here or there, there will be no controllable battle, there will be no Great General in the field at all. But somewhere far in the rear the central organizer will sit at the telephonic centre of his vast front, and he will strengthen here and feed there and watch, watch perpetually the pressure, the incessant remorseless pressure that is seeking to wear down his countervailing thrust. Behind the thin firing line that is actually engaged, the country for many miles will be rapidly cleared and devoted to the business of war, big machines will be at work making second, third, and fourth lines of trenches that may be needed if presently the firing line is forced back, spreading out transverse paths for the swift lateral movement of the cyclists <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> perpetual alertness to relieve sudden local pressures, and all along those great motor roads our first [...] "Anticipations" [...] sketched, there will be a vast and rapid shifting to and fro of big and very long range guns. These guns will probably be fought with the help of balloons. The latter will hang above the firing line all along the front, incessantly ascending and withdrawn; they will be continually determining the distribution of the antagonist's forces, directing the fire of continually shifting great guns upon the apparatus and supports in the rear of his fighting line, forecasting his night plans and seeking some tactical or strategic weakness in that sinewy line of battle.|$|E
6000|$|And {{he will be}} the man <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{the best}} humour, and have the clearest brain, to kneel down when he gets up to his daily work, and [...] "in everything, by prayer and supplication, make his {{requests}} known to God." [...] And then, whether he can make both ends meet or not, whether he can begin next year free from debt or not, still [...] "the peace of God will keep his heart." [...] He may be unable to clear himself, but still he will know that he has a loving and merciful Father in heaven, who has allowed distress and difficulty to come on him only as a lesson and an education. That this distress came because God chose, and that when God chooses it will go away--and that till then--considering that the Lord God sent it--it had better NOT go away. He will believe that God's gracious promises stand true--that the Lord will never let those who trust in Him be confounded and brought to shame--that He will let none of us be tempted beyond what we are able, but will always with the temptation make a way for us to escape, that {{we may be able to}} bear it. And so the peace of God which passes understanding, will keep that man's mind. And in whom? [...] "In Jesus Christ." [...] Now what did St. Paul mean by putting in the Lord Jesus Christ's name there? what is the meaning of [...] "in Jesus Christ"? This is what it means; it means what Christmas-day means. A man may say, [...] "Your sermon promises fine things, but I am miserable and poor; it promises a holy and noble rejoicing to everyone, but I am unholy and mean. It promises peace from God, and I am sure I am not at peace: I am always fretting and quarrelling; I quarrel with my wife, my children, and my neighbours, and they quarrel with me; and worst of all," [...] says the poor man, [...] "I quarrel with myself. I am full of discontented, angry, sulky, anxious, unhappy thoughts; my heart is dark and sad and restless within me--would God I were peaceful, but I am not: look in my face and see!" ...|$|E

He will want all his pluck then, and all the simplicity which he can master. You must remember that a skilful man will have been turned loose on him with all the ferocity of a bloodhound; a man who will have all the cruelty of Lax, but will have nothing to fear; a man who will be serving his purpose all round if he can only dumbfound that poor boy by his words and his looks. A man, when he has taken up the cause of these ruffians, learns to sympathise with them. If they hate the Queen, hate the laws, hate all justice, these men learn to hate them too. When they get hold of me, and I look into the eyes of such a one, I see there my bitterest enemy. He holds Captain Yorke Clayton up to the hatred of the whole court, as though he were a brute unworthy of the slightest mercy,--a venomous reptile, against whom the whole country should rise to tear him in pieces. And I look round and see the same feeling written in the eyes of them all. I found it more hard to get used to that than to the snap of a pistol; but I have got used to it. Poor Florian will have had no such experience. And there will be no mercy shown to him because he is only a boy. Neither sex nor age is supposed to render any such feeling necessary to a lawyer. A lawyer in defending the worst ruffian that ever committed a crime will know that he is called upon to spare nothing that is tender. He is absolved from all the laws common to humanity. And then poor Florian has lied." [...] A gloomy look of sad, dull pain came across the father's brow as he heard these words. [...] "We must look it in the face, Mr. Jones." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{first of}} these {{possible}} College courses, and the one {{most likely to be}} useful and fruitful for the mass of the male population in a modern community, is an expansion of the Physics of the Schooling stage. It may be very conveniently spoken of as the Natural Philosophy, course. Its backbone will be an interlocking arrangement of Mathematics, Physics, and the principles of Chemistry, and it will take up as illustrative and mind-expanding exercises, Astronomy, Geography, and Geology conceived as a general history of the Earth. Holding the whole together will be the theory of the Conservation of Energy in its countless aspects and a speculative discussion of the constitution of matter. A certain minimum of Historical and Political reading and of general [...] "Library" [...] would be insisted upon in Section ii. This could be made a quite noble and spacious course of instruction extending over from three to five years, from fourteen or fifteen up to eighteen or twenty-one (or even longer in the case of those partially employed); its less successful products would drop out--it might be before completion--to take up the work of more or less skilled artisans and technical workers, and its more successful ones would pass some of them into the technical colleges for special industries with a view to business direction, into special study for the engineering trades, for the profession of soldiering, [Footnote: I may perhaps explain that my conception of military organization is a universal service of citizens --non-professional soldiers--who will be trained--possibly in boyhood and youth, to shoot very well indeed, to ride either horses or bicycles, and to take up positions and move quickly and easily in organized bodies, and, in addition, a special graduated profession of soldiers <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> their various ranks engineers, gunners, special-force men of various sorts, and, in the higher ranks, masters of all the organization and methods necessary for the rapid and effective utilization of the non-professional manhood of the country, of volunteers, militia, or short-service enlistment levies, drawn from this general supply, and of all the machinery of communication, provisioning, and so forth. They will not be necessarily the [...] "social superiors" [...] of their commands, but they will naturally exercise the same authoritative command in warfare that a doctor does in a sick-room.] or for the naval and mercantile services, or into research and the literature of science. Some also would pass on to study for the profession of medicine through more special work in Chemistry and Physiology, and some with a proclivity for drawing and design would become architects, designers of appliances, and the like. The idea of the ordinary development of this course is not so very remote from what already exists in Great Britain as the Organized Science School, but, as with all these courses, it would be done in varying degrees of thoroughness and extension under varying conditions. This is the first of my three alternative College courses.|$|E
