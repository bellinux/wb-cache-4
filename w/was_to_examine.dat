5|$|On 10 February 1964, the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it was to use SI except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect. In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. Metric Study, the emphasis of which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the feasibility of adopting SI. The first volume was delivered in 1970. The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for {{the increased use of}} the metric measurement system in the United States. Metrication was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States Metric Board (USMB).|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three hundred years, Scotland was {{directly}} governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom, both seated at Westminster, {{and the lack of}} a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity. Suggestions for a 'devolved' Parliament were made before 1914, but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.|$|E

Security surrounding the trial was heavy: one thousand soldiers armed with submachine guns were guarding the jail's perimeter, and the roads leading to the jail were patrolled by tanks.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} fox hunting, {{including}} {{the killing of}} the quarry animal, the pursuit's strong associations with tradition and social class, and its practice for sport have made it a source of great controversy within the United Kingdom. In December 1999, the then Home Secretary, Jack Straw MP, announced the establishment of a Government inquiry (the Burns Inquiry) into hunting with dogs, to be chaired by the retired senior civil servant Lord Burns. The inquiry <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the practical aspects of different types of hunting with dogs and its impact, how any ban might be implemented and the consequences of any such ban.|$|E
25|$|Piaget {{administered}} a test in 15 boys with ages ranging from 10 to 14 {{years in which}} he asked participants to describe {{the relationship between a}} mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).|$|E
25|$|While a {{law student}} at Georgetown, Fluke was invited by Democrats to speak at a February 2012 hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on new Administration rules {{concerning}} the Conscience Clause exceptions in healthcare associated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Democrats requested that the committee add Sandra Fluke to the first panel, which was otherwise an all-male panel of clergy and theologians. Committee chairman Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman from California, refused to allow Fluke to testify at the hearing, stating that Fluke lacked expertise, was {{not a member of}} the clergy, and her name was not submitted in time for the hearing. Democratic members criticized the decision not to include Fluke because of the lack of female witnesses at the hearing, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> contraception coverage.|$|E

25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The {{purpose of this study}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as {{it is hard to know}} if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E

He stated: [...] "I was really lucky because there's a real phonetic coherence of the episode that brought them all together on an emotional level.

500|$|By August 1927, Wackett {{had been}} {{promoted}} flight lieutenant and given {{command of the}} Papuan Survey Flight formed at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Consisting of two Supermarine SeagullIII single-engined amphibious biplanes and six aircrew, the flight <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> and photograph the Papuan and New Guinean coasts {{as far north as}} Aitape and, if possible, Bougainville. Stripped of all equipment considered non-essential—including radio sets—to increase range, the aircraft departed on 27September and journeyed some , covering almost [...] of country and taking 350photos. Wackett's machine (serial A9-5) returned to Melbourne on 26December and the other (A9–6) on 19January 1928. Inclement weather prevented the expedition from reaching Bougainville, and thick jungle cover limited the usefulness of its photographic record. Nevertheless, the Air Force learned valuable lessons concerning the Seagull's capabilities in a potential wartime role, as it was found to be unsuited to operations in the tropics.|$|E

[...] The title of the series refers to the question [...] "Who watches the watchmen?", famously posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal (as [...] "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until Harlan Ellison informed him. Moore commented in 1987, [...] "In the context of Watchmen, that fits. 'They're watching out for us, who's watching out for them? The writer stated in the introduction to the Graphitti hardcover of Watchmen that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.|$|E
500|$|The general {{function}} of the Assay Commission <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the gold and silver coins of the Mint and ensure they met the proper specifications. [...] Assay commissioners were placed on one of three committees in most years: [...] the Counting, Weighing, and Assaying Committees. The Counting Committee verified {{that the number of}} each type of coin in packets selected from the pyx matched what Mint records said should be there. The Weighing Committee measured the weight of coins from the pyx, checking them against the weight required by law. The Assaying Committee worked with the Philadelphia Mint's assayer as he measured the precious metal content of some of the coins. [...] In some years there was a Committee on Resolutions—in 1912, it urged that a leaflet be published for visitors to [...] the Mint's coin collection, and that a medal be struck to commemorate the collection. The full Assay Commission adopted that committee's report.|$|E
