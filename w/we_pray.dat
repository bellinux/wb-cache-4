5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
25|$|The second {{so-called}} sura, entitled al-Hafd (haste) {{translates as}} follows: 'O Allah, we worship You and to You <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> and prostrate and to You we run and hasten to serve You. We hope for Your mercy and we fear Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers.' Obviously these two pieces constitute so-called 'qunut', i.e. supplications which Muhammad sometimes {{said in the}} morning prayer or witr prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran. They are in fact identical to some parts of qunut reported in the collections of hadith. See: Nawawi, al-adhkar, Cairo, 1955, pp.57–8.|$|E
25|$|In the evening, {{and in the}} morning, and at noonday we praise Thee, we bless Thee, we {{give thanks}} unto Thee, and <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> unto Thee, O Lord of all: Direct Thou our prayer before Thee as incense, and incline not our hearts unto words or {{thoughts}} of wickedness: but deliver us from all who seek after our souls. For unto Thee, Lord, O Lord, lift we up our eyes, and in Thee have we trusted. Put us not to shame, O our God. For unto Thee are due all glory, honour and worship, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.|$|E

25|$|I wish {{to express}} my heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E

500|$|He was {{subsequently}} promoted to captain and, on August 23, 1945, awarded the Medal of Honor. Although {{still recovering from}} his wounds, for which {{he would continue to}} receive treatment until mid-1946, he attended a ceremony at the White House where President Harry S. Truman formally presented him with the medal. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Daly received three Silver Stars, a Bronze Star with [...] "V" [...] device, and two Purple Hearts. [...] Commenting on his Medal of Honor citation in a speech at Fairfield High School sometime later, Daly said, [...] "We all lose our courage at times. It is something <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> for in the morning, that God will give us the strength and courage to do what is right." ...|$|E
500|$|James I, {{who was a}} {{confirmed}} dog-lover, also built a huge kennel (about [...] long) and dog-yard (over half an acre in size) at Royston. [...] He seems to have loved Royston and spent considerable time there, hunting and feasting and enjoying himself—so much so that his favourite dog, Jowler, returned one evening with a note tied to his collar. [...] The note read: [...] "Good Mr Jowler, <b>we</b> <b>pray</b> you {{to speak to the}} King (for he hears you every day and so he doth not us) that it will please His Majesty to go back to London, for else the country will be undone; all our provision is spent already and we are not able to entertain him longer." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} morning, 1 September, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion went on {{the offensive}} again, while a force of seven Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese headquarters around Waga Waga. By this time, the Japanese had abandoned the objective of reaching the airfields and instead sought only to hold off the Australians {{long enough to be}} evacuated. This information was not known by the Allies, however, who were in fact expecting the Japanese to undertake further offensive action. In this regard, the 2/9th, initially with orders to join the 2/12th's counterattack, was delayed an extra day after an erroneous intelligence report from MacArthur's headquarters warning Clowes of a renewed Japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture. The attack did not occur and, as a result, on 2 September the 2/9th was moved by barge up to the KB Mission. The next day it took over from the 2/12th and led the Australian advance. With the Japanese position at Milne Bay close to collapse, on 2 September Yano sent a radio message to the headquarters of the 8th Fleet which stated: [...] "e have reached the worst possible situation. We will together calmly defend our position to the death. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> for absolute victory for the empire and for long-lasting fortune in battle for you all".|$|E
5000|$|He also {{discussed}} whom <b>we</b> should <b>pray</b> to. First he said <b>we</b> should not <b>pray</b> to dead human souls, {{as we have}} no reason to think they hear our prayers or have any power to help us. Then he discussed whether <b>we</b> should <b>pray</b> to angels or not. Unlike Morgan - who thought <b>we</b> should <b>pray</b> to both God and angels - Chubb thought we probably should not pray to angels. He said even though they are “ministering spirits,” we cannot be sure they hear our prayers, and they might not be at liberty to help us without God’s direct guidance. He finally spent ten pages wondering whether <b>we</b> should <b>pray</b> to Jesus or just to God the Father. He concluded that <b>we</b> should <b>pray</b> to God the Father “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” ...|$|R

500|$|Quatermass {{emerges from}} the car park to find the stadium empty. So many have now been {{harvested}} that the particles of dust in the air have turned the sky green. Kapp attempts to repair his equipment in order to contact the alien presence, but the Planet People destroy his efforts. They try {{to persuade him to}} join them but he refuses, convinced now that his family are dead. Quatermass, aided by Gurov, who has travelled to London from Moscow, assembles a team of scientists to find a solution. He deliberately selects old people for the task as they are immune to the effects of the alien force. Quatermass decides to set a trap. He plans to fake the presence of a large gathering of Planet People at Kapp's observatory and, when the force comes, to detonate a nuclear weapon. Quatermass does not believe this will be sufficient to destroy the alien machine but he hopes that it will damage it enough to make it go away. Kapp volunteers to stay behind with Quatermass to help detonate the bomb. The pair set up the trap and wait. Suddenly, Kickalong appears with a group of Planet People, including Quatermass' granddaughter, Hettie. Kapp tries to warn them away but is shot by Kickalong. The light appears, indicating that the alien force has arrived, but the shock of seeing his granddaughter among the Planet People causes Quatermass to suffer a heart attack. However, aided by Hettie, he is able to detonate the bomb. Later, according to Gurov, [...] "The message was taken. It has not come again. <b>We</b> <b>pray</b> it will never come again".|$|E

50|$|Chubb {{was sure}} that God heard all our petitionary prayers, {{but he did not}} think God {{answered}} all of them in the way we wanted him to.

He cited evidence that God did not often answer our prayers: over the last two hundred years, millions of sincere, fervent prayers had petitioned God for the defeat of the Antichrist, but the Roman Catholic hierarchy or other interests bent on defeating God's kingdom still existed.|$|R
