5|$|In 1996, Peggy {{featured}} in a storyline about breast cancer. It {{was the first time}} that the soap had given one of its characters the illness, though the issue was covered much less substantially in 1987 as a means of promoting breast cancer screening, when Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) discovered a lump on her breast, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> out to be benign.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tree}} fort, Jake charges {{his cell phone}} and discovers footage that he filmed prior to Finn and him waking up in a jail cell in the Nightosphere; apparently, Marceline had invited Finn and Jake to party in the Nightosphere, wherein she was given a demonic amulet by Hunson, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> her into a being of pure evil.|$|E
5|$|January 4/5, 1879: At Jacksonville at 7 pm, sleet began, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> to rain 90minutes later. The {{freezing}} rain covered trees, shrubbery, {{and everything else}} outdoors by morning. The weight of the ice broke the limbs of many orange trees. At Fernandina, snow occurred.|$|E
50|$|The body of sancai {{ceramics}} {{was made}} of white clay, coated with coloured glaze, and fired at a temperature of 800 degrees Celsius. Sancai {{is a type of}} lead-glazed earthenware: lead oxide was the principal flux in the glaze, often mixed with quartz in the proportion of 3:1. The polychrome effect was obtained by using as colouring agents copper (<b>which</b> <b>turns</b> green), iron (<b>which</b> <b>turns</b> brownish yellow), and less often manganese and cobalt (<b>which</b> <b>turns</b> blue).|$|R

5|$|The 19th century saw {{considerable}} {{economic development}} <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> the small agricultural town of Chamonix into {{a base for}} tourists, with luxurious hotels and mountain lodges being built to accommodate them. A trade in selling local items to visiting foreigners soon developed. Crystals collected from across the massif were much in demand, as were locally produced goods such as horn trinkets and honey.|$|E
5|$|The appellants were Jehovah's Witnesses. On 2 July 1992, police seized {{publications}} from them, thirteen of <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> {{out to be}} publications prohibited under Order 123. The appellants {{were charged}} under Order 123 for possession of publications by the WTBTS, an offence punishable under section 4(2) of the UPA.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Taiwan and China, Rammasun began weakening due to {{an approaching}} trough, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> the typhoon northeastward. It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima and also produced strong winds in Okinawa. About 10,000houses lost power on the island, and high surf killed two sailors. On the Japanese mainland, there was light crop damage and one serious injury. After weakening to a tropical storm, Rammasun passed {{just west of the}} South Korean island of Cheju-do, killing one person from high waves. The storm crossed the country, killing three others and leaving $9.5million in damage. High rains also affected North Korea and Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East.|$|E

5|$|Around daybreak, Pike's A Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, {{reached the}} village of Katika, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> {{out to be a}} {{clearing}} with some dilapidated huts. His company came under fire from Katika Spur, the high ground to the west, which was strongly held by the 9th Company, 80th Infantry Regiment and a company of the 238th Infantry Regiment. The Japanese attempted to outflank A Company on its left, but ran into Capitan L. Snell's D Company, 2/15th Infantry Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Born in Hengoed, Caerphilly, Parslow {{started his}} career with Cardiff City's youth system in 1998. Having progressed through the club's centre of {{excellence}} he earned a three-year scholarship in May 2002, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> into a one-year professional contract on its conclusion. He made an appearance for Cardiff in a 1–0 defeat by Bangor City in the FAW Premier Cup on 25 January 2005 and {{was included in the}} first-team squad for the 2005–06 season. Parslow went on trial with League One club Swansea City in March 2006, before returning to Cardiff the following month after nothing materialised. After making no appearances he was released by Cardiff on 22 May 2006.|$|E

Some of these include a cell which generates electricity when breathed upon, a filter <b>which</b> <b>turns</b> radioactive waste into potable water, a device which extracts rhenium from scrap material, and a compound <b>which</b> <b>turns</b> light into electricity. He also {{claims to have}} discovered a method of producing silicon from fertilizer.|$|R
5|$|Despite the scare {{over his}} back complaint, Miller {{returned}} from New Zealand {{to play in}} the 1946 season, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> out to be his last season in the VFL; St Kilda's finished second-last. Miller played with more aggression than during his pre-war years and his high leaping marks were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia. Miller thus became one of the few players to play {{at the highest levels of}} both cricket and Australian rules football.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E
5|$|Governor John P. Richardson {{had been}} elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with {{opposition}} from Tillman's farmers. As {{had been done to}} Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump speaker, and when given the opportunity to debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.|$|E
25|$|The major {{variations}} of a left-arm spinner are the topspinner (<b>which</b> <b>turns</b> less and bounces {{higher in the}} cricket pitch), the arm ball (<b>which</b> does not <b>turn</b> at all, drifts into a right-handed batsman {{in the direction of}} the bowler's arm movement; also called a 'floater') and the left-arm spinner's version of a doosra (<b>which</b> <b>turns</b> the other way). The left-arm unorthodox spin like a leg break or leg spin is also a bowling action.|$|R

She {{appeared}} in the 1950 musical comedy Dance Me a Song, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> {{out to be a}} flop, though it was choreographed by Agnes de Mille, who had won acclaim for Oklahoma! a few years earlier. As one of the play's principal stars, she appeared in several scenes, but the choreography was ravaged by critics, as was the play, and reviews of her performance were mixed.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 A.R. Angus, an Australian inventor, brought two {{locomotives}} {{onto the}} lower {{section of the}} line to test and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device. The demonstration of the system took place at Kentsford on 5 July 1912, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> into something of a gala for local people, watching two hired GWR tender locos, the only tender locos to work this line, being brought safely to a halt rather than the anticipated head-on collision. Testing of this system continued intermittently until the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|In the present, Ginko, {{to escape}} a blizzard, finds a village inn. After {{revealing}} himself as a Mushishi, he is asked to help several locals suffering from hearing loss. After he helps the locals, Ginko is asked by the innkeeper {{to look at her}} granddaughter, Maho, who is deaf, has horns on her forehead, and hears strange noises. Maho's mother had the same symptoms and was cremated after her death. Maho, however, kept her mother's horns, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> out to be a disguised Mushi and the cause of her illness. Ginko heals the girl and then continues on his journey.|$|E

5|$|Kisnorbo's {{first goal}} for Leicester came on 15 October 2005 against Watford at Vicarage Road, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> {{out to be}} the match winner. His initial {{appearances}} for Leicester were as a midfielder, and at first he failed to adjust and was booed by his own fans during a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. However, a move back to defence resulted in a change in fortunes for Kisnorbo, and his partnership with then-teammate Paddy McCarthy was instrumental in helping Leicester avoid relegation to League One that season.|$|E
5|$|She and Leopold {{married in}} a {{religious}} ceremony five days before his death, though their failure to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage void under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income – all of <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> her into a multimillionaire. For years the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 in Cambo-les-Bains, France.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{sustained}} and concentrated attacks on radar left it free to help direct {{the deployment of}} RAF units at opportune moments. Its continued warnings of incoming raids were a crucial benefit to Fighter Command. The Luftwaffe also had poor intelligence {{on the type of}} RAF airfields. It made repeated errors, often misidentifying airfields as Fighter Command bases, <b>which</b> <b>turned</b> out to belong to RAF Coastal Command and RAF Bomber Command. On Adlertag, most of the targets on the Luftwaffes list—if destroyed—would not have impaired Fighter Command in the slightest.|$|E
