5000|$|Clerk's {{engine was}} made of two {{cylinders}} - one <b>working</b> <b>cylinder</b> and an additional cylinder to charge the cylinder, expelling the exhaust through a port uncovered by the piston.

50|$|The engine {{always worked}} as a water pump and was {{equipped}} with two cast iron cylinders {{at opposite ends of}} the beam, one for the <b>working</b> <b>cylinder</b> and one for the pump. The pump cylinder was taller and thinner, of 24 in diameter and 8 ft tall, designed for a working stroke 7 ft within this, although only 6 ft was used in practice. The pumped water was delivered at a head of 24 ft. The engine was later described as being of 30 hp in power.|$|E
5000|$|The Backus Water Motor Company of Newark, New Jersey was {{producing}} an early {{example of a}} split cycle engine {{as far back as}} 1891. The engine, of [...] "a modified A form, with the crank-shaft at the top", was water-cooled and consisted of one <b>working</b> <b>cylinder</b> and one compressing cylinder of equal size and utilized a hot-tube ignitor system.

5000|$|In this engine, {{similar in}} design to the Beare head, a [...] "piston charger" [...] replaces the valve system. The piston charger charges the main {{cylinder}} and simultaneously regulates the inlet and the outlet aperture, leading to {{no loss of}} air and fuel in the exhaust. In the main cylinder, combustion takes place every turn as in a two-stroke engine and lubrication as in a four-stroke.

50|$|In some steam engines, the {{cylinders}} {{may be of}} varying size with the smallest bore <b>cylinder</b> <b>working</b> the highest pressure steam.

Metallic scrapers are used for sub zero temperature applications, and applications where foreign materials can deposit on the rod.The bearing elements / wear bands are used to eliminate metal to metal contact.

50|$|A blowing {{engine is}} a large {{stationary}} steam engine directly coupled to air pumping cylinders. They are used to provide the air blast for blast furnaces {{and other forms of}} smelter. As the <b>working</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the driven load are both reciprocating pistons, they may be directly coupled by their piston rod. The connecting rod is only used to drive a flywheel whose inertia balances load through the cycle of the engine, not as an output shaft. These engines were some of the last new return connecting rod designs to be built.|$|E
50|$|Indicated {{horsepower}} (ihp) is {{the theoretical}} {{power of a}} reciprocating engine if it is completely frictionless in converting the expanding gas energy (piston pressure × displacement) in the cylinders. It is calculated from the pressures developed in the cylinders, measured by a device called an engine indicator - hence indicated horsepower. As the piston advances throughout its stroke, the pressure against the piston generally decreases, and the indicator device usually generates a graph of pressure vs stroke within the <b>working</b> <b>cylinder.</b> From this graph {{the amount of work}} performed during the piston stroke may be calculated.|$|E
50|$|Design of {{the flat}} {{double-acting}} Stirling engine solves the drive of a displacer {{with the help of}} the fact that areas of the hot and cold pistons of the displacer are different.The drive does so without any mechanical transmission.Using diaphragms eliminates friction and need for lubricants.When the displacer is in motion, the generator holds the working piston in the limit position, which brings the engine working cycle close to an ideal Stirling cycle.The ratio of the area of the heat exchangers to the volume of the machine increases by the implementation of a flat design.Flat design of the <b>working</b> <b>cylinder</b> approximates thermal process of the expansion and compression closer to the isothermal one.The disadvantage is a large area of the thermal insulation between the hot and cold space.|$|E

40|$|A {{process for}} the {{consolidation}} and containment of solid or semisolid hazardous waste, which process comprises closing an end of a circular hollow cylinder, filling the cylinder with the hazardous waste, and then cold <b>working</b> the <b>cylinder</b> to reduce its diameter while simultaneously compacting the waste. The open end of the cylinder can be sealed prior to or after the cold working process. The preferred method of cold working is to draw the sealed cylinder containing the hazardous waste through a plurality of dies to simultaneously reduce {{the diameter of the}} tube while compacting the waste. This process provides a quick continuous process for consolidating hazardous waste, including radioactive waste...|$|R
50|$|The {{action was}} gas-operated, with the piston <b>working</b> in a <b>cylinder</b> beneath and {{integral}} with the barrel. The Johnston {{did not use}} the Lewis's prominent clock spring. Cocking of the piece was unusual, the entire pistol grip sliding forwards to engage the action, then returning backwards to cock it. This was first unlocked by a trigger-like mechanism in a cutout through the grip, behind the firing trigger.|$|R
5000|$|Uniflow engines {{potentially}} allow greater {{expansion in}} a single cylinder without the relatively cool exhaust steam flowing across the hot end of the <b>working</b> <b>cylinder</b> and steam ports of a conventional [...] "counterflow" [...] steam engine during the exhaust stroke. This condition allows higher thermal efficiency. The exhaust ports are only open for {{a small fraction of}} the piston stroke, with the exhaust ports closed just after the piston begins traveling toward the admission end of the cylinder. The steam remaining within the cylinder after the exhaust ports are closed is trapped, and this trapped steam is compressed by the returning piston. This is thermodynamically desirable as it preheats the hot end of the cylinder before the admission of steam. However, the risk of excessive compression often results in small auxiliary exhaust ports being included at the cylinder heads. Such a design is called a semi-uniflow engine.|$|E
50|$|Another {{attraction}} {{was their}} safety. A steam engine, with its exposed fire and hot boiler, steam pipes and <b>working</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{could not be}} used in flammable conditions, such as munitions factories or fuel refineries. Hot-bulb engines also produced cleaner exhaust fumes. A big danger with the steam engine was that if the boiler pressure grew too high and the safety valve failed, a highly dangerous explosion could occur, although this was a relatively rare occurrence by the time the hot-bulb engine was invented. A more common problem was that if the water level in the boiler of a steam engine dropped too low, the lead plug in the crown of the furnace would melt, extinguishing the fire. If a hot-bulb engine ran out of fuel, it would simply stop and could be immediately restarted with more fuel. The water cooling was usually closed-circuit, so no water loss would occur unless there was a leak. If the cooling water ran low, the engine would seize through overheating — a major problem, but it carried no danger of explosion.|$|E
50|$|The first {{practical}} {{examples of}} these engines were installed in 1742 at Coalbrookdale and as improvements to the Carron Ironworks on the Clyde in 1765. Richard Ford at Coalbrookdale first tried using horse pumps in 1735. The first engines were atmospheric beam engines to either Newcomen, Smeaton or Watt's systems. A cylinder was provided {{on opposite sides of}} the beam, one as the <b>working</b> <b>cylinder</b> supplied with steam and the other as the pumping cylinder. The engines were single-acting, the power stroke being downwards at the power cylinder, and the pump being a simple upward-acting bucket pump. The Watt engines were of Watt's early single-acting atmospheric designs. By the time of his later thermodynamic improvements, he had also developed his sun and planet gear and could offer engines that rotated directly. A large single-acting engine, Resolution, was built at Coalbrookdale and by the time it was delivered in 1782, it had already been obsoleted by these further developments. Despite this, the engine worked successfully for almost forty years.|$|E
