'Participants' (who would account for their emissions) were to be few, and high in the production chain of each sector. Their compliance obligation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> surrender one New Zealand unit (NZU) or one internationally tradable Kyoto-compliant unit for each tonne of emissions.|$|E
5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcements}} {{concerning the}} three titles, Operation Rainfall {{came into existence}} {{in an effort to}} persuade Nintendo to bring the titles to North America. Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story were chosen for their pedigree, while Pandora's Tower was selected due to its unique mechanics {{and the fact that it}} was also published by Nintendo for the Wii. The team also decided on the titles as they were already confirmed for an English release in Europe and had received critical acclaim in Japan, so they avoided trying to push for the release of critically and commercially unsuccessful games such as Earth Seeker. The campaign's title stemmed from the group's wish to inundate Nintendo of America with requests. Beginning in June 2011 on the message boards of gaming site IGN, it was met with support from the gaming community. Its campaign was spread across letters and emails to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé, in addition to campaigns on Facebook and Twitter. Both physical and digital mediums were chosen for the campaign to make them more obvious and less able to be deleted, as a purely digital campaign <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>To</b> this end, letters and objects inspired by the titles were sent to Nintendo of America.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposal}} {{to upgrade the}} Mark II to a Mark IIA was put forward in 1974. The upgrade <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> a 100ft circular aperture {{which could have been}} used on wavelengths down to 6mm, which would have enabled it to be used as part of the high-frequency component of the original MERLIN array. It was also planned that the telescope would be used for spectral line work at millimeter wavelengths. However, the upgrade was never approved.|$|E

25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of {{trying to find out}} why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting to have taken place <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> fake his death.|$|E
25|$|One solution, which {{afterwards}} had {{the support}} of Napoleon III, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> partition Schleswig on the lines of nationality, assigning the Danish part to Denmark, the German to Holstein. This idea, which afterwards had supporters among both Danes and Germans, proved impracticable at the time owing to the intractable temper of the majority on both sides. This solution was subsequently implemented by plebiscites in 1920 as a condition of the treaty of Versailles, and Northern Schleswig was returned to Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Phase Two {{was meant}} to be {{undertaken}} in Baltimore. Malvo described how this phase was close to being implemented, but never was carried out.

Then, at the officer's funeral, they were to detonate several improvised explosive devices complete with shrapnel. These explosives were intended to kill a large number of officers attending the funeral.|$|E

25|$|Another anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes, has criticised both {{of these}} theories. On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that {{the quickest way to}} get more male warriors <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory she points out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.|$|E

The other possibility <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> call for early elections immediately.

25|$|The Vilsack Energy Security Agenda {{set out a}} {{strategy}} to dramatically reduce U.S. reliance on foreign energy and to cut the United States' carbon emissions. It also called for replacing the Department of Energy with a new Department of Energy Security, to oversee and redefine the federal government’s role in energy policy. The reorganized department would have acted as an institutional advocate for innovation in energy policy, and was intended to ensure accountability as the nation works towards achieving its energy security goals.
