5|$|As {{with the}} Mackensens, the three ships of the Ersatz Yorck class were never completed.

The lead ship, Ersatz Yorck, was the only vessel of the three to have construction begin, though she was over two years from completion by the time work was abandoned. With the hull incomplete, the ship could not be launched and towed to ship-breakers; as a result, Ersatz Yorck was broken up in situ.|$|E
