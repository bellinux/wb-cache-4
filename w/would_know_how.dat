5|$|For voice casting, the {{localization}} {{team was}} sent {{a list of}} people who might fit the roles, along with short reels for each actor. Once the actors had been chosen, Bateman wrote the voice direction, which consisted of short blurbs the voice actors saw next to the line they were supposed to say, so they <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to perform it. While the North American version of the game allows the user to select either Japanese or English audio tracks, the European version, which was released by Rising Star Games, only features the Japanese audio track.|$|E
25|$|Research out of {{hypervelocity}} railgun {{technology was}} done to build an information base about railguns so that SDI planners <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to apply the technology to the proposed defense system. The SDI railgun investigation, called the Compact High Energy Capacitor Module Advanced Technology Experiment, {{had been able to}} fire two projectiles per day during the initiative. This represented a significant improvement over previous efforts, which were only able to achieve about one shot per month. Hypervelocity railguns are, at least conceptually, an attractive alternative to a space-based defense system because of their envisioned ability to quickly shoot at many targets. Also, since only the projectile leaves the gun, a railgun system can potentially fire many times before needing to be resupplied.|$|E

She cooked his killer's food {{while he was in}} prison to ensure that the condemned man did not starve before his hanging. One of Mary's grandchildren noted that she was very serious; Graves once said, [...] "I wish I could cry but I cannot. If I could forget the tragedy, perhaps I <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to cry again." [...] Mary's brother William did not settle down for any significant time.|$|E

500|$|Later in 1948, six {{courses were}} led {{by members of the}} {{national}} BSA staff, with one at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation and another at Philmont Scout Ranch. Scouters were enthusiastic about the new course. [...] "Perhaps the finest experience we have had in 35 years of Scouting was attending the Wood Badge course in New Mexico... Any man who lived nine days in a Gilwell Troop <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> a troop is operated." [...] The new Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of America, Arthur A. Schuck, was a training enthusiast. He felt Wood Badge would be a great opportunity to train selected men who could return to their local councils and train others. Schuck was so enthusiastic about the Wood Badge course that he was responsible for sending invitations using his signature from his office to every participant.|$|E
500|$|When he {{graduated}} from Alabama, Hutson did not plan on playing professionally, since the NFL was not highly regarded in the South compared to college football. But Green Bay Packers head coach Curly Lambeau saw Hutson as the perfect receiver for his passing attack, {{which at the time}} was headed by quarterback Arnie Herber and end John [...] "Blood" [...] McNally. Before the draft existed, college players could sign with any team they wanted, and while Hutson did sign a contract with Green Bay, he had also signed a contract with the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers. Both contracts came to the NFL office at the same time, and NFL president Joseph Carr declared that Hutson would go to Green Bay, as the Green Bay contract had an earlier date of signing. Hutson later stated he chose the Packers because they offered the most moneyâ€”$300 a game. [...] "That was far and above what they had ever paid a player," [...] said Hutson. [...] "Each week they'd give me a check for $150 from one bank and $150 from another so nobody <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much I was getting paid." ...|$|E
500|$|SEAL Team 10's quick-reaction force (QRF) commander. Bana {{had read}} the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing {{to appear in the}} film, {{regardless}} of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors that make this story special, and they are the reasons why I jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to portray SEAL teammates. That was what I {{wanted to be a part}} of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time." [...] Bana did not physically prepare for the role. [...] "My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved", he explained. [...] "It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely. There's no purpose in me going out and firing an M4 in this case." ...|$|E

[...] Following a protest march, the Cuban government erected a large number of poles, carrying black flags with single white stars, obscuring the messages. In June 2006, Granma International referred to the billboard as [...] "the systematic launching of the crudest insults of our people via the electronic billboard, which, in violation of the most elemental regulations of international law, they think they can maintain with impunity on the facade of that imperial lair." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nuttall and Barba theorized {{from their}} own {{experience}} about how an LAPD officer would commit a murder. It {{would be better to}} do it on a day off, and departmental records showed that Lazarus had indeed been off the day Sherri Rasmussen was killed. An officer would know better than to use his or her duty gun, since {{it would have to be}} disposed of after the crime and the penalties for losing a duty gun or failing to prevent its theft were severe. Instead it made sense to use a backup gun like Lazarus' [...]38. Lastly, a working patrol officer <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to do just enough to make the crime scene look like an interrupted burglary to satisfy an overworked detective.|$|E
2500|$|After badmouthing Wu-Tang at a concert, Bad Boy {{recording}} artist Mase had a run-in with Ghostface {{and his entourage}} at a club in New York City. There {{was some sort of}} physical altercation between Mase's and Ghostface's camps, and Mase left the incident with a broken jaw. Kanye West is among several rappers who have made reference to the incident, rapping [...] "...if you could feel how my face felt/ You <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> Mase felt..." [...] on his single [...] "Through the Wire". Shyheim also referred to the incident in a freestyle, with the line [...] "The Empire State, where Ghostface retired Mase". In the June 2007 issue of Hip Hop Connection magazine, Wu-Tang affiliate Cilvaringz stated that Ghostface had in fact done time in jail for [...] "beating up" [...] Mase.|$|E

You are going to hate me as much tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> we would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee.
