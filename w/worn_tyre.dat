Additionally, one of Pommer's front wheels was danging off its {{suspension}} rod and Fuoco appeared to have sustained bodywork damage. Merhi was forced to switch to a <b>worn</b> <b>tyre</b> as he sustained a puncture by running over carbonfibre shrapnel. Since the track was blocked with multiple cars stranded, the race was red-flagged to a halt. Several cars were repaired by their teams to enable their drivers to continue racing. The cars of Ocon, Blomqvist, Cao, Goddard and Kanamaru were too heavily damaged and were forced to retire. Seventy minutes later, the Grand Prix restarted behind the safety car. Fuoco chose to drive into the pit lane since his team repaired his car until the last minute before the restart. The safety car was withdrawn after two laps and racing resumed with Rosenqvist leading teammate Auer. Auer slipstreamed onto the back of Rosenqvist and passed him on the run down to Lisboa corner for the lead. However Auer again out-braked himself and ran deep at the turn. Cassidy took advantage of his error to claim third. On the same lap, King lost sixth place to Coletti while Wells overtook Cheng for 15th and Verstappen moved past Buller.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tyre</b> <b>wear</b> is {{a complex}} phenomenon. It depends non-linearly on {{numerous}} parameters, like tyre compound and design, vehicle type and usage, road conditions and road surface characteristics, environmental conditions (e. g., temperature) and many others. Yet, <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> has many economic and ecological implications. The possibility to predict <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> is therefore of major importance to tyre manufacturers, fleet owners and governments. Analogous observations {{can be made for}} road wear prediction due to the high road maintenance costs and traffic safety implications. <b>Tyre</b> and road <b>wear</b> are strongly related; the energy that wears the road is the energy that <b>wears</b> the <b>tyre.</b> There is therefore much to gain from an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms behind both wear phenomena. Based on these observations, in 2000 we started the three-year 5 th framework EU project TROWS (<b>Tyre</b> and ROad <b>Wear</b> and Slip assessment). The results include tools to analyse <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> and road polishing. These will be combined in a suitable wear prediction environment. This paper focuses on the followed methods and results sofar of TROWS for truck <b>tyre</b> <b>wear.</b> Several types of tests were performed to obtain insight in the mechanisms behind the truck <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> phenomenon. These include material tests on tyre compounds, carousel tests with truck tyres, and tests with an articulated MAN truck on a public road course in Italy. Truck <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> mechanisms are presented and explained in relation to results from the performed <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> tests. Some modelling activities are discussed, as well as the wear prediction environment (Prolinx) that was developed to integrate the vast amount of test and modelling results from partners working at different locations with different tools. The relation between <b>tyre</b> and road <b>wear</b> is briefly touched upon. A discussion on the remaining challenges in predicting <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> concludes this paper...|$|R

40|$|Studying rubber wear is {{important}} because it can save money, minimize health and environmental issues related to the particles generated from <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> and reduce fuel consumption. The wear of rubber is considered {{to be the result of}} energy dissipation due to friction. There are many models that describe the dynamical behaviour of vehicles and tyre, but less e ort has been dedicated to consider the <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> in these models. The purpose of the thesis was to create an easy to understand and trend-accurate <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> model for implementation in a complete car model. The <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> in the thesis is determined to be the amount of rubber volume loss due to sliding per unit length that the tyre travels. A literature study was performed with the objective of gaining knowledge of tyre models and the a ecting parameters of <b>tyre</b> <b>wear.</b> The most important parameters in determining <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> were identied as the forward velocity, side-slip angle, longitudinal slip, vertical load, and tyre ination pressure. The wear was chosen to be calculated with Archards wear law for these parameters both separately and combined in pairs in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the wear. The results show that wear is increasing exponentially for the forward velocity. <b>Tyre</b> <b>wear</b> decreases linearly as tyre ination pressure (vertical bristle sti ness) increases. The vertical load, longitudinal slip and side-slip angle yielded exponentially increasing wear. The most inuential parameters a ecting the <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> were the longitudinal slip and side-slip angle, these yielded wear rates up to 107 higher compared with the reference case. The developed <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> model is a good base for future work. More measurement data are needed in order to validate the model. For future work it is also recommended to implement camber angle and temperature dependency in order to study these two important parameters inuence on <b>tyre</b> <b>wear...</b>|$|R

The aim of the project is to acquire knowledge related to <b>tyre</b> <b>wear,</b> its environmentalimpacts, use a mathematical model to simulate <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> and study how the differentparameters influences wear. First a literature survey was performed to acquire knowledge related to <b>tyre</b> <b>wear.</b> It wasfound that <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> is mainly due to adhesive and hysteresis wear. Several factors werefound to affect <b>tyre</b> <b>wear</b> for example velocity, slip angle and the type of road surface.
