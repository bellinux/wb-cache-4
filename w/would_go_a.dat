5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|While the Ordainers {{were at work}} {{drafting}} their reform document, Edward {{decided to}} address {{one of the main}} causes behind the discontent: the Scottish situation. Edward II had, almost immediately after his accession, abandoned the relentless Scottish campaigns of his father. As a result, Robert the Bruce had been able to regain the initiative in the war, reconquer lost territory, and stage destructive raids into the north of England. To aggravate matters, Edward had continued to raise extortionate taxes, ostensibly for the war in Scotland, but without showing any result. If the King could produce victory against the Scots, this <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> long way towards undermining the work of the Ordainers. In June, the King summoned the magnates for a military campaign, but most of the Ordainers refused {{on the basis of the}} work they were performing. When the King departed for Scotland in September, only Gloucester, Warenne and Gaveston among the earls accompanied him. The campaign proved frustrating for Edward, when Bruce refused to engage in open battle, or even get involved in negotiations. In February, Gaveston was sent with an army north from Roxburgh to Perth, but he failed to track down the Scottish army.|$|E
25|$|At Texas, Earnhardt ran {{near the}} front until lap 187, when his battery {{alternator}} quit {{and he ended up}} finishing 29th. At Kansas, he ran {{near the front}} until a debris caution happened while he, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., and Carl Edwards were all on pit road. Earnhardt <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> lap down, take the wave-around, and finish 16th. At Richmond, he finished 10th. At Talladega, he went a lap down early after some banging with Joe Nemechek. However, with a caution for a crash on lap 43, Earnhardt got the free pass {{to get back on the}} lead lap. He made his way back up through the field to the Top 5, but slipped back to 17th at the end.|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Bart the General" [...] finished 31st {{place in the}} weekly ratings for the week of January 29 - February 4, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 14.3. It was the highest rated show on the Fox Network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "Some good lines and setpieces aside - we love Bart's fantasy of death at Nelson's hands - this episode nevertheless feels a bit unsure of itself, particularly towards the end." [...] In a DVD review of the first season David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5 and adds [...] "Another episode that helped to propel Bart's popularity into the stratosphere ...". Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode [...] "remains a primitive example of The Simpsons, but it’s a reasonably amusing and entertaining experience." [...] and added that the episode [...] "lacks the subtlety and cleverness found on later episodes, but it was onto something." [...] Matt Groening notes on the commentary track that he finds it strange how controversial this episode seemed {{at the time of}} its release. Today, they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> lot further and to him this episode now seems harmless. The episode's reference to Full Metal Jacket was named the eleventh greatest film reference in the history of the show by Nathan Ditum of Total Film.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 August 2009, Megrahi {{withdrew his}} appeal. South of Scotland SNP MSP Christine Grahame said, [...] "There {{are a number}} of vested {{interests}} who have been deeply opposed to this appeal continuing as they know it <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> considerable way towards exposing the truth behind Lockerbie... In the next days, weeks and months new information will be placed in the public domain that will make it clear that Mr Megrahi {{had nothing to do with}} the bombing of Pan Am 103." [...] Tam Dalyell, the former Labour MP for West Lothian, has long believed Megrahi was the victim of a catastrophic miscarriage of justice, and has publicly stated that Megrahi is merely a scapegoat. Dalyell was supported by Nelson Mandela, the Church of Scotland, the Catholic Church, the law faculties of the Scottish universities, the representatives of British relatives and the UN's official observer at the trial in The Hague.|$|E
