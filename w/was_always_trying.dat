25|$|Series 8 and 9 {{featured}} Bodger and Badger {{running a}} Bed & Breakfast {{hotel in the}} fictional seaside town of Puddleford (location filming for series 8 and 9 took place around Brighton). Various guests stayed at the hotel {{over the course of}} the two series and again Bodger kept Badger's presence a secret from all of them. Guests included two Spanish flamenco dancers, Miss Peake (a bad-tempered school teacher), Mr Tucknott (a dim-witted bank manager), the bubbly Mrs Bobbins, Miss Piper (a mad old woman) and Mr Wilson (a pathetic trainee bank manager). In Series 8 the characters of Millie the Milkwoman and China the dog were introduced, who featured in the show until the very end. Millie was friends with Bodger and knew about Badger, as he was friends with her dog, China. Series 8 also featured the return of Mr Smart, as he ran the B next door to Bodger's. Smart never seemed to have any guests staying at his hotel and <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>trying</b> to steal Bodger's. This was the first series to utilise the 1997 BBC logo and the last series to use the pink background for its title card and end credits.|$|E
500|$|... "Burn Black" [...] and [...] "Dicknail" [...] also feature {{aggressive}} {{language and}} themes alluding to child molestation and incest. [...] "Beautiful Son", written and recorded in 1992, features a more mellow guitar riff, and its lyrics make references to crossdressing. Love said the songwriting process {{on the track}} {{was an attempt to}} [...] "be a little dumber. I <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>trying</b> to write a very complex song without ever having learned to write an easy Beatles song," [...] noted in a 1994 interview. [...] "It just had a riff. It wasn't super smart but it sounded good and that's when I started learning things don't have to have lots and lots of notes. That the best songs are carried by simple lines and simple melodies." [...] This illustrates the band's turning point from their noise rock beginnings to more mellow, accessible sounds.|$|E
500|$|Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the film's soundtrack album. It was {{released}} by Varèse Sarabande on October 12, 2010. The score was composed by Michael Giacchino. Giacchino stated that scoring the film was a difficult [...] "balancing act" [...] for some scenes. He mentioned, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>trying</b> to say, 'let's take music out!' and Matt [...] was like, 'no, put it in!'" [...] In composing the score, he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed. Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said, [...] "…it was tricky finding the right balance of, well, should this be scary? Or should this be sentimental? Or should it be emotional? Or should it be this? It was a weird balance because you're dealing with a dynamic that is quite questionable {{as far as what}} everyone's intentions are in the film.|$|E

500|$|Spencer Stone {{was born}} in 1992 in Sacramento, California, United States to Brian Stone and Joyce Eskel. He has an older brother named Everett, a California Highway Patrolman in Redwood City, California, and younger sister named Kelly. Growing up in Carmichael, California, Stone met his now-best friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler while {{attending}} Freedom Christian School in Fair Oaks, California, continuing their friendship into adulthood. All three men are described as sharing [...] "a deeply religious background and a belief in service to their community" [...] His mom stated {{that he wanted to}} become a soldier, watching countless Navy Seal videos with him. Stone later attended Del Campo High School where he played football, lacrosse, and other contact sports. Del Campo High School teacher and basketball coach Dave Nobis, remembers Stone as he played basketball in junior year through to senior year when he was also in Nobis' psychology class. Nobis said that Stone was always looking out for family and friends, [...] ""His blue-collar attitude and how he cared about others, he would have been the one to step up rather than curl into a ball." [...] and that [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>trying</b> to pick up his teammates, giving them a high five. After he graduated, he sent me a link to a motivational speech to use in my psychology class," ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Connery was {{the first}} actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, {{he had come to}} the {{attention}} of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s. At a muscular 6'2", Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond, believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role. Producer Albert R. Broccoli—known to all as Cubby—disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that [...] "I wanted a ballsy guy... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job". Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, [...] "He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>trying</b> to display". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E
500|$|As Charles <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>trying</b> to find {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms, the episode had {{a scene in}} which Jerry dreams he is interrogated by the FBI for his illegal cable hookup, and is killed when he tries to escape. Charles recalled the dream sequence as [...] "one of the most ambiguous scenes we did [...] " [...] and felt it was very Tarantino-like. At the end of the dream Kramer holds Jerry in his arm, stating [...] "what have you done to my little cable boy?"; this scene had to be filmed multiple times, as it was hard for Seinfeld not to laugh when Richards stated the line. In audio commentary he recorded for the Seinfeld: Volume 1 DVD set, Charles noted how he established three of the episode's four storylines in one scene, in which the characters eat and talk at Monk's Cafe. [...] "The Baby Shower" [...] also {{is one of the few}} episodes of season two in which the primary storylines of all four characters come together in the final scene. In [...] "The Busboy", which had been filmed earlier, the four storylines also intersected in the final scene, but the episode aired as the final episode of season two. Charles also felt the episode defined the Kramer character more, as it is the first episode in which Kramer speaks out against the system. In addition, the episode also establishes Elaine's interest in the Kennedys, a plot element that would return later in the season four episode [...] "The Virgin".|$|E

2500|$|On December 16, 1963, US President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was {{impressed}} by the way Graham had praised the work of his great-grandfather Rev. George Washington Baines, invited Graham to the White House to give him spiritual counseling. After this visit, Johnson frequently would call on Graham for more spiritual counseling as well as companionship. As Graham recalled to his biographer Frady, [...] "I almost used the White House as a hotel when Johnson was President. He <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>trying</b> to keep me there. He just never wanted me to leave." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Tim Burton {{directed}} a short stop-motion {{film as a}} tribute to Vincent Price called Vincent, about a young boy named Vincent Malloy who is obsessed with the grim and macabre. It is narrated by Price. [...] "Vincent Twice, Vincent Twice" [...] was a parody on Sesame Street. He was parodied in an episode of The Simpsons ("Sunday, Cruddy Sunday"). Price had his own Spitting Image puppet, who <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>trying</b> to be [...] "sinister" [...] and lure people into his ghoulish traps, only for his victims to point out all the obvious flaws. The October 2005 episode of the Channel 101 series Yacht Rock featured comedian James Adomian as Vincent Price during the recording of Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller".|$|E
