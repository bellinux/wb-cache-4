5|$|As Leighton <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be dislodged, Ferguson {{promised to}} find Gunn another club, and {{fulfilled}} his pledge when he sold him for Â£100,000 to Norwich City in October 1986.

5|$|Brewer was not {{resigned}} by the Maple Leafs {{and released}} {{as a free}} agent on July 1, 2015. He spent the entire summer training in hopes of landing an NHL job but realized by mid-August that he <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> find a team interested in his services. He has since quietly retired.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> be adequate, but other witnesses, {{including}} Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even}} a claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2007 season, the Mets {{began to}} discuss trading Humber to the Minnesota Twins {{in a package}} of {{prospects}} to acquire two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Johan Santana. Eligible to become {{a free agent after}} the 2008 season, Santana had rejected a proposed four-year, $80 million contract extension from the Twins. Assuming that he <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> resign with Minnesota, the Twins began to shop him to other MLB teams.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, Manning made {{a formal}} {{petition}} to President Obama to reduce her 35-year sentence {{to the six}} years of time she had already served. On December 10, 2016, a White House petition to commute her sentence reached the minimum 100,000 signatures required for an official response. Lawyers familiar with clemency applications stated in December 2016 that the pardon <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> happen; the request did not fit into the usual criteria.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{also met}} Stuart Cornfeld during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was {{interested}} in producing Ronnie Rocket; Cornfeld was working for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> find sufficient financing to be produced, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead. Cornfeld found four scripts he felt Lynch would be interested in, but on hearing {{the name of the}} first, the director decided his next project would be The Elephant Man.|$|E

5|$|The {{postponement}} of Barbarossa {{from the}} initially planned date of 15 May {{to the actual}} invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) occurred {{for a number of}} reasons. Most importantly, an unusually wet winter kept rivers at full flood until late spring. The full floods could have discouraged an earlier attack, even if it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have happened {{before the end of the}} Balkans Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E

5|$|As President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes {{had caused}} heated {{tensions}} within the Republican Party. Hayes had {{moved away from}} party patronage by offering government jobs to Southern Democrats instead of Northern Republicans. His actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party, such as Roscoe Conkling of New York and James G. Blaine of Maine. Hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> win in 1880, and had announced at his 1877 inauguration {{that he would not}} run for a second term. Without an incumbent president in the race, the rival factions within the Republican Party, the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E
5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> <b>to</b> contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E
