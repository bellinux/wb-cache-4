5|$|McKinsey was {{merged with}} {{accounting}} firm Scovell, Wellington & Company that same year, creating the New York-based McKinsey, Wellington & Co. and splitting off the accounting practice into Chicago-based Wellington & Company. A Wellington project {{that accounted for}} 55 percent of McKinsey, Wellington & Company's billings was about to expire and Kearney and Bower had disagreements about how to run the firm.

5|$|Sven-Göran Eriksson {{took over}} from Pearce for the 2007–08 season and, {{following}} a spending spree, Samaras was reportedly deemed surplus to requirements {{by the new}} manager. Samaras' agent Paul Koutsoliakos said that, despite interest from across Europe, his client <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the Premier League and prove his ability. Samaras was linked with a £2.5million move to Middlesbrough {{towards the end of}} the transfer window but ended up staying at City. Eriksson stated that although he was unimpressed with Samaras when he first joined, he felt the player had improved and adapted his style of play a lot during pre-season and that he now felt comfortable keeping him at the club.|$|E

5|$|Thi oversaw I Corps with a {{great deal}} of autonomy, and the other {{officers}} felt threatened, which was accentuated by Thi's alignment with Buddhist activist movements in his region, traditionally a Buddhist stronghold. The Buddhists were opposed to expansion of the Vietnam War and the American leadership viewed Thi negatively. In early 1966, feeling more confident about his hold on power, Kỳ orchestrated Thi's removal, and announced that Thi would be going to the US for medical treatment, but in reality into exile. Thi refused to go along with Kỳ's false story and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Vietnam, and this led to civil unrest in I Corps, where Thi was popular. The disquiet escalated into open rebellion by pro-Thi military units, allied to Buddhist anti-junta activists who were calling for civilian government and an end to the US-driven war expansion policy. After three months of virtual secession, Kỳ's forces quelled the dissidents, and Thi emigrated to the U.S., where he lived for the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the march, the loyalist forces faced {{problems}} such as desertions, lack of discipline, illness, food shortages, and poor navigation. The march included several river crossings, which were made difficult {{by the lack of}} bridges, swollen rivers due to rain, as well as bogged down wagons and cannons. It was particularly difficult for the VOC forces, who were unfamiliar with the terrain of the Javanese interior. Hurdt <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the Solo River valley, and to continue the campaign in the following year. Amangkurat preferred to keep marching, and his opinion prevailed. As the loyalist forces marched eastwards, the rebel forces avoided major battle, but fought in skirmishes, and continued to endanger the loyalists' foragers and stragglers. The loyalists scoured the countryside to collect food, causing panic among its inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|In the {{eleventh}} stage, the first mountain {{stage of the}} race, Gino Bartali was away together with French Jean Robic. There {{was a lot of}} crowd, and they pressed forward to see the cyclist coming. This caused Bartali to fall down during the descent of the Col d'Aspin, and this caused Robic to also fall down. Bartali got up and won the stage, but felt threatened by spectators, who punched and kicked him. One spectator had threatened Bartali with a knife. Bartali told his team manager Alfredo Binda that he was leaving the Tour de France, and that all Italian cyclists should abandon the race. Not all Italian cyclists wanted to leave: the members from the second Italian team (the Italian Cadets) and Adolfo Leoni wanted to stay. Some Italian cyclists said they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the race to help Magni defend the leading position. Magni felt bad about giving up the chance to win the Tour de France, but accepted the decision. The Tour organisation wanted to keep the Italian cyclists in the race, and among other compromises offered to give them neutral gray jerseys, so the spectators would not recognize them. None of this helped, and both Italian teams left the race. As a consequence, the fifteenth stage, that was originally scheduled to end in Italy (Sanremo), was rescheduled to end in Menton.|$|E

500|$|Producers {{scheduled}} for The Call to be filmed in Canada in June 2011 after {{they failed to}} make the cut for a California tax credit. With a low budget of $13 million, they settled on Ottawa, Ontario, where director Anderson had just finished another project. However, the California Film Commission (CFC) called back nine months later and informed them that the waiting list had been largely cleared and that they now qualified for $1.9 million in tax deduction. According to Producer Michael Helfant, they were [...] "literally days from starting to put down a deposit." [...] Berry was reportedly pleased with the news, having <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles and the CFC helped secure film locations for the project.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of filming [...] "The Five", the actors who played Watson and Griffin had not been cast yet. The {{producers}} would later cast Peter Wingfield as Watson. According to Amanda Tapping, casting Wingfield was [...] "so easy" [...] as [...] "he has this sensibility about him, much like [...] does." [...] While filming his scenes, Wingfield did not want his exoskeleton prop to be removed between takes, as he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> character. When the producers conceived Clara Griffin, the granddaughter of Nigel Griffin, {{they were looking for}} a young local actress to play the part who would look like a potential love interest to Will Zimmerman.

[...] At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Division I Championship, he helped France to a third-place finish, the first time the French under-18 team had ever won a medal in an IIHF tournament. His six points in five games were tied for eleventh overall in tournament scoring and tied for the lead on the French team.

500|$|In 1998, the Clintons' {{relationship}} {{became the}} subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a [...] "vast right-wing conspiracy", characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place. After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the marriage. The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.|$|E
500|$|In October 1946, Kimball {{and several}} other general {{authorities}} toured the Navajo Nation {{in an effort to}} improve relations between the LDS Church and the Navajo people. Kimball was dismayed at the abject poverty among the Navajo and empathized with their distrust of the US government. At that time, the average Navajo person ate no more than [...] a day, and a single dentist served the entire population of 55,000. Though the reservation of the Navajo Nation covered , only 0.01% of that area was arable. In 1947, Golden Buchanan, an LDS leader in Sevier County, Utah, heard of a 17-year-old Navajo girl working on a sugar beet farm who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> Utah and attend public school. Buchanan wrote Kimball with an idea for the children of Navajo families to live with local LDS families so that they could receive proper nutrition and educations. Kimball supported the idea and asked Buchanan if his family would be willing to take Helen John, the Navajo girl, as a foster daughter to begin the program. Buchanan's family agreed. While it took time to develop the program, that {{is referred to as the}} start of the LDS Church's Indian Placement Program, also known as the [...] "Lamanites Placement Program." [...] By 1954, the program had 68 students, and the Church had standardized some of its approach. By 1969, nearly 5,000 students were placed with LDS families throughout the Western United States and Canada.|$|E
