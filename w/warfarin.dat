5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} <b>warfarin</b> by reducing the metabolism of <b>warfarin</b> in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of <b>warfarin.</b> In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the <b>warfarin</b> effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence <b>warfarin</b> dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to <b>warfarin</b> treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of <b>warfarin.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> {{administration}} {{in the second and}} third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal <b>warfarin</b> syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with <b>warfarin</b> use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders, including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with <b>warfarin</b> poses a problem in pregnant women requiring <b>warfarin</b> for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> {{consists}} of a racemic mixture of two active enantiomers—R- and S- forms—each of which is cleared by different pathways. S-warfarin is 2-5 times more potent than the R-isomer in producing an anticoagulant response. Both the enantiomers of <b>warfarin</b> undergo CYP-mediated metabolism by many different CYPs to form 3',4',6,7,8 and 10-hydroxy <b>warfarin</b> metabolites, major being 7-OH <b>warfarin</b> formed from S-warfarin by CYP2C9 and 10-OH <b>warfarin</b> from R-warfarin by CYP3A4.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> {{interacts with}} many {{commonly}} used drugs, and the metabolism of <b>warfarin</b> varies greatly between patients. Some foods {{have also been}} reported to interact with <b>warfarin.</b> Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace <b>warfarin</b> from serum albumin and cause {{an increase in the}} INR. This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with <b>warfarin</b> (e.g. simvastatin), INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with <b>warfarin</b> is <b>warfarin</b> necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that <b>warfarin</b> inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since <b>warfarin</b> initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on <b>warfarin</b> are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
5|$|Excessive use {{of alcohol}} is also known to affect the {{metabolism}} of <b>warfarin</b> and can elevate the INR and thus {{increase the risk of}} bleeding. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product insert on <b>warfarin</b> states that alcohol should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} need rapid {{reversal}} of <b>warfarin</b> such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of <b>warfarin</b> can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse <b>warfarin</b> overdose when vitamin K could work alone. PCC {{has been found to}} be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, <b>warfarin,</b> should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of <b>warfarin</b> necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. <b>Warfarin</b> necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving <b>warfarin</b> or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving <b>warfarin</b> at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of <b>warfarin</b> is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, other {{coumarins}} {{are used}} instead of <b>warfarin,</b> such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely interchangeable with <b>warfarin.</b> Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of <b>warfarin</b> without a need for monitoring, such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, have been approved {{in a number of}} countries for classical <b>warfarin</b> uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation, and others in the same drug classes are under development. There is a reversal agent available for dabigatran (idarucizumab) but not for apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} posited that Lavrenty Beria, Nikita Khrushchev and others conspired to use <b>warfarin</b> to poison Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. <b>Warfarin</b> is {{tasteless}} and colourless, and produces symptoms {{similar to those}} that Stalin exhibited.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to <b>warfarin</b> in the {{workplace}} by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin absorption, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for <b>warfarin</b> exposure in the workplace as 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 100mg/m3, <b>warfarin</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|The {{common side}} effect is bleeding. Less common side effects may include areas of tissue damage and purple toes syndrome. Use is not {{generally}} recommended during pregnancy. It {{is recommended that}} the effects of <b>warfarin</b> typically be monitored by checking prothrombin time (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with <b>warfarin,</b> either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of <b>warfarin</b> may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effect}} of <b>warfarin</b> use is {{bleeding}}. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). Many drug interactions can increase the effect of <b>warfarin,</b> also causing an overdose.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> {{activity}} is determined partially by genetic factors. Polymorphisms in two genes (VKORC1 and CYP2C9) play a particularly {{large role in}} response to <b>warfarin.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for <b>warfarin</b> use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). <b>Warfarin</b> is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from <b>warfarin</b> (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> is {{contraindicated}} in pregnancy, as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; <b>warfarin</b> use during pregnancy is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as <b>warfarin)</b> are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to <b>warfarin</b> in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> {{is used to}} cull {{vampire bat}} populations in areas where human-wildlife {{conflict}} is a concern. Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated {{with a combination of}} petroleum jelly and <b>warfarin.</b> The bat returns to its roost {{and other members of the}} roost become poisoned as well by ingesting the <b>warfarin</b> after reciprocal grooming. Suspected vampire bat roosts may also be coated in the <b>warfarin</b> solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce rabies transmission is questionable, however; a study in Peru showed that culling programs did not lead to lower transmission rates of rabies to livestock and humans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> {{should not}} be given to people with heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} until platelet count has improved or normalised. <b>Warfarin</b> is usually best avoided in people with protein C or protein S deficiency as these thrombophilic conditions {{increase the risk of}} skin necrosis, which is a rare but serious side effect associated with <b>warfarin.</b>|$|E
5|$|When <b>warfarin</b> is newly started, it may promote clot {{formation}} temporarily. This {{is because}} the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity. <b>Warfarin</b> causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead {{to a reduction in}} activity of protein C (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Although loading doses of <b>warfarin</b> over 5mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII, resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when <b>warfarin</b> is loaded rapidly at greater than 5mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer heparin, an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with <b>warfarin</b> therapy for four to five days, in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of <b>warfarin</b> has been achieved.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{retrospective}} study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that <b>warfarin</b> use {{for more than}} one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by <b>warfarin</b> of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E
5|$|After an {{incident}} in 1951, where a US Army inductee attempted suicide with multiple doses of <b>warfarin</b> in rodenticide but recovered fully after presenting to a hospital and being treated with vitamin K (by then known as a specific antidote), studies began {{in the use of}} <b>warfarin</b> as a therapeutic anticoagulant. It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of <b>warfarin</b> was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{reports that}} <b>warfarin</b> could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a link between <b>warfarin</b> use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking <b>warfarin</b> for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E
5|$|Details on {{reversing}} <b>warfarin</b> {{are provided}} in clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians. For people with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0, a small dose (about 1000 mcg = one milligram) of oral vitamin K is sufficient. When <b>warfarin</b> is being given and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). <b>Warfarin</b> treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
5|$|When <b>warfarin</b> (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a {{constellation}} of birth defects known variously as fetal <b>warfarin</b> syndrome (FWS), <b>warfarin</b> embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E
5|$|X-ray crystallographic {{studies of}} <b>warfarin</b> {{show that it}} exists in {{tautomeric}} form, as the cyclic hemiketal, which is formed from the 4-hydroxycoumarin and the ketone in the 3-position substituent. However, the existence of many 4-hydroxycoumadin anticoagulants (for example phenprocoumon) that possess no ketone group in the 3-substituent to form such a structure, suggests that the hemiketal must tautomerise to the 4-hydroxy form in order for <b>warfarin</b> to be active.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using <b>warfarin</b> and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically <b>Warfarin</b> or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when <b>warfarin</b> is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|It is {{typically}} thought {{to affect the}} big toe, but it affects {{other parts of the}} feet as well, including the bottom of the foot (plantar surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of <b>warfarin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} also implicated <b>warfarin</b> use in valvular and {{vascular}} calcification. No specific treatment is available, but some modalities are under investigation.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of action remained unknown until it was demonstrated, in 1978, that <b>warfarin</b> inhibits the enzyme epoxide reductase and hence interferes with vitamin K metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The only {{common side}} effect of <b>warfarin</b> is {{bleeding}}. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported) and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when <b>warfarin</b> is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the spinal cord. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.|$|E
5|$|VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 {{less susceptible to}} suppression by <b>warfarin.</b> There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to <b>warfarin</b> (higher proportion of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (higher proportion of group A haplotypes). Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms {{lead to a more}} rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR, but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> also {{interacts with}} many herbs and spices, some used in food (such as ginger and garlic) and others used purely for {{medicinal}} purposes (such as ginseng and Ginkgo biloba). All may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin; similar effects {{have been reported}} with borage (starflower) oil or fish oils. St. John's Wort, sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, reduces {{the effectiveness of a}} given dose of warfarin; it induces the enzymes that break down <b>warfarin</b> in the body, causing a reduced anticoagulant effect.|$|E
5|$|<b>Warfarin</b> {{first came}} into {{commercial}} use in 1948 as a rat poison. In 1954 it was approved for medical use in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Warfarin</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$1.12 to 7.20 for a typical month of treatment. In the United States it usually costs less than $25 a month.|$|E
5|$|When {{taken with}} NSAIDS (non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} medications), <b>warfarin</b> {{increases the risk}} for gastrointestinal bleeding. This increased risk {{is due to the}} anti-platelet effect of NSAIDS as well as the possible damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during <b>warfarin</b> treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E
