5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E
25|$|When the Indian Cricket Team {{toured the}} West Indies in 1976, Clive Lloyd tested his new plan of attack, relentlessly getting his fast bowlers such as Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, and Colin Croft to bowl short-pitched or bouncers to Indian batsman. While playing at Kingston, Jamaica the Indian team {{declared}} on a second-innings lead of 12, after the management {{decided that they}} <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> risk sending their bowlers such as Bishen Singh Bedi to face the fearsome fast bowling.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some games}} such as Second Life, in-game {{currency}} is not freely convertible with real world currency. Players may only buy specific in-game items (such as the Pilot License Extension (PLEX), a token worth 30 days of game time) from CCP with real-world currency. The player can then sell {{the items on}} the in-game market for ISK (game currency). The reverse process, selling in-game currency or items for real-world money, is prohibited. The developers' reasoning for this policy, as related by a CCP representative at Fanfest 2010, is that free interchange of currency causes in-game banking to fall under the same regulatory domain as real-world banking. CCP <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> place this restriction on in-game behavior, due both to the difficulty of regulatory enforcement and the desire to allow players to create illegitimate in-game banks or Ponzi schemes if they wish to do so.|$|E

While Winslet and Stuart stated their belief that, instead of being asleep in her bed, the character dies {{at the end of}} the film, Cameron said that he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> reveal what he intended with the ending because [...] "he answer has to be something you supply personally; individually." ...|$|E
500|$|But this wider aim proved {{impossible}} to achieve: {{the government was}} circumspect as rehabilitating the Waffen-SS would have {{opened the door to}} claims by personnel of other SS and Nazi organisations, including SA, SD, Hitler Youth, and others—a prospect the federal government <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> have raised either domestically or internationally. The public image of the organisation was not helping either, because some of the more outspoken HIAG members sounded [...] "alarmingly Nazi in their pronouncements", according to Large.|$|E
500|$|Chapter 27 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} films of the 2000s. In April 2006, an on-line petition group calling themselves Boycottchapter27.org campaigned to [...] "pressurise [...] movie theatres not to show the film, to stop the glorification of a murderer." [...] Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, expressed her thought saying, [...] "This is another thing which will hurt me, I'm sure. I <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> make a story out of Mr. Chapman at all, although I sympathize with the actors. They need to work.

500|$|During {{his trial}} at Coventry Crown Court, Hughes {{was accused of}} driving too fast in wet {{conditions}} and was described as driving [...] "like a madman". He claimed the brakes on his car had locked, though tests showed that the brakes were in perfect working order and had technology installed to prevent the driver from losing control. When asked {{where he had been}} in the 36 hours after leaving the scene of the incident Hughes said that [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> say, really", though later admitted he had travelled 20 miles to Smethwick. Prosecutor Melbourne Inman QC told the court Hughes had fled the scene to dodge a breath test. On 9 August 2004, Hughes was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving, and was sentenced to six years imprisonment. Frisby said that the sentence was not long enough. Hughes lodged an appeal against the sentence, but not the conviction. In January 2005, his appeal for his sentence to be reduced was refused.|$|E
500|$|On graduation, Ching-teng enrolls at the National Chiao Tung University. Chia-Yi, {{who did not}} do well on the {{admission}} exam because she was ill on that day, only manages to enter the National Taipei University of Education with her mediocre test results. Depressed and upset, she is consoled by Ching-teng, who calls her long-distance almost every night from the university. During the winter holiday season that year, the two go on their first [...] "date", during which Ching-teng asks Chia-yi if she loves him. However, fearing she would say no, he decides that he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> hear her answer (it is revealed later that her reply would have been [...] "yes"). Ching-teng later organizes a fight night and invites Chia-yi to watch, hoping to impress her with his [...] "strength". On the contrary, Chia-yi finds it childish for Ching-teng to injure himself for no reason. This upsets Ching-teng, sparking a quarrel that causes the two to break up.|$|E
500|$|Century Falls is conceptually much {{darker than}} its {{predecessor}} Dark Season and his later work, which Davies attributed to a trend that inexperienced writers [...] "get off on the dark stuff": in a BAFTA interview with Davies, Home recalled that she [...] "very nearly got into trouble because it did actually push at the boundaries which some of the powers-that-be <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> have been pushed"; and a Daily Mail review of the series considered the show's themes of arson, black magic, and communal fear as being [...] "on a scale normally reserved for peak-time adult viewing". The series offered a sense of realism in its protagonist, who is not heroic and aspirational, has poor social skills, and is bluntly described by Ben as a [...] "fat girl", a practice that the Daily Mail praised as [...] "something that defies the Thought Police". Century Falls was the last script he wrote for the BBC's children's department for fourteen years. He had begun to formulate another successor: The Heat of the Sun, a series set over Christmas 1999 and New Year's Day 2000 that would have included the concepts of psychic powers and world domination.|$|E

500|$|In March 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Disney had greenlit the third film with Hedlund reprising his role as Sam and Kosinski returning to direct the sequel. Wilde {{was revealed}} in April to be returning as Quorra. Filming was expected to start in Vancouver in October 2015. However, in May 2015, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Walt Disney Studios had chosen not to continue with a third installment, which was confirmed by Wilde the following month. In the end of July, Boxleitner stated he frequently heard about the pre-production of Tron 3 while shooting Cedar Cove in Vancouver, and was disappointed to hear about the cancellation. While expressing the opinion that Disney decided to [...] "play it safe" [...] and explore other properties, Boxleitner said that this broke his interest in continuing with the franchise, as [...] "it's been too up and down for me. I <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> just keep going. I don’t want to repeat my career anymore." [...] In September 2015, Hedlund stated that he was told that the third Tron film was not [...] "totally dead", but jokingly suggested that it could be released 30 years later, referencing the near 30-year gap between the first film and Legacy.|$|E
500|$|Davis's {{company had}} taken their {{designated}} position at {{the left of the}} provincial line. [...] This would have placed the Acton company {{in the rear of the}} attack when the line advanced. [...] The company in the lead would have been Captain David Brown's company from Concord. [...] When Barrett asked Brown if he would lead the attack, Brown responded that he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not.</b> [...] Knowing that Davis's company was well equipped with bayonets and cartridge boxes, Barrett asked Davis if his company would lead the advance. [...] Several slight variations of Davis's response have been recorded. [...] His response is most often given as, [...] "I have not a man that is afraid to go." [...] Following Barrett's orders, Davis then moved his company to the right of the line. [...] Around 10:30, the provincials faced to the right and advanced on the Old North Bridge in a column of two men abreast. [...] At the head of the column was Davis, Major John Buttrick of Concord, and Lt. Col. John Robinson of Westford. [...] Barrett remained behind on the hill, cautioning his men as they marched by him not to fire first. The British at the bridge, watching the provincials approach, were surprised to see, as one soldier later said, that they [...] "advanced with the greatest regularity".|$|E

2500|$|During the {{excavation}} {{of the rubble}} of Scopas' dining hall, Simonides was called upon to identify each guest killed. Their bodies had been crushed beyond recognition but he completed the gruesome task by correlating their identities to their positions (loci in Latin) at the table before his departure. He later drew on this experience to develop the 'memory theatre' or 'memory palace', a system for mnemonics widely used in oral societies until the Renaissance. According to Cicero, Themistocles wasn't much impressed with the poet's invention: [...] "I would rather a technique of forgetting, for I remember what I <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>not</b> remember and cannot forget what I would rather forget." ...|$|E
