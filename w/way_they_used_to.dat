2500|$|Philpot made further {{controversial}} comments {{after the}} 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, legalizing gay marriage throughout the United States. Philpot described gay marriage as an oxymoron, the Supreme Court's decision as [...] "pretty close to insane," [...] and described homosexual relationships as [...] "sterile" [...] and [...] "just entertainment." [...] He also described homosexuality as a choice, saying that children now have [...] "got {{to decide which}} gender to date"; this matches his previously expressed views that the gay lifestyle is a [...] "destructive lifestyle" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "behavior, it's not genetic." [...] LGBT rights advocates challenged these views as showing a [...] "fundamental misunderstanding {{of what it means to}} be LGBT" [...] and as evidence of a [...] "deep disrespect for LGBT people and their families." [...] Judges have a First Amendment right to express their views so long as they do not influence their decisions. Philpot has presided over many cases with LGBT people and lawyers who have been involved report that he does not base his decisions on a litigant's sexuality. Speaking of his religious views, Philpot has stated that [...] "I don't mention Jesus inside the courthouse very much, even when I know he is absolutely the only answer to the problem in front of me." [...] Philpot has also stated that [...] "half the adoptions I do are for gay people. And they're not bad people," [...] and that he loves homosexuals. Philpot regrets, however, that friendships between straight men are affected as they are unable to hug in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> and that the rainbow, a symbol from the Bible, had been [...] "stolen" [...] – and he plans to put a rainbow on the back of his car.|$|E

60|$|Maybe {{the boys}} {{nowadays}} do not throw fire-balls, or know about them. They {{were made of}} cotton rags wound tight and sewed, and then soaked in turpentine. When a ball was lighted a boy caught it quickly up, and threw it, and it made a splendid streaming blaze through the air, and a thrilling whir as it flew. A boy {{had to be very}} nimble not to get burned, and a great many boys dropped the ball for every boy that threw it. I am not ready to say why these fire-balls did not set the Boy's Town on fire, and burn it down, but I know they never did. There was no law against them, and the boys were never disturbed in throwing them, any more than they were in building bonfires; and this shows, as much as anything, what a glorious town that was for boys. The <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> build their bonfires was to set one tar-barrel on top of another, as high as the biggest boy could reach, and then drop a match into them; in a moment a dusky, smoky flame would burst from the top, and fly there like a crimson flag, while all the boys leaped and danced round it, and hurrahed for the Whig candidates. Sometimes they would tumble the blazing barrels over, and roll them up and down the street.|$|E

40|$|Protective {{action of}} cultures: {{the case of}} lactic {{bacteria}} against undesirable food flora. Protective strains {{have been used for}} centuries in the fermentation of a variety of food. The preservative ability of these strains in food is attributed to the production of antimicrobial metabolites including organic acids and bacteriocins. But to secure an extension of shelf life and better food safety, the multiple antimicrobial barriers approach is required. This approach typically uses the principal hurdles temperature (higher or lower), water activity (Aw), pH, redox potentiel (Eh), chemical preservatives, vacuum packaging, modified atmosphere, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and UV, as additional barriers to protective cultures and/or antimicrobial compounds. This paper reviews the recent literature describing the protective cultures and different <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> suppress unwanted flora. Are also briefly presented, classification, biosynthesis, mechanism of action of bacteriocins produced by these cultures and finally the protective benefit of <b>using</b> additional barriers <b>to</b> booster protective cultures and/or their bacteriocins...|$|R

Formal methods are widely <b>used</b> in order <b>to</b> enact exhaustive analyses of these systems, but their complexity grows with system dimension and heterogeneity. In addition, experts in application domains could not be familiar with formal modelling techniques. A way to manage complexity of analysis is the use of Model Based Transformation techniques: analysts can express their models in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> do and automatic algorithms translate original models into analysable ones, reducing analysis complexity in a completely transparent way. In this work we describe an automatic transformation algorithm generating hybrid automata for the analysis of a natural water supply system.
