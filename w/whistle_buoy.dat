50|$|In October 2006, the {{controlling}} depth was 5.2 ft, reaching 8.2 ft at mid-channel, {{in the entrance}} channel to {{the intersection of the}} east and west channels. From that area, thence 4.9 ft, reaching 8.3 ft at mid-channel, in the west channel leading to Terry and Johnson Coves, thence 6.9 ft, reaching 7.4 ft at mid-channel, in the east channel leading to Bayou St. John. The channels are well marked. A lighted <b>whistle</b> <b>buoy</b> off the entrance marks the approach.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} use of Oscillating Water Columns was in <b>whistling</b> <b>buoys.</b> These buoys {{used the}} air pressure {{generated in the}} collecting chamber to power a PTO system that consisted of a whistle or foghorn. Rather than generating electricity, the PTO would generate sound, allowing the buoy to warn boats of dangerous water. J. M. Courtney patented one of these <b>whistling</b> <b>buoy</b> designs. In 1885 Scientific American reported that 34 of the <b>whistling</b> <b>buoys</b> were operating of {{the coast of the}} USA.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} {{may have}} been named by Captain William Thompson of Salem in 1891, and has since been compared to New Hampshire's Old Man in the Mountain. A nearby <b>whistling</b> <b>buoy</b> is known as [...] "Mother Ann’s Cow".|$|R

This rock may be found on NOAA chart 18755. This rock was given its name by the Coast Survey. It was named for the boat, John Begg, which struck a nearby rock in 1824.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was shut}} down in 1957 and replaced with a <b>whistle</b> <b>buoy,</b> having become the most expensive U.S. lighthouse to operate. [...] The last keeper was Oswald Allik, who would later become the last head keeper of Heceta Head Light. [...] Within two years, the lighthouse was sold to group of investors from Nevada, who sold it in 1980 {{to a group of}} realtors, who created the Eternity at Sea Columbarium, which opened in June of that year. [...] After interring about 30 urns, the columbarium's license was revoked in 1999 by the Oregon Mortuary and Cemetery Board and was rejected upon reapplication in 2005.|$|E

50|$|On {{his first}} {{appearance}} as a two-year-old, Derring-Do was entered in the valuable National Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. He finished second to the Irish filly Pourparler, {{who went on to}} win the following year's 1000 Guineas. He was then moved up in distance for the Imperial Stakes over six furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse and won from <b>Whistling</b> <b>Buoy.</b> On his final appearance of the season he returned to five furlongs for the Cornwallis Stakes at Kempton in September. Ridden by Breasley he started the 8/13 and won narrowly from the filly Golden Apollo.|$|R

[...] The course started {{from the mouth of}} New London Harbor, to Sarah Ledge, then led around the eastern end of Block Island, then around Fire Island Lightship, finishing at Montauk Point <b>Whistling</b> <b>Buoy.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lifeguards Without Borders is an {{international}} non-profit organization made up of volunteer lifeguards and health care professionals who aim to reduce drowning worldwide through domestic and international training, program development, and research. It was organized by doctors Justin Sempsrott and Andrew Schimdt in 2006, and is {{an international}} division of the American Red Cross Volunteer Lifesaving Corps, which has provided volunteer lifeguards to beaches in the United States since 1912. The group's projects have included lifeguard instructor training programs in Peru; teaching EMS, nursing and physician courses; performing medical research on drowning; donating <b>whistles,</b> <b>buoys,</b> and rescue boards; and providing additional lifeguards for large scale events, such as Carnaval in Ecuador. The organization partners with other international lifesaving and drowning prevention organizations to provide logistical, educational, and resource support.|$|R
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{was made}} without incident until {{the morning of}} 1 August 1917, when fog appeared {{off the coast of}} Nova Scotia. The visibility was reduced to near zero, but Captain William McNeil continued on his course and posted several crew members to listen for the various <b>whistles</b> like <b>buoy</b> bells or foghorn blasts, which warns ships of the dangerous shoals that threaten the entrance to Halifax Harbour.|$|R
50|$|Several {{advances}} in the technology of fog signals were made during the 1850s. In 1851, an experimental air fog whistle and reed horn was installed at Beavertail Lighthouse {{at the entrance to}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. At first this sound signal was powered by a horse-operated treadmill and later by an internal combustion steam engine. Around 1851, mechanically rung fog bells were introduced. The striking mechanism was governed by a weight attached to a flywheel, and later internally run by clockworks. The strokes of the fog signals were timed deliberately to afford each signal a unique sound characteristic. The bell signal was gradually replaced by three variations of that instrument. The first was an ordinary locomotive whistle, enlarged and modified and blown by steam from a high-pressured tubular boiler. The second was a reed-trumpet, and in 1866 the third variation, a siren-trumpet. Although the fog bell signal was still used for warning vessels over short distances, other fog signals started to supersede the smaller bell signal. Bells were also used on buoys; later <b>whistling</b> <b>buoys</b> were invented by J. M. Courtenay and were first in use in 1876. The first gas-lighted buoy was installed in 1882. The gong buoy was invented in 1923.|$|R
5000|$|Huckins Yacht Corporation built PT boats for two squadrons during World War II. In 1940, three {{governing}} bodies - the Bureau of Ships, the Board of Inspection and Survey, and the Navy Personnel Command - had agreed that all PT boats developed {{up to that}} time were defective. Confident he had a solution, Frank Pembroke Huckins utilized his company's own [...] "Quadraconic" [...] Hull to build a boat that met the Navy’s PT boat guidelines. The Quadraconic design, supported by 15 years of in-house research and experimentation, was developed using a conic method worked out by Lindsay Lord, and resulted in slightly concave bottom sections and a sharp bow entry. The Huckins PT 69 was compared to those being constructed by Elco, Higgins and the Philadelphia Navy Yard in a series of comparative performance tests conducted by the Board of Inspection and Survey off New London, Connecticut in July 1941, known as the [...] "Plywood Derby". The tests allowed boats of various classes from the three manufacturers to demonstrate their seakeeping qualities and hull strength by making a run at maximum sustained speed in the open ocean. Accelerometers were installed in the pilot house of each design to record [...] "pounding" [...] of the hull against the water in like sea conditions. The seaway course of the open-water trial, [...] at full throttle, started from the mouth of New London Harbor and finished at Montauk Point <b>Whistling</b> <b>Buoy.</b>|$|R
