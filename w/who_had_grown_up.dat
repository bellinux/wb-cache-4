5|$|Pahing, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> {{within the}} nascent {{independence}} movement and associated with several historical figures, {{was arrested for}} being half-Dutch by the Japanese spy Maruyama (Verdi Solaiman)– a man who coveted Pahing's wife. After being tortured, Pahing was released to discover {{that his wife had}} been raped and killed; their newborn son Fajar had been kidnapped. Pahing later died on a flight carrying medical supplies over Yogyakarta when the flight was shot down. Meanwhile, his son was raised by Maruyama– the kidnapper– and had his name changed to Dasaad Muchlisin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was {{promoted}} at the NBS and {{put in charge of}} the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.|$|E
5|$|King Philip, who {{ascended the}} Spanish throne in 1556, {{acknowledged}} {{the new political}} reality and cultivated his sister-in-law. She was a better ally than the chief alternative, Mary, Queen of Scots, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, King Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth. This interview was conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir. On 17 November 1558, Mary died and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne.|$|E

25|$|Heading into 2003, Tom Long {{refused to}} work for Ernie Eves. Most speculated that Long saw Eves as too wishy-washy and not enough of a {{traditional}} hard-right conservative. Jaime Watt took Long's position as campaign co-chair and more or less all the same players settled into the same spot. A few new faces included Jeff Bangs as campaign manager. Bangs was a long-time Eves loyalist <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> in his riding of Parry Sound.|$|E
25|$|By 1919 or 1920, {{while still}} {{spending}} winters in Manhattan and summers on Cape Cod, the sisters came to consider Provincetown their formal place of residence.

Like themselves a Midwesterner of German origin <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> in a household where German was spoken, he settled in Provincetown in 1919. Agnes and Knaths shared artistic leanings and mutually influenced each other's increasing use of abstraction in their work.|$|E
25|$|Such an all-encompassing love often {{leaves little}} room for other affections. Hephaestion was the best friend of Alexander, his king and his {{commanding}} officer, {{so it is not}} surprising that we only hear of several other close friendships or attachments in his life. There is no evidence, however, that he was anything but popular and well liked among the group of Alexander's close friends and Companions <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> together, and worked well together for so many years.|$|E

25|$|An intimation of the Murphy family's early history, {{together}} with the expression of genuine sentiment regarding {{the beginnings of the}} Murphy fortune, is contained {{in the name of the}} Greater Penobscot Building......
