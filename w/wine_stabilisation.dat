40|$|This study {{examined}} the viability of using thaumatin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as proteins in model wine solutions for bentonite fining studies and compared them with unfined New Zealand sauvignon blanc (SB) wine. Bentonite fining trials were performed on model wine solutions and unfined SB wines (pH range 3. 5 to 4. 3). Thaumatin was more readily adsorbed onto bentonites of all types than BSA and its adsorption onto bentonite was less affected by the pH of the solution. Specifically, the amount of BSA adsorbed onto bentonite decreased significantly as the pH of the solution approached the isoelectric point (pI) of BSA while thaumatin was adsorbed at that pH due to its higher pI. Changing pH affected protein adsorption of real wine less noticeably than of BSA and thaumatin, and decreasing pH increased protein adsorption {{in contrast to the}} model solutions. Neither of the model solutions can fully represent the response of real wine to bentonite fining but they are simple and cost effective to prepare and reacted to changes in bentonite concentration similar to real wine. Thaumatin is potentially a better protein to use in simple model solutions for <b>wine</b> <b>stabilisation</b> studies like filtration where molecular weights are important consideration...|$|E
40|$|Several papers {{investigated}} the complex chemical and technical {{properties of the}} family of tannins. In particular, they studied their role in <b>wine</b> <b>stabilisation</b> phenomena, the peculiar ability to modify the beverages sensory perception (e. g. astringency, colour and flavour), but also the beneficial health effects (e. g. antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, possible uses as anti-cancer or against cardiovascular diseases) [1, 2]. They are traditionally classified as hydrolysable tannins (gallotannins, ellagitannins and flavonoids) [3], that are mainly derived from several plant material [4, 5], and condensed tannins, that are generally extracted from grape tissues [6]. O. I. V. identifies the tannins produced from different botanical sources as juice and wine clarification adjuvants (Recueil des methods Internationales d’analyses, 2013), while the European Authorities recognise them as flavourings and food ingredients (EU Regulation No. 2232 / 96, EC No 1334 / 2008).

40|$|Bromelain from {{pineapple}} stem {{has been}} studied in unexplored model wine buffer (pH 3. 2 tartaric acid and ethanol) in order to evaluate its applicability for white <b>wine</b> protein <b>stabilisation.</b> Bromelain proteolytic activity was studied against several synthetic peptide substrates in McIlvaine buffer covering a wide pH range. Among different synthetic substrates, Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA {{turned out to be}} the most suitable one to test bromelain activity at the average minimum pH value of wine (3. 2). The protease activity was significantly increased by the presence of 5 mM cysteine while no influence was exerted by EDTA. The inhibiting effect of ethanol was investigated in the range 0 – 25 % (v/v), resulting in being rather limited at the average minimum concentration found in wine (10 % v/v). The kinetic parameters were estimated in both McIlvaine (as reference) and model wine buffers. This study showed that stem bromelain worked well at the average minimum pH value of wine, and had a significantly higher activity in model wine buffer (Ka increased of 42 %). These results are the basis for suggesting a future biotechnological application of this protease in winemaking. L'articolo è disponibile sul sito dell'editore [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Enology, {{the science}} of wine, enters the {{atmosphere}} of technological explosion of the third millennium. In order to achieve higher quality products enology is expected to implant to the utmost the latest scientific knowledge into wine technology. Enology will satisfy these demands, but will the consumer be satisfied too? It will {{not be possible to}} produce modern and attractive wines without ´considerate´ methods of pressing, intact prefermentation must processing and realisation of regulated fermentation process. Regulation of fermentation will be carried out even more consistently in biological (pure yeast cultures, immobilised cells, genetically manipulated microorganisms), physically-chemical and bioengineering (shape of the containers, continual fermentation) ways. Will wine be produced in strictly reduction regimes; will purely physical methods be enough in the process of <b>wine</b> <b>stabilisation?</b> Wont the resources of must chemical consistency (acids, polyphenols, proteins, other native antioxidants) be more widely used for this reason? The beauty wine of the third millennium should develop from the refined range of today´s varieties. However, application of the latest methods of chemical analysis (GC, HPLC, MS, SNIF - NMR) will allow a more precise determination of the origin, purity and authenticity of wine in the near future. It will help define the originality (both chemical and sensory) {{of a wide range of}} wines from different parts of the world which have to be preserved for the generations of our descendants...|$|E
40|$|White wines {{generally}} {{contain a}} relatively low concentration of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins of grape (Vitis vinifera), namely, thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) and chitinases. These proteins play roles in the defence mechanism of plants against pathogens, and can cause protein haze in white wine unless removed prior to bottling. TLPs are, after the chitinases, the second most abundant proteins found in wines. It has been demonstrated that different isoforms of TLPs have different hazing potential and aggregation behaviour, but an explanation on why this occurs is lacking. In this work we present the elucidation of the molecular structures of three isoforms of grape TLPs purified from Sauvignon blanc grape juice. The three TLPs have very similar structures despite belonging to two different classes (F 2 / 4 JRU is a thaumatin-like protein while I/ 4 L 5 H and H 2 / 4 MBT are VVTL 1), and having different unfolding temperatures (56 vs. 62 °C). Interestingly, protein F 2 / 4 JRU {{was found to be}} heat unstable thus forming haze, while {{this was not the case}} for I/ 4 L 5 H. From the comparison of the three structures we attributed these differences in properties to the conformation of a single loop and the amino acid composition of its flanking regions. The presence of a disulfide bridge in this loop is probably the key for the unfolding/refolding behaviour of this area, and the fact that white wines are typically produced in reducing conditions and with SO 2 added to prevent faults due to oxidation is likely to exacerbate haze formation. The availability of structural information on haze forming proteins could inform research into alternative <b>wine</b> <b>stabilisation</b> solutions as the development of target proteases for the degradation of haze-forming proteins, resulting in an important change in the winemaking stabilization practices...|$|E
40|$|Commercial tannins {{are natural}} polyphenolic {{compounds}} extracted from different plant tissues such as gall, {{the wood of}} different species and fruit. In the food industry they are mainly used as flavourings and food ingredients, whereas in winemaking they are classified as clarification agents for <b>wine</b> protein <b>stabilisation,</b> although colour stabilisation, metal removal, unpleasant thiol removal and rheological correction are also well-known and desired effects. Due to their particular technical properties and very different costs, the possibility of correct identification of the real botanical origin of tannins {{can be considered a}} primary target in oenology research and in fulfilling the technical and economic requirements of the wine industry. For some categories of tannins encouraging results have already been achieved by considering sugar or polyphenolic composition. For the first time this work verifies the possibility of determining the botanical origin of tannins {{on the basis of the}} mineral element profile and analysis of the 13 C/ 12 C isotopic ratio. One hundred-two commercial tannins originating from different botanical sources (grapes, oak,gall, chestnut, fruit trees, quebracho, tea, acacia, officinal plants and tara) were analysed to determine 57 elements and the 13 C/ 12 C isotopic ratio, using ICP-MS and IRMS respectively. Forward stepwise discriminant analysis provided good discrimination between the 30 8 most abundant groups, with 100 % correct re-classification. The model was then validated five times on subsets of 10 % of the overall samples, randomly extracted, achieving satisfactory results. With a similar approach it was also possible to distinguish toasted and untoasted oak tannins as well as tannins from grape skin and grape seeds...|$|R
40|$|In the Australian <b>wine</b> industry, cold <b>stabilisation</b> is {{a widely}} used {{industrial}} process to prevent tartrate instability in bottled wines. This process involves cooling the wine close to its freezing point for extended periods, thereby inducing tartrate precipitation. However, it has several important disadvantages. Consequently, alternative methods to cold stabilisation have been developed. This includes electrodialysis, nanofiltration and contact processes. In this study, current knowledge regarding performance and cost of cold stabilisation and alternative technologies for tartrate stabilisation is reviewed. Whilst there have been occasional cost comparisons between cold stabilisation and alternative technologies, existing data is not suitable for properly evaluating the relative economics of the different process options. Therefore, alternative technologies to cold stabilisation, including the Westfalia process, nanofiltration and electrodialysis were compared for both technical and economic performance. Berri Estates Winery {{was used as the}} basis for engineering calculations and conceptual cost estimates. This {{is the first time that}} such a comprehensive evaluation has been undertaken of a broad range of alternative technologies for tartrate <b>stabilisation</b> during <b>wine</b> production. Product loss was a key cost driver in differentiating tartrate stabilisation processes. Cold stabilisation was found to be the most economic treatment process irrespective of scale or winery size. The Westfalia process and nanofiltration were the next most cost effective options. Data for economic evaluation and environmental assessment were summarised in a survey form that was circulated to technical experts from Hardy Wine Company, the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI) and the University of Adelaide. The purpose of the survey was to obtain the experts’ opinions on the merits of the alternative technologies. The results of this survey were used for comparison between current cold stabilisation and alternative technologies, by performing multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This represents an original application of MCDA techniques to decision making in the wine industry. The MCDA analysis identified a strong preference by experts for nanofiltration combined with centrifugation as an alternative to cold stabilisation. As a consequence, laboratory investigations and field testing of nanofiltration were conducted to obtain new and practical information which was not presently available and relevant to understanding and implementing this process for tartrate <b>stabilisation</b> of <b>wine.</b> The laboratory experiments were performed with a range of membranes and tartrate unstable wines (i. e. Semillon, Colombard and Shiraz) using a purpose-designed laboratory-scale continuously-stirred batch-test membrane cell. The results showed that a range of commercial nanofiltration membranes with a nominal molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) between 200 and 500 Daltons (Da) were able to achieve tartrate <b>stabilisation</b> of all <b>wines</b> tested. This was achieved at moderate pressures less than 20 bar with a recovery of at least 50 %. It was also observed that seeding of wine following nanofiltration might reduce the holding time required to achieve stability and also enable reductions in the recovery rate to values of less than 50 %. The field testing was performed at Berri Estates Winery in the Riverland region of South Australia. The testing was performed using an existing commercial membrane system. This membrane system was already used for juice/wine concentration. The nanofiltration membranes had a nominal MWCO of 300 Da. The testing was conducted on Colombard and Shiraz wines. The field tests confirmed that nanofiltration could successfully tartrate stabilise Colombard and Shiraz wines at recoveries of 50 %; without seeding; within relatively short holding periods of less than four hours; and at flux rates between 5 and 10 L/m²/h. Crystallisation kinetics were also studied. At low recovery, the crystallisation was initially controlled by diffusion step, then surface integration. However, at high recovery, the crystallisation was controlled solely by surface integration. Sensory testing (by duo-trio difference tests) produced adverse sensory outcomes when compared with treatment of the same <b>wines</b> by cold <b>stabilisation.</b> Unfortunately, it could not be established whether this problem was inherent to the process or arose from unrelated factors. Setting aside the adverse sensory result, this is the first time that technical feasibility of nanofiltration for tartrate stabilisation has been successfully demonstrated. Further field testing and sensory evaluation of nano-filtered wines should be carried out to verify the effect of nanofiltration on wines. If the process is successful and favourable, the process design for implementation of a production scale nanofiltration for tartrate stabilisation should then be optimised. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Identifying {{alternatives}} to bentonite fining and/or reducing bentonite use to achieve protein stability {{has long been}} a goal of the wine industry. Unstable proteins in white and rosé wines have been demonstrated to be pathogenesis-related proteins which originate from the grape, survive vinification and remain soluble in finished wine. This thesis contributes information about protein in and stabilisation of New Zealand wines. The aims of this study were first to develop methods for protein quantification and characterisaton, and then further to investigate viticultural and oenological influences on <b>wine</b> protein <b>stabilisation.</b> This study was carried out on Sauvignon blanc from the Marlborough region in consecutive vintages, 2007 and 2008. Three methods, Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) assay, lithium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (LDS-PAGE) and sodium dodecyl sulphate capillary gel electrophoresis (SDS-CGE), were utilised to investigate effects of vintage, vineyard site, pruning, pH adjustment, timing of bentonite addition, stabilisation test parameters and type of adsorbent. Wine protein recovery by acetone precipitation was more effective than that by ultrafiltration (10 kDa molecular weight cut-off); the latter gave a 21 % loss of total protein by SDS-CGE. Proteins with molecular weight between 19 and 33 kDa were the predominant fractions determined by both LDS-PAGE (70 %) and SDS-CGE (98 %), but the 64 kDa fraction observed by LDS-PAGE (21 %) was not detectable in SDS-CGE. However, the SDS-CGE provided better resolution than LDS-PAGE with 8 fractions (9. 6, 19, 21 22, 24. 6, 26. 5, 27. 6 and 32 kDa) detected. For a range of wines (n = 18) surveyed results indicated that the CBB assay resulted in wine protein concentrations (average 113. 3 mg L⁻¹; CV = 16 %) about 42 % higher compared to LDS-PAGE (r² = 0. 80; CV = 8 %) and about 4. 2 times lower compared to SDS-CGE (r² = 0. 62; CV = 16 %). The rapid and simple CBB assay coupled with the finding that a narrow range of protein content (10 to 25 mg L⁻¹) remained in most stabilised wines (n = 102) could be a good method to predict bentonite requirement. Among 5 vineyard sites in Marlborough, one consistently showed the lowest protein concentration in juice and wine, lowest haze formation and lowest bentonite requirement regardless of pruning treatment and vintage, whereas other vineyards varied when pruning treatments and/or vintages were compared. Two juice protein peaks at 22 and 28 kDa in SDS-CGE appeared to be related to two main wine protein fractions at 22 and 26 kDa, respectively. The 28 kDa fraction was reduced and became heterogeneous after fermentation, while the 22 kDa fraction remained unaffected. Bentonite requirement determined by a standard hot/cold test (80 °C for 6 hours followed by 4 °C overnight) was correlated with total and individual protein concentrations and haze level; there was a good correlation of bentonite requirement with the 26 and 32 kDa fractions (r² = 0. 78; p < 0. 001), but less good with protein haze, total protein concentration and the predominant 22 kDa fraction (r² < 0. 50; p < 0. 05). The presence or absence of bentonite during fermentation seemingly did not affect fermentation kinetics to below 0 °Brix regardless of pH, although lower juice pH (2. 80 and 3. 00) tended to result in sluggish fermentation. The presence of bentonite in the ferment improved the rate of completion of fermentation for the slower fermentation (pH 2. 80). Adjusting the pH of juice and/or wine modified the bentonite requirement by two mechanisms: reduced wine pH improves protein adsorption efficiency by bentonite fining, and decreased juice pH results in a lower wine protein content. Bentonite addition during fermentation was the most efficient in terms of protein removal but fining after fermentation resulted in the lowest overall dosage. The molecular weight profile of proteins from wines produced at microvinification and commercial scales were identical, although different fermentation scales slightly affected wine protein content. Protein content and molecular weight profiles in stabilised wines were affected by the original juice pH with more complex patterns from high pH juice. Heat treatment at 90 °C for 1 hour produced the most protein haze and was the most sensitive in haze reduction in response to incremental bentonite fining compared to 80 °C for 2, 6 and 15 hours treatments. There seemed to be a coincident point at approximately 3 nephelometric turbidity units which gave the same predicted bentonite requirement for all heat tests. Na bentonite was the most efficient adsorbent in protein removal, followed by NaCa bentonite, polymeric resin and cation-exchange resin. Protein adsorption isotherms from the Langmuir model indicated that the adsorption capacity for Na bentonite was about 2 and 3 times higher compared to that for NaCa bentonite and polymeric resin, respectively. Na bentonite showed slightly higher binding affinity (Langmuir constant) than NaCa bentonite, but much greater when compared to polymeric resin. The polymeric resin was favorable for use in a regenerable continuous process but suffered from recovery inefficiency. Some tendency for selective removal by bentonite was noted between wine protein fractions based on molecular weight examined by SDS-CGE. However, this was not affected by wine pH (2. 80 and 3. 85) or bentonite type (Na or NaCa). Based on pH effects and lees volume considerations, NaCa bentonite is suitable for low pH wines and high bentonite requirement, whereas Na bentonite is suitable for high pH wines or low bentonite requirement...|$|R
