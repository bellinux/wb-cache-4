5|$|In the show's third act, {{the host}} conducts an {{interview}} with a celebrity guest. Guests come {{from a wide range of}} cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes, pundits, policy experts and political figures. During Stewart's tenure, the show's guests tended away from celebrities and more towards non-fiction authors and political pundits, as well as many prominent elected officials. In the show's earlier years it struggled to book high-profile politicians. (In 1999, for an Indecision 2000 segment, Steve Carell struggled to talk his <b>way</b> <b>off</b> Republican candidate John McCain's press overflow bus and onto the Straight Talk Express).|$|E

An English fleet under Sir Robert Mansell intercepted and attacked six Spanish galleys under the command of Federico Spinola; in the Dover Straits and was fought all the <b>way</b> <b>off</b> from the coast of England and finally off the Spanish Netherlands. The English were soon joined by a Dutch fleet under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant and they completed the destruction.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} at the Asian Branch headquarters, Allen's Innocence takes its true form: the , a cape-like Innocence which is armor and has a small claw (allowing Allen to perform new techniques). He rejoins his comrades in Edo, where the group is trapped in Noah's Ark. As they look for a <b>way</b> <b>off</b> the Ark, Allen and his friends fight the Noah. In his rematch with Tyki, Allen {{transforms}} his left arm into a sword which exorcises evil (allowing him to win). When Cross appears and saves Allen from Tyki's new Noah appearance, he directs him to restore the falling Ark by playing a piano. Returning to headquarters, Allen learns {{that he is the}} host of the late 14th Noah (Nea), who betrayed the Earl, was killed and was related to Mana. Before his death, Nea implanted his memories in Allen so he would be reborn. All Exorcists are ordered to kill Allen before he begins transforming into a Noah. While Allen controls his body, he begins turning into Nea; Crown Clown's sword hurts him, despite its only affecting Noah and Akuma.|$|E

5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his <b>way</b> <b>off</b> the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a <b>way</b> <b>off</b> the ship. Learning {{that there is no way}} to change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield.|$|E
5|$|Players {{create a}} {{character}} and travel around Sucia Island, a location Barred {{to the members}} of the player character's sect. Whilst searching for a <b>way</b> <b>off</b> the island, the game's ultimate goal, players can form alliances with the island's inhabitants and complete quests through combat or other means. Geneforge is played in 45° axonometric perspective, movement through the game's environs is real-time but switches to turn-based combat in the game's playing field. The game world is divided up into 77 areas accessible through a world map. The first two areas serve as the game's tutorial; introducing players to navigation, controls and shaping creations. Clearing areas by defeating guardians or successfully traversing the terrain allows players to bypass those areas via the world map, reducing travelling time. The game has an always-visible auto-map, which begins each area completely darkened, and is revealed as the player explores. As the player's party performs tasks or defeats enemies they receive experience, leading to increased levels and additional skill points. The player character's skill points can be used to increase their statistics or to improve their aptitude in one of the fifteen available skills. Canisters which increase skills or add new abilities are scattered throughout the game.|$|E

The north wall is gone and all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} found ways of bypassing the boycott and managed to trade with both Israel and the Arab world. For example, some firms that did business with Arab countries officially complied with the boycott, but in practice subcontracted their trade with Israel to companies already blacklisted by the Arab states, while others did business with Israel through divisions or affiliates whose links to the company were disguised. Others strove to cultivate good personal relationships with Arab leaders, who {{would allow them to}} trade with Israel without economic repercussions in their own countries as a favor. Some firms placed on the blacklist managed to lobby or buy their <b>way</b> <b>off</b> it.|$|E

Graystripe finds the correct scent trail, and they follow it to a makeshift WindClan camp. Fireheart spots Barley's farm a little <b>ways</b> <b>off</b> the trail and the pair hurriedly leaves in fear of the dogs that live on the farm chasing them after they get let out.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was <b>way</b> <b>off</b> stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} {{successive}} tour, white South Africa {{was forced to}} put on a brave front in acclaiming sporting triumph where there was none. A full-strength Sri Lankan team was some <b>way</b> <b>off</b> international competitiveness so it was little surprise that a makeshift rebel outfit was utterly humiliated, failing to win a single tour match. Now captained by Peter Kirsten of Western Province, South Africa comfortably won all four ‘ODIs’ and both ‘Tests’. Lawrence Seeff, who replaced the injured Barry Richards, and Graeme Pollock made 188 and 197 respectively in the second ‘Test’ but protested that the matches could not be classed as international cricket. SACU, trying to protect the ‘unofficial international’ brand it had created, fined them for the admission.|$|E
25|$|Mutai won {{his first}} World Marathon Major event in April 2011, taking the title at the 2011 London Marathon with a course record and new {{personal}} best time of 2:04:40. This made him the fourth fastest runner ever over the distance. He {{was one of the}} favourites for the Great North Run, but it was half marathon specialist Martin Mathathi who took the honours and Mutai finished in third. His next major race was the 2011 New York City Marathon and his time of 2:06:28 hours was faster than the course record, although he was second place to Geoffrey Mutai. He attempted to defend his title at the 2012 London Marathon, but ended up in seventh some <b>way</b> <b>off</b> the winner Wilson Kipsang. Following the injury of Moses Mosop, he was drafted into the Kenyan Olympic marathon team as a replacement.|$|E
