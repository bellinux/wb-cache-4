2500|$|In {{cognitive}} {{models of}} social anxiety disorder, those with social phobias experience dread over how they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> others. They may feel overly self-conscious, pay high self-attention after the activity, or have high performance standards for themselves. According {{to the social}} psychology theory of self-presentation, a sufferer attempts to create a well-mannered impression towards others but believes {{he or she is}} unable to do so. Many times, prior to the potentially anxiety-provoking social situation, sufferers may deliberately review what could go wrong and how to deal with each unexpected case. [...] After the event, they may have the perception that they performed unsatisfactorily. Consequently, they will perceive anything that may have possibly been abnormal as embarrassing. These thoughts may extend for weeks or longer. Cognitive distortions are a hallmark, and are learned about in CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Thoughts are often self-defeating and inaccurate. Those with social phobia tend to interpret neutral or ambiguous conversations with a negative outlook, and many studies suggest that socially anxious individuals remember more negative memories than those less distressed.|$|E

50|$|Theoretical {{physicist}} Edward Witten {{proposed that}} the reason no flop-transition has ever caused universally catastrophic results is because the world-sheet of the strings will surround the flop-transitioning sphere and virtually cancel out the effects.
