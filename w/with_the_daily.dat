5|$|Around Storybrooke, {{residents}} {{notice the}} clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Lana Parrilla) {{looks through the}} book of fairy tales and discovers that the last few pages are torn out. She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing {{because it is an}} old book. Regina learns Emma is still in town when the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Daily</b> Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, at a journalists' briefing, {{he warned}} that the Royal Navy needed another £1 billion to meet future foreign policy demands and appealed to the Government for {{additional}} funding, {{a third of the}} navy's annual operating budget, to spend on building more modern ships. In a later interview <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Daily</b> Telegraph he said that an increase of more than 30 per cent in the fleet's day-to-day budget was necessary to pay for better sailors' wages, the running of ships and improved accommodation. He threatened to resign as head of the navy if the Government failed to agree to pay for two new aircraft carriers – the Royal Navy CVF programme, which it had previously promised.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, after {{spending}} some {{two years in}} Medan <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>daily</b> Sinar Soematra, Andjar returned to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine Doenia Film, a Malay adaptation of the Dutch-language magazine Filmland; although an adaptation, Doenia Film also contained original coverage of the domestic theatre and film industry. At the time, the cinema of the Indies was becoming established: the first domestic film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng (The Lost Lutung), was released in 1926, and four additional films were released in 1927 and 1928. Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical productions; for example, the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar inspired the marketing for 1929's Njai Dasima, which emphasised the exclusively native cast. In 1930 Andjar left Doenia Film {{and was replaced by}} Bachtiar Effendi.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, his journalistic mentor Pedlar Palmer moved to The Sydney Morning Herald and Fingleton became disenchanted. He was coaxed by cricketer-journalist {{to move his}} publication, the Telegraph Pictorial where he worked for several years before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War. However, Fingleton's initiation into his new workplace was difficult as the Telegraph Pictorial had just merged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Daily</b> Telegraph and around half the workforce were to be made redundant. Fingleton was demoted from the main staff to a freelance correspondent covering events in the inner-city suburbs of Redfern and Newtown. In such crime-ridden and turbulent working-class area, Fingleton was productive in break stories and was soon restored to the regular staff.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 2009, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based {{prediction}} market game Hubdub {{launched a}} spin-off known as FanDuel; the service attempted to market {{itself as a}} modern alternative to the fantasy sports services provided by other media properties, such as Yahoo! Sports and CBSSports.com, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>daily</b> fantasy format and integration with popular social networks. Its founder, Nigel Eccles, was inspired to create the site when he realizied that the carve-out for fantasy sports in the U.S. Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 did not state that a legal, paid fantasy sports competition had to last for an entire season. In February 2012, the Boston-based DraftKings was established by former VistaPrint executives Jason Robins, Matthew Kalish, and Paul Liberman. DraftKings gained a local, Somerville-based competitor in StarStreet, when it introduced a daily fantasy game of its own.|$|E

5|$|The Bill {{has become}} a popular drama in the United Kingdom and in many other countries, most notably in Australia. The series {{attracted}} audiences of up to six million viewers in 2008 and 2009. Ratings during 2002 peaked after the overhaul of the show which brought about the 2002 fire episode, in which six officers were killed and the 2003 live episode attracted ten million viewers- {{forty percent of the}} UK audience share. Immediately following The Bills revamping and time slot change, it was reported that the programme had attracted 4.5million viewers, 19% of the audience share, however, it lost out to the BBC's New Tricks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Daily</b> Mirror later reporting that ITV's schedule change was behind a two million viewer drop in ratings.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely in touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>daily</b> affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects {{as diverse as the}} death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people counted in the census of 1381 was 59,873,305; however, this number dropped {{significantly}} when the government found that some 3 million people were missing from the tax census of 1391. Even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in 1381, the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region, where Hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace. The government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of 60,545,812 people in 1393. In his Studies on the Population of China, Ho Ping-ti suggests revising the 1393 census to 65 million people, noting that large areas of North China and frontier areas were not counted in that census. Brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62 million, while the population was in fact increasing. Even the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–505) remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>daily</b> dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers. William Atwell states that around 1400 the population of China was perhaps 90 million people, citing Heijdra and Mote.|$|E
