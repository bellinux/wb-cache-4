Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being [...] "the worst president," [...] Bush would say, [...] "I make decisions on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls." ...|$|E

There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
500|$|Cultura Profética {{has been}} {{described}} as roots reggae. The group has often made use of the moog synthesizer, an instrument commonly used in traditional reggae but is generally rare in contemporary reggae. Despite primarily performing reggae music, the group incorporates various other rhythms into its compositions, including those of Caribbean genres such as salsa. The song [...] "Reggae Rústico" [...] from Ideas Nuevas includes an extended soneo, an improvised call-and-response section common in the salsa genre, at its closing, calling for unity in reggae music. Additionally, the band's music features a strong emphasis on improvisation and polyrhythmic patterns. Rodríguez notes that [...] "We've developed <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> our own genre. We don't consider ourselves a pop act but we do make popular music {{in the sense that we}} are supported by many people. People have finally understood what we do." [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard observed elements of jazz in the single [...] "La Complicidad," [...] additionally describing it as [...] "more mellow rock than reggae." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|The video {{featured}} full-bodied tattooed model Rick Genest (Rico), {{better known}} by his stage name Zombie Boy. Gaga painted {{her face in}} a similar way to Genest, in one of the main series of sequences. She said that the sequences displayed the fact that she would not allow society or critics to dictate her sense of beauty. [...] "I tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> beauty, and hence the scene was of me and Rico defining ourselves in artistic way and not relying on society to dictate it," [...] she added. The costumes for the video were designed by Formichetti, who blogged about the various designer pieces shown in it. In the opening sequence of the video, Gaga wore a head accessory by Alexis Bittar, a diamond neckpiece by Erickson Beamon with earrings by Pamela Love, and a stained-glass dress by Petra Storrs. Finger rings were provided by Erickson Beamon and chiffon clothes by Thierry Mugler. For the skeletons sequences, both she and Rico wore tuxedos by Mugler while the slime during the orgy scenes were courtesy of Bart Hess. For her Michael Jackson impression in the alley at the video's end, Gaga wore shirt and pants by Haus of Gaga, shoes by Natacha Marro, a Billykirk belt and LaCrasia gloves.|$|E
500|$|While {{living in}} England Donen became {{a fan of}} the British variety show Beyond the Fringe and wanted to work with the show's comedy duo Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The {{resulting}} film was Bedazzled, an updated version of the Faust legend in 1967. It was written by Cook with music by Moore, and also starred Eleanor Bron and Raquel Welch. Moore plays a lonely young man whose unrequited love of his co-worker (Bron) drives him to attempt suicide. Just then the devil (Cook) appears and offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. The film's fun-loving association with the Swinging London of the 1960s divided critics, but Roger Ebert called its satire [...] "barbed and contemporary... dry and understated", and overall, a [...] "magnificently photographed, intelligent, very funny film." [...] On the other hand, Time magazine called it the feeblest of all known variations on the Faust theme. The film was a hit and was especially popular among American college students. Donen considered it a favorite among his own films and called it [...] "a very personal film in that I said a great deal about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> important in life." [...] It was remade as Bedazzled by director Harold Ramis in 2000.|$|E

500|$|Talking on how {{the season}} would {{interact}} with Agent Carter, Bell said, [...] "Here's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> interesting. Agent Carter seems to be about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., but about the beginnings of something, and the basic values of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got blown up last year and what Coulson always wanted was a return to basics, and it gives {{us an opportunity to}} return to some of those core values and even physically, some of that S.S.R. stuff has a way of finding its way into our show that could be cool. Anyway we can tie things together, we're {{going to try to do}} it, but it is hard when the stories are 60 years apart." [...] Several scenes in [...] "Shadows" [...] and [...] "The Things We Bury" [...] are flashbacks featuring Peggy Carter which serve as an introduction to the world of Agent Carter, setting up characters and ideas for that series, including Carter's belief in the need for [...] "a permanent unit during peacetime", which will lead to the creation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The episode [...] "Making Friends and Influencing People" [...] names Hydra's ability to brainwash people as the Faustus Method, named for the character who appears, as Johann Fennhoff, in Agent Carter, played by Ralph Brown.|$|E
500|$|It was {{revealed}} in a flashback in the episode that Smithers was briefly {{married to a}} woman, but the two split up when he devoted too much time to his boss Mr. Burns. Smithers's relationship with Mr. Burns {{has long been a}} running joke on The Simpsons. His sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a [...] "Burns-sexual" [...] and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay. Matthew Henry wrote in the book Leaving Springfield that this episode is [...] "perhaps the best" [...] example of an attempt to portray an actual gay lifestyle on the show. Henry added that the flashback is a [...] "wonderfully rendered parody of scenes from two of Tennessee Williams's most famous plays, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire. To fully appreciate it, one must know something of not only the two plays cited but also of Williams himself, of his own struggles with both heterosexual and homosexual desires {{and the way in which}} these struggles were incorporated into his art. The creators of The Simpsons offer <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a perfect parallel for the relationship between Smithers and Mr. Burns by combining Williams's two most notable male characters and their defining characteristics: the suppressed homosexual desire of Brick and desperate dependence of Stanley." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
