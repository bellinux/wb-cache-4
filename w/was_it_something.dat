25|$|Human {{sacrifice}} {{and other forms}} of torture—self-inflicted or otherwise—were common to many parts of Mesoamerica. Thus the rite was nothing new to the Aztecs when they arrived to the Valley of Mexico, nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> unique to pre-Columbian Mexico. Other Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Purépechas and Toltecs, performed human sacrifices as well and from archaeological evidence, it probably existed since the time of the Olmecs (1200–400 BC), and perhaps even throughout the early farming cultures of the region. Although the extent of human sacrifice is unknown among several Mesoamerican civilizations, such as Teotihuacán, what distinguished Maya and Aztec human sacrifice was the importance with which it was embedded in everyday life.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell {{has become}} a regular {{participant}} on many panel shows, leading The Independents James Rampton to christen him [...] "if not king, then certainly prince regent of the panel games." [...] Mitchell is a team captain on the BBC panel show Would I Lie To You?, opposite Lee Mack. The show has run since 2007, airing ten series. Since 2006, he has hosted eighteen series of The Unbelievable Truth, a panel game on BBC Radio 4. The inaugural episode of <b>Was</b> <b>It</b> <b>Something</b> I Said?, a panel comedy show that Mitchell hosts, was broadcast on Channel 4 in October 2013.|$|E
5000|$|What {{the hell}} is good design? Is <b>it</b> <b>something</b> that gives {{satisfaction}} to your own ego? Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> that creates a positive response in the eyes, minds, and hearts of millions of people? Also, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> that <b>is</b> appropriate to its category? Ideally <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all of these. Walter Landor ...|$|R

[...] "Is {{that sort of thing}} always dreaming? Is <b>it</b> dreaming? Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else? Mightn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> else?" ...|$|R
500|$|Mouly divided {{her time}} between {{publishing}} and parenthood following {{the birth of}} daughter Nadja in 1987. [...] Researching books for Sue Coe motivated her to take up science courses at Hunter College, perhaps toward a neuroscience degree. [...] She abandoned this plan in 1991 when {{she gave birth to}} son Dashiell. [...] In 1991, Mouly and Spiegelman published the final issue of Raw, which was no longer a small, hands-on operation, nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> they still thought necessary, as the artists then had a range of publishing outlets that had not existed when Raw first saw the light of day.|$|E
6000|$|What other {{association}} {{besides the}} association with Dexter did I {{connect with the}} corridor? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> I had seen during my visit to Gleninch? No. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> I had read? I snatched up the Report of the Trial to see. It opened at a page which contained the nurse's evidence. I read the evidence through again, without recovering the lost remembrance until I came to these lines close at the end: ...|$|E
6000|$|Aynesworth {{looked at}} him suddenly. The weariness was there indeed--was it his fancy, or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> more than weariness which shone out of the dark, tired eyes? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} have remarked that Bernard has been unusually gracious {{to the girl}} and her mother. Is it his notion of a host's duty? Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is {{the object}} of this assembly?" [...] I asked him. [...] "Are we to fight for the edification of the First Born, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> worse than that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Looky here, Mr. Beamish," [...] said Mr. Fotheringay. [...] "Let us clearly {{understand}} what a miracle <b>is.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>something</b> contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of Will..." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, {{there are}} moments, certainly. But <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did? Did he become angry with you, and say {{anything}} that was unkind or true? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly {{understand}} the anxiety you showed about Delamayn," [...] he said, [...] "when {{you found that}} he had only fainted under the fatigue. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> more than a common fainting fit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{lost them}} {{and left the}} town, striding quickly, easily, up into the hills {{at the edge of}} town. When he reached the cage he stopped. What had happened? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> about his clothing? His dress? ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to have wept {{as we have}} wept, [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to {{have done}} as we have done, [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to have watched when all men slept, [...] And seen the stars which never see the sun.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do," [...] said Mr. Overgold. [...] "I can't help {{asking myself}} {{what it all}} means. Is life, after all, merely a series of {{immaterial}} phenomena, self-developing and based solely on sensation and reaction, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I might (reflect on that) when I'm done playing someday," [...] Stafford said. [...] "I had no {{idea about}} that, or that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> coming. <b>It's</b> <b>something</b> that I'll {{probably}} look back on when I'm done and realize <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> pretty special." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{those things}} were over now--perhaps that <b>was</b> <b>it!</b> <b>Something</b> had {{happened}} to the world and the old light had been turned out. He himself was changed, and Sid was changed, terribly changed, and Ann no doubt was changed.|$|E
60|$|What {{could that}} be? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> real or only a shadow? Dick {{rubbed his eyes}} and peered out more sharply than ever. It was not a shadow, but a real form, slowly moving around {{to the rear of}} the house.|$|E
6000|$|Dinah {{looked at}} him inquiringly, but instead of going on, he reached a chair and brought it near {{the corner of the}} table where she was sitting. She wondered, and was afraid--and the next moment her {{thoughts}} flew to the past: <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> about those distant unhappy ones that she didn't know? ...|$|E

5000|$|Hello, {{my name is}} Leroy Brooks. I am from Houston, Texas and my {{question}} is for all the candidates. Whether this flag right here to a Confederate flag represents the symbol of racism, a symbol of political ideology, a symbol of Southern heritage—or, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> completely different? ...|$|R
60|$|She drew {{a little}} nearer to him. He was {{conscious}} of a mysterious and unfamiliar perfume, perhaps from the violets half hidden in her furs, or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> in her hair? It reminded him {{a little of the}} world the keys into which he had gripped--the world of joyousness, of light-hearted pleasures, the sunlit world into which he had only looked through other men's eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it isn't that," [...] {{explained}} Mrs. Enderby; [...] "it's to {{have your}} maids say 'All right' when you ask them to remove the soup. It's a bit shocking also {{to have your}} cook or housemaid going about the house singing some wretched ditty. What was that one, Charley, that Irma Maud sang till we were nearly wild (Irma Maud was my chambermaid). What <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> <b>Something</b> about 'Tixey Ann.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{his return}} to the rectory, he merely said that he had been to see after various things {{belonging}} to him, which were still left in the empty house. His look and manner as he gave us this brief explanation were, to my mind, more unsatisfactory than ever. I made no remark; and, observing that his loose traveling coat was buttoned awry over the breast, I set it right for him. My hand, as I did this, touched his breast-pocket. He started back directly--as if there was something in the pocket which he did not wish me to feel. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> he had brought from Browndown? ...|$|E
6000|$|Rachel {{had little}} choice what she should say or do. What Fanny was saying tenderly and privately, the two boys were {{communicating}} open-mouthed, and Mrs. Curtis came at once with her nervous, [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> my dear; <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> very sad? Those poor children look very cold, and half starved." ...|$|R
60|$|ADAM. It is; and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> {{greater than}} me: I am {{only a part}} of it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} as to which Willie is ‘after’ - Winnie or the revolver - is like the question in All That Fall as to whether Mr Rooney threw the little girl out of the railway-carriage or not. And the answer is the same in both cases - we don’t know, at least I don’t. All that is necessary as far as I’m concerned - technically and otherwise - less too little, more too much - is the ambiguity of motive, established clearly I hope by Winnie, ‘Is it me you’re after, Willie, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else? Is <b>it</b> a kiss you’re after, Willie, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> else?’ and by the conspicuousness of revolver requested in the stage-directions at beginning of Act II. To test the doubt was dramatically a chance not to be missed, not be bungled either by resolving it." ...|$|R
60|$|The service began,--the well-remembered, {{beautiful}} {{appeal and}} prayers {{which she could}} still repeat, after a lapse of time, almost by heart; and their music and rhythm, the simple yet magnificent language {{in which they were}} clothed--her own language--awoke this morning a racial instinct strong in her,--she had not known how strong. Or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> in Hodder's voice that seemed to illumine the ancient words with a new meaning? Raising her eyes to the chancel she studied his head, and found in it still another expression of that race, the history of which had been one of protest, of development of its own character and personality. Her mind went back to her first talk with him, in the garden, and she saw how her intuition had recognized in him then the spirit of a people striving to assert itself.|$|E
60|$|Here {{let me say}} {{something}} at once. If this marvellous creature expected that the revelation of her splendour was going to make me her slave; to cause me {{to fall in love with}} her, as it is called, well, she must have been disappointed, for it had no such effect. It frightened and in a sense humbled me, that is all, for I felt myself to be in the presence of something that was not human, something alien to me as a man, which I could fear and even adore as humanity would adore that which is Divine, but with which I had no desire to mix. Moreover, was it divine, or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> very different? I did not know, I only knew that it was not for me; as soon should I have thought of asking for a star to set within my lantern.|$|E
60|$|Or <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> quite {{different}} from either of these, something vast and splendid {{beyond the reach of}} vision, something God-sent, beginning and ending in the Eternal Absolute and at last partaking of His attributes and nature and from aeon to aeon shot through with His light? And how was the truth to be learned? I asked my Eastern friends, and they talked vaguely of long ascetic preparation, of years upon years of learning, from whom I could not quite discover. I was sure it could not be from them, because clearly they did not know; they only passed on what they had heard elsewhere, when or how they either could not or would not explain. So at length I gave it up, having satisfied myself that all this was but an effort of Oriental imagination called into life by the sweet influences of the Eastern stars.|$|E

60|$|ZOO. Whatever you <b>are</b> doing, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> {{so utterly}} evil {{that if you}} do not stop I will kill you.|$|R
