A voltage sensor which separates common mode and differential mode in a three-phase setup combined with a 8 -channel digital oscilloscope allows measuring voltage and current via many samples in the three phases plus neutral. Using fast fourier transform for the data processing the conventional amplitude-as-function-of-frequency plots, similar to what would be obtained using conventional EMI receivers, can be generated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} crack depth of a rotor-bearing-disk system on {{vibration}} amplitudes is investigated. Two {{models of the}} crack, which are the breathing and the open crack models, are considered. Finite element models and general harmonic balance solutions are derived with either breathing or open cracks which are valid for damped and undamped rotor systems. It is found via <b>waterfall</b> <b>diagrams</b> of the system with a breathing crack and slight unbalance that there are critical pairs of crack depth and frequency of large vibration amplitudes at the backward whirling frequencies. These high vibration amplitudes at the backward whirl appear at earlier crack depths than those at the forward whirl for both crack models. Resonance peaks at the second, third and fourth sub-harmonic frequencies emerge as the crack depth increases. It is shown that the orbit changes {{can be used as}} an indication of breathing crack propagation in the shaft. In addition, the veering in the critical frequencies has been clearly noticed in the open crack case...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{nonlinear}} dynamics of circular cylindrical shells under axial static (compressive) and periodic resonant loads have been experimentally investigated, {{the goal is}} to study the dynamic scenario and to analyze nonlinear regimes. A special test rig has been developed for the experiment in order to apply a static axial load combined with a dynamic axial load. The setup allows for investigating the linear behavior under static preload by means of the usual modal testing techniques; moreover, it allows for analyzing the nonlinear response which occurs when the dynamic axial load is periodic and gives rise to complex resonances. The complex dynamics, arising when a periodic axial load excites the asymmetric (shell like) modes, are analyzed by means of amplitude frequency <b>diagrams,</b> <b>waterfall</b> spectrum <b>diagrams,</b> bifurcation diagrams of Poincaré maps; a deep analysis of time histories, spectra, phase portraits and Poincaré maps completes the study of the complex dynamic scenario...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{electric}} vehicle {{was subjected to}} on-road acoustic tests. A specific high frequency tone was perceived in a sound field dominated by wind and road noise. The car was instrumented with microphones which measured the noise inside the passenger compartment and with tachometers to record the motor’s rotational velocity with respect to time. <b>Waterfall</b> <b>diagrams</b> were generated by tracking the spectrums of noise from fixed time samples against the rpm of the motor. The analysis of the diagrams revealed that high orders, like the 24 th and 48 th {{were responsible for the}} sound. These orders represent the acoustic response of the electromagnetic interaction between the stator and the rotor of the electric motor. To analyze the propagation of noise from the source (motor) to the target (driver), a transfer path analysis (TPA), respectively an airborne source quantification (ASQ) were proposed. The TPA focused on the structure borne noise generated by the forces transmitted into the body through the powertrain supports, and the ASQ, on the airborne noise radiated by the surface of the motor and gearbox casing. The conclusion was that the airborne noise is the main contributor to the total pressure level in the passenger compartment, but at lower speeds a strong structure borne noise content is present. ...|$|R
40|$|Switched {{reluctance}} machines (SRMs) {{benefit from}} major advantages, such as cheap and robust construction and electrical fault tolerance, but also suffer from noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) issues. The present paper {{focuses on the}} NVH influence of the current hysteresis controller, which is generally used in SRM drives. The impact {{of changes in the}} controller sampling time is experimentally investigated on an 8 / 6 15 kW (30 kW peak) SRM. In practice the initial hysteresis controller, implemented on a dSPACE platform running at 10 kHz, is compared with an improved version running twenty times faster on external microcontrollers. Tests are performed in the form of run-ups, in order to study the drive in transient conditions and investigate a continuous speed range, while vibration, current and sound pressure waves are measured. Current waveforms are also simulated using AMESim software to compare with experimental measurements. Both controller implementations are modelled and both run-up and constant speed conditions are considered. To identify the frequency content related to the switching process, those simulation results are also analysed before and after having removed the current ripple due to switching through signal processing. Run-up results are plotted as <b>waterfall</b> <b>diagrams,</b> which both give a global overview of the frequency content for the considered speed range and allow distinguishing speed-order related harmonics and resonance frequencies. It is observed that the improved controller generates a shift of the spectrum towards higher frequencies with a global reduction of vibration and noise amplitude. Furthermore, the excitation of the dominating first ovalization mode of the SRM is considerably reduced. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{behavior}} of a rotor-bearing-SFD system with the inner race defect of bearing is investigated. The contact force between the rolling element and the race is calculated in Hertzian contact and elastohydrodynamic lubrication condition. The supporting force of the SFD is simulated by integrating the pressure distribution derived from Reynolds’s equation. The equations of motion of the rotor-bearing-SFD system are derived and solved using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The dynamic behavior and the fault characteristics are analyzed with two configurations of the SFD: (1) mounted on the unfaulted bearing and (2) mounted on the faulty bearing. According {{to the analysis of}} time-frequency <b>diagram,</b> <b>waterfall</b> plot, and spectral diagram, the results show that the characteristics of inner race defects on bearing frequencies are related to the characteristic multiple frequency of the inner race defect and the fundamental frequency. The speed and defect width have different influence on the distribution and amplitude of frequency. The SFD can enhance the system stability under the bearing fault but the enhancement decreases with the increasing speed. Meanwhile, the beneficial effect of the SFD varies according to the mounted position in the rotor system...|$|R
40|$|WD 1145 + 017 was {{observed}} from 2015 November to 2016 July {{for the purpose}} of characterizing transit behavior of the white dwarf by dust clouds thought to be produced by fragments of an asteroid in close orbit with the star. Fortuitously, most of these observations were carried out during a time when the overall `dip' activity was dramatically enhanced over that during its discovery with Kepler K 2. By the end of our reported observations the dip activity had declined to a level close to its K 2 discovery state. Three notable events were observed. In 2016 January a large number of dust clouds appeared that had an orbital period of 4. 4912 hours, and this event also marked the end of a 3 -month interval dominated by the K 2 `A' period. The second event was a 2016 April 21 appearance of four dip features with drift lines in a <b>waterfall</b> <b>diagram</b> (date vs. phase) that diverged from their origin date, at a location away from the `A' asteroid, and which lasted for two weeks. The third event was the sudden appearance of a dip feature with a period of 4. 6064 hours, which is essentially the same as the K 2 `B' period. The evolution of dip shape, depth, and total fade amount provide constraints on dust production and loss mechanisms. Collisions can account for the sudden appearance of dust clouds, and the sudden increase in dust amount, but another mechanism for continual dust production is also required.

40|$|In case {{of active}} {{magnetic}} bearing power failures or high transient overloads, the fast spinning rotor interacts with the auxiliary bearing. A critical motion is possible, called backward whirl. It can produce very high loads on rotor and bearings, {{which can lead to}} the destruction of the machine. Therefore, it is important to make numerical and experimental investigations of {{active magnetic bearing}}s (AMBs) supported rotor system with auxiliary bearings. The models for the AMBs supported rotor with auxiliary bearing system are introduced. The theoretical method for estimation equivalent stiffness and damping of the AMB is developed in this work. The dynamic equivalent stiffness and damping of the AMB-rotor system is calculated from the knowledge of frequency response of the digitally controlled AMB. In this work, plenty experiments have been made to explore which factors or parameters are essential for the system performance. Some modifications and extensions of the hardware and software of the test rig have been done. Several important parameters of system such as stiffness and damping have been estimated through frequency domain and time domain methods by analyzing the experimental results. These parameters were used in numerical simulations. Under some specific designed cases, it is found that the rotor undergoes a complicated motion behavior, the backward whirl. The experiment results have been presented and analyzed. The detailed models of the AMBs supported rotor interacting with the auxiliary bearing system are introduced, which considered discontinuous stiffness caused by bearing clearance effect, nonlinear Hertzian contact and Coulomb friction forces. Furthermore, according to the real test rig, the auxiliary bearings could be modeled as fixed and compliant mounted. The rotor is modeled as rigid mass or rigid beam by paying regard to its operation range. Several groups of differential equations are presented and the numerical simulation method is developed for the nonlinear time variant ODEs based on event functions in MATLAB. Numerical investigations as time history, orbit diagram, Poincaré section <b>diagram</b> and <b>waterfall</b> spectrum <b>diagram</b> are proposed to study the complex dynamic response of the system. It is found that the AMB-rotor-auxiliary bearing system undergoes complicated motion behaviors including chaotic motion. The bifurcation analysis results are presented, to explore which factors or parameters are essential to system performance then find an appropriate optimized design to prevent it. The important parameters studies on the rotor driving frequency, the support and contact stiffness are carried out through bifurcation analysis. The complicated motions of rotor are observed by changing the control parameters...|$|R
