5|$|In Jönköping, a {{memorial}} {{in honour of}} Bauer stands in the Town park, which was created in 1931 by Swedish sculptor Carl Hultström. Hultström also made a bust in bronze of Bauer, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> in the National Portrait Gallery at Gripsholm Castle.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E

5|$|Like the LP12, the Xerxes has a two-piece platter–sub-platter {{configuration}} on <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> a thin felt mat. And {{while the}} LP12's platters {{are made of}} mazak, the Xerxes' platters are of aluminium. The outer platter is rigid and peripherally weighted. However, the Roksan's outer platter weighs {{less than half of}} that of the LP12, to reduce load on the main bearing, yet is able to achieve a greater inertia because of its weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|Marsh {{was born}} into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales. His surname {{is believed to have}} possibly derived from that of Francis Henry Marsh, whose property Camira was separated from Yulgilbar by the Richmond Range. Details of Marsh's itinerant pre-cricket life are scarce, because Aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with others because he was illiterate.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the centre}} of the village are two public houses: the Star Inn, which was {{licensed}} in 1848, opposite the village green, and the Sun Inn, which was licensed beginning in 1838, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> at the top of Sun Hill, on the road to Alton. There was a third pub in the village called the Moon Inn (also known as the Half Moon) which was demolished around 1948; just north of the church in Drury Lane.|$|E

5|$|The Xerxes.20 which {{superseded}} the Xerxes.X in 2005 incorporated new {{main bearing}} {{ball and the}} new Rmat-5 sub-plinth. The bearing, attached to the inner platter, has an unusually small-diameter hardened-steel spindle, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> {{on top of a}} tungsten ball that measures 2mm and is machined to a tolerance in the order of micrometres. The corresponding housing is made of bronze. The two-piece platter, when fit together, are snug and will not resonate.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-three bais, or forest clearings, {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Nki National Park. In April 2006, while looking for elephant groups, a WWF team discovered the largest bai in the region, Ikwa Bai. Dr. Mike Loomis, {{a member of the}} group, confirmed that this bai is slightly larger than Dzanga Sangha Bai (Central African Republic), which had previously held the record. He also reported little human development adjacent to the bai, and noticed 21 elephants and 16 buffaloes in it simultaneously. The bai has a small creek running through its center, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> atop a bed of rocks and sand. A large mineral pit is located next to the stream. It is the habitat of several wildlife species, the largest-numbering being chimpanzees, elephants, buffaloes, and gorillas.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{street of}} Kuching is the Main Bazaar, {{a row of}} 19th century Chinese shophouses located along the Kuching Waterfront {{overlooking}} the Sarawak River. It offers the city's best concentration of antique and handicraft shops. The Main Bazaar is part of Kuching's old town, which also includes the Carpenter Street and India Street. The old Courthouse building, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> in between Carpenter Street and India Street, has undergone major renovation and now houses the Sarawak Tourism Board complex. Some other interesting areas around the central business district include Padungan Street, which is the Chinatown of Kuching.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface {{platforms}} opened in 1868 by the District Railway (DR) {{as part of}} the company's first section of the Inner Circle route and deep level platforms opened in 1999 {{as part of the}} Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford. A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, but the original station was completely rebuilt in conjunction with the construction of the deep level platforms and Portcullis House, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> above the station.|$|E
5|$|Today's DeKalb County Courthouse is {{the third}} {{in a line of}} {{structures}} to carry that name. In 1839 a log structure was built and called the county courthouse; the log building stood {{across the street from the}} current courthouse. Ten years later, in 1850, the second DeKalb County Courthouse was erected. From December 13, 1902 until April 17, 1924, DeKalb-Sycamore Electric Traction Company operated a trolley route between the two cities (DeKalb and Sycamore), which ended at the DeKalb County Courthouse. The current courthouse, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> on the same site as the 1850 building, was erected in 1905.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{gambling}} in Omaha {{is limited to}} keno, lotteries, and parimutuel betting, leaving Omahans to drive across the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where casinos are legal and there are numerous businesses operating currently. Recently a controversial proposal by the Ponca tribe of Nebraska {{was approved by the}} National Indian Gaming Commission. It will allow the tribe to build a casino in Carter Lake, Iowa, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> geographically {{on the west side of}} the Missouri River, adjacent to Omaha, where casinos are illegal.|$|E
5|$|When Japan's {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 led to U.S. entry into World War II, blood donor projects, stamp and bond drives, and the {{dedication}} of service flags gave the City College a wartime atmosphere. More than three-quarters of the students participated in the Victory Corps, which sponsored courses in communications, map reading, judo {{and the study of}} the poisonous and non-poisonous plants on Pacific islands. By the time the war ended in 1945, 4,667 City College students had served in the armed forces, 204 of whom lost their lives. The names of all of the fallen, including two Medal of Honor recipients, are inscribed on a bronze memorial, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> today {{in the center of the}} school.|$|E
5|$|Attica is a war-torn city {{under assault}} by the Persian Empire and their pet basilisk, {{and is the}} site of Eurybiades' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog of the Dream God, Morpheus. Just beyond the city is the Temple of Helios, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> atop the Sun Chariot, which has {{plummeted}} to Earth in Helios' absence. Boreas, Zephyros, Euros, and Notos, gods of the north, west, east, and south winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is an underground cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess Eos, the Primordial Fires, and a statue of Triton. The Underworld is the underground realm of the dead and is host to the River Styx and ferryman of the dead, Charon. Tartarus is the prison of the dead and the Titans where the massive Titan Hyperion is chained. The Fields of Elysium are home to deserving souls that roam peacefully and are overlooked by the Temple of Persephone.|$|E

[...] The small basin serves as the venue for a 20 foot tall water spouting jet. The water then proceeds to spill over the small basin and {{over the edge of the}} other basins, eventually over and into the granite basin. Surrounding the fountain is a seven foot wide granite walkway and a semi-circular granite bench.|$|R

5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of Exmouth, the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> {{at the mouth of the}} River Sid. Access to the beach is via a wooden {{staircase}} known as Jacob's ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon AONB. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid. The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along the tops of the cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer, with Beer Quarry Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis.|$|E
5|$|The {{religion}} {{was born in}} Iran, where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception. It grew from the mid-19th century Bábí religion, whose founder taught that God would soon send a prophet {{in the manner of}} Jesus or Muhammad. In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Bahá'u'lláh announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of Akka in the Ottoman province of Syria, in what is now Israel. Following Bahá'u'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son `Abdu'l-Bahá (1844-1921), and later his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957). Bahá'ís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national Spiritual Assemblies that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the Universal House of Justice, the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Bahá'í community, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> in Haifa, Israel near the shrine of Báb.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} section of the Jubilee line was planned in the 1970s, {{the second phase of the}} project was {{intended}} to continue the line eastwards from the terminus at Charing Cross to the City of London, Woolwich and Thamesmead. Westminster station would not have been on this planned route, but the need to provide transport infrastructure for the redevelopment of the London Docklands in east and south-east London led to a redirection of the route to run via Westminster to connect Waterloo and London Bridge stations with the new developments. For the Jubilee Line Extension, the buildings around the station were demolished and the sub-surface station was completely reconstructed together with the erection of a parliamentary office building, Portcullis House, <b>which</b> <b>sits</b> above the station. Both projects were designed by Michael Hopkins & Partners.|$|E
