5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> advantage that {{as few as}} 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to get started presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E

5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Newburgh {{writing in}} the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey’s early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{paternal}} and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou. Henry’s brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.|$|E
5|$|English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Yardley's {{decision}} {{was regarded as}} a surprise; although The Oval had traditionally been a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> advantage. Jack Fingleton speculated that Australia would have bowled first if Bradman had won the toss. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, England were dismissed for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Gianna Maria Canale {{took the}} female {{lead in the}} film despite not {{initially}} wanting the role. The film {{was the last of}} her many films she made with Freda. Freda and Canale had first worked together on Il cavaliere misterioso (1948); their relationship led to Freda leaving his wife to go with Canale to Brazil where they made two more films. On their return to Italy, Canale <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> female lead role in nearly all his films including The Iron Swordsman, Sins of Rome and Theodora, Slave Empress.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the 5th and 8th King's (Liverpool Irish) {{received}} specialist {{training at}} Ayrshire {{in preparation for}} a planned invasion of France. They had been selected to form the nucleus of the 5th and 7th Beach Groups, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> objectives of maintaining beach organisation, securing positions, and providing defence against counter-attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{after the}} Rockets won a coin toss against the Baltimore Bullets to {{determine}} who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> first overall pick in the 1968 NBA Draft, they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston. Hayes led the team to the franchise's first ever playoff appearance in 1969, but the Rockets lost in the semi-finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks, four games to two. In 1970 NBA Draft, the Rockets drafted Calvin Murphy and Rudy Tomjanovich, who would both spend their whole careers with the Rockets.|$|E

5|$|In August 1989, Cranor {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees: PepsiCo could take over weak franchises, existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets, and PepsiCo <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to increase royalty fees. The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees, who countered with a lawsuit, and the issue was not resolved until 1996. PepsiCo was accused of behaving in an imperious manner towards franchisees, who it believed were holding back the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been {{the backbone of the}} company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners.|$|E
5|$|La Fleche's stable companion, Orme, was {{regarded}} as {{the best of the}} year's two-year-old colts, and there was speculation as to which of the two was the better. It was also generally believed that La Fleche <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Derby as her principal target for the following year.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
500|$|A {{victory for}} Arsenal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> brought <b>the</b> two teams level on points. An Arsenal victory by two clear goals <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given them <b>the</b> title on goals scored, as <b>the</b> two teams <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been tied on goal {{difference}} at +37. A three-goal deficit or more <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won Arsenal <b>the</b> title on goal difference. Any other result (i.e. a Liverpool victory, a draw or an Arsenal win by one goal) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given <b>the</b> title to Liverpool.|$|R

5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{had issued}} {{the first of}} its twice-daily reports at {{approximately}} 8:00a.m.; it did not send another report to Washington, D.C. until 8:00p.m. This proved to be a serious problem: the storm <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> better part of a day to build up hurricane forces before the Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C., would have detailed information.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of nobelium is incompletely characterized {{and is known}} only in aqueous solution, in which it can take on the +3 or +2 oxidation states, the latter being more stable. It was largely expected before the discovery of nobelium that in solution, it would behave like the other actinides, with the trivalent state being predominant; however, Seaborg predicted in 1949 that the +2 state would also be relatively stable for nobelium, as the No2+ ion <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ground-state electron configuration 5f14, including the stable filled 5f14 shell. It took nineteen years before this prediction was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The electoral {{conditions}} were announced as such: The election 67 districts {{were reduced to}} 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing no one who held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> money to enter candidates. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections {{that they did not}} consider fair.|$|E
