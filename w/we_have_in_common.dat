2500|$|From {{an early}} age, Alice was {{interested}} in politics. When advancing age and illness incapacitated her Aunt Bamie, Alice stepped into her place as an unofficial political adviser to her father. She warned her father against challenging the renomination of William Howard Taft in 1912. Alice took a hard-line view of the Democrats and in her youth sympathized with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. She supported her half-brother Ted {{when he ran for}} governor of New York in 1924. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for president in [...] 1932, Alice publicly opposed his candidacy. Writing in the Ladies' Home Journal in October 1932, she said of FDR, [...] "Politically, his branch of the family and ours have always been in different camps, and the same surname is about all <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.....</b> I am a Republican..... I am going to vote for Hoover..... If I were not a Republican, I would still vote for Mr. Hoover this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to his essay, [...] "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", in Christians Among the Virtues, he {{said that}} Christians are called to be patient {{patients}} in sickness and in health because [...] "patience is integral to the Christian life". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with God. [...] "In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity." [...] He also says that God showed us {{the best example of}} patience {{when it comes to the}} life of Jesus. Because God is the foundation, Hauerwas stated that “only patience shaped by Christ is true patience". As well as this, he later emphasized that patience is not developed by human will, but given through the Holy Spirit, who gives us the capacity to love, for “without [...] in us there cannot be patience because in good men it is the [...] of God which endures all things.” In the author’s essay, he gave people a framework of how to learn to practice patience when we are not sick: ...|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{the only}} thing (besides, of course, our common mortality) which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with the excursionists is our love of the trolley-line.

After a year of fervent opposition and protest, the whole community--whether of summer or of winter folks--now gladly accepts the trolley, and the grandest cottager and the lowliest hotel dweller meet in a grateful appreciation of its beauty and comfort.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Pitt is also gone! by tens of {{thousands}} looked upon in like manner as a great loss. For my own part, as probably you know, I {{have never been able}} to regard his political life with complacency. I believe him, however, to have been as disinterested a man, and as true a lover of his country, as it was possible for so ambitious a man to be. His first wish (though probably unknown to himself) was that his country should prosper under his administration; his next that it should prosper. Could the order of these wishes have been reversed, Mr. Pitt would have avoided many of the grievous mistakes into which, I think, he fell. I know, my dear Sir George, you will give me credit for speaking without arrogance; and I am aware it is not unlikely you may differ greatly from me in these points. But I like, in some things, to differ with a friend, and that he should know I differ from him; it seems to make a more healthy friendship, to act as a relief to those notions and feelings which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> and to give them a grace and spirit which they could not otherwise possess.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the most}} INTERESTING life," [...] she {{corrected}} herself. She {{looked at her}} daughter {{with a look of}} vague alarm. It was the kind of maternal scrutiny which suggests that, in looking at her daughter a mother is really looking at herself. She was not altogether satisfied; but she purposely made no attempt to break down the reserve which, as a matter of fact, was a quality she particularly admired and depended upon in her daughter. But when her mother said that marriage was the most interesting life, Katharine felt, as she was apt to do suddenly, for no definite reason, that they understood each other, in spite of differing in every possible way. Yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply more to feelings which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> {{with the rest of the}} human race than to our feelings as individuals, and Katharine knew that only some one of her own age could follow her meaning. Both these elderly women seemed to her to have been content with so little happiness, and at the moment she had not sufficient force to feel certain that their version of marriage was the wrong one. In London, certainly, this temperate attitude toward her own marriage had seemed to her just. Why had she now changed? Why did it now depress her? It never occurred to her that her own conduct could be anything of a puzzle to her mother, or that elder people are as much affected by the young as the young are by them. And yet it was true that love--passion--whatever one chose to call it, had played far less part in Mrs. Hilbery's life than might have seemed likely, judging from her enthusiastic and imaginative temperament. She had always been more interested by other things. Lady Otway, strange though it seemed, guessed more accurately at Katharine's state of mind than her mother did.|$|E

They do vicious cultural work and suggest that these people are not like us. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> nothing <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> And not only do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> nothing <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> but their behaviors and their traits are so deplorable that we don't want to <b>have</b> anything <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with them.
