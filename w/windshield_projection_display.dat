40|$|International audienceProjection displays, {{compared}} to other modern display technologies, have many unique advantages. However, the image quality assessment of <b>projection</b> <b>displays</b> has not been well studied so far. In this paper, we propose an objective approach to measure the relative contrast of <b>projection</b> <b>displays</b> based on the pictures taken with a calibrated digital camera {{in a dark room}} where the projector is the only light source. A set of carefully selected natural images is modified to generate multiple levels of image contrast. In order to enhance the validity, reliability, and robustness of our research, we performed the experiments in similar viewing conditions at two separate geographical locations with different <b>projection</b> <b>displays.</b> In each location, we had a group of observers to give perceptual ratings. Further, we adopted state-of-art contrast measures to evaluate the relative contrast of the acquired images. The experimental results suggest that the Michelson contrast measure performs the worst, as expected, while other global contrast measures perform relatively better, but they have less correlation with the perceptual ratings than local contrast measures. The local contrast measures perform better than global contrast measures for all test images, but all contrast measures failed on the test images with low luminance or dominant colors and without texture areas. In addition, the high correlations between the experimental results for the two <b>projections</b> <b>displays</b> indicate that our proposed assessment approach is valid, reliable, and consistent...|$|R
40|$|As the {{development}} of microelectronic technology, flat-panel microdisplay has become a reality. The microdisplay can be applied on both the <b>projection</b> <b>display</b> and personal viewer systems. The advantage of microdisplay are high resolution, high integration, high bandwidth and very low power consumption. The conventional microdisplay is a monochrome display. In order to achieve full color, color-separation prism and three panels are used for <b>projection</b> <b>display,</b> and color sequential technique is used for personal viewer. The former requires a very precise alignment of three panels. The latter requires a high data refresh rate and limits the resolution of microdisplay. In this thesis, I applied micro color filters on microdisplay to achieve full color. This technology was compatible with microelectronic technology. The line width of micro color filter can be as fine as 3 μm. The micro color filter on chip had a very flat topographic surface, which is very critical to the latter liquid crystal alignment. The micro color filter had a high temperature and light stability, a good color saturation, for the requirements of color <b>projection</b> <b>display.</b> Reflective mode liquid crystal cell was further applied on the micro color filter chip. The contrast ratio of projection system was as high as 190, 240 and 90 for red, green and blue pixels under white light illuminating, respectively.

40|$|Abstract- Electronic <b>projection</b> <b>display</b> {{technology}} had {{its origin}} in the Oil film projector system. Developed in the early 1940 s oil film projectors have been the workhorse for applications that require <b>projection</b> <b>displays</b> of the highest brightness. But due to various limitations a number of solid state technologies have challenged the oil firm projector, including CRT-LCD light valves and active-matrix- LCD panels. In response to various limitations of the LCD technologies and to provide superior image quality, high brightness <b>projection</b> <b>display</b> systems have been developed based on Digital Light Processing technology. DLP {{is based on the}} Digital Micro Mirror Device (DMD), a Micro Electro Mechanical System, invented in 1987 by Larry Hornbeck at Texas Instruments. DMD is a fast, reflective digital light switch that precisely controls a light source using a binary pulsewidth modulation technique. It can be combined with image processing, memory, a light source, and optics to form a DLP system capable of projecting large, bright, high contrast colour images with better colour fidelity and consistency than current displays. This paper describes the structure, working, operation, advantages and future use of the DLP system.

40|$|Abstract. Electromagnetic optical {{scanning}} mirrors for both {{horizontal and vertical}} scanning of a Laser <b>Projection</b> <b>Display</b> have been proposed. Electromagnetic actuation is selected because of the millimeter-sized mirror. For low cost reason, the glass and PMMA films are respectively used as the main structure of horizontal and vertical scanning mirrors. A mathematical model considering the operation frequency of the Laser <b>Projection</b> <b>Display</b> has been derived to fast design the geometry of the scanning mirror. In order to machine scanning mirrors with high quality geometry, the 193 nm excimer laser is used as the major machine tool. Different control circuits {{have been developed to}} control both horizontal and vertical scanning. The scanning frequencies, 4. 15 kHz and 260 Hz respectively for horizontal and vertical scanning mirrors, have been measured by laser Doppler vibrometer. Comparing to other optical scanners, 193 nm excimer laser machined {{optical scanning}} mirrors have advantages in low cost and easy to fabricate. In this paper, a Laser <b>Projection</b> <b>Display</b> consisting of the horizontal and vertical scanning mirrors has also been built to show the application potential.
