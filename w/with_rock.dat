5|$|A jazz fusion album, Songs of Experience explores darker sounds {{than its}} predecessor, as the poems Axelrod drew on for {{inspiration}} {{dealt with the}} darker side of humanity. Its music was partly inspired by composer Gunther Schuller's Third Stream concept. Axelrod composed Baroque orchestrations <b>with</b> <b>rock,</b> R, pop, and folk music elements.|$|E
5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} their second album, the Clash {{had started to}} depart from the punk rock sound. While touring in the United States twice in 1979, they chose {{supporting}} acts such as rhythm and blues artists Bo Diddley, Sam & Dave, Lee Dorsey, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, as well as neotraditional country artist Joe Ely and punk rockabilly band the Cramps. This developed fascination <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> and roll inspired their approach for London Calling.|$|E

5|$|Before the first-section groundbreaking, in 1937 {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} sent workers {{to assess the}} former railroad tunnels. In September of that year, a contract was awarded to drain water from the tunnels. After this, workers cleared rock slides and vegetation from the tunnel portals before evaluating the nine tunnels' condition. It was decided that six of the nine former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels {{could be used for}} the roadway. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was in too poor a condition for use, and the Quemahoning and Negro Mountain tunnels would be bypassed <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> cuts through the mountains; The Quemahoning Tunnel had been completed and used by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad.|$|E

5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The {{upper body}} {{was covered by}} a short jacket that was filled <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> salt, and the forearms and legs were {{protected}} with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.|$|E
5|$|During {{its history}} {{spanning}} seven centuries, the castle {{was owned by}} a succession of seven families. One of the owners, the count Lafaurie of Monbadon, peer of France, was a catalyst {{to the construction of}} the Eiffel bridge. In March 1891, the Quancard brothers Jean and Eugène bought the property for 110 000 francs, and the Quancard family remains the last owners. The purchase came after a severe phylloxera outbreak, causing the death of over half of French vineyards, devalued the property. The land area was covered mostly <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> until the Quancard brothers used explosives to remove it, and large amounts of clay-limestone soil, known to be beneficial for the wine produce, was brought to replace it.|$|E

5|$|Folk-rock {{drew on the}} {{sporadic}} mainstream {{success of}} groups like the Kingston Trio and the Almanac Singers, while Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger helped to politically radicalize rural white folk music. The popular musician Bob Dylan rose to prominence {{in the middle of}} the 1960s, fusing folk <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> and making the nascent scene closely connected to the Civil Rights Movement. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands like The Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers and folk-oriented singer-songwriters like Joan Baez and the Canadian Joni Mitchell. However, by the end of the decade, there was little political or social awareness evident in the lyrics of pop-singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, whose self-penned songs were deeply personal and emotional.|$|E

5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad line, {{part of the}} Feather River Route, that {{parallels}} the cut-off was built between 1906 and 1907, filling a causeway <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> and gravel at a great cost. Along the route across the Great Salt Lake Desert, the railroad served the communities of Arinosa, Barro, and Salduro, which were also served by the new road. The Union Pacific Railroad merged with the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Western Pacific in December 1982.|$|E

5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in <b>with</b> <b>rock,</b> dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E
5|$|Because the Supremes {{were popular}} with white {{audience}}s {{as well as}} with black ones, Gordy had the group cater to its middle American audience with performances at renowned supper clubs such as the Copacabana in New York. Broadway and pop standards were incorporated into their repertoire alongside their own hit songs. As a result, the Supremes {{became one of the first}} black musical acts to achieve complete and sustained crossover success. Black rock and roll musicians of the 1950s had seen many of their original hit tunes covered by white musicians, with these covers usually achieving more fame and sales success than the originals. The Supremes' success, however, counteracted this trend. Featuring three group members who were marketed for their individual personalities (a move unprecedented at the time) and Diana Ross's pop-friendly voice, the Supremes broke down racial barriers <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> and roll songs underpinned by R stylings. The group became extremely popular both domestically and abroad, becoming one of the first black musical acts to appear regularly on television programs such as Hullabaloo, The Hollywood Palace, The Della Reese Show, and, most notably, The Ed Sullivan Show, on which they made 17 appearances. The Supremes' cross-cultural success effectively paved the way for the mainstream success of contemporaneous label mates such as the Temptations, the Four Tops and the Jackson 5.|$|E
5|$|Following the band's first {{performances}} with Skiba in 2015, Barker {{alluded to}} a potential tour <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> group A Day to Remember. Performances promoting California began on May 14, 2016 with the group's surprise appearance at KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California. Prior to the main headlining tour, the group embarked on the We Are Pirates Tour, performing at several festivals and amphitheaters between May and July 2016. The festivals included X Games Austin 2016, Firefly Music Festival, Big Field Day, Amnesia Rockfest, and Kerfuffle 2016. Hoppus and Skiba also performed several acoustic sets in England in June 2016. The main tour behind California began on July 21 in San Diego and its North American leg concluded on October 7 in Irvine. The trek was supported by A Day to Remember, {{as well as the}} All-American Rejects, All Time Low, and DJ Spider. Afterwards, the group again performed acoustic sets in the U.K., and also performed at various festivals and events, including Not So Silent Night, Holiday Havoc, Wrex the Halls, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band also played the AT Developer Summit and the Phoenix Open in early 2017.|$|E

5|$|In one of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} on the mountain in over thirty years, six climbers—two guides, and four clients—last heard from on May28, 2014, were presumed dead on May31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along <b>with</b> <b>rock</b> and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.|$|E
5|$|On January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Punk {{defended the}} WWE Championship against The Rock in a match stipulated that if The Shield interfered, Punk would be {{stripped}} of the title. Punk originally pinned The Rock to retain after The Shield put Rock through a table while the arena lights were out. Vince McMahon began {{to announce that}} Punk would be stripped of the title, but he instead restarted the match at The Rock's request. Punk went on to lose the match, ending his record-setting reign at 434 days. Punk received a title rematch <b>with</b> <b>Rock</b> on February 17 at the Elimination Chamber event, stipulated that the Rock would lose the WWE Championship if he was disqualified or counted out, but Rock pinned Punk to retain the title. On the February 25 episode of Raw, Punk faced Royal Rumble winner John Cena for his number one contendership to the WWE Championship, but lost.|$|E
5|$|When Deep Purple's first line-up came {{together}} in 1967, {{there was a moment}} of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music <b>with</b> <b>rock,</b> using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, in line with the hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.|$|E

40|$|General EcologyThe {{possible}} commensal {{relationship between}} benthic algae and zebra mussels occupying the same rocky substrate was studied at Douglas Lake in Pellston, Michigan. Chlorophyll a tests {{were used to}} analyze benthic algae concentrations on three different treatments: <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> live zebra mussels, <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> dead zebra mussels, and <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> no zebra mussels with expectations to find that <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> zebra mussels have higher benthic algae concentrations than <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> no zebra mussels, and <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> live zebra mussels have higher benthic algae density than <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> dead zebra mussels. The study was divided into field survey, field study and laboratory study. In the field survey, I observed a trend that showed higher benthic algae concentration on <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> zebra mussels; however, it was statistically insignificant. I compared the chlorophyll a concentration found on <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> live and dead zebra mussels <b>with</b> <b>rocks</b> without zebra mussels for the field and laboratory studies, and found {{a significant difference in}} the field study, which showed that <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> zebra mussels had higher benthic algae concentration. Finally, I compared <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> live zebra mussels and dead zebra mussels and found an insignificant difference between the two treatments for the field and laboratory study, even though the trends showed a higher concentration of benthic algae on <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> dead zebra mussels. Since <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> zebra mussels showed a higher concentration of benthic algae in general, a commensal relationship between the two organisms is possible...|$|R
