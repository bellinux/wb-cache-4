5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{landings}} on 17September were successful, over {{the night of}} 17–18September, divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>missing</b> so Brigadier Philip Hicks of 1st Airlanding Brigade assumed command of the division on September18. Subsequent problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge as strong German defences had stopped the other battalions. Hicks decided that the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment and 11 Para would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} reach their objective.|$|E

Continuing to intensify, the hurricane attained major hurricane strength, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane {{off the coast of}} Mexico. Shortly before landfall, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane, and it dissipated on October 5. Damage was generally minimal, though one person <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>missing.</b>|$|E

A post-mortem soon confirmed he had drowned. In an inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court on 20 July, Coroner John Sampson recorded a verdict of accidental death. It had been assumed in several reports of his death that, while trying {{to make his way}} home by dinghy from The Wibbley Wobbley to his houseboat The Sea Sovereign just fifteen yards away across Greenland Dock, Hardee had lost his balance and drowned while drunk. But the Coroner found that, whilst attempting to access The Sea Sovereign from the quayside, Hardee had fallen into the dock while drunk.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to captain, Holden {{finished}} {{the war as}} an instructor with No.6 (Training) Squadron in England, where his work earned him the Air Force Cross. After leaving the Australian Flying Corps in 1919, he became a manager at the family firm of Holden's Motor Body Builders and joined the part-time Citizen Air Force, before setting up as a commercial pilot and establishing his own air service. In 1929, he located Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm in the north-west Australian desert after the pair <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>missing</b> on a flight to England in the Southern Cross. Holden began transport operations in New Guinea in 1931. He was killed the following year in a passenger plane crash in Australia.|$|E
5|$|SG 4′s {{mission was}} also a disaster. During the {{assembly}} phase, they flew across JG 11′s flight path, and the formation was broken up. Some of the pilots joined JG 11 in the confusion. Unable to recover the formation, I and II./SG 4 then decided to head home. The Kommodore, Druschel, had continued with five other pilots from III./SG 4 who had lost contact with their Gruppe. They crossed the front near Hürtgenwald around 09:10. As they did so, American anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, claiming seven aircraft in the next 30 minutes. Only six of the 50 Fw 190s of SG 4 carried out an attack, against airfields near Aachen and the Asch aerodrome. Of these six, four did not return. Druschel himself <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>missing.</b>|$|E
