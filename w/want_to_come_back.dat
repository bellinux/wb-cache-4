In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making.

His performances throughout the season were highly lauded, and he received standing ovations both in Barcelona at the Camp Nou, as well as from rival supporters in away matches. A leg injury sustained in mid-November 2008 left Iniesta sidelined until 3 January; initially expected to return to action in six weeks, he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> until he was 100 percent.

The time established a new Equatoguinean swimming record in the discipline. Moussambani was the sole competing swimmer after the heat's two other competitors were disqualified for false starts. He used a large amount of energy in the first 50 metres, and as his legs stiffened, his pace reduced. Officials decided against retrieving him from the pool after he was observed to sink below the water shortly before finishing and he was cheered by the crowd throughout. Overall Moussambani finished 71st (and last) out of all athletes, and did not progress into the semi-finals after finishing one minute and 2.91 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later rounds. After completing the event, he said that it was [...] "a very special moment" [...] of which he would not forget and the crowd cheering motivated him to finish: [...] "Gold medal is not everything in the Olympics.

500|$|In 2008, at the 30 Years of Terror Convention, Halloween {{producer}} Malek Akkad {{confirmed that}} {{a sequel to}} Rob Zombie's 2007 film was in the works. French filmmakers Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo were in negotiations to direct the sequel in November 2008, but on December 15, 2008 Variety reported that Rob Zombie had officially signed on to write and direct the Halloween sequel. In an interview, Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first Halloween made him not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for a sequel, but {{after a year of}} cooling down he was more open to the idea.

Producer Malek Akkad said the original intention, when they believed Zombie was not returning, was to create a [...] "normal sequel". Akkad and his Trancus producing company hired various writers to come up with drafts for a new film, but none worked. Akkad and the Weinstein brothers then turned to Bustillo and Muary, whose film Inside had recently been bought for distribution by the Weinstein Company. According to Akkad, the producers really wanted Zombie to return, as Akkad felt that there was something [...] "lost in the translation" [...] when the French filmmakers took over the project. After his work on the 2007 remake, Zombie had earned the trust of Akkad, who told him to ignore any rules they had set for him on the previous film.

Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a {{creative}} outlet. He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony. [...] "I know what you need – you need your band," [...] Wentz told Stump. [...] "I think it's kind of weird that we haven't really seen each other this year. We paid for each other's houses and you don't know my kid," [...] Wentz remarked. The result, [...] "three or four" [...] new songs, were shelved with near immediacy, with the two concluding that [...] "it just wasn't right and didn't feel right." [...] Several months later, the two reconvened and wrote tracks that they felt truly represented the band in a modern form. The band decided that if a comeback was in order, it must represent the band in its current form: [...] "We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> just to bask in the glory days and, like, and collect a few checks and pretend ... and do our best 2003 impersonation," [...] said Stump. Afterwards, the quartet held an all-day secret meeting at their manager's home in New York City where they discussed ideas and the mechanics of getting together to record. Trohman was the last to be contacted, through a three-hour phone call from Stump. As Trohman was arguably the most excited to begin other projects, he had a list of stipulations for rejoining the band. [...] "If I'm not coming back to this band writing music [...] then I don't want to," [...] he remarked. Stump supported Trohman's ambition saying Trohman [...] "needed to be writing more." ...|$|E
