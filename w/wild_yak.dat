5|$|The {{domestication}} of bovids {{has contributed}} in shifting {{the dependence of}} human beings from hunting and gathering to agriculture. The Bovidae include {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats; all are from Eurasia, and are now found across the world. The other two species are the horse and pig. Other large bovids that have been domesticated but which remain within the ranges of their wild ancestors are the water buffalo (from the Indian water buffalo), domestic yak (from the <b>wild</b> <b>yak),</b> zebu (from the Indian aurochs), gayal (from the gaur) and Bali cattle (from the banteng).|$|E
5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and <b>Wild</b> <b>yak</b> (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E

40|$|Aim We {{aimed to}} examine the phylogeographical {{structure}} and demographic history of domestic and <b>wild</b> <b>yaks</b> (Bos grunniens) based {{on a wide range}} of samples and complete mitochondrial genomic sequences. Location The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) of western China. Methods All available D-loop sequences for 405 domesticated <b>yaks</b> and 47 <b>wild</b> <b>yaks</b> were examined, including new sequences from 96 domestic and 34 <b>wild</b> <b>yaks.</b> We further sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of 48 domesticated and 21 <b>wild</b> <b>yaks.</b> Phylogeographical analyses were performed using the mitochondrial D-loop and the total genome datasets. Results We recovered a total of 123 haplotypes based on the D-loop sequences in <b>wild</b> and domestic <b>yaks.</b> Phylogenetic analyses of this dataset and the mitochondrial genome data suggested three well-supported and divergent lineages. Two lineages with six D-loop haplogroups were recovered for all morphological breeds of domestic yaks across their distributions in the QTP, while one more lineage and more endemic haplogroups or haplotypes were found for <b>wild</b> <b>yaks.</b> Based on the mitochondrial genome data, the divergences of the three lineages were estimated to have occurred around 420, 000 and 580, 000 years ago, consistent with the geological records of two large glaciation events experienced in the QTP. Main conclusions There are distinct phylogeographical differences between <b>wild</b> and domestic <b>yaks.</b> However, there is no apparent geographical correlation between identified haplogroups and distributions of domestic yaks. Three differentiated lineages of yaks probably evolved allopatrically in different regions during the Pleistocene glaciation events, then reunited into a single gene pool during post-glacial population expansion and migrations before the start of the domestication of yaks in the Holocene.

50|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>yaks</b> are herd animals. Herds {{can contain}} several hundred individuals, {{although}} many are much smaller. Herds consist primarily of females and their young, {{with a smaller}} number of adult males. The remaining males are either solitary, or found in much smaller groups, averaging around six individuals. Groups move into lower altitude ranges during the winter. Although <b>wild</b> <b>yaks</b> can become aggressive when defending young, or during the rut, they generally avoid humans, and may rapidly flee for great distances if any approach.|$|R
25|$|The {{domestic}} yak (Bos grunniens) is a long-haired domesticated bovid {{found throughout the}} Himalayan region of the Indian subcontinent, the Tibetan Plateau and {{as far north as}} Mongolia and Russia. It is descended from the <b>wild</b> <b>yak</b> (Bos mutus).|$|E
25|$|The zoo has also, in the past, {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} criticism for keeping single and unpaired specimens of rare species like the banteng, great Indian one-horned rhinoceros, crowned crane and the lion-tailed macaque. Lack of breeding and exchange programs has led to the elimination of individuals and populations of environmentally vulnerable species like the southern cassowary, <b>wild</b> <b>yak,</b> giant eland, slow loris and echidna.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} designated as Bos grunniens ("grunting ox") by Linnaeus in 1766, but this name is now generally only considered {{to refer to}} the domesticated form of the animal, with Bos mutus ("mute ox") being the preferred name for the wild species. Although some authors still consider the <b>wild</b> <b>yak</b> to be a subspecies, Bos grunniens mutus, the ICZN made an official ruling in 2003 permitting the use of the name Bos mutus for wild yaks, and this is now the more common usage.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>yaks</b> roaming in the high-altitude Qinghaiâ€“Tibetan plateau have to {{maintain}} high metabolic efficiency. However, domestic yaks do not require such high efficiency because of their limited activity. Hence, domestication may have caused the relaxation of selective constraints on the yak mitochondrial genome because mitochondrial mutations are extremely sensitive to energy-related selective pressures. We have tested this hypothesis by analyzing the mitochondrial genomes of 51 domestic <b>yaks</b> and 21 <b>wild</b> <b>yaks.</b> The {{results show that the}} ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitutions in mitochondrial protein-coding genes is significantly higher in domestic yak lineages than those of <b>wild</b> <b>yaks.</b> This genetic difference suggests that the relaxation of selective constraints following the domestication in addition to bottlenecks has allowed faster accumulation of nonsilent substitutions in the yak mitochondrial genome, despite its short domestication history.

6000|$|The zobo, or {{cross between}} the yak and hill cow (much {{resembling}} the English cow), is but rarely seen in these mountains, though {{common in the}} North West Himalaya. The yak {{is used as a}} beast of burden; and much of the wealth of the people consists in its rich milk and curd, eaten either fresh or dried, or powdered into a kind of meal. The hair is spun into ropes, and woven into a covering for their tents, which is quite pervious to wind and rain;* [The latter is, however, of little consequence in the dry climate of Tibet.] from the same material are made the gauze shades for the eyes used in crossing snowy passes. The bushy tail forms the well-known [...] "chowry" [...] or fly-flapper of the plains of India; the bones and dung serve for fuel. The female drops one calf in April; and the young yaks are very full of gambols, tearing up and down the steep grassy and rocky slopes: their flesh is delicious, much richer and more juicy than common veal; that of the old yak is sliced and dried in the sun, forming jerked meat, which is eaten raw, the scanty proportion of fat preventing its becoming very rancid, so that I found it palatable food: it is called schat-tcheu (dried meat). I never observed the yak to be annoyed by any insects; indeed at the elevation it inhabits, there are no large diptera, bots, or gadflies to infest it. It loves steep places, delighting to scramble among rocks, and to sun its black hide perched on the glacial boulders which strew the Wallanchoon flat, and on which these beasts always sleep. Their average value is from two to three pounds, but the price varies with the season. In autumn, when her calf is killed for food, the mother will yield no milk, unless the herdsman gives it the calf's foot to lick, or lays a stuffed skin before it, to fondle, which it does with eagerness, expressing its satisfaction by short grunts, exactly like those of a pig, a sound which replaces the low uttered by ordinary cattle. The yak, though indifferent to ice and snow and to changes of temperature, cannot endure hunger so long as the sheep, nor pick its way so well upon stony ground. Neither can it bear damp heat, for which reason it will not live in summer below 7000 feet, where liver disease carries it off after a very few years.* [Nevertheless, the yak seems to have survived the voyage to England. I find in Turner's [...] "Tibet" [...] (p. 189), that a bull sent by that traveller to Mr. Hastings, reached England alive, and after suffering from languor, so far recovered its health and vigour as to become the father of many calves. Turner does not state by what mother these calves were born, an important omission, as he adds that all these died but one cow, which bore a calf by an Indian bull. A painting of the yak (copied into Turner's book) by Stubbs, the animal painter, may be seen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. The artist is probably a little indebted to description for the appearance of its hair in a native state, for it is represented much too even in length, and reaching to too uniform a depth from the flanks.] Lastly, the yak is ridden, especially by the fat Lamas, who find its shaggy coat warm, and its paces easy; under these circumstances it is always led. The <b>wild</b> <b>yak</b> or bison (D'hong) of central Asia, the superb progenitor of this animal, is the largest native animal of Tibet, in various parts of which country it is found; and the Tibetans say, in reference to its size, that the liver is a load for a tame yak. The Sikkim Dewan gave Dr. Campbell and myself an animated account of the chase of this animal, which is hunted by large dogs, and shot with a blunderbuss: it is untameable and horridly fierce, falling upon you with horns and chest, and if he rasps you with his tongue, it is so rough as to scrape the flesh from the bones. The horn is used as a drinking-cup in marriage feasts, and on other grand occasions. My readers are probably familiar with Messrs. Huc and Gabet's account of a herd of these animals being frozen fast in the head-waters of the Yangtsekiang river. There is a noble specimen in the British Museum not yet set up, and another is preparing for exhibition in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.|$|E

Results The domestic yak populations had two deeply divergent phylogenetic groups with a divergence time of > 100, 000 yrs BP. We here show that haplotypes clustering with two deeply divergent maternal lineages in domesticated yaks occur in a single, small, wild population. This finding suggests that all domestic yaks are derived from a single wild gene pool. However, there is no clear correlation of the mtDNA phylogenetic clades and the 10 morphological types of sampled yaks indicating that the latter diversified recently. Relatively high diversity was found in Qinghai and Tibet around the current wild distribution, in accordance with previous suggestions that the earliest domestications occurred in this region. Conventional molecular clock estimation led to an unrealistic early dating of the start of the domestication. However, Bayesian estimation of the coalescence time allowing a relaxation of the mutation rate are better in agreement with a domestication during the Holocene as supported by archeological records. Conclusion The information gathered here and the previous studies of other animals show that the demographic histories of domestication of livestock species were highly diverse despite the common general feature of deeply divergent maternal lineages. The results further suggest that domestication of local wild prey ungulate animals was a common occurrence during the development of human civilization following the postglacial colonization in different locations of the world, including the high, arid Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. </p...|$|R

50|$|Although {{they are}} locally {{sympatric}} with Siberian ibex, {{the two species}} have differing habitat and pasture preferences, reducing likely competition. In Tibet, the argali must regularly compete with other grazing species for pasture, including Tibetan antelope, bharal, Thorold's deer and <b>wild</b> <b>yaks.</b> Competition is most serious with livestock, especially domestic yak and domestic sheep, with which argali are frequently forced to intermingle and from which they often catch diseases and parasites.

Where not locally extirpated, snow leopards and leopards are also predators of argali of any age. Eurasian lynx and wolverines may seldom kill argali to at least the size of winter-weakened ewes. Red foxes and domestic dogs (largely those kept by sheep-herders) will prey on lambs.
