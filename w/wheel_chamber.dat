40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a simulation model, {{which focuses on}} the material flow during the excavation process of an Earth Pressure Balanced Shield Machine (EPB-Shield). The dependencies between system elements are being analyzed and rebuilt. The excavation-related machine elements cutting <b>wheel,</b> excavation <b>chamber,</b> conditioning unit and screw conveyor are implemented as reusable and configurable components to create a flexible simulation model. Time-variant soil parameters along the tunnel lining are considered. A simulation experiment demonstrates the dependency of the advancement rate and therewith the overall performance to under-designed downstream elements. ...|$|R

50|$|Great Tew is {{recorded}} as having two watermills by the 13th century, {{and both were}} still in use when the estate was surveyed in 1778. Mill Lane, about 600 yd north of the village, is named after a mill that was built or rebuilt in the 17th century for wool processing. Traces of its mill pond, mill stream and <b>wheel</b> <b>chamber</b> were still visible in the early 1980s. Further north, about 0.9 mi from the village, there was a mill on the stream near Cottenham Farm. Traces of its mill ponds, buildings and two waterwheels were still visible in the early 1980s, and a small wood there is still called Pool Spinney. One mill had ceased {{being used by the}} time G.F. Stratton sold the estate in 1815; the other was disused by 1837.|$|E

Originally built as a mill for Mission San Gabriel, it was converted into a home by 1850 by Colonel and Mrs. Edward Kewen who lived there for the following 21 years. They dispensed, it was said, "the most lavish hospitality San Gabriel Valley has ever known. " To the far left are the two archways that led to the <b>wheel</b> <b>chamber</b> during the time the building served as a grist mill.

5000|$|In British English, [...] "commode" [...] is the {{standard}} term for a chair, often on <b>wheels,</b> enclosing a <b>chamber</b> pot—as used in hospitals and the homes of invalids. (The historic equivalent is the close stool, hence the coveted and prestigious position Groom of the Stool for a courtier close to the monarch.) This piece of furniture is termed in French a chaise percée ("pierced chair"); similar items were made specifically as moveable bidets for washing.|$|R
40|$|The ATLAS {{collaboration}} {{has chosen}} the Micromegas technology {{along with the}} small-strip Thin Gap Chambers for the upgrade of the inner muon station in the high-rapidity region, the so called New Small Wheel upgrade project. It will employ eight layers of Micromegas and eight layers of small-strip Thin Gap <b>Chambers</b> per <b>wheel.</b> The New Small Wheel project requires fully efficient Micromegas chambers, {{able to cope with}} the maximum expected rate of 15 kHz/cm 2 featuring single plane spatial resolution better than 100 μm. The Micromegas detectors will cover a total active area of ~ 1200 m 2 and will be operated in a moderate magnetic field (≤ 0. 3 T). Moreover, together with their precise tracking capability the New Small <b>Wheel</b> Micromegas <b>chambers</b> will contribute to the ATLAS Level- 1 trigger system. Several studies have been performed on small (10 × 10 cm 2) and medium (1 × 0. 5 m 2) size prototypes using medium (1 − 5 GeV/c) and high momentum (120 – 150 GeV/c) hadron beams at CERN. A brief overview of the results obtained is presented...|$|R
50|$|An {{interview}} with Robert Salter {{appeared in the}} Los Angeles Times (June 11, 1972). He discussed, in detail, the relative ease with which the U.S. government could build a tube shuttle system using technologies available at that time. Maglev being poorly developed at the time, he proposed steel <b>wheels.</b> The <b>chamber's</b> door to the tube would be opened, and enough air admitted behind to accelerate the train into the tube. Gravity would further accelerate the departing train down to cruise level. Rising from cruise level, the arriving train would decelerate by compressing the rarefied air ahead of it, which would be vented. Pumps at the stations would make up for losses due to friction or air escaping {{around the edges of}} the train, the train itself requiring no motor. This combination of modified (shallow) gravity train and atmospheric railway propulsion would consume little energy but limit the system to subsonic speeds, hence initial routes of tens or hundreds of miles or kilometers rather than transcontinental distances were proposed.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{extrusion}} {{and rolling}} technology was proposed {{as a new}} strip production technology. It conducts a hot rolling process using waste heat after continuous extrusion. The continuous extrusion and rolling forming was simulated with DEFORM- 3 DT. Influences of extrusion wheel velocity and rolling reduction on the continuous extrusion and rolling forming were analyzed. It was shown that as extrusion wheel velocity increases, torque of extrusion <b>wheel,</b> <b>chamber</b> force and rolling force, will drop; temperature of the billet {{in the area of}} abutment which is highest will increase. As the rolling reduction is increased, torque of the extrusion wheel and force acting on the chamber decrease, while torque and force of the rolls increase. The experimental results showed that a homogeneously distributed and equiaxed grains microstructure can be formed in copper strip billets with an average grain size of about 80  μm, after continuous extrusion. Grains of the copper strips are stretched clearly, during rolling, along the rolling direction, to form a stable orientation. Nevertheless, the grain boundaries are still relatively clear to see...|$|E

40|$|The Electrostatic Levitation (ESL) Laboratory at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is {{a unique}} {{facility}} for investigators studying high-temperature materials. The ESL laboratorys main chamber has been upgraded {{with the addition of}} a rapid quench system. This system allows samples to be dropped into a quench vessel that can be filled with a low melting point material, such as a gallium or indium alloy, as a quench medium. Thereby allowing rapid quenching of undercooled liquid metals. Up to eight quench vessels can be loaded into a <b>wheel</b> inside the <b>chamber</b> that is indexed with control software. The system has been tested successfully with samples of zirconium, iron-cobalt alloys, iron-chromium-nickel, titanium-zirconium-nickel alloys, and a silicon-cobalt alloy. This new rapid quench system will allow materials science studies of undercooled materials and new materials development. The system is described and some initial results are presented...|$|R
50|$|The kettle grill is {{considered}} the classic American grill design. The original and often-copied Weber kettle grill was invented in 1951 by George Stephen. It has remained {{one of the most}} commercially successful charcoal grill designs to date. Smaller and more portable versions exist, such as the Weber Smokey Joe. The kettle grill is composed of a lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, lower chamber, venting system, and legs. Some models include an ash catcher pan and <b>wheels.</b> The lower <b>chamber</b> that holds the charcoal is shaped like a kettle, giving the grill its name. The key to the kettle grill's cooking abilities is its shape. The kettle design distributes heat more evenly. When the lid is placed on the grill, it prevents flare-ups from dripping grease, and allows heat to circulate around the food as it cooks. It also holds in flavor-enhancing smoke produced by the dripping grease or from smoking wood added to the charcoal fire.|$|R
