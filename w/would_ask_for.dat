Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested that Henry Balnaves should go to Cecil.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

Mitchell sent over parlimentaires demanding that Story defect to the Prince with his fleet, but Story refused indignantly.

25|$|As the 2011–12 {{season began}} to unfold, Columbus {{recorded}} a dismal 2–12–1 record, the worst start to an NHL season by {{any team in}} 19 years. With the team struggling, rumors began circulating that the Blue Jackets were contemplating trading Nash {{as a solution to}} their on-ice woes. While Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson stated publicly that he had had no discussions regarding a Nash deal, other teams had indeed inquired about his availability. When asked about it, Nash stated that if the franchise felt it could improve itself by dealing him, {{he would be willing to}} waive his no-trade clause in order to get the deal done. Though Howson had previously maintained that he had no intention of trading Nash, two weeks before the trade deadline, he stated in the press that the team was open to all options and they were willing to listen to trade proposals for Nash, despite not actively shopping him. Speculation was that in return for Nash the Blue Jackets <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> a top six forward, a top prospect and a first-round draft pick.|$|E

The collector then advised him to change his logo or he might confuse the knife-buying public, as they <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> Bowie knives instead of linerlock folders. Emerson agreed with this assessment, dropping the knife outline and the word [...] "knives" [...] from his stamp, using just his name in a half-circle on the blade as a logo. This marking is known among collectors as the [...] "Half-Moon Logo" [...] and would appear again as a transitional mark between the Viper and Specwar lines of knives.|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the NHL trade deadline, Columbus {{announced}} that unlike earlier in the season, they would listen to trade proposals involving Rick Nash, though they were not actively shopping him. Howson stated that the team was open to all options for improving the team, including trading Nash. Speculation was that in return for Nash the Blue Jackets <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> a [...] "combination of young, proven players, high-end prospects and draft picks." [...] Leading up to the trade deadline, the Blue Jackets dealt Antoine Vermette to the Phoenix Coyotes for two draft picks and goaltender Curtis McElhinney. Despite being injured at the time, the acquisition of McElhinney was believed to give Columbus the flexibility to trade Curtis Sanford. The following day, on February 23, Columbus traded Jeff Carter to the Kings. In the deal, Columbus acquired defenseman Jack Johnson and a first-round draft pick; the team was given the choice of taking the pick in either 2012 or 2013. At the deadline, Columbus was unable {{to come to terms}} on a deal involving Nash, but they did make one more move; they sent center Samuel Pahlsson to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for two fourth-round draft picks and minor league defenseman Taylor Ellington. Following the trade deadline, Howson announced that the team had attempted to trade Nash at the player's request. Nash stated that he had requested the trade after being informed that the franchise was going into another rebuilding phase. He further noted that he felt that he [...] "could be a huge part of that towards bringing assets in," [...] and in his view [...] "it was the best thing for the team, the organization, and personally for [...] career." [...] After the personnel changes, the Blue Jackets closed out the month with a three-game losing streak.|$|E

[...] Trump purportedly held a grudge against Weicker for blocking his plans to build a casino in Bridgeport in 1994. [...] The two had an exchange of insults in which Weicker labeled Trump a [...] "dirt bag" [...] and Trump referred to Weicker as [...] "a fat slob who couldn't get elected dog catcher." [...] In response to the Newsweek report, Trump sent out a press release in which he criticized the two party system, praised the Reform Party, and stated [...] "If the Reform Party nominated me, I would probably run and probably win."

500|$|Arranger Nelson Riddle found Sinatra to be a [...] "perfectionist {{who drove}} himself and {{everybody}} around him relentlessly", {{and stated that}} his collaborators approached him {{with a sense of}} uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament. [...] Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others. On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians. [...] After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told Sammy Cahn, who wrote songs for Anchor's Away, [...] "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne, and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it were a mellow love song, he <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> Gordon Jenkins. If it were a [...] "rhythm" [...] number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior. Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter {{at the end of each}} number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as [...] "Isn't that a pretty ballad" [...] or [...] "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with [...] "childlike delight". She states that after each show, Sinatra would be [...] "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".|$|E
