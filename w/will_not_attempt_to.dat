What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E

Upon collection of the maggot mass, only one insect, Chrysomya megacephala, was discovered. He concluded that the water barrier accounted for the scarcity of other flies. He also noted that flies <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> trek across large bodies of water unless there is a substantially influential attractant.|$|E

The incentive problem of moral hazard—when economic agents maximise their own utility to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than providing collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess internationally valuable collateral anyway.|$|E

2500|$|According to Karl Marx, {{the father}} of [...] "scientific socialism", {{religion}} is a tool used by the ruling classes whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It {{is in the interest}} of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their capitalist economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as escapism.|$|E

The Bloomberg School <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> evaluate what experts believe is almost certainly a faulty methodology, saying the scientific community should make the evaluation.

2500|$|Hayden's final {{legislative}} {{success was}} authorization of the Central Arizona Project. On June 4, 1963, {{one day after}} the Supreme Court issued a decision in Arizona v. California favorable to Arizona, Hayden joined {{with the rest of his}} state's congressional delegation in reintroducing legislation authorizing the water project. As in the bill's previous efforts, Hayden's influence was able to secure passage of the legislation in the Senate while passage in the House proved difficult. Initial opposition from the California delegation subsided by early 1965 after Governor Pat Brown declared, [...] "California <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> win by obstruction what it has not won by litigation", only to be replaced by opposition from Colorado Representative Wayne Aspinall. Aspinall, chairman of the House Interior Committee, refused to hold hearings on Hayden's bill. In response to the delays, Hayden waited till Aspinall returned home for vacation and then added his proposed bill as a rider to pork barrel bill containing patronage for a large number of Congressmen. In response to Hayden's maneuver, Aspinall returned from vacation to hold hearings on the Central Arizona Project.|$|E

50|$|In Virginia, courts {{weigh the}} (1) function, (2) {{geographic}} scope and (3) {{duration of the}} CNC against the employer's legitimate business interests to determine their reasonableness.

Virginia courts <b>will</b> <b>not</b> generally <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> revise or enforce a narrower restriction in a non-compete agreement. As a result, a drafting error or unenforceable restriction may render the entire agreement unenforceable in Virginia.|$|R
