This {{is an issue that}} we've been following very closely since we have been made aware of these allegations, and we are aware of the allegations. Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian capacity-building efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports {{of violence}} against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E

After police contacted the society in regards to the claims, a member was able to explain that the allegations were unfounded. In a statement on their website following the incident, they wrote [...] "nobody involved with the Merseyside Skeptics Society – or anyone that I even know of – has ever made threats to Joe or his family, and <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> never will." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... <b>We</b> <b>absolutely</b> stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of what they have to say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the first}} of the Australian shows, Minister for Fair Trading for New South Wales Virginia Judge, said she was aware that Spears would lipsync during the concerts and was {{considering}} to include disclaimers on promotional materials and tickets, indicating that portions of the show would be pre-recorded. This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Judge further explained her position saying, [...] "Let's be clear– live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you deserve better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, [...] "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. There is a lot to see about this show, there's nothing like this in the world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for. <b>We</b> <b>absolutely</b> give them a show". After opening night in Perth, The Advertiser writer Rebekah Devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of the show. They were apparently [...] "disappointed" [...] and [...] "outraged" [...] regarding Spears's lip syncing and subdued dancing. Australian tour promoter Paul Dainty talked about the situation saying, ...|$|E

Therefore, we need, <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> have to have, a constitutional amendment that defines marriage." [...] He is in full support of the Federal Marriage Amendment. Due to his numerous stances opposing the gay rights movement, he has received ratings of 7% from the American Civil Liberties Union, 0% from the Human Rights Campaign, and 19% from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People..

2500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of the band's next album (and first for Fontana) was beset with problems. The band members were distracted by hedonism, ego and indecision, going through four different producers and multiple studios. The stress of Fontana's commercial expectations were also playing a part. In 2005, Chadwick recollected that [...] "the guy who signed us (Dave Bates) had signed Def Leppard and Tears for Fears {{so he had}} a lot of clout. He insisted on putting us together with producers who were quite obviously wrong for us. He was completely uninterested in anything that didn't have a huge chorus in it. He wanted hits, basically. He also ordered a load of remixes that we hadn't authorised and <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> loathed." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the bronze}} medal game, Lithuanians faced the Unified Team {{for the third}} time that year, with each team winning once. Captain Valdemaras Chomičius felt that [...] "We lost to them once already, we couldn't let that happen again. The final had to be ours", while Šarūnas Marčiulionis added that [...] "We didn't have any choice, <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> had to win at any cost". Head coach Vladas Garastas briefed the team saying [...] "Men, you're playing for the people of Lithuania. Forget about your {{personal}} ambitions. People are watching you, losing sleep over you". Šarūnas Marčiulionis: [...] "Some were listening on radios, others were watching on television. All of Lithuania was stopped. Everyone was watching that game". In a close match, the Lithuanians kept the lead all times for an 82–78 victory, that felt inexpressibly remarkable for a tiny country which regained its independence just two years and was playing the remains of its former colonizer. Marčiulionis played 40 minutes during that match and scored 29 points, while Sabonis added 27. Donnie Nelson described the locker room as [...] "like winning the NBA championship times five". After the bronze medal victory, de jure Head of State Vytautas Landsbergis visited the team at the locker room, and they all sung the national anthem.|$|E
2500|$|The Bruins volleyball {{team had}} an [...] "A" [...] squad and a {{developmental}} squad. A large blue curtain separated the two practice courts. Players were in constant competition {{to stay on}} the [...] "A" [...] squad. Scates used a scoring system for his players during the practices, and their position on the team depended on the points they were scoring in practice. The coaches with the development squad could recommend players to move up, and Scates would check scores and move an [...] "A" [...] court player down. The scoring system allowed the players to know there was nothing personal in the choices being made. John Speraw, a former player and current head coach at UCLA, commented [...] "the way he managed to make objective decisions was to stay fairly separate from the players. It was never personal. And once you graduated, he enjoyed the relationship that developed with his players." [...] He highly valued competitiveness in a player, and wanted to go into matches with players that hated to lose. UCLA alumnus Karch Kiraly noted a common thread in the players around him at UCLA: [...] "He recruited people that were like I was. <b>We</b> <b>absolutely</b> hated to lose and loved to win, and that's what the Bruins were like. They were a reflection of Al, and Al wanted to win every single match, every single season." ...|$|E

60|$|We reached Senlis in {{time for}} dinner, and while the repast was getting ready, we strolled through the place, in order to revive the sensations with which we had visited it five years before. But, alas! these are joys, which, like those of youth are not {{renewable}} at pleasure. I could hardly persuade myself {{it was the same}} town. The walls, that I had then fancied lined with the men-at-arms of the Charleses of France, and the English Henries and Edwards, had now lost all their peculiarities, appearing mean and common-place; and as to the gate, from which we had almost heard the trumpets of the heralds, and the haughty answer to a bold summons of surrender, <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> had difficulty in persuading ourselves that we had found it at all. Half Europe had been roamed over since the time when, fresh from America, we made the former visit, predisposed to gaze with enthusiasm at every relic of a former age and a different state of society.|$|E

You are not the learned scientist you represented yourself to be -- instead, if we are to believe our newly made friends here, you are a pretender, a big sham, and a brute in the bargain. This being so, we intend to dispense with your services from this day forth.

6000|$|Vanderbank {{considered}} {{him with a}} benevolence, a geniality of approval, that he literally had to hold in check for fear of seeming to patronise. [...] "There's {{not one of us}} who can touch you. You're delightful, you're wonderful, and I'm intensely curious to hear you," [...] the young man pursued. [...] "Were <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> odious?" [...] Before his guest's puzzled, finally almost pained face, such an air of appreciating so much candour, yet of looking askance at so much freedom, he could only try to smooth the way and light the subject. [...] "You see we don't in the least know where we are. We're lost--and you find us." [...] Mr. Longdon, as he spoke, had prepared at last really to go, reaching the door with a manner that denoted, however, by no means so much satiety as an attention that felt itself positively too agitated. Vanderbank had helped him on with the Inverness cape and for an instant detained him by it. [...] "Just tell me as a kindness. DO we talk--" ...|$|E

Something has gone awry at Sinzheim: no right lodging in the waste Inns there; or good clean Barns, of a promising character, are to be had nearer than there: <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> {{do not go to}} Sinzheim to-night; we are to stop at Steinfurth, a small quiet Hamlet with Barns, four or five miles short of that! This was a great disappointment to the Prince,--and some say, a highly momentous circumstance in his History: ["Might perhaps have succeeded at Sinzheim" [...] (Seckendorf's Relation of the Crown-Prince's meditated Flight, p. 2;--addressed to Prince Eugene few days afterwards; given in Forster, iii. 1-13).]--however, he rallies {{in the course of the}} evening; speaks again to Page Keith. [...] "Steinfurth [STONY-FORD, over the Brook here]; be it at Steinfurth, all the same!" [...] Page Keith will manage to get horses for us here, no less.

60|$|The {{excitement}} {{which had}} been caused through those parts of South America which we had to traverse was imagined by us to be purely local, and I can assure our friends in England that we had no notion of the uproar which the mere rumor of our experiences had caused through Europe. It {{was not until the}} Ivernia was within five hundred miles of Southampton that the wireless messages from paper after paper and agency after agency, offering huge prices for a short return message as to our actual results, showed us how strained was the attention not only of the scientific world but of the general public. It was agreed among us, however, that no definite statement should be given to the Press until we had met the members of the Zoological Institute, since as delegates it was our clear duty to give our first report to the body from which we had received our commission of investigation. Thus, although we found Southampton full of Pressmen, <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> refused to give any information, which had the natural effect of focussing public attention upon the meeting which was advertised for the evening of November 7th. For this gathering, the Zoological Hall {{which had been}} the scene of the inception of our task was found to be far too small, and {{it was only in the}} Queen's Hall in Regent Street that accommodation could be found. It is now common knowledge the promoters might have ventured upon the Albert Hall and still found their space too scanty.|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} {{preparing}} for our summer excursion some time, but were unable {{to get away from}} Paris before the 18th of July. Our destination was undetermined, health and pleasure being the objects, though, a portion of our party having never seen Belgium, it was settled to visit that country in the commencement of the journey, let it end where it might The old caleche was repaired for the purpose, fitted with a new rumble to contain Francois and Jetty (the Saxon femme de chambre, hired in Germany), the vache was crammed, sacks stowed, passport signed, and orders were sent for horses. We are a little apt to boast of the facilities for travelling in America, and, certainly, so long as one can keep in the steam-boats or on the rail-roads, and be satisfied with mere velocity, no part of the world can probably compete with us, the distances considered; but <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> want the highest order of motion, which, I think, beyond all question, is the mode of travelling post. By this method, your privacy is sacred, you are master of your own hours, going where you please, and stopping when you please; and, as for speed, you can commonly get along at the rate of ten miles in the hour, by paying a trifle in addition, or you can go at half that rate should it better suit your humour. A good servant and a good carriage are indispensable, and both are to be had at very reasonable rates, {{in this part of the}} world.|$|E
6000|$|The reasons {{put forward}} by the South for secession have been trifling almost beyond conception. Northern tariffs have been the first, and perhaps foremost. Then {{there has been a}} plea that the {{national}} exchequer has paid certain bounties to New England fishermen, of which the South has paid its share, getting no part of such bounty in return. There is also a complaint as to the navigation laws--meaning, I believe, that the laws of the States increase the cost of coast traffic by forbidding foreign vessels to engage in the trade, thereby increasing also the price of goods and confining the benefit to the North, which carries on the coasting trade of the country, and doing only injury to the South, which has none of it. Then last, but not least, comes that grievance as to the Fugitive Slave Law. The law of the land as a whole--the law of the nation--requires the rendition from free States of all fugitive slaves. But the free States will not obey this law. They even pass State laws in opposition to it, [...] "Catch your own slaves," [...] they say, [...] "and we will not hinder you; at any rate we will not hinder you officially. Of non-official hinderance you must take your chance. But <b>we</b> <b>absolutely</b> decline to employ our officers to catch your slaves." [...] That list comprises, as I take it, the amount of Southern official grievances. Southern people will tell you privately of others. They will say that they cannot sleep happy in their beds, fearing lest insurrection should be roused among their slaves. They will tell you of domestic comfort invaded by Northern falsehood. They will explain to you how false has been Mrs. Beecher Stowe. Ladies will fill your ears and your hearts too with tales of the daily efforts they make for the comfort of their [...] "people," [...] and of the ruin to those efforts which arises from the malice of the abolitionists. To all this you make some answer with your tongue that is hardly true--for in such a matter courtesy forbids the plain truth. But your heart within answers truly, [...] "Madam, dear madam, your sorrow is great; but that sorrow is the necessary result of your position." ...|$|E
