5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E

25|$|In 1655, though, the {{settlers}} again came in fatal {{conflict with the}} native population in The Peach Tree War. According to popular belief, it started when a young Indian girl was shot by a Dutchman as she attempted to pluck fruit from a peach tree in an orchard on Manhattan. Her murder elicited calls for revenge from the native population, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> house-to-house search of New Amsterdam. At the time, Stuyvesant and his troops were on an expedition to the Zuydt Rivier (Delaware Bay), where they had forced the colony of New Sweden to submit to rule by his government. Five hundred Indians attacked Pavonia, killing 100 settlers. One hundred fifty hostages were taken and held at Paulus Hook. When later ransomed they returned to New Amsterdam, and once again the settlements on the west shore of the Noort Rivier were evacuated.|$|E

25|$|Antonello da Messina painted mostly small meticulous {{portraits in}} glowing colours. But {{one of his}} most famous works also {{demonstrates}} his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. This is the small painting of St. Jerome in His Study, in which the composition is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the shadows on the tiled floor. The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural light and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited Piero della Francesca. Antonello's work influenced both Gentile Bellini, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> series of paintings of Miracles of Venice for the Scuola di Santa Croce, and his more famous brother, Giovanni, {{one of the most significant}} painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss against Ireland {{and elected}} to bat, after conceding 370 against India after setting them in. His {{decision}} {{seemed to be}} vindicated {{at the start of}} Bangladesh's innings, with Tamim Iqbal unleashing a flurry of boundaries immediately, to take Bangladesh to 49/0 after 5 overs. Ireland needed a moment of inspiration and they got it from wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> brilliant stumping to send Imrul Kayes on his way. Ireland quickly built on it, with a direct hit from Ed Joyce catching Junaid Siddiqui short, before both Tamim and Shakib were also dismissed softly. Mushfiqur Rahim and Raqibul Hasan staged a recovery then, and at 147/4 in the 34th over, Bangladesh looked well set for a score above 250 until Mushfiqur top-edged a sweep of George Dockrell. This triggered another collapse, and only a late cameo from Naeem Islam took Bangladesh to 205.|$|E

[...] A similar idea was created for the [...] television series in the late 1970s. Jaron Summers pitched a premise for [...] "The Child" [...] in a meeting with Jon Povill, Roddenberry's assistant, and producer Harold Livingston. Povill suggested changes in the meeting, and Summers subsequently submitted a revised draft treatment. Livingston asked Povill to re-write it, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> complete re-write {{in the space of a}} week. Livingston was subsequently so impressed with his efforts that he demanded Roddenberry make him story editor. Roddenberry refused, until Livingston threatened to quit if Povill didn't get the job.

2500|$|Andrei Tarkovsky {{was born}} in the village of Zavrazhye in the Yuryevetsky District of the Ivanovo Industrial Oblast to the poet and {{translator}} Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky, a native of Yelisavetgrad, Kherson Governorate, and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute who later worked as a corrector; she {{was born in}} Moscow in the Dubasov family estate. Andrei's paternal grandfather Aleksandr Karlovich Tarkovsky (in [...] ) was a Polish nobleman who worked as a bank clerk. His wife Maria Danilovna Rachkovskaya was a Romanian teacher who arrived from Iași. Andrei's maternal grandmother Vera Nikolaevna Vishnyakova (née Dubasova) belonged to an old Dubasov family of Russian nobility that traces its history back to the 17th century; among her relatives was Admiral Fyodor Dubasov, a fact she had to conceal during the Soviet days. She was married to Ivan Ivanovich Vishnyakov, a native of the Kaluga Governorate who studied law at the Moscow University and served as a judge in Kozelsk. According to the family legend, Tarkovsky's ancestors on his father's side were princes from the Shamkhalate of Tarki, Dagestan, although his sister Marina Tarkovskaya <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> detailed research on their genealogy called it «a myth, even a prank of sorts», stressing that none of the documents confirms this version.|$|E

So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, {{are going to be}} 3,000 or 5,000," [...] he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: [...] "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself.
