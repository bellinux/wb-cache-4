The process of scanning {{hundreds or thousands of}} small objects is time consuming. Our original 3 D laser scanner optimizes the scanning process and reduces time significantly by four directional scanning of many small objects simultaneously. To reconstruct surface of stone tools, the scanned point clouds are processed with a new triangulation method that preserves the properties of sharp edges. Our approach is based on a projection based method in which points are distinguished into neighboring layers with a point cloud slicing method to be individually reconstructed. In addition, we introduce a simple hole-filling algorithm for mesh completion of models. The main advantages of our approach are speed and efficiency for reconstruction of many small objects...|$|E

This representation offers a compact and reversible way to preserve the essence of the original image. Various applications, such as compression, edge detection, image enhancement, and image editing, can be achieved based on this representation. In this paper, the <b>whole</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> verge point representation is presented. Based on these verge points, image reconstruction can be easily achieved via iterative linear interpo-lation.

40|$|Frequency {{response}} and residue {{are the two}} popular methods of designing damping controller. However, due to practical limitations, the former is limited to local controller design, which is not preferable for damping inter-area modes. Although the latter benefits wide area control, it strongly relies on the open loop dynamic model of power system which, for large systems, is hard to obtain. This paper, therefore, combines the two methods to design a wide area damping controller which obviates the need for identifying the open loop dynamic model. The method includes feedback loop selection, residue phase calculation and power system stabilizer (PSS) tuning using modal decomposition control (MDC). The core issue, residue phase calculation, has been validated in a two-area four-machine system and the <b>whole</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> wide area damping controller design was performed in a real power system, China Southern Grid.

On the other hand, the interpretation of the evolutive mechanism of seasonality as an amplitude modulation process, due to longer period components, suggests the adoption of a detection algorithm for estimation purposes. Moreover, the genuine seasonal pattern is obtained by passing the unmodulated seasonal component through a properly designed wave selector filter and the associated nuisance component enables to estimate the error term as well.

The joint space, which is made of a joint angle set, forms a Configuration space (Cspace). Obstacles in a robot work-cell are transformed into Cobstacles (obstacles Configuration) using the slice projection method. Second, a connected graph, or robot roadmap, is constructed using randomly selected free configurations from the free Cspace, which is immune from the collisions.

Legionella pneumophila is the most important human pathogen, followed by L. micdadei, L. longbeachae, L. dumoffii, and other rare species. Accurate identification of Legionella spp. other than L. pneumophila is difficult because of biochemical inertness and phenotypic identity of different species. The feasibility of using an oligonucleotide array for identification of 18 species of Legionella was evaluated in this study. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the macrophage infectivity potentiator mip gene, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of 30 oligonucleotide probes (16 - to 24 -mers) immobilized on a nylon membrane. A collection of 144 target strains (strains we aimed to identify) and 50 nontarget strains (44 species) were analyzed by the array.

40|$|A {{new method}} based on adsorptive {{cathodic}} stripping voltammetry with catalytic enhancement for {{the determination of}} total dissolved iron in seawater is reported. It was demonstrated that iron detection at the ultratrace level (0. 1 nM) may be achieved in small samples (500 μL) with high sensitivity, no need for purging, no added oxidant, and a limit of detection of 5 pM. The proposed method {{is based on the}} adsorption of the complex Fe/ 2, 3 -dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) exploiting the catalytic effect of atmospheric oxygen. As opposite to the original method (Obata, H.; van den Berg, C. M. Anal. Chem. 2001, 73, 2522 - 2528), atmospheric oxygen dissolved in solution replaced bromate ions in the oxidation of the iron complex: removing bromate reduces the blank level and avoids the use of a carcinogenic species. Moreover, the new method is based on a recently introduced hardware that enables the determinations to be performed in 500 μL samples. The analyses were carried out on buffered samples (pH 8. 15, HEPPS 0. 01 M), 10 μM DHN and iron quantified by the standard addition method.

The glutaraldehyde fixation method for the immobilization of CAb on polystyrene dipsticks was superior to the adsorption fixation and the adsorption-glutaraldehyde fixation methods. The glutaraldehyde fixation method resulted in a higher surface-saturating CAb concentration as evaluated by the peroxidase saturation technique and by the ability of the CAb-coated dipstick to discriminate between positive and negative controls (index of discrimination). Of nine blocking agents used alone or in pairs, lysine-human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, and gelatin effectively saturated available sites on the CAb-coated dipsticks without causing interference with the antigen-Ab reactions. The addition of 1 % polyethylene glycol to the diluent of the biotinylated anti-SEB Ab conjugate improved the detection of SEB. A concentration of 4 % polyethylene glycol allowed a 5 -min reaction time for the streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Cheddar cheese homogenate reduced the sensitivity of the SEB assay; however, the sensitivity was restored when 1. 6 % (wt/vol) of either a nonionic detergent (Mega- 9) or two zwitterionic detergents (Zwittergent 3 - 10 and 3 - 12 detergent) was added to the diluent.

Acoustic travel times were measured from all data sets using the time-distance helioseismology technique and compared with the ray theory predictions, frequently used for helioseismic travel-time inversions. It is found that the measured travel-time shifts agree well with the ray theory in both cases with and without phase-speed filtering for the shallow and deep perturbations.
