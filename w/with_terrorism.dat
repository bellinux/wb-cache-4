5|$|The Vajpayee {{government}} {{ordered the}} Indian {{armed forces to}} expel the Pakistani soldiers occupying Kashmir territory, later known as the Kargil War. Although the government was later criticised for the intelligence failures that did not detect Pakistani presence, it was successful in ousting them from the previously Indian-controlled territory. The Vajpayee administration also offered political support to the US War on Terror, {{in the hope of}} better addressing India's issues <b>with</b> <b>terrorism</b> and insurgency in Kashmir. This led to closer defence ties with the US, including negotiations for the sale of weapons.|$|E
5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The aim of the act was to improve the government's ability to deal <b>with</b> <b>terrorism.</b> It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening {{a joint session of}} the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass. The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{five men}} were charged <b>with</b> <b>terrorism</b> aimed at {{undermining}} authority on 29 October. The investigation {{was led by}} Gagik Jhangiryan, the Chief Military Prosecutor of Armenia, who claimed his team {{was looking for the}} masterminds of the shooting even after the trial had begun. According to Jhangiryan, the investigating team considered more than a dozen theories. By January 2000, Jhangiryan's investigators considered the connection of Kocharyan and his circle to the parliament shooting. Several figures close to Kocharyan were arrested, including Aleksan Harutiunyan, the Deputy Presidential Adviser, and Harutiun Harutiunyan, the Deputy Director of the Public Television of Armenia but, by the summer of that year, they were released. Eventually, Jhangiryan failed to find evidence linking Kocharyan to the shooting.|$|E
