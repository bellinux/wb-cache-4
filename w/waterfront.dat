5|$|In 1966, the <b>waterfront</b> {{area was}} among the {{earliest}} National Historic Landmarks designated by the Secretary of the Interior. Five years later, in 1971, WHALE succeeded in getting today's historic district designated as the Bedford Landing <b>Waterfront</b> Historic District. The city later enacted zoning regulations to preserve its character.|$|E
5|$|Just {{east of the}} {{district}} is the John F.

Local preservationists have supported a plan to redesign the highway and restore access to the <b>waterfront</b> that spurred the area's original development. The city received a $16.3 million grant to make this possible.|$|E

5|$|The {{completion}} {{date for the}} two tunnels was estimated at late 1987. WMATA engineers also inspected the mothballed <b>Waterfront</b> Station and {{found it to be}} still structurally sound (although water needed to be pumped from the station). However, some repairs to the tunnel between L'Enfant Plaza and <b>Waterfront</b> needed to be made. Construction of the tunnel from <b>Waterfront</b> to Navy Yard was set to begin in September 1985, construction of the Navy Yard station in early 1986, and linkage with the Anacostia River tunnels shortly thereafter. The two new Green Line stations were expected to open in 1990. In October 1985, WMATA awarded the $24.9 million contract to excavate the tunnel between the <b>Waterfront</b> and Navy Yard stations to Harrison Western Corp. WMATA's board awarded a $41.5 million contract for the construction of the Anacostia Station to Kiewit Construction Co. in June 1985, and said the station would open in 1990. Ground was broken at the site on September 21, 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the city's <b>waterfront</b> park and public boat launch in 2005 spurred {{interest}} in redevelopment of downtown Marysville. The closure of the final <b>waterfront</b> sawmill in 2005, followed by its acquisition and demolition by the city in 2008, led city planners to propose a downtown master plan. The 20-year plan, released and adopted by the City Council in 2009, proposed the redevelopment of the Marysville Towne Center Mall into a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented area with a restored street grid. The <b>waterfront</b> area would include trails, residential buildings, and retail spaces, along with a new city hall and civic center. In 2015, the city of Marysville was also the recipient of grants and consultation from the Environmental Protection Agency's smart growth program, identifying strategies for infill development in downtown.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} of ferry {{service to}} New Jersey, people moved to locations along the Hudson River <b>waterfront</b> there. In 1986, <b>waterfront</b> settlements like Bayonne, Highlands, Keyport, Port Liberte, and Weehawken saw a reinstatement of their ferry service to Manhattan, under {{the operation of}} NY Waterway. By 1989, around 3,000 of the settlements' combined 10,500 residents paid a $5.00 fare in each direction to board the NY Waterway ferries, despite competition from cheaper alternatives like the PATH train system. Around this time, there were plans to create ferry routes between Inwood and Atlantic City; South Amboy and Wall Street; and from the city proper to New Jersey, Connecticut, and Westchester.|$|E

2500|$|Washington Harbour was {{purpose-built}} {{close to}} the waterline. About 1970, the Department of the Interior commissioned Arthur Cottom Moore Associates to study the way 80 cities utilized their <b>waterfronts.</b> The study found that when cities used <b>waterfronts</b> for public use, they either erected [...] "festival/market buildings" [...] (where vendors occupy space temporarily) that are easily vacated or erected levees or seawalls seal the river off from the land. Moore was determined to provide the public ready access to the Potomac River, and avoid both solutions.|$|R

5|$|In January 1978, a WMATA {{regional}} {{task force}} approved a Green Line route in Anacostia that followed Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue and then Wheeler Road down to the Beltway (with a new station added near St. Elizabeths Hospital). Nonetheless, the Prince George's County government demanded in May 1978 that WMATA chose the Suitland-Parkway-to-Rosecroft route instead, and WMATA agreed to the change. In August 1978, WMATA's Board of Directors recommended {{to the federal government}} and its partner state and local governments that the entire -long (160.9 kilometres) Metrorail system be fully built—a proposal that included immediate construction of the Archives, <b>Waterfront,</b> Navy Yard – Ballpark, and Anacostia stations. WMATA announced in November 1978 that it had secured funding to build the Green Line from Gallery Place to <b>Waterfront</b> and that construction was nearly complete on this portion of the line, but that funding did not exist to push the line from <b>Waterfront</b> to Anacostia. Nonetheless, Metro reiterated that it intended to complete the extension to Anacostia Station by late 1983.|$|E

In an intensive workshop involving 23 students and seven faculty from Cairo University (CU), The American University in Cairo (AUC), and the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), interdisciplinary teams systematically inventoried existing conditions along a 12 -km reach of the Nile from Maadi to Tahrir Square, recording river-bank relations, building heights and conditions, circulation, and land-use...|$|R
40|$|This book {{explores the}} role of {{technology}} in ecological urban design and regeneration. Part I provides theoretical and methodological insights into technological approaches that offer optimum respect to existing cultural and natural environments, while offering minimum impact and carbon footprint. Parts II and III provide contextualised examples that demonstrate the use, or proposal of, sustainable technologies and solutions for regenerating parts of the urban and peri-urban. The case studies offer insights from the Mediterranean and the Middle East in a diverse range of spaces, from central urban squares, oblique cities, urban <b>waterfronts,</b> decaying suburbs, to peri-urban areas such as touristic <b>waterfronts,</b> former industrial areas, hyper-commercial areas, humid zones and parks...|$|R
