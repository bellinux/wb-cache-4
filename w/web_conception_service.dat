40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to the widespread variation in legislation and regulation of assisted <b>conception</b> <b>services</b> throughout Europe and the implications that this may have for what is understood as 'a family'. At present, access to assisted <b>conception</b> <b>services</b> appears to rely on a 'traditional' notion of the family with the consequence that large numbers of potential service users are excluded. We believe that the existing state of assisted conception legislation already demonstrates a turn to the postmodern. This paper aims to make this turn to the postmodern more explicit and take it further towards what we argue is its inevitable conclusion. It is argued that a postmodern approach should benefit both assisted <b>conception</b> <b>service</b> providers and, perhaps more importantly, service users through an emphasis on localized knowledge, acceptance of difference and 'otherness', and a recognition of the complexity and ambiguity of human behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{literature}} has addressed {{arguments about the}} importance of the `welfare of the child' principle (Blyth and Cameron, 1998; Golombok, 1998) in the assessment of the provision of assisted <b>conception</b> <b>services.</b> Two broad positions have emerged concerning the application of this principle: (i) the minimum welfare principle, and (ii) the maximum welfare principle. Pennings (1999) attempts to provide a commonsense resolution to this debate by proposing a `reasonable welfare principle' for the welfare of the child. Whilst, the attempt to move beyond the two present positions is welcomed, there are a number of significant problems with the arguments presented by Pennings (1999). Pennings (1999) correctly outlines the two most widely recognized positions (maximum and minimum welfare principles) concerning the welfare of the child and the provision of assisted <b>conception</b> <b>services.</b> Whilst we are broadly in agreement with the arguments and criticisms presented for the maximum welfare principle, there.. ...|$|R
40|$|Safer {{conception}} interventions reduce HIV incidence while {{supporting the}} reproductive goals {{of people living}} with or affected by HIV. We developed a consensus statement to address demand, summarize science, identify information gaps, outline research and policy priorities, and advocate for safer <b>conception</b> <b>services.</b> This statement emerged from a process incorporating consultation from meetings, literature, and key stakeholders. Three co-authors developed an outline which was discussed and modified with co-authors, working group members, and additional clinical, policy, and community experts in safer conception, HIV, and fertility. Co-authors and working group members developed and approved the final manuscript. Consensus across themes of demand, safer conception strategies, and implementation were identified. There is demand for safer <b>conception</b> <b>services.</b> Access is limited by stigma towards PLWH having children and limits to provider knowledge. Efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and acceptability data support a range of safer conception strategies including ART, PrEP, limiting condomless sex to peak fertility, home insemination, male circumcision, STI treatment, couples-based HIV testing, semen processing, and fertility care. Lack of guidelines and training limit implementation. Key outstanding questions within each theme are identified. Consumer demand, scientific data, and global goals to reduce HIV incidence support safer <b>conception</b> <b>service</b> implementation. We recommend that providers offer services to HIV-affected men and women, and program administrators integrate safer conception care into HIV and reproductive health programs. Answers to outstanding questions will refine services but should not hinder steps to empower people to adopt safer conception strategies to meet reproductive goals...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Safer {{conception}} care encompasses HIV care, {{treatment and}} prevention for persons living with HIV and their partners who desire children. In 2012, South Africa endorsed a progressive safer conception policy supporting HIV-affected persons to safely meet reproductive goals. However, aside from select research-supported clinics, widespread implementation has not occurred. Using South Africa {{as a case}} study, we identify key obstacles to policy implementation and offer recommendations to catalyse expansion of these services throughout South Africa and further afield. Discussion: Four key implementation barriers were identified by combining authors’ safer <b>conception</b> <b>service</b> delivery experiences with available literature. First, strategic implementation frameworks stipulating where, and by whom, safer <b>conception</b> <b>services</b> should be provided are needed. Integrating safer <b>conception</b> <b>services</b> into universal test-and-treat (UTT) and elimination-of-mother-to-child-transmission (eMTCT) priority programmes would support HIV testing, ART initiation and management, viral suppression and early antenatal/eMTCT care engagement goals, reducing horizontal and vertical transmissions. Embedding measurable safer conception targets into these priority programmes would ensure accountability for implementation progress. Second, facing an organizational clinic culture that often undermines clients’ reproductive rights, healthcare providers’ (HCP) positive experiences with eMTCT and enthusiasm for UTT provide opportunities to shift facility-level and individual attitudes in favour of safer conception provision. Third, safer conception guidelines have not been incorporated into HCP training. Combining safer conception with “test-and-treat” training would efficiently ensure that providers are better equipped to discuss clients’ reproductive goals and support safer conception practices. Lastly, HIV-affected couples remain largely unaware of safer conception strategies. HIV-affected populations need to be mobilized to engage with safer conception options alongside other HIV-related healthcare services. Conclusion: Key barriers to widespread safer <b>conception</b> <b>service</b> provision in South Africa include poor translation of policy into practical and measurable implementation plans, inadequate training and limited community engagement. South Africa should leverage the momentum and accountability associated with high priority UTT and eMTCT programmes to reinvigorate implementation efforts by incorporating safer conception into implementation and monitoring frameworks and associated HCP training and community engagement activities. South Africa’s experiences {{should be used to}} inform policy development and implementation processes in other HIV high-burden countries...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Implementation of safer <b>conception</b> <b>services</b> for HIV-affected couples within primary {{healthcare}} {{clinics in}} resource-limited settings remains limited. We review service utilization and safer conception strategy uptake {{during the first}} three years of Sakh’umndeni, which is a safer conception clinic in South Africa. Methods: Sakh’umndeni is located at Witkoppen Health and Welfare Centre, a high-volume primary healthcare clinic in northern Johannesburg. Men and women desiring to conceive in less than or equal to six months and in relationships in which one or both partners are living with HIV are eligible for safer <b>conception</b> <b>services.</b> Clients receive a baseline health assessment and counselling around periconception HIV risk reduction strategies and choose which strategies they plan to use. Clients are followed-up monthly. We describe client service utilization and uptake and continuation of safer conception methods. Factors associated with male partner attendance are assessed using robust Poisson regression. Results: Overall 440 individuals utilized the service including 157 couples in which both partners attended (55 %) and 126 unaccompanied female partners. Over half of the couples (55 %) represented were in serodiscordant/unknown status relationships. Higher economic status and HIV-negative status of the women increased male partner involvement, while HIV-negative status of the men decreased male involvement. Regarding safer conception strategies, uptake of antiretroviral therapy initiation (90 %), vaginal self-insemination among partnerships with HIV-negative men (75 %) and timed condomless intercourse strategies (48 %) were variable, but generally high. Overall uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was 23 % and was lower among HIV-negative men than women (7 % vs. 44 %, p  60 %. Conclusions: Safer conception strategies are generally used by clients per recommendations. High uptake of strategies suggests that the proposed combination prevention methods are acceptable to clients and appropriate for scale-up; however, low uptake of PrEP and MMC among HIV-negative men needs improvement. Targeted community-based efforts to reach men unlinked to safer <b>conception</b> <b>services</b> are needed, alongside streamlined approaches for service scale-up within existing HIV and non-HIV service delivery platforms...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 67 - 75). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Three experiments were designed {{to determine the effects of}} estradiol or estradiol and progesterone administration in combination with a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) insert at treatment initiation or after CIDR removal on follicular dynamics and estrous and fertility rates. Experiments were conducted over a period of two years and included Bos indicus and Bos taurus cattle. Each female received a CIDR for 7 or 8 d with prostaglandin F?[a] (25 mg, im) upon removal. The first experiment determined effects of estradiol benzoate (EB) administration either 24 h post-CIDR removal or EB administration upon CIDR insertion on estrus and fertility rates to artificial insemination (AI) or embryo transfer (ET). EB administration 24 h post-CIDR removal consistently increased estrus and fertility rates to AI and ET regardless of parity, lactational state, and post-partum interval. EB administration upon CIDR insertion did not affect first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> rates to AI or ET. However, parity and post-partum interval did affect first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> rates in those trials. In addition, there was an affect of duration of CIDR administration (7 - or 8 -d) on estrus and fertility rates in nulliparous, Bos indicus-influenced females. The second experiment determined the effects of EB or EB and progesterone (EB + P 4) administration at CIDR insertion on follicular dynamics and mean serum P 4 concentrations. Mean serum P 4 concentrations were affected by an interaction between follicle diameter (mm) and treatment. Mean dominant follicle diameter (mm) was influenced by treatment and breed type. The third experiment determined the effects of estradiol 17 b (E- 17 ?) or E- 17 ? and progesterone (E- 17 ? + P 4) at time of CIDR insertion on first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> rates to timed insemination. There was no significant difference between treatments at CIDR insertion on first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> rate. However, post-partum interval, location of trial, and technician did affect first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> rate. These results indicate that EB administration 24 h post-CIDR removal consistently and significantly increased synchrony rates. In addition, late post-partum and multiparous females had higher overall first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> rates to either AI or ET than did females in which the post-partum interval was less than 75 d or parity was less than two progeny respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify precalving nutritional risk factors that may affect variation in first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> risk in 21 commercial Holstein dairy herds in a tropical environment (Reunion Island). The data set included 473 lactation records in 404 cows. A multivariate logistic-regression model including herd as a random effect was used to analyse the relationship between first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> risk and energy status (body condition score, plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate), nitrogen status (urea), hepatic function (γ-glutamyltransferase, glutamate deshydrogenase, albumin), and mineral deficiencies (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium), adjusting systematically for factors such as breeding, season, parity, previous milk yield and fertility, calving to first service interval and type of oestrus (spontaneous versus induced). The overall mean conception risk was 0. 27 ± 0. 02 (mean±S. E. M., n= 473). First <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> risk was penalized by calving to 1 st service interval shorter than 60 days, synchronized oestrus, previous 305 -day milk yield > 8000 kg (p< 0. 05), low blood glucose concentration in high-yielding cows (p< 0. 05) and combined high urea and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations (p< 0. 01). Precalving energy imbalance, revealed by low prepartum glucose concentration, was a strong nutritional predictor of low first <b>service</b> <b>conception</b> risk in high-yielding cows. Some precalving nutritional disorders potentially associated with consumption of spoiled silage which induces elevated circulating urea and β-hydroxybutyrate have a delayed detrimental effect on conception, even if the true causes of this effect remain to be elucidated. As a conclusion, our findings should lead the breeders to pay more attention to the feeding of dry cows that is usually neglected in Reunion Island dairy farms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Assisted <b>conception</b> <b>services</b> in the UK {{have been}} subject to state {{regulation}} since 1991. One of the key, if controversial, requirements of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act forbids the provision of 'treatment services' to a woman 'unless account has been taken of the welfare of any child who may be born {{as a result of the}} treatment (including the need of that child for a father) and of any other child who may be affected by the birth' (Section 13 (5)). In practice, fertility clinics have found it difficult to operationalise this requirement and critics have complained that it has been used to discriminate against (mostly) women and (occasionally) heterosexual couples. In 2006, the UK statutory regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), revised its guidance to fertility clinics on undertaking Section 13 (5) 'welfare assessments'. The government has also indicated its intention to remove reference to a child's need for a father as part of its proposed overhaul of the Act. This paper uses a social constructionist perspective to examine the revised requirements to take account of the welfare of the child and argues that welfare assessments should be underpinned by 'respectful uncertainty' and 'healthy scept...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{sexual and}} {{reproductive}} health {{of people living}} with HIV is fundamental for their well-being. Antiretroviral therapy and reproductive technologies have significantly improved {{quality of life of}} people living with HIV in developed countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of HIV, the sexual practices and fertility of women infected with HIV have been understudied. AimTo assess the sexual behavior, fertility intentions, and awareness of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV in pregnant women with HIV-negative partners in Yaounde Central Hospital (Yaounde, Cameroon). MethodsA cross-sectional survey using a semistructured, interviewer-administered questionnaire was conducted at the antenatal unit and HIV clinic in  2014. Main Outcome MeasuresNinety-four pregnant women infected with HIV provided consistent information on (i) sociodemographic characteristics, (ii) sexual and fertility patterns, (iii) awareness of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and (iv) their unmet needs. ResultsAlthough sexual desire had significantly changed since their HIV diagnosis, the women were highly sexually active.
