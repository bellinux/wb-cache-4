Most carts in the United States have <b>swivel</b> <b>wheels</b> at the front, while the rear wheels are fixed in orientation, while in Europe it is more common to have four <b>swivel</b> <b>wheels.</b> This difference in design correlates with smaller retail premises in Europe.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first and}} only SE-2300 had a fixed {{conventional}} undercarriage with oleo-pneumatic springing, faired main legs and <b>wheels</b> and a <b>swivelling</b> tailwheel. [...] The two SE-2310s had tricycle undercarriages, the first unfaired but the second with faired legs and spats.|$|R
40|$|A basic {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation {{is made of}} the shimmy behavior of a swiveling landing gear, the experimental tests being conducted with a small wheel mounted over a continuous belt. Effects of wheel loading, rolling velocity, rearward position of the wheel {{with respect to the}} swivel axis, tire elasticity, and torsional flexibility of the fuselage are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. A major theoretical conclusion is that the motion of a landing gear moving in a straight line without fuselage elasticity is stable for a sufficiently large rearward position of the <b>wheel</b> behind the <b>swivel</b> axis, and this conclusion is well verified quantitatively by the experimental data...|$|R
5000|$|The {{brand new}} F-100C was flown by Lt. Barty R. Brooks, {{a native of}} Martha, Oklahoma and a Texas A&M graduate, of the 1708th Ferrying Wing, Detachment 12, Kelly AFB, Texas. The {{aircraft}} {{was one of three}} being delivered from North American's Palmdale plant to George AFB, California, but the nose gear pivot pin worked loose, allowing the <b>wheel</b> to <b>swivel</b> at random, so he diverted to Edwards, which had a longer runway. On approach, at a high angle of attack, the fighter exceeded its flight envelope, and, too far into stall condition, lost directional control with fatal results. These scenes were inserted in the movie The Hunters, starring Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner, in the movie X-15 with actor Charles Bronson playing the unlucky pilot, and in the Made for TV film Red Flag: The Ultimate Game, although in The Hunters and in Red Flag: The Ultimate Game, the aircraft supposedly represented were respectively an F-86 and an F-5E. The incident was also commemorated in the fighter pilot song [...] "Give Me Operations" [...] (set to the tune of the California Gold Rush song [...] "What Was Your Name in the States?"): ...|$|R
30|$|Design 1.1 {{involves}} bespoke cargo boxes, specifically dimensioned to {{fit within}} {{the constraints of}} the current metro. The boxes would have detachable shelving that can be rearranged as needed, to suit different freight sizes. Using shelving allows different goods to be stored in one box while being easily differentiated, acting similar to a bento box [10]. The height of the box is just under that of the average human height, to allow the user to see ahead when manoeuvring the box. The boxes will be mounted with <b>swivel</b> <b>wheels</b> possessing brakes to allow them to be moved onto the metro by hand. This application eliminates the need for forklifts as these {{would not be able to}} load the cargo onto the metro effectively.|$|R
40|$|A {{large-scale}} combined legged and {{wheeled vehicle}} with anthropomorphic legs is presented. This concept combines {{the advantages of}} a walking machine with the stability of a wheeled vehicle. The leg utilises a spherical hip joint, a revolute knee joint and a passively pivoting foot. Due {{to the size of}} the system linear hydraulic actuators are used, and thus kinematic loops are created in the mechanism. This paper describes the closed-form recursive solution of the direct and the inverse kinematics, the statics for one leg and some results from computer simulations. 1 Introduction For the manipulation of heavy loads in unstructured environments combined legged and wheeled vehicles, often realized as walking excavators, can be used. These machines consist of a platform with two front legs and two <b>swivelling</b> <b>wheels</b> at the back. They combine the advantages of a walking machine [...] mobility in unknown terrain [...] with the higher stability of wheeled vehicles. Here the forward movement is provi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of the paper is using multi-functional sensors to detect the vehicle {{attitude}} (the tilt angle of vehicle), and many other vehicle information. Combining all the information, the adaptive front-lighting system can achieve the real-time control of the pitman arm and yaw angle for automobile headlight system. The feasible control methodology could highly enhance the safety of driving and electronic additional value in automobile industry. In the paper, various conditions of HID (High Intensive Discharge) headlight system could be controlled, such as the control of pitman arm and yaw angle, are widely discussed. In the pitman arm angle control, we use G-sensor to detect the unbalanced vehicle caused by load, rugged road, uphill and downhill. Finally, combining the velocity obtained from the ECM (Engine Control Module), the leveling motor control for headlight pitman arm angle real time and adjust will be realized. On the other hand, we use the potentiometer and micro switch to sense the direction and quantity of steering <b>wheel</b> angle, the <b>swivel</b> motor control for headlight yaw angle real-time adjustment is completed...|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} {{generally}} released {{in a large}} game unit, known as the Deluxe cabinet version, or a stand-alone smaller unit was available for smaller sites where space was an issue. The Deluxe cabinet variant permitted players {{to sit down and}} was a fully enclosed unit. The cabinet was designed to be folded into four separate pieces for transport, with the roof being fully removable, as is the floor, and the ends of the game come ready on <b>swivel</b> <b>wheels.</b> The game was very successful onsite for operators and although the Star Trek Voyager series has finished some two years prior to its release. The original license from Paramount Pictures was obtained by Frank J. Pelligreni, President of Team Play Inc, and proved to be a very successful design and product for the company. The license and distribution of the game was granted only to the United States, so no units were exported outside of the USA in brand new form, however, some units have been sold when 2nd hand and have made their way into collectors hands in Australia and possibly Japan, but less than half a dozen units,according to the games original designer, Teamplay Inc.|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the relationship between interhandle distances and upper limb exertion during simply pushing and pulling of a cart with four <b>swivel</b> <b>wheels,</b> defined by a roll box pallet (RBP) in a Japanese industrial standard. Methods: Six healthy young male participants were asked to push and pull an RBP at a distance of 5. 2  m under six conditions corresponding to different interhandle distances (40  cm, 60  cm, and 80  cm) and weights (130  kg and 250  kg). The upper limb exertion was studied by shoulder abduction and flexion, and elbow flexion, as well as surface electromyogram (EMG) in shoulder extensor, and elbow flexor and extensor. Participants were required to provide subjective evaluations on operability after each trial. Results: Subjective operability indicated that a narrower interhandle distance had a better operability for pushing. Interhandle distance was also related to upper limb exertion especially for pushing. A narrow interhandle distance caused smaller shoulder adduction but larger elbow flexion. The normalized EMG data revealed that muscular activity became smaller with a narrow interhandle distance in shoulder extensor. During the pulling task, elbow flexion was smaller at a narrow interhandle distance, although subjective operability and normalized EMG were not significantly varied. Conclusion: A wider interhandle distance, such as 80  cm, was not suitable in the forwardbackward movement of the RBP. Therefore, this study concluded that an interhandle distance of 40  cm would be suitable for pushing and pulling an RBP to protect the workers' hands against the risk of injury by installing inner handles...|$|R
