Karstic carbonate dissolution occurs along fault cores in limestones and, to a lesser degree, dolostones and creates superposed high-permeability conduits.

The existence of the time of use externality depends on the presence of important differences in the preferences between the control and non-control sectors.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the causes}} of the wildcat banking in Italy after the First World War. The hypothesis is that financial instability in banking sector increased after the monetary deflation and the resumption of gold standard. Two levels of analysis are considered: a macroeconomic one and a microeconomic one. A faulty regulation and a sticky transmission of monetary policy retarded the effects of monetary deflation on the credit expansion because of the ineffectiveness of this policy in reversing expectations. Wildcat banking booming in more local banks with "non profit" organization in which corporate control schemes took responsability away from managers or majority shareholder groups. Also a new national regulation on the banking sector, enacted in 1926, was defective owing to many overlappings between the regulation agencies (Tresury and central bank). Both a loss of monetary policy credibility and an incomplete system of regulation clashed with the spur of looting. The case of the Marinelli's banking group is a typical example of overfinancing supported by a lot of politicians. In this turbid business of looting are included both profiteers and tentatives of acquisition in small and large banks trough a financial <b>watering</b> <b>of</b> social <b>capital.</b> The rise <b>of</b> such business depends on a loss of confidence in monetary policy, also after Pesaro's announcement.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 103 - 117). California {{is now in}} {{its fourth}} year of a severe record breaking drought. The drought has renewed and intensified anxieties over California???s perpetual state <b>of</b> <b>water</b> crisis, and has reinforced and legitimized the need for applying market-based mechanisms for the production, allocation, and use <b>of</b> <b>water</b> resources. Emphasis has been put on the reallocation <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from one space to another in order to promote the ???beneficial use??? <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The logic <b>of</b> ???beneficial use??? is premised on mobilizing water in ways that meet the requirements <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> and enables the realization of surplus value (profit) from networks of production, consumption, and exchange. Shifting flows <b>of</b> <b>water</b> between different circuits <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> aligns with what David Harvey refers to as a spatial-fix. The purpose of this research is to examine how the transfer <b>of</b> Colorado River <b>water</b> from the Imperial Valley to San Diego through the Quantification Settlement Agreement (QSA) constitutes a ???spatial-fix???. This agreement provides a strong example of ways in which the production <b>of</b> <b>water</b> becomes intertwined with and articulated through circuits <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation and circulation. My research specifically looks at how particular political processes and changing social demands for water have altered ways in which different social actors are able to secure and gain access to Colorado River <b>water.</b> <b>Of</b> particular significance is how the QSA has fundamentally challenged the Imperial Valley???s historic control over Colorado River water, and resulted in the reallocation of the single source <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that had transformed the region into a highly productive agricultural landscape. Through a political ecological analysis of the QSA, I argue that the Imperial Valley-San Diego County water transfer serves as a ???spatial-fix??? by securing the socio-ecological conditions for the expanded reproduction <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> while simultaneously extending geographies of commodity production and exchange through capitalist urbanization. In doing so, I examine how the QSA becomes expressed through the reconfiguration of rural and urban space and how these interconnected socio-spatial processes produce highly differentiated socio-environmental outcomes and reflect the geographically uneven character of capitalist development...|$|R
