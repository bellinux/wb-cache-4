5|$|Bletchley Park is {{a former}} private estate located in Old Bletchley and modern Museum of Cryptography. Conveniently located at the {{junction}} of the Varsity Line with the West Coast Main Line, Bletchley Park, code-named Station X, was {{the location of the}} Allied main code-breaking establishment during World War II. Codes and ciphers of several Axis powers were deciphered there, most famously the German Enigma. Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic digital computer was put to <b>work</b> <b>here</b> as part of the codebreaking effort. The high-level intelligence produced by Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is frequently credited with aiding the Allied war effort and shortening the war, although Ultra's effect on the actual outcome of World War II is debated.|$|E

25|$|This {{site was}} located {{to the south}} of Woodnesborough. <b>Work</b> <b>here</b> was {{abandoned}} in 1914 without coal being found. It was served by a half mile branch off the East Kent Light Railway. The site was subsequently used by the Hammill Brickworks. Some buildings survive.|$|E

25|$|As I left {{extremism}} I realised {{that if you}} {{are born}} here and grow up here, then you belong here. The Islam that was preached 2,000 years ago isn’t going to <b>work</b> <b>here</b> in modern London. Muslims need to alter their lifestyles to a Western lifestyle. To criticise is not Islamaphobic. It's about opposing certain ideas.|$|E
25|$|He {{was sent}} back to London in April 1916 to receive his {{decoration}} from the king and to serve in the Admiralty.

25|$|Another {{area that}} was left unexcavated was the initial Teotenanca settlement, Ojo de Agua, on the valley floor {{on the north side}} of Tetepetl Hill. Using sonar in the 1970s, a small {{platform}} was detected about two meters underground and a few objects were uncovered and put on display at the site museum. However, lack of funding prevented any serious <b>work</b> <b>here,</b> but did allow for measures to protect the area from damage, although it still remains private property.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, {{the novelist}} Evelyn Waugh {{came up to}} Hertford, famously feuding with his history tutor C. R. M. F. Cruttwell (who was to become the fourth {{principal}} of the refounded college, 1930–1939), and later naming a number of odious characters after him. Waugh wrote of his time at Hertford, 'I do no <b>work</b> <b>here</b> and never go to Chapel'. He novelised his time at Oxford in Brideshead Revisited, having his protagonist Charles Ryder at Hertford.|$|E
25|$|Equatorial Guinea {{has also}} been a {{destination}} for fortune-seeking European settlers from Britain, France and Germany. Israelis and Moroccans also live and <b>work</b> <b>here.</b> Oil extraction since the 1990s has contributed to a doubling of the population in Malabo. After independence, thousands of Equatorial Guineans went to Spain. Another 100,000 Equatorial Guineans went to Cameroon, Gabon, and Nigeria because of the dictatorship of Francisco Macías Nguema. Some Equatorial Guinean communities are also found in Latin America, the United States, Portugal, and France.|$|E

25|$|In 1291 a water powered pump was at <b>work</b> <b>here,</b> {{draining}} the marshland between Lingfield and Edenbridge. The present corn mill building {{dates to the}} early 19th century, but incorporates parts of an older structure. The cast iron low breastshot waterwheel drove three pairs of stones. The mill last ground by water sometime before the First World War, and was working by electricity into the 1970s. The waterwheel was used to work ancillary machinery until 1968, when the cast iron pit wheel was broken in the floods of that year.|$|E
25|$|Microbiology {{receives}} {{almost any}} clinical specimen, including swabs, feces, urine, blood, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, {{as well as}} possible infected tissue. The <b>work</b> <b>here</b> is mainly concerned with cultures, to look for suspected pathogens which, if found, are further identified based on biochemical tests. Also, sensitivity testing is carried out {{to determine whether the}} pathogen is sensitive or resistant to a suggested medicine. Results are reported with the identified organism(s) and the type and amount of drug(s) that should be prescribed for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Scorsese's {{next project}} was his fifth {{collaboration}} with Robert De Niro, The King of Comedy (1983). It is a satire {{on the world}} of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (kidnapping). The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed up until this point, often using a static camera and long takes. The expressionism of his previous <b>work,</b> <b>here</b> gave way to moments of almost total surrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however. The King of Comedy failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics {{in the years since}} its release. German director Wim Wenders numbered it among his 15 favorite films.|$|E

25|$|Janssen, in his {{original}} BIFAO 84 paper, noted the curious {{fact that no}} known New Kingdom pharaohs who reigned {{for a quarter of}} a century including Ramesses II and Ramesses III had their accession date in this time frame and suggests the Year change was an error committed on behalf of the scribe. He then attributed the ostraca to Ramesses III, whose accession date was I Shemu day 26 and expressed his view that the scribe may have inadvertently implemented the Year change two weeks early instead. Janssen also observed that the palaeography of the ostraca suggests a date in the 20th Dynasty partly because it followed the later New Kingdom form of writing and due to its provenance in the Grand Putit region, which features numerous Dynasty 20 ostracas. However, this form of writing is also attested in monuments of Ramesses II and it would, therefore, not be unexpected to find it in a document from the very late 18th Dynasty since the transition from the Early New Kingdom to the Late New Kingdom Form of writing had already occurred prior to the end of Horemheb's reign, as Frank Yurco once noted. Indeed, Janssen's palaeographical reference for his paperProf. Georges Posenerhimself suggested a date in the 19th Dynasty due to the form of the wsf (absent) and akhet (inundation) text. As Janssen himself writes, a few 19th Dynasty ostracas have been found in the Grand Putit area prior to the 20th Dynasty's intensive exploitation of this region. This does not exclude some late 18th Dynasty <b>work</b> <b>here</b> either. Secondly, both Janssen and Krauss stress in their papers that the relative scarcity of the hieratic text in Ostraca IFAO 1254 precludes a clear dating of the document to Ramesses III's reign and that palaeography, in general, does not give a precise date for a document's creation. Hence, a dating of the ostraca to Horemheb's reign on the basis of the Year change is eminently plausible. On other matters, a damaged wall fragment painting from the Petrie Collection reportedly mentions Horemheb's 15th or 25th Year.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This {{is the sort}} of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would <b>work</b> <b>here,</b> if Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't really get to know any of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{considered}} {{that a great}} part of the episode's merits were due to George R. R. Martin's script. Sepinwall felt that [...] "Martin didn't get the easiest draw when he wound up having to dramatize the events depicted in 'The Pointy End,'" [...] but still loved the results. Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand at <b>work</b> <b>here.</b> Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly feel much more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of fun stuff to play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E

In spite of its lost world location, the Crown has been a beacon of gastronomic adventure for at least 30 years – those with long memories will recall Stephen Bull carving out his reputation here." [...] He said of the food, [...] "There is clearly a distinctive palate at <b>work</b> <b>here.</b> In lesser hands, such a meal could be not so much a car crash as a multiple pile-up, but it is not, because the ingredients are handled with originality, assurance and, more importantly, a keen sense of pleasure." ...|$|E
