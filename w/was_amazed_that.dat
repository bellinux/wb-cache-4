25|$|Then one day {{he emerged}} from the fort {{with the help of}} villagers, who broke down the door. By this time most had {{expected}} him to have wasted away or to have gone insane in his solitary confinement. Instead, he emerged healthy, serene, and enlightened. Everyone <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> he had been through these trials and emerged spiritually rejuvenated. He was hailed as a hero and from this time forth the legend of Anthony began to spread and grow. Anthony went to Fayyum and confirmed the brethren there in the Christian faith before returning to his fort.|$|E
25|$|The {{captain of}} Externsteine later told his captors {{that he thought}} the attack was being carried out by tanks, and he <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> the ships could break through the ice at the speed they did. He opined that the Americans would have to scuttle his ship as it was trapped in the ice. Externsteine was renamed East Breeze by her captors. However, by using {{explosives}} on the ice, the ship was freed. A prize crew of 36 men from both icebreakers soon had the ship under way. At the time, it was the northernmost combat operation ever undertaken by United States forces. Externsteine was the only enemy surface vessel captured by United States naval forces during World War II.|$|E

500|$|Stuart Morris, a {{historian}} who helped to provide research for Steel for the Portland show, commented: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> {{he should have}} absorbed {{so much of the}} island's history in the short period of time that he had. He joked about the Portland winds, saying that in comparison, islanders wouldn't even have bothered to take out their kites in the face of Hurricane Katrina. He made a few remarks about Portland/Weymouth rivalry and our Weymouth friends present laughed as much as the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre: Sucre {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} Michael during time at Fox River State Penitentiary, where he was his cell-mate. Initially, his character's story focuses on his wish to reunite with his fiancée. Upon receiving the pilot script, Nolasco's {{first thought was that}} it was [...] "one of those failed pilots that the network did not really want" [...] since most of the series pilots would have started production by that time. Admitting that he does not like to read, Nolasco <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> the script was a [...] "huge page-turner". Prior to his last audition for the role, Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice. Subsequently, he was cast in the role.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "I Will Survive" [...] / [...] "Survivor" [...] Troubletones {{performance}} [...] "made the mash-up fun for {{a second}} time", and Bell called it [...] "awesome". Chaney characterized the Mercedes and Santana vocals as [...] "strong", as did Votta, but both felt {{it was not as}} good as the [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] / [...] "Someone Like You" [...] mash-up two episodes prior. Slezak gave the performance an [...] "A", and said, [...] "I loved that the Troubletones broke free of the standard-operating glee-club choreography, and that there’s another legendary duet to add to the Sancedes oeuvre." [...] Flandez wrote that it was [...] "superbly well done and well choreographed", except for the jumping jacks. Votta thought Blaine and Finn's triumphant fist bump during the number seemed warranted, though Slezak and Sullivan seemed unconvinced.|$|E

500|$|Writing in Salon, David Sirota, a {{progressive}} political commentator compared The Dark Knight Rises {{and the game}} Call of Duty to 1980s popular culture reflecting the political period of the time, accusing them of perpetuating a conservative agenda: [...] "Just as so many 1980s pop culture products reflected {{the spirit of the}} Reagan Revolution's conservative backlash, we are now seeing two blockbuster, genre-shaping products not-so-subtly reflect the Tea Party's rhetorical backlash to the powerful Occupy Wall Street zeitgeist." [...] An article in Variety reported Chuck Dixon, the co-creator of the Bane character, as saying that Bane is [...] "far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street type if you're looking to cast him politically." [...] Catherine Shoard of the center-left British publication The Guardian claimed the film [...] "is a quite audaciously capitalist vision, radically conservative, radically vigilante, that advances a serious, stirring proposal that the wish-fulfilment of the wealthy is to be championed if they say they want to do good." [...] In contrast, liberal commentator Jonathan Chait opined in New York that [...] "What passes for a right-wing movie these days is The Dark Knight Rises, which submits the rather modest premise that, irritating though the rich may be, actually killing them and taking all their stuff might be excessive." [...] Writing in USA Today, Bryan Alexander called Bane [...] "the ultimate occupier" [...] and reported that Christian Bale <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> the script had [...] "foreseen" [...] the Occupy movement.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E
2500|$|Although Linklater had {{referred}} to the project as Boyhood {{during the early years}} of production, in 2013 he settled on the title 12 Years, but was forced to rename it by the release of 12 Years a Slave in the same year. Hawke <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> the producers [...] "still had their job" [...] at the film's completion, despite [...] "(having) to hide a couple hundred thousand dollars a year for over a decade while we slowly made this movie". Despite the risks, Linklater was allowed an unusual level of freedom with the production, never having to show IFC the work as it progressed.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas {{was educated}} at Macaulay Church of England Primary School, Victoria Rise, Clapham until 1974, where his party trick was {{to recite the}} first verses of the four gospels from memory. He then won a {{scholarship}} to attend the independent Christ's Hospital School, where he attained O-levels and A-levels in English, history, and politics and economics. At school, Thomas was influenced by his drama teacher, Duncan Noel-Paton, and by Bertolt Brecht's play The Caucasian Chalk Circle, in which the audience's sympathies are swayed from one view of a political argument to the other; speaking of this to The Guardian in 1999, he said [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> a play could make you change your mind". He went on to be awarded a degree in Theatre Arts at Bretton Hall College.|$|E
2500|$|Curtiss {{began his}} career as a Western Union bicycle messenger, a bicycle racer, and bicycle shop owner. In 1901, he {{developed}} an interest in motorcycles when internal combustion engines became more available. In 1902, Curtiss began manufacturing motorcycles with his own single-cylinder engines. His first motorcycle's carburetor was adapted from a tomato soup can containing a gauze screen to pull the gasoline up via capillary action. In 1903, he set a motorcycle land speed record at [...] for one mile (1.6km). When E.H. Corson of the Hendee Mfg Co (manufacturers of Indian motorcycles) visited Hammondsport in July 1904, he <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> the entire Curtiss motorcycle enterprise was located in the back room of the modest [...] "shop". Corson's motorcycles had just been trounced the week before by [...] "Hell Rider" [...] Curtiss in an endurance race from New York to Cambridge, Maryland.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{positive}} side, Marti was astonished by the [...] "inviolable right {{of freedom of}} speech which all U.S. citizens possessed". Marti applauded the United States' Constitution which allowed freedom of speech to all its citizens, no matter what political beliefs they had. In May 1883, while attending political meetings he heard [...] "the call for revolution – and more specifically the destruction of the capitalist system". Marti could not believe that revolution was advocated and <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> this could happen because this [...] "could have led to its own destruction". Marti also gave his support to the women's suffrage movements, and was [...] "pleased that women here [...] advantage of this privilege in order to make their voices heard". According to Marti, free speech was essential if any nation was to be civilized and he expressed his [...] "profund admiration for these many basic liberties and opportunities open to the vast majority of American citizens".|$|E

2500|$|I {{arrived at}} the University of Florida on my 25th {{birthday}} in September 1957. Having completed {{four years in the}} Air Force, I was anxious to move ahead quickly with my education, and get on to a working career. [...] …I was called in to be interrogated three or four times during the next two years. Each time, it was the same setting, and the same set of questions. Each time I was unceremoniously marched out of class, in front of the instructor and all my classmates, by a uniformed policeman. Once this occurred during a final exam in accounting. [...] …At each interrogation, I refused to tell them anything. [...] Each time I <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that,</b> while I was truly terrified by their tactics and their threats, I was able to stonewall their questions and refuse to give them the answers they were so desperate for. I came to realize that they, as a group, were really a very dumb bunch of redneck, illiterate people, clumsily wielding a vast amount of power over others.|$|E
2500|$|Blade Runner (1982), {{based on}} Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, {{directed}} by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford. A screenplay {{had been in}} the works for years before Scott took the helm, with Dick being extremely critical of all versions. Dick was still apprehensive about how his story would be adapted for the film when the project was finally put into motion. Among other things, he refused to do a novelization of the film. But contrary to his initial reactions, when he was given an opportunity {{to see some of the}} special effects sequences of Los Angeles 2019, Dick <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> the environment was [...] "exactly as how I'd imagined it!", though Ridley Scott has mentioned he had never even read the source material. Following the screening, Dick and Scott had a frank but cordial discussion of Blade Runner's themes and characters, and although they had wildly differing views, Dick fully backed the film from then on, stating that his [...] "life and creative work are justified and completed by Blade Runner". Dick died from a stroke less than four months before the release of the film.|$|E
2500|$|From 2006–2009, Morpurgo, Lee Hall and Revel Guest {{worked on}} a {{proposed}} film version of War Horse, which Morpurgo and Hall would write and Guest produce. Lack of finances meant {{that it was an}} informal arrangement, with the film rights not formally sold by Morpurgo to Guest's production company and no one being paid for the work they undertook. In 2009, film producer Kathleen Kennedy saw the critically acclaimed production of War Horse in London's West End with her husband, fellow producer Frank Marshall and their two daughters. They were very impressed by the story and Marshall has recalled how he <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>that</b> no one had already bought the film rights to the book. Steven Spielberg was told about War Horse by several people, including Kennedy, who was his colleague at Amblin Entertainment. After discussions with Revel Guest, it was announced on 16 December 2009 that DreamWorks had acquired the film rights to the book, with Spielberg stating: [...] "From the moment I read Michael Morpurgo's novel War Horse, I knew this was a film I wanted DreamWorks to make ... Its heart and its message provide a story that can be felt in every country." ...|$|E
