I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E

25|$|After briefly {{arguing over}} who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the {{remaining}} child, Andersen proceeded to stab Sørstrønen {{once in the}} neck, also severing her carotid artery, while Kristiansen was holding her arms and legs. The two men then covered the bodies with vegetation, and stuffed their bodies between the slab rocks before throwing the girls' blood-soaked swimsuits in the muddy waters of the lake. After walking back towards the neighborhood of Eg, in which they lived, the two men planned to feign an alibi for {{the time of the}} murders. Kristiansen was to say he was in his workshop, while Andersen was to say he was jogging. Later in the day, the two met up at Kristiansens house, where they called up two other friends, in an attempt to bolster their alibi.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Helen Carte in 1913, Rupert D'Oyly Carte became the {{controlling}} stockholder of the hotel group. In 1919, he sold the Grand Hotel, Rome, which his father had acquired in 1894 {{at the urging of}} Ritz. For the Savoy, he hired a new chef, François Latry, who served from 1919 to 1942. In the 1920s he ensured that the Savoy continued to attract a fashionable clientele by a continuous programme of modernisation and the introduction of dancing in the large restaurants. It also became the first hotel with air conditioning, steam-heating and soundproofed windows in the rooms, 24-hour room service and telephones in every bathroom. It also manufactured its own mattresses. One famous incident during Rupert's early years was the 1923 shooting, at the hotel, of a wealthy young Egyptian, Prince Fahmy Bey, by his French wife, Marguerite. The widow was acquitted of murder after it was revealed that her husband had treated her with extreme cruelty throughout the six-month marriage and had stated that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 666, Yeon Gaesomun died of a natural cause and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and {{weakened}} by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother. He was initially succeeded as Dae Mangniji, the highest position newly made under the ruling period of Yeon Gaesomun, by his oldest son Yeon Namsaeng. As Yeon Namsaeng subsequently carried out a tour of Goguryeo territory, however, rumors began to spread both that Yeon Namsaeng <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> his younger brothers Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan, whom he had left in charge at Pyongyang, and that Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan were planning to rebel against Yeon Namsaeng. When Yeon Namsaeng subsequently sent officials close to him back to Pyongyang to try to spy on the situation, Yeon Namgeon arrested them and declared himself Dae Mangniji, attacking his brother. Yeon Namsaeng sent his son Cheon Heonseong (泉獻誠), as Yeon Namsaeng changed his family name from Yeon (淵) to Cheon (泉) observe naming taboo for Emperor Gaozu, to Tang to seek aid. Emperor Gaozong saw {{this as an opportunity}} and sent an army to attack and destroy Goguryeo. In the middle of Goguryeo's power struggles between Yeon Gaesomun's successors, his younger brother, Yeon Jeongto, defected to the Silla side.|$|E

25|$|When Marge {{escapes from}} the {{courtroom}} {{and goes to the}} library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding nothing bad about her and a newspaper tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she has too much to do to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is dressed for the job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep.|$|E
500|$|In June 1947, {{after four}} non-title bouts, Robinson was {{scheduled}} to defend his title {{for the first time}} in a bout against Jimmy Doyle. Robinson initially backed out of the fight because he had a dream that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Doyle. A priest and a minister convinced him to fight. Sadly, his dream proved true. On June 25, 1947 Robinson dominated Doyle and scored a decisive knockout in the eighth round that knocked Doyle unconscious and resulted in Doyle's death later that night. Robinson said that the impact of Doyle's death was [...] "very trying".|$|E

[...] "I knew when I got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background.

500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me and told me that I was the one that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E
500|$|Beauchamp's {{trial began}} May 8, 1826. After {{a change of}} venue was denied, Beauchamp pleaded {{innocent}} to the charge against him. A jury was empaneled, and testimony began May 10. Eliza Sharp recounted {{the events of the}} night of the murder and reiterated that Beauchamp's voice was that of the murderer. John Lowe, a magistrate of Simpson County, testified that he had heard Beauchamp threaten to kill Sharp, and said that on Beauchamp's return from Frankfort, he saw him waving a red flag and heard him tell his wife that he had [...] "gained the victory". Patrick Darby repeated his testimony of the 1824 meeting between him and Beauchamp. Darby said that Beauchamp had told him that Sharp offered him one thousand dollars, a slave girl, and [...] of land if he and his wife Anna would leave him (Sharp) alone. As Sharp had apparently reneged on the promise, Beauchamp told Darby he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the man. Other witnesses testified that Beauchamp habitually referred to Sharp's friend, John W. Covington, as [...] "John A. Covington", the name used by the murderer to gain entry to Sharp's house.|$|E

500|$|Lost writer Elizabeth Sarnoff {{explained}} that Michael's storyline in season two is about [...] "what a father {{will do to}} save his son"; she noted [...] "there's nothing worse than what he does". The second episode of season two was originally going to be Sawyer centric, however this was rewritten [...] "at the proverbial last minute" [...] and changed to a Michael centric episode. Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation for this episode. Perrineau was unaware that his character had been captured by the Others until he was told Michael <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Ana Lucia and Libby. Perrineau described shooting the scenes in [...] "Two for the Road" [...] where Michael murders Ana Lucia and Libby as a [...] "tough day". The last scene shot of season two was Michael and Walt sailing away from the Island. As {{it was a long}} camera shot, Perrineau had to sail the boat so far from the pier, that by the time he returned, all the equipment had already been packed away. He said, [...] "It felt fitting, actually. Like; that's it". Perrineau knew he would be back one day, but as the producers did not reveal any details to him, he did not know when. He was the first actor that left the show as [...] "part of a grander design to come back", and the only one until Emilie de Ravin.|$|E
500|$|Takumi {{found the}} game's first defendant, Larry Butz, to be {{particularly}} difficult to write, and had to re-write him several times. Originally, Larry {{was going to be}} an [...] "average Joe" [...] type of character, who only appeared in the game's fourth episode, but after his inclusion in the first episode, Suekane and Iwamoto told Takumi to give the character [...] "some oomph". Following this, Takumi wrote him as a [...] "prickly tough-guy" [...] who had the habit of telling people he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> them. Some of the higher-ups at Capcom did not like this, so Takumi changed him into a character who laments his lot in life, saying [...] "I'm going to die!" [...] or that the situation is killing him. The culprit of the third episode was originally going to be male, until Suekane pointed out that all villains in the game were male. The development team debated over what to do with the now female character; some staff members thought it would be odd to have a female character be the director of an action show, and some wondered what to do with the director role if she could not fill it. In the end, Takumi changed the scriptwriter character into a director, and made the culprit a [...] "strong, glamorous, fashionable, and cool-headed" [...] producer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{presiding}} judge Asbjørn Nes Hansen {{wrote in}} his sentencing : [...] "Each of the victims {{has been subjected to}} the extreme burden of having been forced to listen to the other being raped while moaning in pain. Lena must have had thoughts about what would happen to her while Stine Sofie was being raped. After Lena was killed, Stine Sofie must have heard the defendants quarreling about who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her. Jan Helge Andersen explained that Stine Sofie took Lena's arm and later peered onto her. She probably understood at that time that Lena was dead. As the District Court has referred in its judgment, {{it is not possible to}} comprehend the fear and the suffering that the two girls went through before they finally died." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} flashback, Sawyer {{returns to the}} house and tells Cassidy to run because Sawyer's partner Gordy <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> them, and points to a car outside.

He sends her off with the money, packed in a bag. He goes to the car, which turns out to be empty.

5000|$|The paper quickly drew {{threats and}} attacks for its {{reporting}} on corruption by government ministers. In 1995, men pulled Wickrematunge {{and his first}} wife, Raine, out of their car and attacked them with clubs.

We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> your children.'" [...] In 2000, the government tried Wickrematunge for criminal libel of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, but Wickrematunge received no major penalties. In 2002, Raine left him due to the constant threats against their family, taking their three children to Australia.|$|R
