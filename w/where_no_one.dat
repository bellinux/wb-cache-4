5|$|The {{buildings}} are considered fireproof by the New York City Fire Department because partitions between individual units {{are designed to}} stop the spread of flames, also known as compartmentalization. This is evidenced by a 2004 fire caused by a cigarette, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was seriously injured because the fire was self-contained.|$|E
5|$|Older {{accounts}} of the Whiskey Rebellion portrayed it as being confined to western Pennsylvania, yet there was opposition to the whiskey tax in the western counties of every other state in Appalachia (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia). The whiskey tax went uncollected throughout the frontier state of Kentucky, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could be convinced {{to enforce the law}} or prosecute evaders. In 1792, Hamilton advocated military action to suppress violent resistance in western North Carolina, but Attorney General Edmund Randolph argued that there was insufficient evidence to legally justify such a reaction.|$|E
5|$|Manstein's plan, {{developed}} with the informal cooperation of Heinz Guderian, {{suggested that the}} Panzer divisions attack through the wooded hills of the Ardennes <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would expect them, then establish bridgeheads on the River Meuse and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Wehrmacht would thus cut off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders. This {{part of the plan}} later became known as the Sichelschnitt ("sickle cut"). Manstein's proposal also included a second thrust outflanking the Maginot Line, which would allow the Wehrmacht to force any future defensive line much further south.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the movie}} Wayne's World, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) is heard {{whistling}} the Star Trek theme while lying {{on top of}} the hood of an AMC Pacer. While looking at the stars, he says, [...] "Sometimes I wish I could boldly go <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> gone before." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.|$|E
5|$|The medieval setting {{has been}} the {{traditional}} background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome, original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers. Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop. Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's Iliad, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> stands out as either a hero or a villain, {{as an example of}} what he wants to achieve with his books.|$|E
5|$|For {{the main}} event, the CMLL ring crew quickly erected a 15-foot tall steel cage {{around the ring}} as the {{participants}} were introduced. The match {{started out with a}} 10-minute period <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would be allowed to leave the cage, forcing the two Infernales squads to fight each other. When the 10 minutes were up Tarzan Boy was quick to climb up the cage and over the top, escaping while everyone else was fighting. Moments later he was joined by teammate Rey Bucanero. Mephisto was the first to escape the cage for his team, leaving four men in the ring. Moments later both Último Guerrero and Averno climbed out of the cage. This left El Satánico to fight Máscara Mágica where the only way to win was to pin their opponent or force them to submit. In the end, the veteran Satánico forced his masked opponent to submit to win the match and the Los Infernales name. Afterwards Máscara Mágica removed his mask per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulations and revealed his birth name, Antonio Gómez Medina, formerly known as Talismán Jr.|$|E

5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E
25|$|Jozef {{took the}} family to a town some miles away <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knew them, and made them promise {{that they would never}} reveal who had {{protected}} them.

5000|$|Two Drama CDs were {{released}} consisting of L SIDE and the R SIDE. The L SIDE {{was released on}} March 21, 2003 under JVC Victor. The R SIDE was released on the same day.

Both of these CDs have the TV version of [...] "Go <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>ones</b> gone before" [...] while the VOCAL SIDE has the full version.|$|R
500|$|Early in the series, Monica's {{apartment}} is established {{as one of}} the show's two primary locations. In the pilot, the apartment number is 5, which was changed to 20 in subsequent episodes after the writers determined that Monica actually lived on a much higher floor. Season three's [...] "The <b>One</b> <b>Where</b> <b>No</b> <b>One's</b> Ready" [...] takes place entirely in Monica's apartment because the show's budget was not large enough to accommodate additional sets or guest stars at that time. In the series finale, Phoebe certifies that each character shared Monica's apartment at least one point during their lives.|$|R
40|$|Most trade models {{today are}} specializations of, or {{variations}} on, the general-equilibrium model of Arrow-Debreu-McKenzie, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one's</b> action is conditioned on others' previous action. Although that model does {{not deal with}} free riding, trade literature has achieved much for a world under stable environment. Evidence from Asian high-tech sectors and findings of dynamic games argue for an augmented analysis of world trade, involving new goods, new suppliers, and rapidly changing technology. Here comparative advantage depends on industrial policy to control free riding, encourage pioneers and launch industries. Distinctly different industrial policies shape international specialization among the nations. Copyright 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
25|$|Another time Saint Anthony was {{travelling}} in the desert, {{he found}} a plate of silver coins in his path. He pondered {{for a moment as}} to why a plate of silver coins would be out in the desert <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else travels, and realised the Devil must have laid it out there to tempt him. Anthony continued walking along and saw a pile of gold in his way which the Devil had laid there to deceive him, but he ignored them and continued on his way.|$|E
25|$|Horne did {{not recover}} his {{physical}} health. Mann writes that {{he continued to}} go on countless hunger strikes in prison without any cohesive strategy and with little support. It {{got to the point}} <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> apart from the guards knew whether he was eating or not. He embarked on his final hunger strike on 21 October 2001, and died 15 days later of liver failure. He had signed a directive refusing medical treatment, and was regarded by psychiatrists as of sound mind, which caused the prison authorities not to intervene.|$|E
25|$|Far from {{endangering}} kids, teen dances keep kids safe. If {{the young}} people hadn't been at a crowded public dance overseen by extensive security (19 guards were at CHAC on Saturday night) <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> got hurt, the kids would likely have been out at unchaperoned and completely unregulated house parties—not after the dance, but all night. And, without a fat calendar of all-ages events, that's {{where they would be}} every weekend. Because without organized all-ages dances and live-music events, house parties and parking lots are all kids have.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women deliver {{at home with}} a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could see that they were poor.|$|E
25|$|Eventually {{the couple}} {{came back to}} the city to work. By then, Bob Whitehead had become a good friend and {{encouraged}} Allen to write another play. She drew on her married life and wrote The First Wife, about a suburban working couple. It was made into the film Wives and Lovers in 1963, starring Janet Leigh and Van Johnson. When Allen read The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, by Muriel Spark, she instantly saw play potential <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else did. After undergoing hypnotherapy to alleviate a yearlong bout of writer's block, Allen produced a draft of the play in three days.|$|E
25|$|Her husband became both sleepy and inattentive {{as he got}} older. The {{sleepiness}} led to a {{car accident}} <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was hurt but Henry was charged with dangerous driving. He became obsessed by the Norwegian ballerina Gerd Larsen and he would refuse to travel with West but wanted to return to London to be with Larsen. West initially considered this to be purely her husband's infatuation, but she came to think that Larsen was driven by money. At her husband's funeral she had the upsetting problem of Larsen's request to be amongst the mourners, {{even though she had}} only known him for 18 months. Henry's will left £5,000 for Larsen.|$|E
5000|$|Bottle episodes are {{sometimes}} produced when a show has a mid-season cliffhanger or an expensive season opener/closer, to allow {{as much of}} the budget as possible to go to the more expensive episodes. Scott Brazil, executive producer/director of The Shield, described bottle episodes as [...] "the sad little stepchild whose allowance is docked in order to buy big brother a new pair of sneaks". [...] The popularity of the Friends bottle episode [...] "The <b>One</b> <b>Where</b> <b>No</b> <b>One's</b> Ready" [...] led the producers to create at least one bottle episode in each season. Several early episodes of The X-Files were conceived as bottle episodes, including [...] "Space", [...] "Darkness Falls", and the well-received [...] "Ice", although these ran over budget.|$|R

25|$|Widows and widowers {{observed}} {{three days}} of fasting and silence, wherein they did not bathe or comb their hair, and may even shave their hair and eyebrows as a special sign of grief. They abstained from eating cooked food until the mourning period ended. In {{the case of the}} death of a datu, his wives, or children: the community was placed under strict mourning requirement called the pumaraw <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was to wear colored clothes, climb coconut trees, or fish in certain streams; and spears were to be carried point down and side arms blade up. A mournful silence was to be conserved, and families could be enslaved as punishment for breaking the mourning interdict.|$|E
25|$|A Landing {{party from}} the Saginaw entered the small Fossil Bluffs Village, found it deserted, {{and the next}} day set it alight. The next day the Saginaw sailed for Hamilton Bay, the site of present day Kake and at the time a large village named Town <b>Where</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Sleeps. This site was bombarded prior to a landing party putting to shore and setting the village afire after finding it deserted. The next morning the Saginaw sailed for Security Bay to a village now known as Retaliation Point Village which was also deserted and put to the torch. Setting sail, the Saginaw found two deserted forts with stores and smokehouses which were also {{destroyed}} by fire.|$|E

His mother, Marie, asked Tony Soprano for money so she could relocate her family to Maine, <b>where</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would know them or what happened to Vito. Tony asked Phil Leotardo to also intervene, because of his involvement in Vito's death. Both paid separate visits to Vito Jr. and told him to start acting more like an adult.
