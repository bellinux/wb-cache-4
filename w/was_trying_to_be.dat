5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed that he <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{all things to all}} people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions {{for the sole purpose of}} pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

He expressed his disapproval of Amitabh's inaugurating a girls' school named after his daughter-in-law, actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, at Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, rather than in Maharashtra. Bachchan was also criticised for choosing to run elections from his native state.

500|$|It is {{not clear}} what the composition's {{reception}} was at the time, and the piece's publication by a company which had little previous experience of this endeavour indicate that there was little positive impact on the composer's financial problems. Joplin wanted to be considered as a serious artist, and spoke of his preference for [...] "classical music". Compositions such as Bethena, A Concert Waltz and his operas A Guest of Honor and Treemonisha indicate that he <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken seriously as a composer. Like many of his other works, Bethena was largely forgotten after Joplin's death from syphilis in 1917. The slow revival and re-discovery of Ragtime and Joplin started in the 1940s, although it concentrated on the rags such as the Maple Leaf Rag, rather than Bethena.|$|E

Cobain {{forgot about the}} song for a while, but began working on it again {{when he and his}} wife, Courtney Love, moved to a house in the Hollywood Hills. In a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if she could use the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied, [...] " [...] off!" [...] and closed the closet door. [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so sneaky", said Love. [...] "I could hear that one from downstairs." [...] The couple shared a journal in which they would write lyrics; Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross noted that Love's songwriting {{sensibility}} informed Cobain's on the song. The song's name came from a heart-shaped box Love had given Cobain. However, Cobain had originally titled the song [...] "Heart-Shaped Coffin".|$|E

500|$|Despite the band's {{annoyance}} {{at having}} {{so little time}} to prepare, the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10:00am. In order {{to sound like a}} live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor. [...] "It was more yelling than singing," [...] Ely said, [...] "'cause I <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard over all the instruments." [...] In addition, he was wearing braces {{at the time of the}} performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. In what was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were not proud of the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was [...] "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. [...] The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.|$|E

Until this time, according to George Martin, [...] "we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own." [...] Released in December, Rubber Soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy. Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to [...] "the Beatles' now habitual use of marijuana", an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as [...] "the pot album", and Starr said: [...] "Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently." [...] After Help!s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning. Of [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] Lennon commented: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sophisticated in writing about an affair... but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn't tell." ...|$|E
