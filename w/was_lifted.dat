50|$|There is {{evidence}} that meltwater discharges are episodic. This can result because as water continues to collect, more ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the water moves outward in a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice <b>is</b> most easily <b>lifted</b> (i.e., areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) <b>are</b> <b>lifted</b> first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice. As water collects, additional ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> until a release path is created.|$|R

50|$|If meltwater accumulates, the {{discharges}} are episodic under continental ice sheets as well {{as under}} Alpine glaciers. The discharge results when water collects, the overlying ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the water moves outward in a pressurized layer or a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice <b>is</b> most easily <b>lifted</b> (i.e. areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) <b>are</b> <b>lifted</b> first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice.
