5|$|During {{the scene}} where Ray's stolen minivan is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as president, he was affectionately {{known as the}} People's President, saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> {{decision}} he had taken during his tenure. Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row. Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged. Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist {{who was convicted of}} conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004. While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row. He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of Saturday, May 5, Mayweather {{defeated}} Cotto in 12 rounds by a unanimous decision, improving his record to 43–0. Mayweather used movement and outboxed Cotto {{in the middle of}} the ring for the first few rounds. Beginning in rounds three and four Cotto cut the ring off from Mayweather, forcing the latter to fight from the ropes. However, Mayweather seemed to outfight Cotto from the ropes with his combinations and by rolling with most of Cotto's punches. Cotto had more success in the middle rounds, landing his jab and body shots on Mayweather and effectively trapping him on the ropes. The later rounds were controlled by Mayweather, who boxed more in the center of the ring late in the fight. In the 12th round Mayweather's uppercut stunned and hurt Cotto, but Cotto was able to fight until the end. The judges scored the fight a unanimous decision for Mayweather by scores of 118–110, 117–111, and 117–111. After the fight, Mayweather said Cotto <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> fighter he ever faced.|$|E

500|$|Of {{particular}} {{note was}} Marseille's 158th claim. After {{landing in the}} afternoon of the 26 September 1942, he was physically exhausted. Several accounts allude to his Squadron members being visibly shocked at Marseille's physical state. Marseille, according to his own post-battle accounts, had been engaged by a Spitfire pilot in an intense dogfight that began at high altitude and descended to low-level. Marseille recounted how both he and his opponent strove to get onto the tail of the other. Both succeeded and fired but each time the pursued managed to turn the table on his attacker. Finally, with only 15 minutes of fuel remaining, he climbed into the sun. The RAF fighter followed and was caught in the glare. Marseille executed a tight turn and roll, fired from 100 metres range. The Spitfire caught fire and shed a wing. It crashed into the ground with the pilot still inside. Marseille wrote, [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> adversary I have ever had. His turns were fabulous... I thought it would be my last fight". Unfortunately the pilot and his unit remain unidentified.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E

500|$|McGovern was {{assigned}} to Liberal Army Airfield in Kansas and its transition school to learn to fly the B‑24 Liberator, an assignment he was pleased with. McGovern recalled later: [...] "Learning how to fly the B‑24 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> part of the training. It was a difficult airplane to fly, physically, because {{in the early part}} of the war, they didn't have hydraulic controls. If you can imagine driving a Mack truck without any power steering or power brakes, that's about what it was like at the controls. It was the biggest bomber we had at the time." [...] Eleanor was constantly afraid of her husband's suffering an accident while training, which claimed a huge toll of airmen over the course of the war. This schooling was followed by a stint at Lincoln Army Airfield in Nebraska, where McGovern met his B-24 crew. Traveling around the country and mixing with people from different backgrounds proved to be a broadening experience for McGovern and others of his generation. The USAAF sped up training times for McGovern and others due to the heavy losses that bombing missions were suffering over Europe. Despite, and partly because of, the risk that McGovern might not come back from combat, the McGoverns decided to have a child, and Eleanor became pregnant. In June 1944, McGovern's crew received final training at Mountain Home Army Air Field in Idaho. They then shipped out via Camp Patrick Henry in Virginia, where McGovern found history books with which to fill downtime, especially during the trip overseas on a slow troopship.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Lofton {{was one of}} six Indians' {{starters}} who batted [...]300 {{or higher}} (.310). He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led the AL {{for the third consecutive}} season. The Indians faced the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of Game Six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 40. It was described by The New York Times as [...] "the run that demoralized the Mariners." [...] Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: [...] "Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995." [...] As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland {{for the first time since}} the 1954 season. [...] "I'm glad for the city of Cleveland to be able to experience this, because they haven't experience this for a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it's improving, and we tried to do this for the city", Lofton said. The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 10044 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a [...]200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> post-season loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.|$|E
