40|$|Pit lakes (abandoned flooded mine pits) {{represent}} a potentially valuable water resource in hot arid regions. However, pit lake water is often characterised by low pH with high dissolved metal concentrations resulting from Acidic and Metalliferous Drainage (AMD). Addition {{of organic matter}} to pit lakes to enhance microbial sulphate reduction is a potential cost effective remediation strategy. However, cost and availability of suitable organic substrates are often limiting. Nevertheless, large quantities of sewage and green waste (organic garden waste) are often available at mine sites from nearby service towns. We treated AMD pit lake water (pH 2. 4) from tropical, North Queensland, Australia, with primarytreated sewage sludge, green waste, and a mixture of sewage and green waste (1 : 1) in a controlled microcosm experiment (4. 5 L). Treatments were assessed at two different rates of organic loading of 16 : 1 and 32 : 1 pit water:organic matter by mass. Combined green waste and sewage treatment was the optimal treatment with water pH increased to 5. 5 in only 145 days with decreases of dissolved metal concentrations. Results indicated that green waste was a key component in the pH increase and concomitant heavy metal removal. Water quality remediation was primarily due to microbially-mediated sulphate reduction. The net result of this process was removal of sulphate and metal solutes to sediment mainly as monosulfides. During the treatment process NH 3 and H 2 S gases were produced, albeit at below concentrations of concern. Total coliforms were abundant in all green <b>waste-treatments,</b> however, faecal coliforms were absent from all treatments.

Thermozymes are often used when the enzymatic process is compatible with existing (high-temperature) process conditions. The main advantages of performing processes at higher temperatures are reduced risk of microbial contamination, lower viscosity, improved transfer rates, and improved solubility of substrates.

40|$|A new {{hydrogen}} sulfide <b>waste-treatment</b> process that uses microwave plasma-chemical technology is currently under {{development in the}} Soviet Union and in the United States. Whereas the present waste treatment process only recovers sulfur at best, this novel process recovers both hydrogen and sulfur. The plasma process involves dissociating {{hydrogen sulfide}} in a "nonequilibrium" plasma in a microwave or radio-frequency reactor.

The remaining gases are purified and separated into streams containing the product hydrogen, the hydrogen sulfide to be recycled to the plasma reactor, and the process purge containing carbon dioxide and water. This process has particular implications for petroleum refining industry, in which hydrogen is a widely used reagent and must be produced from increasingly scarce hydrocarbon resources. The modular nature of the new process may also offer economic advantages over small-scale waste treatment technologies widely used in the natural-gas industry. Laboratory-scale experiments with pure hydrogen sulfide indicate that conversions exceeding 90 % are possible with appropriate reactor design and that the energy required to dissociate hydrogen sulfide is low enough for the plasma process to be economically competitive.

Four main categories are investigated: streams from agriculture; organic waste; wood; and sludges. Altogether 18 different streams are distinguished. Gross availability and net availability are inventorized. Various properties (composition, heating value, supply patterns) are analysed and the suitability of these streams for conversion i a BIG/CC unit is studied. The costs at which various treams {{are likely to be}} available are assessed. The gross energetic availability amounts annually to approximately 190 PJ (HHV) primary energy. Because of competing useful and higher value applications than fuel of various treams, such as fodder and fertilizer, the net availability is slightly less than 90 PJ (HHV). For a number of streams the costs are negative due to present <b>waste-treatment</b> costs. Costs of waste streams vary from- 10 - 5 ECU/GJ. For a small fraction the costs are higher than for energy crops (estimated to be approximately 4. 5 ECU/GJ).

The ability of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to harvest electricity from organic waste and renewable biomass is attracting increased interest in wastewater treatment. In this paper we investigated the bioelectrochemical response of an electroactive mixed-culture biofilm in MFC to different tobramycin concentrations. RESULTS: The electroactive biofilms showed {{a high degree of}} robustness against tobramycin at the level of μg/L. The current generation responses of the biofilms were affected by the presence of tobramycin.

The bacterial communities of the biofilms vary with the concentrations of tobramycin, the equilibrium of which is critical for the stability of electroactive biofilms based-MFC.
