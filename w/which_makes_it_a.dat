5|$|Miss Malini marked Narayan's {{earliest}} use {{of story}} elements that would recur {{in some of}} his later novels. It was later rewritten by him as the 1949 novel Mr. Sampath– The Printer of Malgudi, which in turn was adapted into the Hindi film Mr. Sampat (1952) directed by S. S. Vasan, and a 1972 Tamil film directed by Cho Ramaswamy. Although no print of Miss Malini is known to survive, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> lost film, surviving artefacts include its songs, along with a few stills and newspaper advertisements.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} {{is noted}} for its tolerance of wind, urban pollution, salt spray, and low summer temperatures, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> popular tree for planting in cities, along roads treated with salt in winter, and in coastal localities. It is cultivated and widely naturalised north of its native range in Northern Europe, notably in the British Isles and Scandinavia north to Tromsø, Norway (seeds can ripen {{as far north as}} Vesterålen); Reykjavík, Iceland; and Tórshavn on the Faroe Islands. It now occurs throughout the British Isles, having been introduced in the 16th century.|$|E

Raita is a yogurt-based South Asian/Indian condiment, used as a side dish. The yogurt is {{seasoned}} with coriander (cilantro), cumin, mint, cayenne pepper, and other herbs and spices. Vegetables such as cucumber and onions are mixed in, and the mixture is served chilled. Raita has a cooling effect on the palate <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> good foil for spicy Indian and Pakistani dishes. Raita is sometimes also referred to as dahi.|$|E
25|$|In other {{reactors}} {{the coolant}} {{acts as a}} poison by absorbing neutrons {{in the same way}} that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to scram the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often boron in the form of boric acid) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, {{fentanyl}} {{was introduced}} for palliative {{use with the}} fentanyl patch, followed {{in the next decade}} by the introduction of the fentanyl lollipop, dissolving tablets, and sublingual spray which are absorbed through the tissues inside the mouth. , fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine. In 2013, 1,700 kilograms (3,750 lbs) were used globally. Fentanyl has a relatively wide therapeutic index (270) <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> very safe surgical anaesthetic when monitored carefully; however, its potency requires careful measurements of highly diluted fentanyl in solution.|$|E

25|$|If {{an animal}} is {{diagnosed}} with heartworms, treatment may be indicated. Before the worms can be treated, however, the dog must be evaluated for heart, liver, and kidney function {{to evaluate the}} risks of treatment. Usually, the adult worms are killed with an arsenic-based compound. The currently approved drug in the US, melarsomine, is marketed under the brand name Immiticide. It has a greater efficacy and fewer side effects than previously used drug (thiacetarsamide sodium, sold as Caparsolate), <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> safer alternative for dogs with late-stage infections.|$|E
25|$|Most {{immunodiagnostic}} tests will detect {{infection and}} have a sensitivity above 90% during all stages of the diseases. In addition antibody concentration quickly drops post treatment and no antibodies are present one year after treatment, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> very good diagnostic method. In humans, diagnosis of fasciolosis is usually achieved parasitologically by findings the fluke eggs in stool, and immunologically by ELISA and Western blot. Coprological examinations of stool alone are generally not adequate because infected humans have important clinical presentations long before eggs {{are found in the}} stools.|$|E
25|$|On February 3, 2014, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the {{law firm}} of Mayer Brown filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin on behalf of four {{same-sex}} couples, including a lesbian couple married in Minnesota in 2013. It challenged the state constitution's ban on same-sex marriage as well as Wisconsin's marriage evasion law, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> crime to leave the state to establish a marriage that is not valid in Wisconsin punishable with up to nine months in jail and a fine of as much as $10,000.

25|$|Producing rice in paddies {{is harmful}} for the {{environment}} due {{to the release of}} methane by methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, and live off nutrients released by rice roots. Researchers have recently reported in Nature that putting the barley gene SUSIBA2 into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot (above ground tissue becomes larger, while below ground tissue is reduced), decreasing the methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%. Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> useful tool in feeding a growing world population.|$|E
25|$|The Roussanne vine ripens {{late and}} is {{characterized}} by its irregular yields that can decrease further due to poor wind resistance. The vine is also susceptible to powdery mildew and rot <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> difficult vine to cultivate. In recent years, the development of better clones has alleviated some of these difficulties. The grape prefers a long growing season but should be harvested before the potential alcohol reaches 14% which {{would result in the}} finished wine being out of balance. If picked too soon, the grape can suffer from high acidity. During winemaking, Roussanne is prone to oxidation without care being taken by the winemaker. The wine can benefit from a controlled use of oak. In blends, Roussanne adds aromatics, elegance and acidity with the potential to age and further develop in the bottle.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{methods of}} opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the {{well-being}} of the embryo and/or blastomere may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less of an effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. ZD uses a digestive enzyme like pronase <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the mechanical method of PZD in blastomere biopsies for preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method {{of opening the}} zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo and it is very expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues.|$|E
