500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one.

The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E

500|$|Britten was, as he acknowledged, {{notorious for}} dumping {{friends and colleagues}} who either {{offended}} him or ceased to be of use – his [...] "corpses". The conductor Sir Charles Mackerras believed that the term was invented by Lord Harewood. Both Mackerras and Harewood joined the list of corpses, the former for joking {{that the number of}} boys in Noye's Fludde must have been a delight to the composer, and the latter for an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce from Lady Harewood, which shocked the puritanical Britten. Among other corpses were his librettists Montagu Slater and Eric Crozier. The latter said in 1949, [...] "He has sometimes told me, jokingly, that one day I would join the ranks of his 'corpses' and I have always recognized that any ordinary person must soon outlive his usefulness to such a great creative artist as Ben." [...] Dame Janet Baker said in 1981, [...] "I think he was quite entitled to take what he wanted from others... He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> anyone, but the task in hand was more important than anything or anybody."
