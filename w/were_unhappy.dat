5|$|Despite winning four of {{the first}} five league games of the 2014–15 season, Sannino's future at Watford was subject to much {{speculation}} after it emerged some players <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with his management style. Sannino resigned from his position as Watford manager on 31 August 2014 with the club second in the table, despite winning 4–2 at home to Huddersfield Town the previous day.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015, Samaras was {{reported}} to have agreed terms with Serie A club Sampdoria, but the move fell through as the club <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the results of his medical. Afterwards, he spent time in New York to rehabilitate from a back injury, and in November 2015 was linked with a move to the New York Cosmos, although once again no move actually materialised.|$|E
5|$|Plotland {{development}} {{elsewhere in}} Britain was bulldozed following the Second World War, and various {{attempts were made}} by the local council to demolish Jaywick, but there was resistance from residents, who campaigned against this and won a preservation order in 1970. The council <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> about a housing development sitting on such a flood-prone site, and modern conveniences were slow in arriving. A mains sewer system was only installed in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Jackson and Jones became strained during the album's recording. Jackson {{spent much of}} his time rehearsing dance steps alone. When the album's nine songs were completed, both Jones and Jackson <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the result and remixed every song, spending a week on each.|$|E
5|$|Although {{work had}} begun on the Millfields station, {{including}} {{the completion of}} the station hotel (now the Unicorn pub), the population of Chesham <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> at the station being built such a distance from the town. With the extension to meet the LNWR abandoned the railway no longer needed to curve away from the town, and a public subscription raised £2,000 fund a 71-chain (1,562-yd; 1,428m) extension to a site near the town centre. Construction of the branch to Chesham began in late 1887.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} {{called the}} Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between the French and the Kanaks, {{which had the}} majority support of 80% of the French people. According to the Matignon Accord (or Matignon Agreement) a referendum on independence was proposed to be held by 1998. However, two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement, Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist. The Kanak independence activists <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the situation as they felt that France would never allow them independence.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down quickly. The SER <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
5|$|Season eight was {{received}} well by critics but was less warmly received by fans, {{many of whom}} <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> that Duchovny reduced his role and that Patrick took over as co-lead alongside Anderson. Ratings for the season were initially strong, but it eventually averaged a total of 13.53 million viewers, down from the seventh season's 14.2 million. Concurrent with the airing of this season, Carter and The X-Files production team created and aired a short-lived spinoff titled The Lone Gunmen.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{officials}} <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> {{with the}} turnout of the Ultimate X match at Bound for Glory, {{this was due}} to the technically difficulties involved. A rematch was announced on the October29 episode of Impact!.

Williams versus Styles for the title was promoted for Genesis after this by TNA. Styles retained the championship at the event.|$|E

5|$|The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt {{took place}} from March to June 1937 in the Canadian {{province}} of Alberta. It was a rebellion against Premier William Aberhart {{by a group}} of backbench (not part of the cabinet) members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from his Social Credit League. The dissidents <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with Aberhart's failure to provide Albertans with C$25 monthly dividends through social credit as he had promised before his 1935election. When the government's 1937budget made no move to implement the dividends, many MLAs revolted openly and threatened to defeat the government in a confidence vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railway introduced new tensions {{between the government and}} the First Nations. The authorities wished to move the indigenous peoples to reservations north of the railway in order to cut them off from the United States border. For their part, the First Nations <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> about the railway being built through their lands, stole company horses and disrupted the construction work. The mounted police made arrests and the government reduced their rations: by 1883, the threat of starvation had forced the First Nations to relocate to the northern side of the line.|$|E
5|$|The entire Homicide cast {{returned}} {{for the second}} season. The uncertainty over Homicides future was stressful for the cast and crew, and the logistics of scheduling the filming around the actors' schedules was difficult. Daniel Baldwin publicly criticized NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield over the matter, and it was initially reported Ned Beatty would not return at all. The second season {{was the last to}} include original cast member Jon Polito, who was reportedly dismissed because NBC officials <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with his physical appearance. Polito was publicly critical of the show after his dismissal.|$|E

5|$|The southernmost {{territories of}} the duke, roughly {{encompassing}} northern Delaware, were desired by Charles Calvert, Baron Baltimore, {{who sought to}} extend the reach of his proprietary Province of Maryland into the area. At the same time Calvert was seeking an end to a frontier war with the Iroquois to the north, having persuaded the intervening Susquehannocks {{to move to the}} Potomac River, well within Maryland territory. Furthermore, the Lenape, who dominated Delaware Bay, <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with seizures of their lands by Virginia and Maryland settlers, and war between these groups had been imminent in 1673 when the Dutch retook New York.|$|E
5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired a taste for Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> about the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E
5|$|Violence in Kentucky {{increased}} with {{the outbreak of}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Native Americans who <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> about the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.|$|E

5|$|A {{joint line}} through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had {{approached}} the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E
5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors <b>were</b> <b>unhappy</b> with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the Tribune shut down the magazine, and Benchley was out of work again. When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} at the magazine.|$|E
