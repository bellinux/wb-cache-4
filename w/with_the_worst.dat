5|$|Several storms {{throughout}} the season affected land. Hurricane Estelle passed south of Hawaii, resulting in $2million in damage and two deaths. Hurricanes Newton, Paine and Roslyn each struck Northwestern Mexico. While damage was minimal from these three systems near their location of landfall, Paine brought considerable flooding to the Great Plains. The overall flooding event resulted in $350million in damage, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> effects being recorded in Oklahoma. Hurricane Roslyn was the strongest storm of the season, attaining peak winds of 145mph (230km/h).|$|E

5|$|As {{with prior}} drafts, the team <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> overall record from the {{previous}} season selected first, with teams from the AL and NL alternating picks. If two or more teams had the same record, {{the team with the}} worse record from two seasons prior would draft higher. Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team had the first pick in the 1987 draft. The final two selections in the first round both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.|$|E
5|$|Each team is {{assigned}} one pick per round with the order based generally {{on the reverse}} order of finish in the previous season with the team <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> record receiving the first draft slot. Exceptions to this are the Super Bowl participants from the previous season — the champion Baltimore Ravens were assigned the final draft slot and the runner-up New York Giants assigned the 30th slot in each round. The draft was broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2. Due to previous trades, the Dallas Cowboys and Tennessee Titans did not have selections in the first round. More {{than half of the}} players selected in the draft's first round (17 of 31) would eventually be elected to at least one Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Returning after {{a one-year}} hiatus {{and despite the}} return of players such as Cooney Weiland, Finnigan, Howe and Kilrea, the Senators {{finished}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> record {{in the league in}} the two seasons that followed. Attendance was poor, the club only drawing well when the league's other three Canadian teams came to town. Frank Finnigan recalled that they frequently played home games before small crowds of 3,500 to 4,000. 1932–33 saw the return of Cy Denneny to Ottawa as coach. He would last only the one season. In June 1933, former captain Harvey Pulford was given an option to buy the team and move it to Baltimore, but the option was never exercised. In October 1933, Kilrea was sold for $10,000 to Toronto.|$|E

5|$|The Blue Jackets {{began the}} year <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> start in {{franchise}} history and the worst by any team in an NHL season in 19 years. After an 11–25–5 start, Head Coach Scott Arniel was fired and replaced by Assistant Coach Todd Richards. The poor season prompted several personnel changes including the trade of All-Star forward Jeff Carter, who was acquired with much fanfare during the off-season. With the prospect of another rebuild looming the Blue Jackets' captain and best player, Rick Nash, requested to be traded, though he would remain with the team for the entire season.|$|E
5|$|While Booth's hockey-playing {{future was}} {{initially}} in doubt following his second concussion, he returned for the 2010–11 season and played all 82 games.

With 280 shots, including a 14-shot effort against the Bruins on November 18, 2010, he led all Panthers' players and ranked 12th in the NHL overall. As a team, the Panthers continued to struggle and General Manager Dale Tallon began trading away many of their veteran players {{towards the end of}} the season; they finished <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> record in the East.|$|E

5|$|With {{losses of}} $60,000 over the {{previous}} two seasons, the Canadiens were put up for sale in 1935. Dandurand and Cattarinich entered negotiations to sell the club and move it to Cleveland, Ohio, but a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard stepped forward to buy the team and prevent the transfer. The Canadiens struggled on the ice, finishing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> record {{in the league in}} 1935–36. The new owners asked Cecil Hart to coach the team, in the hopes that he would bring the Habs back to respectability. Hart agreed with one stipulation: that the Canadiens bring back Morenz. The team agreed, and acquired an overjoyed Morenz in a trade with the New York Rangers.|$|E

On the island, 7,879people had to evacuate their houses due {{to the risk of}} further landslides, some of whom went to schools set up as shelters while others stayed with family or friends. Storm surge on Mohéli flooded parts of Tsamia, Walla, and Zirindani, resulting in one fatality. Several houses were damaged on the island, and Djandro lost power due to a damaged power line.
