50|$|A D-ring {{may be used}} {{at the end of}} {{a leather}} or fabric strap, or may be secured to a surface with a metal or fabric strap; though there are D-rings with a middle body {{designed}} to be welded to steel. Ideally, a D-ring swings freely after it has been secured. D-rings may vary in composition, geometry, weight, finish and load (rated) capacity.Though there are differences, a <b>weld-on</b> pivoting link is commonly called a D-ring.|$|E
50|$|CPVC shares {{most of the}} {{features}} and properties of PVC. It is also readily workable, including machining, welding, and forming. Because of its excellent corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures, CPVC is ideally suited for self-supporting constructions where temperatures up to 200 °F (90 °C) are present. Due to its specific composition, dealing with CPVC requires a specialized solvent cement, with high strength solvent cement variants being first introduced in 1965 by Genova Products, then followed by other products such as IPS's <b>Weld-On</b> line. The ability to bend, shape, and weld CPVC enables its use {{in a wide variety}} of processes and applications. It exhibits fire-retardant properties.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from October 13, 2016 - April 13, 2017 This study computationally and experimentally examines the mechanisms of crack penetration, deflection and the transition between penetration and deflection. The finite element analysis based computational modeling work used strength-and-energy based cohesive-zone approach to study the effect of dimensionless parameters (e. g., interfacial incident angle, fracture-length scale, and normalized toughness) on penetration/deflection behavior for mode-I loading (tensile load normal to crack plane). The first modeling work examines the effect of incident angle between crack plane and interface for a crack incident on an interface. As expected, results exhibit that small incident angles cause deflection whereas penetration is more likely at large incident angles. The transition between penetration and deflection becomes more strength-ratio dependent as incident angle decreases. It appears that, facture-length scale is an influential parameter in crack deflection criterion and chances of deflection reduces as fracture-length-scale decreases. Finally, the analysis looked at the effect of normalized-toughness {{and found that the}} normalized-toughness has a small effect on deflection criteria. 	The second modeling work investigated the transition mechanism between deflection and penetration. The situation when both mode-I and mode-II works simultaneously is called mixed-mode, which is presented by the parameter phase angle. Phase angle 0 ° represents pure mode-I, 90 ° represents pure mode-II (shear load parallel to crack plane), and any phase angle in-between 0 ° and 90 ° represents mixed-mode. Results have shown the presence of smaller phase angle in the crack-tip at transition than deflection, while the applied load is elevated at transition due to providing the required energy for both the penetration and deflection. The difference of phase angles between transition and deflection becomes low as fracture-length-scale decreases. The results of cohesive-zone model meet Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) results for the case of small fracture-length scales. This work analyzed interfacial phase angle during transition, between penetration and deflection, not only for homogeneous materials system but also for modulus mismatch. It was found that stiffer first-phase materials tend to create higher phase angle at the crack tip interfaces; the cases for low modulus mismatches are more sensitive than high modulus mismatches. 	A systematic experimental study was performed to compare results with the cohesive-zone method, LEFM, and strength-based method results. A brittle polymer Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was used as substrate material, and two different kind of solvent adhesives <b>Weld-On</b> 4 and <b>Weld-On</b> 16 were used as interfaces that have similar elastic modulus as PMMA. The interfaces created by <b>Weld-On</b> 4 are weaker while <b>Weld-On</b> 16 creates stronger interfaces; however, they have similar toughness. Crack incident angle varied from 75 ° to 90 ° with 5 ° increment. Critical incident angle at transition between penetration and deflection was investigated for each type of interfaces. The results showed that cohesive-zone method can predict crack deflection better than energy-based LEFM; material-to-interface toughness-ratio and strength-ratio both have influence on the transition event...|$|E

The customer's requirements for the case production order included increased level of control and purchasing <b>weld-on</b> parts. The incorporation process for these requirements was not described by the original Work Flow and was the subject of its new revision.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of wheel defects {{on the development of}} rail defects up to a state where rail prompt replacement becomes necessary taking into account different models of the dynamic contact between a wheel and a rail. In particular, the quasistatic Hertz model, the linear elastic model and the elastoplastic Aleksandrov-Kadomtsev model. Based on the model of the wheel-rail contact the maximum stresses are determined which take place in the rail in the presence of wheel defects (e. g. flat spot, <b>weld-on</b> deposit, etc.). In this paper, the solution of the inverse problem is presented, i. e., investigation of {{the influence of}} the strength of a wheel impact upon rails on wheel defects as well as evaluation of the stresses emerging in rails. During the motion of a railway vehicle, the wheel pair position in relation to rails changes significantly, which causes various combinations of wheel-rail contact areas. Even provided the constant axial load, the normal stresses will substantially change due to the differences in the radii of curvature of contact surfaces of these areas, as well as movement velocities of railway vehicles...|$|E
