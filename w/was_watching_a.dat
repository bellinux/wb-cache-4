5|$|K. V. Vijayendra Prasad <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> Marathi film {{where two}} warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are {{attacked}} by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights {{with the army}} and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote {{a story on the}} theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies in his attempt to re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that the relationship between a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.|$|E

He worked with Van Velden Mask Inc., of Stoney Creek, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to develop his idea. The new design, called the All-Star MVP, was approved in 1996 by Major League Baseball. The company is a maker of hockey goalie masks and equipment and was named after the owner of the company, Gerry Van Velden.|$|E

25|$|One of Scorsese's {{trademarks}} was casting many {{actors and}} actresses new to the profession. De Niro, who was already committed to play Jake LaMotta, began to help Scorsese track down unfamiliar names to play his on-screen brother, Joey, and wife, Vikki. The role of Joey LaMotta {{was the first to}} be cast. De Niro <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> low budget television film called The Death Collector when he saw the part of a young career criminal played by Joe Pesci (then an unknown and struggling actor) as an ideal candidate. Prior to receiving a call from De Niro and Scorsese for the proposal to star in the film, Pesci had not worked in film for four years and was running an Italian restaurant in New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the initial}} {{investigation}} conducted by the Philippine Coast Guard, only one apprentice {{member of the crew}} of the Doña Paz was monitoring the bridge when the accident occurred. Other officers were either drinking beer or watching television in the crew's recreation quarters, while the ship's captain <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> movie on his Betamax in his cabin. Nonetheless, subsequent inquiries revealed that the Vector was operating without a license, lookout or properly qualified master. The Board of Marine Inquiry eventually cleared Sulpicio Lines of fault in the accident. In 1999, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that it was the owners of the Vector who were liable to indemnify the victims of the collision. Some of the claims pursued against either Sulpicio Lines or the owners of the Vector, such as those filed by the Cañezal family (who lost two members) and the Macasas family (who lost three members) were adjudicated by the Supreme Court, which found that even the families of victims who did not appear on the official manifest were entitled to indemnity. Caltex Philippines, which had chartered the Vector, was likewise cleared of financial liability.|$|E

500|$|As a {{choreographer}} at Warner Brothers, Prinz had {{a different}} approach than Busby Berkeley, whose choreography for early 1930s movies included elaborate production numbers that were photographed using imaginative camera angles, often from above. Berkeley's numbers [...] "broke {{the boundaries of the}} stage," [...] while Prinz took a completely opposite approach, with the audience never able to forget that it <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> stage performance. Prinz's style is evident in the Little Johnny Jones number in Yankee Doodle Dandy, which featured a stationary camera and included features of the stage, such as the orchestra pit, in the dance number. The camera, in effect, {{became a member of the}} audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{advent of}} Nazism put {{an abrupt end}} to Bayern's development. Club {{president}} Kurt Landauer and the coach, {{both of whom were}} Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the [...] "Jew's club", while local rival 1860 Munich gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. As some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> friendly in Switzerland lead to continued discrimination. Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.|$|E

Tennant was announced as Eccleston's replacement on 16 April 2005. Other recurring characters for the series included Camille Coduri as Rose's mother Jackie Tyler, and Noel Clarke as Rose's boyfriend Mickey Smith.

Lambert reportedly struck the bear with a pole and with his left hand, punched its head, knocking it to the ground to allow the dog to escape.|$|E
500|$|Tennant {{had been}} offered the role when he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> pre-transmission copy of Doctor Who with Davies and Gardner. Tennant {{initially}} believed the offer was a joke, but after he realised they were serious, he accepted the role and made his first appearance in the dénouement of [...] "The Parting of the Ways", the final episode of the first series. Doctor Who continued {{to be one of}} BBC's flagship programmes throughout Davies' tenure, and resulted in record sales of the show's official magazine, an increase in spin-off novels, and the launch of the children's magazine Doctor Who Adventures and toy sonic screwdrivers and Daleks. The show's popularity ultimately led to a resurgence in family-orientated Saturday night drama; the ITV science-fiction series Primeval and the BBC historical dramas Robin Hood and Merlin were specifically designed for an early Saturday evening timeslot. Davies was also approached by the BBC to produce several spin-off series, eventually creating two: Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures.|$|E
500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender was co-created and {{produced}} by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. Its animation was primarily done by three South Korean studios: JM Animation, DR Movie, and MOI Animation. According to Konietzko, {{the series was}} conceived {{in the spring of}} 2001 when he took an old sketch of a balding, middle-aged man and imagined the character as a child. He drew the character herding bison in the sky, and showed the sketch to DiMartino. At the time, DiMartino <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> documentary about explorers trapped at the South Pole. Konietzko described their early development of the concept: [...] "There's an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland ... and maybe some fire people are pressing down on them ..." [...] The co-creators successfully pitched the idea to Nickelodeon vice president and executive producer Eric Coleman two weeks later. The series was introduced to the public in a teaser reel at Comic-Con 2004, and premiered on February 21, 2005.|$|E

500|$|The match saw Lindwall at his best. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs, taking five wickets {{for eight}} runs, and {{finishing}} with 6/20 from 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as [...] "the most devastating {{and one of}} the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket". Fingleton, who played against the Bodyline attack in 1932–33, said [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> man almost the equal of Larwood [...] in pace... Truly a great bowler". O'Reilly wrote Lindwall's [...] "magnificent performance must go down {{as one of the greatest}} bowling efforts in Anglo-Australian Tests. He had two gruelingly long sessions in the innings and overcame each so well that he set the seal on his well-earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever." [...] Hutton was the only batsman to resist the Lindwall-led attack, scoring 30 in 124 minutes and surviving 147 deliveries. The next most resilient display was from Yardley, who scored seven runs in 31 minutes of resistance, facing 33 balls. Miller and Johnston took 2/5 and 2/20 respectively, and Australia's pace trio removed all the batsmen without Bradman having to call upon Ring's leg spin.|$|E
500|$|Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} C+, {{describing}} the film as a long cutscene for fans of the game rather than something equivalent to the recent Warcraft movie adaptation: {{he said that the}} visuals [...] "offer a deep dive into the Uncanny Valley", and praised the lead actors' efforts with a script he found weak. Meghan Sullivan, writing for IGN, gave the movie a score of 6/10: she called the movie [...] "gorgeous", and praised the character design despite some issues with realistic facial expressions, and found the story was bogged down by the political elements when the action side and the plot focusing on the Kingsglaive worked. In contrast, she called the voicework [...] "solid", saying that the leads brought their characters to life and prevented the script from sounding too ridiculous while the supporting cast was weaker overall. She summed up Kingsglaive as [...] "a very beautiful and very confusing movie". Andrew Barker for Variety frequently questioned whether Kingsglaive could count as a movie, as he often felt like he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> recorded gameplay video, praising the visuals while generally faulting the plot as rushed and too full of throwaway characters. Wired's Matt Kamen gave the film a score of 5/10. He greatly praised the movie's visuals, and was positive about the lead actors' performances and the action scenes. His criticism was leveled at its poor portrayal of the female characters, called the narrative confusing, and felt that it focused too much on setting up the events of Final Fantasy XV. His main feeling was that, while it held promise, it relied too much on character stereotypes and world building, calling it [...] "a gorgeous but over-stuffed slice of fanservice".|$|E
500|$|After {{the lunch}} break, England {{struggled}} to 4/35, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker. The debutant Allan Watkins then batted for 16 balls {{in an attempt}} to get off the mark with a series of failed hook shots. He missed an attempted hook shot and was hit in the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer. Soon after, Watkins was dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped lbw by Johnston, leaving England at 6/42. Watkins also collected a bruise on his right shoulder for his troubles with Lindwall; this inhibited his bowling later in the match. Following the departure of Watkins, Lindwall removed Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Young, all yorked in the space of two runs. England fell from 6/45 to 9/47, bringing Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton, who had batted through the innings. Hutton then hit the only boundary of the innings, lofting a straight drive back over Lindwall's head. The ball almost went for six, landing just short of the fence. The home team’s innings ended on 52 when Hutton—who never appeared to be troubled by the bowling—leg glanced Lindwall and was caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon one-handed, at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch {{as one of the best}} he had ever seen. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled a spell of 8.1 overs during which he took 5/8; he totalled 6/20 in 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as [...] "the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket". Fingleton, who played against the Bodyline attack in 1932–33, said [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> man almost the equal of Larwood [...] in pace...Truly a great bowler".
