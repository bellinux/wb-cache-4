5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
5|$|Around 1939, the old aqueduct, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> {{a popular}} hiking trail, started {{becoming}} a popular route with cyclists. Soon after, {{there was a}} proposal to redevelop the trail as a bike path. This proposal never came to fruition, although in the mid-1970s, the city built a separate bike path along Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway, and Pelham Parkway between Jerome Avenue and Pelham Bay Park.|$|E
5|$|Despite the damage, Tyler {{was able}} to move back into his castle, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> {{protected}} by a small Parliamentary garrison. After investigation by Parliamentary agents Brown and Selden, however, the castle was slighted the following year, which rendered it impossible to defend. The Countess of Kent, the new owner of the castle, was given £1,000 in damages, but chose not to rebuild the fortification as it was by then virtually uninhabitable.|$|E
50|$|In January 11, 1985, this {{district}} consists of five wards, namely: Vĩnh Hội Ward (<b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> {{divided into four}} wards numbered from 1 to 4);Lý Nhơn Ward (<b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> divided into three wards numbered 5, 6 and 8);Cây Bàng Ward (<b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> divided into two wards, numbered 9 and 10);Xóm Chiếu Ward (<b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> divided into three wards, numbered 12-14) andKhánh Hội Ward (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> divided into three wards, numbered 15, 16 and 18).|$|R
50|$|SR 15 used {{to travel}} through Hazlehurst, Glenwood, and Dublin, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> {{the path of}} SR 19. It used to travel from Dublin to Wrightsville, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> the path of US 319/SR 31. It also used to travel from Athens, through Arcade and Jefferson, to Commerce, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> the route of SR 15 Alt.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} statues of Robert Peel, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> {{located at the}} police's {{training}} centre Tally Ho!, and Joseph Priestley, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> in Chamberlain Square.|$|R
5|$|Following {{his service}} as governor, Fields {{returned}} to Olive Hill and {{was admitted to}} the bar in 1927. Sensing an opportunity for a political comeback in 1930, Fields launched a bid to regain his former seat in the U.S. House, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> occupied by Republican Elva R. Kendall. Kendall had beaten Fields's successor, Fred M. Vinson in the 1928 Hoover landslide, which saw nine out of eleven (all but the two ancestrally Democratic western Kentucky) U.S. House seats go to the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the Barry Joint Venture was {{launched}} by the Vale of Glamorgan Borough Council, Welsh Development Agency and the now defunct South Glamorgan County Council, later renamed the Barry Action Venture Partnership. The main objective was to redevelop the waterfront around the number one dock, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> derelict.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{learned of}} the {{approach}} of royalist reinforcements and departed, but instead of marching to London, he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset. On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias could join up. More recruits joined his disorganised force, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks). One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.|$|E
50|$|Prior to colonisation, the Dharug {{people lived}} in small groups across the Cumberland Plain, {{including}} in the area <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> the Woodville Ward. The Bidjigal clan lived around the area <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Guildford.|$|R
50|$|Long Lane Cottage <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> in Clifton Way, Goldsworth Park and Langman's <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> in Langman's Lane, Goldsworth {{are both}} {{thought to have}} been built in the 16th century.

50|$|In the basic-type and {{morphotype}} {{scheme for}} eggshell classification (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> typically disused), elongatoolithids {{are of the}} Ornithoid basic type and Ornithoid-Ratite morphotype.

5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but {{it is more likely that}} the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace in the western part of the city, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the morale of the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|An hour later, having {{endured the}} fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle was in a {{position}} to attack the rear-most frigate of the pair as they emerged from the western side of the island. This frigate sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off in pursuit of the other <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle displayed a blue light to indicate her position to the closing Impétueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with the Frenchman. To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the frigate came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their attack for lack of sea room, ran aground on the Pointe de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.|$|E

5|$|By 354/353 BC, in just 5 {{years since}} his accession, Philip had unified Macedon {{and turned it}} into the {{dominant}} power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> battle-hardened, and he now had a supply of ready money to pay for more troops.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, Nichols {{was again}} summoned by Marshall, {{this time to}} Washington, D.C. Marshall had {{recently}} been appointed as district engineer of the new Manhattan Engineer District (MED), and had received authorization to staff it by drawing on officers and civilians working for the Syracuse Engineer District, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> winding down as the major part of its construction program was nearing completion. Marshall started by designating Nichols as his Deputy District Engineer, which became effective when the Manhattan District was officially formed on 16 August 1942.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages the town, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> {{known as}} Manceastre (later to become Manchester), grew and prospered, and trading vessels plied along the river. The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms {{part of the}} City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142. The most {{important}} part of the gift was the fishing rights on the River Irwell, and even in the 18th century, the salmon rights on the rivers of Lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds.|$|E

50|$|The {{forests are}} {{home to more than}} 300 species of birds {{including}} golden eagle, thick-billed parrot (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> endangered having <b>been</b> trapped for collections), military macaw and tufted jay, and were once home to the imperial woodpecker <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> thought to <b>be</b> extinct.|$|R
5|$|News of the {{encounter}} was conveyed back to France, but the country was {{at this time in}} one of the most turbulent eras of the ongoing Revolution and little notice was taken of events in India. Historian William James notes that under normal political circumstances the action would have had more significant ramifications, while Edward Pelham Brenton claims that the French deliberately ignored the report out of fear of antagonising Britain. In Britain, the Admiralty approved of Cornwallis' actions, suggesting that the French were deliberately using the guise of trade to support Mysore against Britain. The action had no effect on the ongoing war in India, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> centred on the inland city of Seringapatam. As British forces closed on the city in February 1792, the Tipu Sultan initiated peace talks which brought the war to an end in exchange for concessions to the Company and its Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June 1809 Agamemnon, {{along with}} the rest of the {{squadron}} (<b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> under the command of Rear-Admiral Michael de Courcy), put into Maldonado Bay for the third and final time, to shelter from a storm. While working her way between Gorriti Island and the shore, Agamemnon struck an uncharted shoal. Captain Jonas Rose attempted to use the ship's boats, together with the stream and kedge anchors, to pull the ship off, but to no avail. The ship had dropped anchor on the shoal just previously, and it was discovered that she had run onto it when she grounded, the anchor having pierced the hull. On 17 June, with the ship listing heavily to starboard, Agamemnons stores and all her crew were taken off by boats from other vessels in the squadron, and the following day Captain Rose and his officers left the ship.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{jurisdiction}} over the province of Soconusco was subject to frequent changes. Immediately after the conquest, it was held in encomienda first by Hernán Cortés, then by Jorge de Alvarado. By 1530, the Audiencia Real of Mexico had {{jurisdiction over}} the province of Soconsusco, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> held in encomienda by the Spanish Crown. It was governed by colonial officers appointed in Mexico. In 1556, Soconusco passed into {{the jurisdiction of the}} Audiencia Real of Guatemala, with independent governors appointed by the Crown. From 1564–69, Soconusco was passed back into the jurisdiction of Mexico, before once again becoming an independent province administered by the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, where it remained until the late 18th century.|$|E
5000|$|In 1883, George Bentham and Joseph Hooker raised Hormidium {{to a full}} genus.

Because the genus Encyclia features non-adnate labella, and because the genus Prosthechea features labella <b>which</b> <b>are</b> only partially adnate (and therefore do not quite meet Lindley's criteria for Hormidium), Bentham and Hooker's description is useful: ...|$|R

5|$|The Italian fleet was reorganized on 9 December, and Pola {{joined her}} three sister {{ships in the}} 3rd Division of the 1st Squadron, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> {{commanded}} by Admiral Angelo Iachino. On 14 December, a British air raid on Naples slightly damaged Pola. Two bombs hit the ship, both amidships on the port side. The hits damaged three of the ship's boilers and caused significant flooding and a significant list to port. Pola was drydocked on 16 December for repair work that lasted until 7 February 1941. She returned to Taranto on 13 February, and she joined Zara and Fiume for extensive maneuvers off Taranto on 1117 March. A nighttime training operation followed on 2324 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the North Korean Army at Pusan made communist continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone. The massive equipment and manpower losses rivaled those of the ROK Army in the first stages of the war. The North Koreans totally collapsed as a fighting force, and the remainder of their routed military retreated into North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered North Korean units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands {{to just a few}} hundred men.|$|E
5|$|The sinking killed 977 of her crew, the {{majority}} of the 1,147 French naval personnel killed in the attack. Some initial salvaging work was done {{in the aftermath of the}} attack, but the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942 interrupted the work. Because she was an impediment to the work of extension of the military harbour (<b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> a full military complex with anti-atomic bunkers), Bretagne ultimately was salvaged from 1952 to 1954. The hull was cut into big parts, which were raised and scrapped ashore.|$|E
