5|$|From its inception, the Progressive League <b>was</b> <b>plagued</b> <b>by</b> {{internal}} conflict between Progressives (former Moderate Conservatives) and Historicals (former Liberals).

By 1868, a rift had opened between the Marquis of Caxias (then Commander-in-Chief of Brazilian forces in the war) and the Progressive Cabinet. With its credibility for prosecuting the war now vanished, the Cabinet resigned and the Emperor called the Conservatives back into power on 16 July 1868.
