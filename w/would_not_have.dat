5|$|As Plato tells it, the heckler {{hails from}} the small island of Seriphus; Themistocles retorts that {{it is true that}} he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been famous if he had come from that small island, but that the heckler <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been famous either if he had been born in Athens.|$|E

5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and}} neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been elevated.|$|E

5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E

5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics and sounds in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team did not intend to create a complete remake of the original game since they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the necessary resources, and because they thought the result <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who pleads guilty must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, he or she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> plead guilty. In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.|$|E
5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew {{impatient}} with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> rebelled excessively.|$|E

5|$|As the NAACP {{attracted}} {{more money and}} talent, and {{became the center of}} anti-Bookerite civil rights activity, Trotter and the NERL became increasingly marginalized on the left.

5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E
