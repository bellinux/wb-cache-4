50|$|Quidams costume designer, Dominique Lemieux, drew {{inspiration}} from Surrealist art, particularly the works of René Magritte and Paul Delvaux. The costumes convey the alienation of the characters and represent an urban landscape {{through the use of}} painted textures and fabrics. The dominant color is grey but is supplemented by deep, rich, warm colors and embellished with metals. Quidam was the first Cirque du Soleil show to use everyday clothing for the outfits, although those in the acrobatic acts are modified. The fabric chosen for Quidam is primarily stretch linen, but also includes leather, jute, linen crepe, <b>wool,</b> <b>velvet</b> and 42 types of cotton.|$|E
40|$|Primary {{components}} of colour reproduction of textured materials, are firstly, the accurate {{rendering of the}} appearance of texture [1], and secondly, the ability to print a surface topology that moves towards 2. 5 D texture printing [2]. The line of enquiry {{is based on the}} author’s interest in the relationship between the ‘direct manipulated’ mark [3] that is digitally generated (mouse, drawing tablet’s, iPads); compared to the analogue mark (produced by a brush, a charcoal smudge, an etched or hand drawn line) and its surface tactility or gonio characteristics [4], [5]; compared to its printed reproduction (for example an inkjet, electrostatic, four-colour separation). There is an emerging area for accurate rendering and synthetic application of texture, for example surface rendering in 2 D and 3 D CAD; and due to recent developments in novel materials and decorative printing inks, textures and embellishments are being incorporated to enhance the surface qualities of packaging. However, convincing naturalistic rendering and texture has proven to be more difficult. Where the human visual system is more forgiving in the perception of halftoned images, texture is problematic, as our visual system is able to discriminate the difference between natural and patterned texture. A natural texture appears homogeneous, but remains random - each element is similar but remains unique. However a patterned texture, although homogeneous is composed of the same repeatable and recognisable elements. Furthermore to render surfaces with no discernable pattern structure that comprises unlimited variations can result in large file sizes. As demonstrated in the recent art exhibition by painter, photographer and printmaker David Hockey at the Royal Academy, London (21 January - 9 April 2012) [6] comparing his paintings and drawings to his iPad works, the surface qualities of the inkjet prints from the iPad drawings were disappointing and devoid of surface characteristics. [URL] Whereas Hockney’s thickly applied paint onto canvas, the paint has a multi-dimensional quality, the varying translucency and opacity of the brush strokes can be seen, as can gloss and matte differential between oil on canvas and watercolour on paper. The difference between Hockney’s approach to drawing using paint on an iPad and drawing on paper can be loosely described as the difference between digital (graphical user interface, pixels, colour picker tools, vector, raster) and analogue (autographic, pigments, brushes, fluid dynamics, materials, texture) and the need to develop methods that are a verisimilitude of real materials [7]. The evolving question is, what are the elements of paintings produced by old masters that capture the qualities, texture, grain, reflection, translucency and absorption of a material, that through the application of coloured brush marks, were able to create a convincing likeness for the material qualities of wood, metal, glass and fabric? There is a difference here between the photoreal methods developed by artists working in the 20 th century who were interested in the creation of hyper-real images. These methods and paintings emulated photographic images and therefore artists attempted to remove any brush marks and surface characteristic to obtain a photoreal quality. However, the painters in the 16 th and 17 th century who were interested in creating a convincing representation of the attributes of a material, these paintings on close inspection demonstrate a gestural almost abstracted version of the material and surface. The paper suggests that in order to create both a convincing visual appearance, a high level of detail is not necessary, that too much information possibly hinders the appearance. It suggests that by using a more gestural approach, whereby the relationship of mark and colour, and by modulating the fluid dynamics of a mark through a textured surface, a more convincing rendering of texture can be achieved. Artists have been long aware of the psychological aspects of the juxtaposition of colour in exploiting the optical qualities and arranging visual effects in artworks. The artists, such as Velázquez, Goya, Holbein, Raphael, Raimondo de Madrazo, Gainsborough, Reynolds [8] demonstrated their mastery of texture by juxtaposing velvet with fur, satin alongside stiff silver embroidery. In order to better understand the convincingness of the visual appearance of texture, in this instance, the study has concentrated on the accurate rendering of garments. What material qualities were they able to convey to the viewer through the medium of paint, that a diverse range of materials - satin, silk, <b>wool,</b> <b>velvet,</b> woven, tapestry, brocade, metal could be demonstrated to the viewer.

They were originally very refined, luxury items. Geometric pieces of rich fabrics were sewn together, and highly decorative embroidery was added. Such quilts were often effectively samplers of embroidery stitches and techniques, displaying the development of needle skills of those in the well-to-do late 19th-century home. They were show pieces, not used for warmth, but for display. The luxury fabrics used precluded frequent washing. They often took years to complete. Fabrics used included silks, <b>wools,</b> <b>velvet,</b> linen, and cotton. The mixture of fabric textures, such as a smooth silk next to a textured brocade or velvet, was embraced. Designs were applied to the surface, and other elements such as ribbons, lace, and decorative cording were used exuberantly. Names and dates were often part of the design, added to commemorate important events or associations of the maker. Politics were included in some, with printed campaign handkerchiefs and other preprinted textiles (such as advertising silks) included to declare the maker's sentiments.|$|R

40|$|In this essay, {{we discuss}} {{words and images}} in sixteenth-century Venice in two forms: the prose {{commentary}} and woodcuts in Cesare Vecellio's Degli habiti antichi et moderni di diverse parti del mondo (Venice, 1590), and the paintings of Paulo Veronese from 1550 to 1578. Our theoretical framework is the analysis of ideology as it is materialized in the making, wearing and representation of clothing. We study three kinds of dress in Venice: the red silks worn by wealthy merchants, the black <b>wool</b> and <b>velvet</b> worn by patrician men, and the white and gold brocades worn by noblewomen. Differences in medium, technique and scale separate Vecellio and Veronese, but they both invoke ancient history and present-day mercantilism to affirm the myth of Venice as a paragon of political order and man-made beauty. That is, the printmaker-writer and the painter share a common rhetorical purpose: through clothing, to celebrate their city as a center of textile wealth and social harmony. In spite of the contrasts between a costume book combining small woodcuts with textual commentary {{and a range of}} large portraits and allegories commissioned by patrons {{at the top of the}} social hierarchy, both men's work communicates the same matrix of beliefs, condensed into their representations of the dress worn in contemporary Venice...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there is}} an actual steam {{cleaning}} industrial process, {{in the context of}} carpet cleaning, [...] "steam cleaning" [...] is, in fact, hot water soil extraction cleaning, which is professionally known as HWE. The hot water soil extraction cleaning method uses equipment that sprays heated water, sometimes with added cleaning chemicals, on the carpet. Simultaneously, the water is vacuumed up, along with any dislodged and dissolved dirt. Many carpet manufacturers recommend professional hot water extraction as the most effective carpet cleaning method which also provides a deeper clean.

6000|$|... “Again, the {{influence}} ascertained to exist of substance and surface {{leads us to}} consider that of texture: and here, again, we are presented on trial with remarkable differences, and with a third scale of intensity, pointing out substances of a close, firm texture, such as stones, metals, etc., as unfavorable, but those of a loose one, as cloth, <b>velvet,</b> <b>wool,</b> eider-down, cotton, etc., as eminently favorable to the contraction of dew." [...] The Method of Concomitant Variations is here, for the third time, had recourse to; and, as before, from necessity, since the texture of no substance is absolutely firm or absolutely loose.

50|$|With the {{building}} of the West Wing in 1902, and moving of offices out of the residence, this oval room was again used as a parlor. Franklin Roosevelt used it as an office in the residence. Following the Truman reconstruction the room was once more used for state events and entertaining. During the Kennedy Administration the room was designated as a drawing room and received many of the furnishings now located there as well as its designation as the Yellow Oval Room. The American interior designer Sister Parish established the basic design of the room by painting the walls a soft yellow, joined by a pale yellow oval carpet topped by Oriental rugs. The French interior designer Stéphane Boudin built upon Parish's contributions, replacing the Truman era hotel style furniture with late 18th and early 19th century French antiques. The furnishings today are mostly in the Louis XVI style, assembled during the Kennedy restoration. Two short columns of green marble were designed by Stéphane Boudin to hold antique, electrified candelabras and Boudin also found the bronze doré and rock crystal 18th century chandelier in Paris for the room. A suite of American manufactured painted wood Neoclassical settee, six armchairs and four side chairs, were reupholstered in a <b>wool</b> and silk <b>velvet</b> faux tiger print during the administration of George W.
