500|$|Superunknown {{lasts for}} 15 songs {{clocking}} on approximately 70 minutes because according to Cornell, [...] "we didn't really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> over {{what should be}} cut". Soundgarden took {{a break in the}} middle of recording to open for Neil Young on a ten-day tour of the United States. The band then brought in Brendan O'Brien [...] to mix the album, as Beinhorn felt the band needed [...] "a fresh pair of ears"; O'Brien had come recommended by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard. Thayil called the mixing process [...] "very painless", and bassist Ben Shepherd said it was [...] "the fastest part of the record".|$|E
500|$|Barkley {{spoke for}} many years of his Republican Party affiliation. In 1995, he {{considered}} running as a Republican candidate for Alabama's governorship in the 1998 election. However, in 2006, he altered his political stance, stating [...] "I was a Republican until they lost their minds." [...] At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence {{to the idea of}} running for Governor of Alabama, stating: I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration... When I run— if I run— we're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people.|$|E

2500|$|Kant {{also claims}} that an {{external}} environment {{is necessary for}} the establishment of the self. Although Kant would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that there is no empirical way of observing the self, we can see the logical necessity of the self when we observe that we can have different perceptions of the external environment over time. By uniting all of these general representations into one global representation, we can see how a transcendental self emerges. [...] "I am therefore conscious of the identical self in regard to the manifold of the representations that are given to me in an intuition because I call them all together my representations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Irenaeus quotes scripture, {{which we}} {{reference}} as John 8:57, {{to suggest that}} Jesus ministers while in his 40's. In this passage, Jesus' opponents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that Jesus has not seen Abraham, because Jesus is too young. Jesus' opponents argue that Jesus is not yet 50 years old. Irenaeus argues that if Jesus was in his thirties, his opponents would've argued that He's not yet 40 years, since that would make Him even younger. [...] Irenaeus' argument is {{that they would not}} weaken their own argument by adding years to Jesus' age. Irenaeus also writes that [...] "The Elders witness to this, who in Asia conferred with John the Lord's disciple, to the effect that John had delivered these things unto them: for he abode with them until the times of Trajan. [...] And some of them saw not only John, but others also of the Apostles, and had this same account from them, and witness to the aforesaid relation." ...|$|E

When she confronts him about their dissolving relationship, Apollo insists that he is still devoted to her and married her because he loves her.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to present the image of Russia in the Polish {{literary}} reportage. I would like to show how often the contemporary Polish reportage refers to national stereotypes, even if it <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> with them. My analysis mainly focus on the books of Krystyna Kurczab-Redlich and Jacek Hugo-Bader, who describe the contemporary russian politics and culture from different perspectives. While the author of "Pandrioszka" mostly concentrates on Moscow, the author of "Dzienniki kołymskie" is particularly interested in Kolyma...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{has three}} motives. In {{the first place}} it <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> against Wellek and Warren who {{maintain}} that all extrinsic approaches to art are unable to furnish aesthetics with a “rational” foundation. But if Wellek and Warren's claim is a crass generalization, {{it does not mean}} that a so called Christian approach to art can easily be justified. Therefore, secondly, a critique - a Christian scientific critique - of some current and so called Christian views on art has become necessary. The last motive, a somewhat old-fashioned one, seems to contravene the second one: this essay <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> state a case for a Christian approach to (the history of) art...|$|R

40|$|This article <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> {{that the}} two {{theatrical}} shows, Sonno from the Italian company OPERA, and Le Grand Architecte, from the French company Pseudonymo, are model examples of the return to {{a certain kind of}} narrative dimension in the contemporary theatre. Over the past years, theatrical theory has often maintained that narrative drama has been completely replaced by visual dramaturgy in contemporary theater. However, an analysis of these two shows suggests that their visual dramaturgy, their construction of sounds and lights, as well as the performer’s actions <b>want</b> <b>to</b> evoke in spectators clear narrative associations. I will set out by presenting {{the state of the art}} and the artistic process of the two companies, to then focus on the way in which these two shows produce a wealth of narrative associations in the audience...|$|R

40|$|This work {{intends to}} {{investigate}} the use of psychoanalytical theory within the aesthetic and critical contemporary art field. To this purpose, it focuses on two philosophers who have become significant in our time: the art critic Hal Foster and the art historian Georges Didi-Huberman. This study aims to show how far the concepts generated in psychoanalytic praxis allowed interpretations that disrupt the traditional aesthetics field. This type of analysis is possible once we abandon the paradigm of “applied psychoanalysis”, which is still current in non-clinical setting. Finally, the proposal <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that the category of the amorphous may clarify certain aesthetic experiences that range from the modernity of art through postmodernity...|$|R

The majority also found that if the Crown <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that a detainee would have made the same decision notwithstanding a Charter infringement, the Crown has the burden of proving that. The majority ultimately found that a court must not speculate on what a detainee might have done or said.|$|R
5000|$|She also {{speaks about}} an [...] "indecent Christ," [...] whereby a kenotic Christology speaks of God self-emptying and being {{embodied}} in Christ and human sexuality. She explains that [...] "Jesus has been dressed theologically as a heterosexually oriented (celibate) man. Jesus with erased genitalia; Jesus minus erotic body." [...] Instead, she speaks about the bi-sexuality of Christ as an inclusive {{understanding of the}} incarnation. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> for a larger Christology which recasts Jesus in postmodern sexualities, genders, and economic locations. This is a critique she had against Latin American liberation theology, which she understood as failing to address questions of gender and sexuality alongside the question of conquest and colonization of the Americas.|$|R
