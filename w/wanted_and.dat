5|$|Cromwell was {{a lawyer}} {{and a member of}} Parliament—a Protestant who saw how Parliament could be used to advance the Royal Supremacy, which Henry <b>wanted,</b> <b>and</b> to further Protestant beliefs and {{practices}} Cromwell and his friends wanted. One of his closest friends was Thomas Cranmer, soon to be Archbishop.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Osborn retires his costumed persona {{and uses}} a {{stand-in}} {{so as not to}} be suspected of being the Green Goblin. This fifth Green Goblin kidnaps Norman's grandson and clashes with a <b>wanted</b> <b>and</b> injured Spider-Man. Norman also crosses paths with Roderick Kingsley and initiates a hostile takeover of the latter's corporate empire, in retaliation for raiding the Goblin's arsenal and identity.|$|E

5|$|In August 2015, {{the series}} was reinvented as Most <b>Wanted</b> <b>and</b> {{received}} a pilot order from ABC. The cast was filled out in early 2016, and production was completed by late March. The episode was co-produced by ABC Studios and Marvel Television. In May 2016, ABC {{announced that it would}} not pick up the pilot to series, and would look to develop other series with Marvel instead.|$|E
5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things the way he <b>wanted,</b> <b>and</b> Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums.

50|$|Like the {{previous}} expansions, new <b>Wants</b> <b>and</b> Fears and interactions were added, {{including a new}} Lifetime <b>Want</b> <b>and</b> several new interactions for children.

40|$|Rationale: {{incentive}} sensitisation theory (IST) {{claims that}} the mechanism of reward is comprised of separate neurobiological systems of <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking, that dependent drug use {{occurs as a result}} of sensitisation of the system controlling <b>wanting,</b> <b>and</b> that the two systems can be dissociated. Objective: to test the IST prediction that <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking for alcohol can be dissociated in humans. Methods: measures of <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking for alcohol were obtained in three experiments. Experiment 1 examined whether liking for alcohol was associated with levels of wanting, as indexed by self-reported weekly alcohol intake. Experiments 2 and 3 also assessed the association between liking <b>and</b> <b>wanting</b> but in these experiments wanting was also indexed by alcohol consumption in the laboratory. Experiment 2 increased wanting for alcohol using an alcohol priming dose to determine whether liking would be similarly affected. Experiment 3 reduced liking for alcohol by adulterating drinks with Tween to see whether wanting would also be reduced. Results: little evidence for an association between liking <b>and</b> <b>wanting</b> for alcohol was found in Experiments 1 – 3 but, collapsing across all experiments, a weak positive correlation between liking <b>and</b> <b>wanting</b> was found. However, in Experiment 2, wanting was increased by the alcohol priming dose whereas liking was not and in Experiment 3 liking was reduced without a concurrent reduction in wanting. Conclusions: although correlations between <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking can be observed these results support the contention of the IST that <b>wanting</b> <b>and</b> liking for alcohol can be dissociated in human participants...|$|R
5|$|Singer {{spent an}} 18-hour day {{shooting}} the underground parking garage robbery. According to Byrne, {{by the next}} day Singer still did not have all of the footage that he <b>wanted,</b> <b>and</b> refused to stop filming in spite of the bonding company's threat to shut down the production.|$|E
5|$|Young {{now had to}} {{lead the}} Saints into the far west, without knowing exactly where to go or where they would end up. He insisted the Mormons should settle in a place no one else <b>wanted</b> <b>and</b> felt the {{isolated}} Great Basin would provide the Saints with many advantages.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, a highly {{unstable}} Osborn has partially regained his sanity {{with the help}} of anti-psychotic drugs. He comes to see Parker as the son he had always <b>wanted</b> <b>and</b> attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails. Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, an emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn he is tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce.|$|E

In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

Brother Ray announced on the January28 episode of Impact! that they were leaving the decision up to the TNA fans to decide who they faced at Against All Odds. On the February4 episode of Impact!, Team 3D announced that the fans voted for them to face Team Canada. Team 3D defeated Team Canada at the show.|$|E
5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we <b>wanted</b> <b>and</b> time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E

5|$|Lucy Stone {{was born}} on August 13, 1818, on her family's farm at Coy's Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. She was the eighth of nine {{children}} born to Hannah Matthews and Francis Stone; she grew up with three brothers and three sisters, two siblings having died before her own birth. Another member of the Stone household was Sarah Barr, “Aunt Sally” to the children– a sister of Francis Stone who had been abandoned by her husband and left dependent upon her brother. Although farm life was hard work for all and Francis Stone tightly managed the family resources, Lucy remembered her childhood as one of “opulence,” the farm producing all the food the family <b>wanted</b> <b>and</b> enough extra to trade for the few store-bought goods they needed.|$|E
5|$|Marcus Lindblom is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} {{known for his}} English localization of the 1995 video game EarthBound. Lindblom spent his youth in the United States, and {{dropped out of college}} to move to Japan with his wife. After four years, he returned to college in the United States and began to work at Nintendo of America's call center. He eventually worked on Japanese-to-English game localization projects such as Wario's Woods and EarthBound. Lindblom worked with a translator and a writer to accurately translate the game for a Western audience. He sought to stay true to Shigesato Itoi's script, but was given latitude to make the script as weird as he <b>wanted,</b> <b>and</b> so added in American cultural allusions. Lindblom considers the localization his highest achievement.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to form two groups, Belle Amie and One Direction, from soloists {{at the end}} of the bootcamp stage was branded unfair by some of the other groups, as neither had entered the competition as groups. The controversy deepened after Cowell put through both Belle Amie and One Direction and picked just one of the original applicants. Cowell defended the decision, saying that the existing groups were not good enough and other groups such as The <b>Wanted</b> <b>and</b> the Spice Girls were created similarly.|$|E

5|$|Unluckily for Galland, his {{excellence}} at evaluation {{earned him}} a place at Tutow training facility where {{he was asked to}} test fly prototype reconnaissance and strike aircraft. This was not what he <b>wanted,</b> <b>and</b> he hoped to be returned to a fighter unit to fly the Bf 109. During his time there, he gave positive evaluations on types such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 189 and Henschel Hs 129. During his test piloting career at Tutow, Galland received unwelcome news; he was to become Gruppenkommandeur of II.(Schlacht)/Lehrgeschwader 2 (II.(S)/LG 2—2nd battle group of the 2nd Demonstration Wing). It was not a fighter unit, but a special mixed Geschwader of ground attack aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was at Paramount Pictures for {{producer}} Roger Edens. Funny Face contains {{four of the}} original George and Ira Gershwin songs from the otherwise unrelated 1927 Broadway musical {{of the same name}} that had starred Fred Astaire. Loosely based on the life of fashion photographer Richard Avedon, who was also the visual consultant and designed the opening title sequence for the film, it was written by Leonard Gershe and included additional music by Gershe and Edens. Donen and Edens began pre-production at MGM, but had difficulty juggling Astaire and Audrey Hepburn's Paramount contracts, the Warner Brothers – owned rights to the Gershwin music that they <b>wanted</b> <b>and</b> their own MGM contracts. Eventually a deal was reached that both released Donen from his MGM contract and allowed him to make his next two films at Paramount and Warner Brothers respectively. Astaire plays an aging fashion photographer who discovers the intellectual bohemian Hepburn at a used bookstore in Greenwich Village and turns her into his new model while falling in love with her in Paris. Donen, Avedon and cinematographer Ray June collaborated to give the film an abstract, smokey look that resembled the fashion photography of the period despite protests by Paramount, which had recently spent a fortune developing the crisp VistaVision. Funny Face was screened in competition at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and received good reviews from critics like Crowther. Sight and Sound, in contrast, accused it of being anti-intellectual.|$|E
