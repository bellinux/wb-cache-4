5|$|At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan {{appeared}} at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands—for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries—to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed {{that they should be}} broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.|$|E
25|$|In the {{expulsion}} from Eden narrative a dialogue is exchanged between a legged serpent (possibly {{similar to that}} appearing on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon) and the woman (3:1–5). The serpent is identified in 2:19 as an animal that was made by Yahweh among the beasts of the field. The woman is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the serpent {{and respond to the}} creature's cynicism by repeating Yahweh's prohibition from 2:17. The serpent directly disputes Yahweh's command. Adam and the woman sin (3:6-8). Yahweh questions Adam, who blames the woman (3:9–13). Yahweh then challenges the woman to explain herself, who blames the serpent, who is cursed to crawl on its belly, so losing its limbs.|$|E
500|$|As of 2012, Ambrose's 405 Test wickets {{place him}} 11th {{on the list}} of leading Test wicket-takers. Of those who have taken over 200 Test wickets, Ambrose has the third best bowling average behind Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner, and has the eighth best economy rate; he rises to third if only those who have taken over 250 wickets are included. For much of his career, Ambrose was rated the world's best bowler in the ICC player rankings, first {{reaching}} the top in 1991; he rarely dropped below second and was ranked in the top 10 from 1989 until the end of his career. His highest rating of 912 in the rankings, which he achieved in 1994, is the equal sixth best rating of all time. In 2010, Ambrose was chosen by a panel of writers and experts as a member of ESPNcricinfo's [...] "All-Time XI" [...] for West Indies. The following year, he was inducted into the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame. During his playing days, Ambrose had a reputation for reticence, and rarely spoke to journalists or the opposition. His response to a request for an interview in 1991—"Curtly talks to no-one"— became associated with him throughout his career, but he was more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> journalists after he retired.|$|E
5000|$|Bishop Richard Pates of Des Moines, Iowa, {{which has}} the first major presidential primary contest in the United States, called on {{candidates}} to show courage and leadership on the issue, saying [...] "With presidential candidates already visiting us regularly, I encourage Catholics across our state, and all people of good <b>will,</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them and ask not if, but how, they plan to work toward solutions to climate change." ...|$|R

2500|$|Reporters {{liked him}} because he was always <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them on the record, even if he could not say much for it. He was the department's {{preferred}} spokesperson for what it called [...] "front-page crimes." [...] Of the department's senior commanders, the same detective who praised Seedman's style in the Times said, [...] "he only one who comes across on the tube—and in a media age you must have a guy like that." ...|$|E
60|$|All this I {{knew to be}} very true. Had it {{not been}} for this {{peculiarity}} of Mr. Hinckman I might have been more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about his niece.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Macallister. [...] "The boat came round {{under our}} quarter, and we landed {{him through the}} lower gangway. He said he'd stay here and wait for ye. He's no sociable, anyway. I've offered him cigars and anisow, besides some of my special whisky, {{but he did not}} seem <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not go {{over there}} and see if we can't {{get to the bottom of}} this game?" [...] was the {{unexpected}} proposal uttered by Mr. Jones. [...] "He <b>will</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would sooner {{come with}} you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let me. And you <b>will</b> promise <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{me all the}} time? No one talks so wonderfully as you do." ...|$|R

[...] Carol remembered that Jackson Elder (now meekly receiving New Ideas) had said the same thing in the same words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{unless you}} care to," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{have no right}} to demand them. I only ask you to remember, Honora, that you have not {{explained}} these reasons very clearly in your letters to your aunt and uncle. They do not understand them. Your uncle was unable, on many accounts, to come here; and he thought that--that as an old friend, you might be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Emmeline," [...] said Ayala, {{putting on}} all the serious dignity which {{she knew how to}} assume, [...] "I am engaged to Colonel Stubbs, and nothing on earth that anybody can say can change it. If you want to hear all about it, Lady Albury will tell you. She knows that you are my aunt, and {{therefore}} she will be quite <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.

50|$|NBC's Andrea Mitchell {{commented that}} the CIA's action may {{be an attempt to}} send a message about leaks as well as a broader message about any contact with {{reporter}}s:Now they've found someone who was about to retire, and they're sending a very tough message. The bottom line is that {{no one is going to}} have the courage or the stupidity or the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> reporters from now on. Very few people will, because they can see from this example, what can happen to you... The purpose is, don't even have lunch with reporters. The purpose is, don't have dinner with reporters. Don't pick up the phone if a reporter calls. It doesn't matter what you say, you're not supposed to have a contact with reporters without telling the higher-ups.|$|R
6000|$|... "Telephone me," [...] said Mr. Crewe, [...] "and if I can get off, I <b>will.</b> I'd like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. You {{have more}} sense than most women I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please tell me--everything." [...] That {{was what}} she wanted to say. He had drawn apart one little chink and showed {{astonishing}} treasures. It seemed to her incredible that a man like that should be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. He had sisters and pets, and once lived in the country. She stirred her tea round and round; the bubbles which swam and clustered in the cup seemed to her like the union of their minds.|$|E
60|$|However Meg managed it, she did {{contrive}} {{that her}} mother should not go near the little parlour this Sunday morning, and Anty was left alone, to receive her lover's visit. I regret {{to say that he}} was long in paying it. He loitered about the chapel gates before he came home; and seemed more than usually <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> anyone about anything. At last, however, just as Meg was getting furious, he entered the inn.|$|E
60|$|For {{a minute}} or two Jimmy left the girl alone. He {{imagined}} if Laura were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him she would let him know. She went {{to the end of the}} terrace, and then turning opposite a bench, looked up and smiled. Jimmy advanced and when he joined her leaned against the low wall. Laura studied him quietly and he got embarrassed. Somehow he felt she disapproved; he imagined he did not altogether look as if he had got up after a night's refreshing sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{say they}} are sportsmen and the fellow in the cloak claims to be well known. The others look like foreigners. I <b>will</b> leave you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them, Don Maccario." ...|$|R
50|$|Also in 2007, Lear's {{board of}} {{directors}} agreed to a $2.3 billion takeover offer from American Real Estate Partners, an affiliate of financier Carl Icahn, subject to shareholder approval. Lear has said it <b>will</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> other interested parties, however, Icahn would receive a $100 million fee should another offer be accepted. The deal was later voted down by shareholders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dinner is ready, and you <b>will</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{me and the}} {{railroad}} man during it," [...] she said.

60|$|Age, {{especially}} when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds much consideration among the poor. The old woman was so decent and contented, and made so light of her infirmities, though they had increased upon her since her former interview with Stephen, that they both {{took an interest in}} her. She was too sprightly to allow of their walking at a slow pace on her account, but she was very grateful to be talked to, and very <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> any extent: so, when they came to their part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious than ever.|$|E
60|$|It was Ukridge who was {{to blame}} for the professor's regrettable {{explosion}} and departure, and he ought by all laws of justice to have suffered for it. As it was, I was the only person materially affected. It did not matter to Ukridge. He did not care twopence one way or the other. If the professor were friendly, he was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him by the hour on any subject, pleasant or unpleasant. If, on the other hand, he wished to have nothing more to do with us, it did not worry him. He was content to let him go. Ukridge was a self-sufficing person.|$|E
60|$|Upstairs in the drawing-room Miss Cassewary did {{her duty}} loyally. It was quite right that young ladies and young gentlemen {{should be allowed}} to talk together, and very right indeed that such a young gentleman as Lord Silverbridge {{should be allowed to}} talk to such a young lady as Lady Mabel. What could be so nice as a {{marriage}} between the heir of the house of Omnium and Lady Mabel Grex? Lady Mabel looked indeed to be the elder,--but they were in truth the same age. All the world acknowledged that Lady Mabel was very clever and very beautiful and fit to be a Duchess. Even the Earl, when Miss Cassewary hinted at the matter to him, grunted an assent. Lady Mabel had already refused one or two not ineligible offers, and it was necessary that something should be done. There had been at one time a fear in Miss Cassewary's bosom lest her charge should fall too deeply in love with Frank Tregear;--but Miss Cassewary knew that whatever danger there might have been in that respect had passed away. Frank was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her, while Mabel and Lord Silverbridge were in a corner together.|$|E

6000|$|It was two {{or three}} days before we got {{everything}} ready, and in our trips to the fort we saw {{a good deal of the}} Indians. We often met them in the town, too, for they were frequently allowed to go out and walk about by themselves. There was no danger, I suppose, of their trying to run away, for they were several thousand miles from their homes, and they probably would not care to run to any other place with no larger stock of the English language than one word, [...] "How?" [...] Some of them, however, could talk a little English. There was one big fellow--he was probably the largest of them all--who was called [...] "Maiden's Heart." [...] I couldn't see how his name fitted, for he looked like an out-and-out savage, and generally wore a grin that seemed wicked enough to frighten settlers out of his part of the country. But he may have had a tender spot, somewhere, which entitled him to his name, and he was certainly very <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> us, to the extent of his ability, which was not very great. We managed, however, to have some interesting, though rather choppy, conversations.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} well-funded {{national}} schemes that involve cross-domain partnerships, linking archives, libraries and museums, such as SCRAN in Scotland and NEWSPLAN 2000. Our Unnetie Project {{is a much}} smaller digitisation project. We started with very little experience of collaboration with partners, less funding and originally {{no idea of the}} process. Helped by the New Opportunities Fund and Resource, our Library Service is working with a County Record Office, a Museum and a local history society to digitise the little-known archive of a local photographer to provide a searchable website of images alongside several storylines illustrating life in the region. The project team has been supported by these partners, overcoming our lack of knowledge and various obstacles, such as the lack of commitment {{on the part of the}} IT developers. The benefits of working with our colleagues were immeasurable and the relationships that have been built up will continue.
