These were then badge engineered into the 'Marshall' range. The company even designed and built some totally new tractors but unfortunately due to the high costs and consequently high asking price, the tractors didn't sell well and the company slipped under.

(2) Structural properties of driver 2 ̆ 7 s seat appeared distinctly; that is, vibro-acceleration of horizontal direction at the elbow had a tendency to become remarkably high and at the back that of forward and rear direction showed a similar tendency. (3) As driving speed of <b>wheel</b> <b>tractor</b> increased, vibro-acceleration increased too. (4) In case of braking when tractor was running, operator received impact tolerably. (5) When tractor ran getting over obstacles, vibro-acceleration increased remarkably. Next I am going to measure vibro-acceleration which may occur in real working.

50|$|Track Marshall was a {{brand of}} {{earthmoving}} equipment who were active during WWII building tanks. Later, they produced a range of crawler tractors, based on the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> Field Marshall brand. In 1956 the first Track Marshall bulldozer model was introduced and later the Challenger 3 followed by the Challenger 33, the TM55 and also the successful six-cylinder TM70 (probably equivalent to a Caterpillar D5). They also built the TM 955 track loader (a drott) and also a range of rubber tracked bulldozers. The company was in business for some 50 years, eventually closing in 1990 after new machines replaced older technology.|$|E

50|$|Up to the 1950s MTZ had not {{produced}} wheeled tractors, tracked crawler tractors being more common. These early tractors were essentially re-claimed tanks, {{with the gun}} turret removed and a flatbed, winch, crane or dozer blade added, the tractors seeing more use on land reclamation and forestry applications rather than agriculture. This was {{largely due to the}} tanks being unsuitable for large scale culitivation as their engine, transmission and track reliability was poor due to them not being designed for pulling loads for long periods as required in agriculture. New designs were put into production during 1950 and the new MTZ <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> was born. These tractors were built to the three main concepts of Soviet engineering- reliability, simplicity and value for money.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the design {{can be traced to}} the Carden Loyd tankette of the 1920s. In 1929 Poland bought 10 or 11 Mark VI tankettes with a licence for their production, and used them for {{development}} of their own TK tankette series. In October 1931 Polish General Staff expressed interest in a small, highly mobile artillery tractor intended for 75 mm field guns in Polish service at the time. In 1932 Janusz Łapuszewski and A. Schmidt of the BBTBP institute ("Armoured Forces Technical Study Bureau") designed a small, fully tracked artillery tractor based on TK-3 tankette. It was designed to tow the 40 mm Bofors and 75 mm wz. 36 anti-aircraft guns, but it could also tow other light and medium artillery used by the Polish Army, including modernised 75 mm Schneider guns and 100 mm Skoda howitzers. For heavier guns it was to be eventually replaced in Polish service with the PZInż 343 <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor,</b> but only a couple of these were completed before the war.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD thesis was to {{analysis}} laboratory and field measurements tractors with different chassis designs. For the measurements were used John Deere tractors with name 8320 R if a wheel and if 8320 RT crawler tractor, possessing the same engine power. Before the field measurements were conducted laboratory tests of tractors, which resulted was the compilation of the full speed characteristics. The field measurements were focused on identifying characteristics of tensile test tractors. For <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> were also measured differences tensile characteristics when changing inflation pressure. Subsequent comprehensive part of a field measurement looked at the analysis of data obtained from measurements of performance and energy parameters of tractor kits depending on the operating mode of the engine. From the experimental measurements show that the tractor equipped with a belt chassis design has a higher tensile strength and also has a lower specific consumption and slippage than <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor.</b> When comparing the measured data with different <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor</b> tire inflation pressure, we find that reducing inflation pressure has {{a positive effect on}} the change of the tensile characteristics. In the practical part of the measurements we have identified that tracked tractor achieves higher performance and lower energy intensity than the <b>wheeled</b> <b>tractor.</b> It was also shown that by adjusting the engine speed into so called economic areas can improve performance while reducing fuel consumption tractor sets...|$|E
