Such technologies must be: capable of effectively treating human faecal wastes without any health or environmental impacts; scalable to address rapid increases in population and urbanization; capable of meeting environmental regulations and standards for faecal management; and competitive with existing strategies. Further and importantly, despite its noxiousness and pathogenic load, the chemical composition of human faecal sludge indicates {{that it could be}} considered a potentially valuable, nutrient-rich renewable resource, rather than a problematic waste product. New approaches to faecal sludge management must consequently seek to incorporate a ‘valuable resource recovery’ approach, compatible with stringent treatment requirements. This review intends to advance the understanding of human faecal sludge as a sustainable organic-rich resource that is typically high in moisture (up to 97 per cent), making it a suitable candidate for dielectric heating, i. e. microwave irradiation, to promote faecal treatment, while also recovering value-added products such as <b>ammonia</b> <b>liquor</b> concentrate (suitable for fertilizers) and chars (suitable for fuel) – which can provide an economic base to sustain the technology. Additionally, microwaving human faecal sludge represents a thermally effective approach that can destroy pathogens, eradicate the foul odour associated human faecal sludge, while also preventing hazardous product formations and/or emissions, aside from other benefits such as improved dewaterability and heavy metals recovery.

The mechanism of this degradation and its oenological implications were examined in this research. It was found that wine LAB able to degrade arginine do so {{by means of the}} arginine deiminase pathway, demonstrated by measuring the enzyme activitie since l l-free extracts: arginine deiminase, ornithinetrans carbamylase and carbamate kinase. These enzymes we represent in most heterofermentative lactobacilli and leuconostocs, but were absent in homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci. The presence of arginine increased the activities of arginine deiminase pathway enzymes in heterofermenters, but failed to induce these enzymes in homofermenters even under conditions of low glucose concentration (1 g/L). Glucose did not repress arginine utilisatio n but fructose appeared to do so, as fructose and arginine were metabolised sequentially, with arginine being metabolised mainly after utilisation of the fructose. D etailed studies o n Leuconostoc oenos OENO, Lactobacillus b uchneri CUC- 3 and Lactobacillus brevis 250 showed that arginine was converted stoichiometrically to ammonia and ornithine as the major end-products and that arginine catabolism could supply energy (ATP) to support growth. lt was also demonstrated that citrulline was excreted during arginine catabolism by both the lactobacilli and the leuconostoc. Some of the excreted citrulline was reassimilated and catabolised after arginine depletion by the lactobacilli, but not by the leuconostoc. The implication of citrulline excretion for the wine industry was explored by studying the formation of the carcinogen ethyl carbamate (urethane) in a synthetic wine and a white wine, since citrulline is a known precursor of ethyl carbamate. During growth of Le. oenos OENO and Lb. buchneri CUC- 3 in the synthetic wine and wine, significant amounts of ethyl carbamate were found i n the two wine types upon heat treatment of samples. The formatio n of ethyl carbamate correlated well with arginine degradation and citrulline excretion. Citrulline excretion during arginine degradation is of concern to the winemaker, since the reaction of citrulline and ethanol to form ethyl carbamate has been shown by other workers to occur even at normal wine storage temperatures. Winemakers, therefore, should avoid using argininedegrading LAB starter cultures for inducing malolactic fermentation (MLF). In addition, spontaneous MLF in wine by undefined LAB strains should be discouraged, as this may lead to formation of ethyl carbamate precursors. Ammonia detection with Nessler's reagent provides a simple, rapid test to assess arginine degradation by wine LAB in a complex medium, but is useful only for strains showing strong ammonia formation.

The concentrations of these sulfur compounds declined over the interval after feeding, mirroring ammonia concentrations measured in rumen liquor, reflecting their common dependence on the fermentation of sulfur amino acids. Ammonia concentrations in rumen headspace gas varied in the opposite direction to the concentration of <b>ammonia</b> in rumen <b>liquor</b> and likely depend more on the pH of rumen liquor. Consideration of the pKa of ammonia suggests that ammonia concentrations in rumen gas will be very low below pH 6, representing a useful diagnostic for subacute ruminal acidosis. Low concentrations of volatile fatty acids were detected in rumen gas. The molar proportions of volatile fatty acids were similar in gas and liquor samples, with rumen gas containing slightly less acetic acid and disproportionately more valeric and caproic acids.

40|$|In this report, we {{systematically}} {{evaluate the}} ability of current-generation, satellite-based spectroscopic sensors to distinguish uranium mines and mills from other mineral mining and milling operations. We perform this systematic evaluation by (1) outlining the remote, spectroscopic signal generation process, (2) documenting the capabilities of current commercial satellite systems, (3) systematically comparing the uranium mining and milling process to other mineral mining and milling operations, and (4) identifying the most promising observables associated with uranium mining and milling that can be identified using satellite remote sensing. The Ranger uranium mine and mill in Australia serves {{as a case study}} where we apply and test the techniques developed in this systematic analysis. Based on literature research of mineral mining and milling practices, we develop a decision tree which utilizes the information contained in one or more observables to determine whether uranium is possibly being mined and/or milled at a given site. Promising observables associated with uranium mining and milling at the Ranger site included in the decision tree are uranium ore, sulfur, the uranium pregnant leach <b>liquor,</b> <b>ammonia,</b> and uranyl compounds and sulfate ion disposed of in the tailings pond. Based on the size, concentration, and spectral characteristics of these promising observables, we then determine whether these observables can be identified using current commercial satellite systems, namely Hyperion, ASTER, and Quickbird. We conclude that the only promising observables at Ranger that can be uniquely identified using a current commercial satellite system (notably Hyperion) are magnesium chlorite in the open pit mine and the sulfur stockpile. Based on the identified magnesium chlorite and sulfur observables, the decision tree narrows the possible mineral candidates at Ranger to uranium, copper, zinc, manganese, vanadium, the rare earths, and phosphorus, all of which are milled using sulfuric acid leaching...|$|R
60|$|Besides the {{differences}} just indicated between the leaves immersed {{in water and}} in <b>weak</b> solutions of <b>ammonia,</b> the tentacles of the latter are in most cases much more closely inflected. The appearance of a leaf after immersion in {{a few drops of}} a solution of 1 grain of phosphate of ammonia to 200 oz. of water (i.e. one part to 87,500) is here reproduced: such energetic inflection is never caused by water alone. With leaves in the weak solutions, the blade or lamina often becomes inflected; and this is so rare a circumstance with leaves in water that I have seen only two instances; and in both of these the inflection was very feeble. Again, with leaves in the weak solutions, the inflection of the tentacles and blade often goes on steadily, though slowly, increasing during many hours; and [page 141] this again is so rare a circumstance with leaves in water that I have seen only three instances of any such increase after the first 8 to 12 hrs.; and in these three instances the two outer rows of tentacles were not at all affected. Hence there is sometimes a much greater difference between the leaves in water and in the weak solutions, after from 8 hrs. to 24 hrs., than there was within the first 3 hrs.; though as a general rule it is best to trust to the difference observed within the shorter time.|$|R
