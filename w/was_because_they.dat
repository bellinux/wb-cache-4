5|$|In 1994 a {{committee}} of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named hahnium (Hn) after the German physicist Otto Hahn, after an older suggestion of ottohahnium (Oh) {{in spite of the}} long-standing convention to give the discoverer the right to suggest a name, so that elements named after Hahn and Lise Meitner (meitnerium) would be next to each other, honoring their joint discovery of nuclear fission. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt that Hesse did not merit an element being named after it. After protests from the German discoverers and the American Chemical Society, IUPAC relented and the name hassium (Hs) was adopted internationally in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{returning}} immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex {{to accompany him}} to his younger sister's wedding. He learns that the reason the couple had him take photos of a cutout picture of them in various places <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> cannot afford a honeymoon. When the groom gets cold feet, Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade the groom {{to go through with}} the wedding. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy, he successfully argues that the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding goes off without any further hitches.|$|E
5|$|The Young Turks and Khánh {{wanted to}} {{forcibly}} retire officers {{with more than}} 25 years of service, ostensibly because they thought them to be lethargic, out of touch, and ineffective. However, the unspoken and most important reason <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> viewed the older generals as rivals for power. Specific targets of this proposed policy were Minh and other senior officers in his short-lived junta, Trần Văn Đôn, Lê Văn Kim and Mai Hữu Xuân.|$|E

60|$|From a {{very early}} age, indeed, this false note in Dolly had begun to make itself heard. While she was yet quite a child, Herminia noticed with a certain tender but {{shrinking}} regret that Dolly seemed to attach undue importance to the mere upholsteries and equipages of life,--to rank, wealth, title, servants, carriages, jewelry. At first, to be sure, Herminia hoped this might prove but the passing foolishness of childhood: as Dolly grew up, however, it became clearer each day that the defect was in the grain--that Dolly's whole mind was incurably and congenitally aristocratic or snobbish. She had that mean admiration for birth, position, adventitious advantages, which is {{the mark of the}} beast in the essentially aristocratic or snobbish nature. She admired people <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> rich, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> high-placed, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> courted, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> respected; not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> good, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wise, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> noble-natured, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> respect-worthy.|$|R
5|$|When the Persians {{heard that}} the Allied fleet was approaching, they set sail from Samos towards the Ionian mainland. According to Herodotus, this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had decided in council {{that they could not}} beat the Allies in a naval battle. They sent the Phoenician ships away (Herodotus does not explain why), and then sailed to the shore near Mount Mycale. Xerxes had left an army there, under the command of Tigranes, to guard Ionia. The Persians beached their ships, built a {{palisade}} around them, and prepared to guard the makeshift fort.|$|E
5|$|As {{with every}} game prior to Final Fantasy VII, Square had {{continued}} to use the passion-based game development approach present with their early projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create the game they wanted. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had extensive capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant they could focus on quality and scale rather than obsessing over their budget. Final Fantasy VII eventually became ranked {{as one of the}} most expensive video game projects at the time, coming in at an estimated $40 million USD, which adjusted for inflation came to $61 million in 2017. Development of the final version lasted just over a year, and included a staff of between 100 and 150 people. As video game development teams were usually only 20 people, the game had what was described as the largest development team of any game up to that point. The development team was split between both Square's Japanese offices and its new American office in Los Angeles, with the American team primarily responsible for city backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, castles {{were built}} {{throughout}} the Holy Roman Empire, which then spanned central Europe. They now typically {{took the form}} of an enclosure on a hilltop, or, on lower ground, a tall, free-standing tower (German Bergfried.) The largest castles, known in German as Hohenburgen, had well-defined inner and outer courts, but no mottes. The motte-and-bailey design began to spread into Alsace and the northern Alps from France {{during the first half of}} the 11th century, spreading further into Bohemia and Austria in the subsequent years. This form of castle was closely associated with the colonisation of newly cultivated areas within the Empire, as new lords were granted lands by the emperor and built castles close to the local gród, or town. Motte-and-bailey castle building substantially enhanced the prestige of local nobles, and it has been suggested that their early adoption <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were a cheaper way of imitating the still more prestigious hohenburgen, but this is usually regarded as unlikely. In many cases, bergfrieds were converted into motte and bailey designs by burying existing castle towers within the mounds.|$|E

5|$|Chad {{participated in}} 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott {{was because of the}} inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior.

5|$|Following their {{defeat at}} the hands of the North Vietnamese Air Force, Colonel Robin Olds learned that Seventh Air Force {{intelligence}} had watched North Vietnamese MiG fighters practicing their new tactics for ten days prior to the battle of 23 August, but had not passed that information on to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and other units. Thus, it soon became clear to U.S commanders that the reason the North Vietnamese repeatedly stood down their fighter force <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were working on their new tactic. In the first half of 1967, the North Vietnamese had realized they could not directly confront U.S. fighters in air-to-air combat, so they changed their procedures for the deployment of their numerically inferior MiG units. To take advantage of the MiG-21’s speed and small size, pilots flying the type were instructed to intercept targets only at high speed behind or above U.S. strike formations.|$|E

5|$|The {{need for}} new rolling stock on the western {{suburban}} tramways prompted Oslo Sporveier to order a modified version to the T1000. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had plans to connect the eastern and western networks, and gradually convert the western lines to metro standard. The T1300 units were built with the same specifications as the T1000, but were also equipped with pantographs so they could operate on the light rail lines. They also had a slightly different front. The initial order was for 33 units, which were designated T5 and T6. The former 18 units had a cab in one end, while the latter 15 had a cab in both ends, allowing Oslo Sporveier to operate single-car trains. The new units were put into service on the Røa and Sognsvann Lines, and were also used on the Kolsås Line outside rush-hour.|$|E

5|$|Kasche had not {{received}} a reply to his telegram of 17 March, so he sent a further telegram to von Ribbentrop on 26 March. In it he advised that two Partisan representatives had arrived in Zagreb for negotiations, and named them using their aliases. He {{pointed out that the}} Partisan interest in an armistice had increased, and emphasised that he considered this a significant development. By this time, Đilas and Velebit had returned to Zagreb, where they reiterated that the Partisans wanted recognition as a regular belligerent, and emphasised the futility of continued fighting. They effectively asked to be left alone to fight the Chetniks. According to Pavlowitch, it is not clear which side posed the question of what the Partisans would do if the British were to land in Yugoslavia without Partisan authorisation, but Đilas and Velebit said they would fight them as well as the Germans. They stated that their propaganda had been slanted towards the Soviet Union because {{they did not want to}} communicate with London. Their determination to fight the British if they landed <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> believed that the British would try to thwart their objective of seizing power in Yugoslavia. They further stated that the Chetniks would not fight the British because such a landing was exactly what they were waiting for.|$|E

5|$|On 1 April 2003, Kato Air {{took over}} the Bodø–Røst route, using Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The new airline had a troubled start with the {{passenger}} numbers dropping by 27 percent. On 4 December, a flight from Røst to Bodø was hit by lightning, and received severe damage during the landing at Bodø. The choice of the operator was criticized by the Røst Municipal Council following the incident, stated that the ministry had prioritized price over safety. The council stated {{that they did not}} feel that Kato Air provided the same service as Widerøe and that the aircraft were a safety hazard. Among the complaints were lack of accessibility for disabled people, no cabin pressurization, no weather radar, more expensive tickets, no discounted tickets and no possibility for carry-on baggage. In February 2006, there was a wave of cancellations by Kato Air, due to technical problems with both the airline's aircraft. In June, the airline's pilots started selling tickets themselves at the airport. The company stated that this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had declined Widerøe to do this because of higher costs. The Civil Aviation Authority of Norway withdrew Kato Air's concession in 2008 due to lack on maintenance. On an interim basis, the helicopter airline Lufttransport, that operated the route to the nearby island of Værøy, {{took over the}} route from 5 September to 29 October, when Widerøe started flying again.|$|E
