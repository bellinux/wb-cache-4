30|$|If the {{evidence}} regarding tsunamis in folklore or historical documents is reliable, {{it appears that}} the boulders in this region <b>were</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> past tsunamis. However, we have no data to suggest that the boulders on Lanyu Island were transported by tsunamis. Thus, we conclude that the boulders <b>were</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> storm waves, particularly those associated with typhoons. Based on the numerical simulation, the boulders could not have <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> the tsunamis, but instead could have <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> storm waves. This suggests that the boulders <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> tsunamis would <b>be</b> relocated by storm waves, if the runup heights of the tsunamis were less than 10 to 15  m, which is almost equal to that of the computed tsunamis.|$|R
5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Welensky found {{employment}} with Rhodesia Railways as a fireman, while putting his physical strength to work as a boxer. He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a locomotive engine driver and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike Welensky <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> management to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia. In 1933 he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council.|$|E

5|$|Anger at Turnbull's {{response}} to the 23 November 2009 meeting triggered a spill motion against his leadership three days later. The motion <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> Kevin Andrews, a former Minister in the Howard government, but was defeated {{by a vote of}} 48 to 35. Andrews was not seen as a genuine prospect for the leadership, so the close vote on the spill motion was considered a blow to Turnbull. While Abbott supported Turnbull at the time of Andrews' spill, he subsequently resigned from the frontbench. Several others joined Abbott in resigning, including Nick Minchin, Eric Abetz, Sophie Mirabella and Tony Smith.|$|E

5|$|After {{resting on}} their arms through the night, the 21st awoke to light {{fighting}} in their front. Over {{the course of}} the morning, Union forces gradually shifted to the left, including the 21st, and it became apparent that the Union right flank had collapsed. Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the Union left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time for the Union army. Finally, under the cover of darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat for the Union army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E

5|$|After this transfer, {{the roadway}} carried the CR492 designation. In 1964, several {{abandoned}} underground mine shafts collapsed underneath M-35 in Negaunee, and M-35 was rerouted {{out of the}} city along its current roadway through Negaunee Township, connecting with CR492. The eastern end of CR492 <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> 2001. Before this realignment, CR492 followed Brookton Road, parallel to US41/M-28 before turning to the previous terminus just west of the border between Marquette Township and the City of Marquette. After the change, CR492 turned north to intersect the highway opposite of Wright Street. The CR492 designation was extended along Wright Street at the same time. In 2006, the city of Marquette extended Wright Street to end at Lakeshore Boulevard.|$|E

In his second season, he <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> the manager Carlos Alberto Parreira from central defence to a defensive midfield role where he flourished.

5|$|During {{the days}} after the landing, the ground forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area. AIB {{personnel}} manned an outpost to warn of the approach of Japanese forces, while the combat troops patrolled and established positions near the main landing area. On 6 November the company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, and subsequently guarded the tracks leading to this area. This unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions to the east of Jacquinot Bay. During this period the 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the landing area, though one of its companies gradually established an outpost between 8 and 12 November.|$|E

5|$|In 1388 he {{returned}} to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, Boniface IX. Leaving Rome, Paul went {{to the court of}} Amadeus VII of Savoy. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress Anna of Savoy, Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon.|$|E
5|$|In October 1914, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> sea to Egypt {{to become}} part of the Force in Egypt {{defending}} the Suez Canal. In the first three years of the war, the soldiers were involved in several small-scale battles connected to the First Suez Offensive, but spent most of their time patrolling in the Sinai Desert and along the west bank of the canal. It was not until November 1917 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the Third Battle of Gaza. The following year the brigade joined the 5th Cavalry Division when it became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade and played an active role in the British victory over Turkish forces in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{following}} his parents wishes {{and looking for}} a job, it is said that Ramprasad devoted most of his time to sadhana. Ramram died before he could make provisions to support the family. Forced finally by poverty, Ramprasad moved to Kolkata and worked as an accountant in the household of Durga Charan Mitra for a monthly salary of thirty rupees. According to traditional accounts, during his employment Ramprasad would write devotional songs to Kali. His fellow employees were appalled to see Ramprasad write poems in his account book, and reported him to their employer. Durga Charan Mitra, upon reading Ramprasad's work, <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> his piety and literary skill. Instead of dismissing Ramprasad from work, he asked him to return to his village and compose songs to Kali, while continuing to pay his salary.|$|E

5|$|M-62 {{was formed}} before 1924 along {{a portion of}} its current routing. The {{trunkline}} started at the Indiana state line and ran north through Edwardsburg and Cassopolis. The northern terminus was at M-40 (now M-51) in Dowagiac. The southern section <b>was</b> <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> the end of 1925 to follow a more direct routing between Edwardsburg and the state line. An extension in 1930 moved the northern terminus west into Berrien County, ending in Eau Claire. The final few miles of highway were transferred back in local control around 1957. Before the transfer, M-62 ran concurrently with M-140 west and continued into Eau Claire. After the transfer, M-62 ended at the eastern M-140 junction and the concurrency was removed.|$|E

Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution declaring Corazon Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized that there is no Filipino historical figure declared through law. On 10 August 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National Heroes Committee in 1995.
