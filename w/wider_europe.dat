5|$|Warfare was endemic {{in early}} Anglo-Saxon England, and major {{conflicts}} still occurred approximately every generation {{in the later}} period. Groups of well-armed noblemen and their households formed the heart of these armies, supported by larger numbers of temporary troops levied from across the kingdom, called the fyrd. By the 9th century, armies of 20,000 men could be called up for campaigns, with another 28,000 men available to guard urban defences. The most common weapon was the spear, with swords used by the wealthier nobles; cavalry was probably less common than in <b>wider</b> <b>Europe,</b> but some Anglo-Saxons did fight from horseback. The Viking attacks on England in the 9th century led to developments in tactics, {{including the use of}} shield walls in battle, and the Scandinavian seizure of power in the 11th century introduced housecarls, a form of elite household soldier who protected the king.|$|E

25|$|From the {{earliest}} days of the Nazi takeover in Germany, the Vatican was taking diplomatic action to attempt to defend the Jews of Germany. In the spring of 1933, Pope Pius XI urged Mussolini to ask Hitler to restrain the anti-Semitic actions taking place in Germany. Mussolini urged Pius to excommunicate Hitler, as he thought it would render him less powerful in Catholic Austria and reduce the danger to Italy and <b>wider</b> <b>Europe.</b> The Vatican refused to comply and thereafter Mussolini began to work with Hitler, adopting his anti-Semitic and race theories. In 1936, with the Church in Germany facing clear persecution, Italy and Germany agreed to the Berlin-Rome Axis.|$|E

25|$|Bede's {{treatment}} of Chad is particularly problematic {{because he could}} not conceal that Chad departed from Roman practices in vital ways– not only before the Synod of Whitby, which Bede presents as a total victory for the Roman party and its norms, but even after it. However, Chad was the teacher of Bede's own teacher, Trumbert, so Bede has an obvious personal interest in rehabilitating him, to say nothing of his loyalty to the Northumbrian establishment, which not only supported him but had played a notable part in Christianising England. This may explain a number of gaps in Bede's account of Chad, and why Bede sometimes seems to attribute to Chad implausible motives. Chad lived at and through a watershed in relations between the Anglo-Saxons and the <b>wider</b> <b>Europe.</b> Bede constantly tries to elide the ambiguities of Chad's career, not always successfully.|$|E
500|$|The {{treaties}} or {{declarations of}} the EU have not declared any city as the [...] "capital" [...] of the EU in any form. However, informally the term has found usage despite connotations {{out of step}} with the normal perceptions surrounding an inter/supranational entity. Brussels is frequently the subject of the label, particularly in publications by local authorities, the Commission and press. Indeed, Brussels interprets the 1992 agreement on seats (details below) as declaring Brussels as the capital. Likewise, authorities in Strasbourg and organisations based there refer to Strasbourg as the [...] "capital" [...] of Europe (often <b>wider</b> <b>Europe</b> due to the presence of the Council of Europe there as well) and Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg are also referred to as the joint capitals of Europe, for example in relation to the [...] "Eurocap-rail" [...] project: a railway that would link [...] "the three European capitals".|$|E
