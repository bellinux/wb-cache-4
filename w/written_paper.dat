40|$|Automatically {{generating}} the related work section for a <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> {{is useful for}} researchers as it can {{save a lot of}} time and avoid missing related works. The related work section of scientific paper usually introduces other researchers' work published before and makes comparisons with the current author's work. This paper proposes an approach to automatically generating related work by comparing the main text of the <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> with the citations to the references from other papers. Our approach firstly collects the papers that cite the reference <b>papers</b> of the <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> and extracts the corresponding citation sentences to form a citation document. It then makes a summarization that makes a comparison between the citation document and the <b>writing</b> <b>paper's</b> abstract, introduction and conclusion. It extracts the representative keywords from the citation document and the <b>writing</b> <b>paper,</b> and constructs a graph of the keywords. The discriminated nodes in the graph are figured out, and then the minimum Steiner tree that covers the nodes is extracted. A summary is generated by extracting the sentences covering the Steiner tree. The experiments show that our approach outperforms three baselines MEAD, ReWoS and ARWG according to ROUGE evaluation results...|$|R

Your Inner Self Since time immemorial {{people have been}} doing abysmal research and <b>writing</b> terrible <b>papers.</b> The ancient civilization of Egypt bankrupted because their sages wrote too many poor papers on too expensive papyrus.
