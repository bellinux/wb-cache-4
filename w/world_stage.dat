5|$|Britain was {{challenged}} again by France under Napoleon, {{in a struggle}} that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations. It was not only Britain's position on the <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe.|$|E

5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the <b>world</b> <b>stage,</b> democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E

5|$|For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli {{campaign}} came to symbolise {{an important}} milestone in {{the emergence of}} both nations as independent actors on the <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> {{and the development of a}} sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, as well as Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E
5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the <b>world</b> <b>stage,</b> and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged {{to protect him from}} incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|In Puerto Rico, Albizu Campos {{used the}} Rhoads scandal {{as part of}} his anti-colonial campaign, {{attracting}} followers to the Nationalist Party. In 1950, longtime Puerto Rican pro-independence activists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola tried to assassinate President Truman to bring their cause to the <b>world</b> <b>stage.</b> When later interviewed, Collazo said that as a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the Nationalist movement.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} {{his childhood in}} his birth town of Ponce, Paoli moved to Spain where, {{with the assistance of}} his well-connected sister Amalia, he obtained a Royal scholarship to take singing lessons in Italy.

5|$|Altrincham has two theatres, the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse and the Club Theatre (latterly {{known as}} the Altrincham Little Theatre). The Altrincham Garrick group was formed in 1913. The Garrick held the <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> premier of Psycho in 1982. In 1998, it {{received}} a grant of £675,000 from the National Lottery {{as part of a}} £900,000 redevelopment of the theatre, which was completed in 1999. The Club Theatre group began in 1896, as the St Margaret's Church Institute Amateur Dramatics Society. It provides a venue for the Trafford Youth Theatre production each year, and it runs the Hale One Act Festival, an annual week-long event started in 1972. The club has received awards from both the Greater Manchester Drama Federation and the Cheshire Theatre Guild.

5|$|In 2015, Cheney {{published}} another book, , again co-authored {{with his}} daughter Liz.

The authors {{tell the story of}} what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II. Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer {{what they see as the}} solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> in defense of freedom.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all people}} with lung {{cancer in the}} US, 16.8% survive {{for at least five}} years after diagnosis. In England and Wales, between 2010 and 2011, overall five-year {{survival}} for lung cancer was estimated at 9.5%. Outcomes are generally worse in the developing <b>world.</b> <b>Stage</b> is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. At presentation, 30–40% of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are stage IV. Survival for lung cancer falls as the stage at diagnosis becomes more advanced: the English data suggest that around 70% of patients survive at least a year when diagnosed at the earliest stage, but this falls to just 14% for those diagnosed with the most advanced disease.|$|E
5|$|The1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Gameswhich were fifth edition, {{were held}} inVancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

The ‘Miracle Mile’, as it became known, saw both the gold medallist, Roger Bannister of England and silver medallist John Landy of Australia, run sub-four minute races in an event that was televised live across {{the world for the}} first time.

He {{first appeared on}} the <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> at the 1988 World Junior Championships, a tournament Canada won, where he scored one goal. His first senior international tournament was the 1991 World Championship, in which he contributed one goal and four assists in ten games as Canada won the silver medal. Linden was also invited to training camp for the 1991 Canada Cup roster, but was released early. In the 1996 World Cup, the successor to the Canada Cup, Linden helped Canada to a second-place finish with a goal and an assist over eight games.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{foreign policy}} remains a {{reserved}} matter, the Scottish Government {{still has the}} power and ability to strengthen and develop Scotland, the economy and Scottish interests on the <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> and encourage foreign businesses, international devolved, regional and central governments to invest in Scotland. Whilst the First Minister usually undertakes a number of foreign and international visits to promote Scotland, international relations, European and Commonwealth relations are also included within the portfolios of both the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs (responsible for international development) and the Minister for International Development and Europe (responsible for European Union relations and international relations).|$|E
5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these claims are valid or not, {{there can be little}} doubt that the entire campaign was poorly conducted, and as a result there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> and the development of a sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E

5|$|Castro's {{increasing}} {{role on the}} <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> strained {{his relationship}} with the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World. Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism. In turn, the Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow. However, recognising Cuba's economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the Prague Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Influenced by China's Great Leap Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries. The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard. This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on the <b>world</b> <b>stage</b> at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed {{to qualify for the}} finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s. Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding {{in the back of a}} van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.|$|E
