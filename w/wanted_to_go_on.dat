5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>on</b> being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

Younger kids played at Redcliffe Police Citizens Youth Club then went elsewhere if they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> Redcliffe Baseball Club had no direct feeder clubs from junior PCYC. In 1991 the PCYC could not support baseball anymore and the seniors wanted feeder clubs to support them so they joined forces at the Silcock Street oval and named themselves the Peninsula Padres – based on the San Diego Padres.|$|E
25|$|Dwarkanath Ganguly {{was born}} on the Bengali New Year's Day, 1st Baisakh (mid-April), 1845 at Magurkhanda village in Bikrampur, now in Bangladesh. At the time of Ganguly's birth, his father, Krishnapran Ganguli lived in Faridpur in {{connection}} with some family work. His mother hailed from a rich family. Once she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a pilgrimage to Puri. In those days, one had to use boats and elephants for transport. Her parent's family {{would have been too}} happy to support her financially for that but she was too upright a person to accept such support. Instead, she covered the long distance for the pilgrimage on foot. This incident portrays the strong will power of Ganguly's mother. The same would be apparent in his life later.|$|E

Eight months later, she sailed for New York, having decided to try her chance as an actress there. Within weeks, she met the as yet unknown writer F. Scott Fitzgerald; he had just handed in the MS of The Other Side of Paradise (1920) to Scribner’s. During their affair, she inspired him with a short story (published as Head and Shoulders) which his agent sold to the Saturday Evening Post for $300 and then the film rights to it for $2500. This money enabled him to marry Zelda, who had put their engagement on hold until he earned some money.|$|E

Later, when asked why he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the Moon missions, he said, [...] "to be alive now and not take part in it seemed terribly myopic". He was put through NASA's rigorous mental and physical examinations. During this time he met Brian O'Leary, also a scientist-astronaut candidate, who became his good friend. O'Leary was selected for Astronaut Group 6 but O'Neill was not.|$|E

500|$|Pierce called Dawn Wells on July 8, 1976, {{to star in}} his film. She {{arrived by}} plane in Texarkana before noon the next day. She stayed in Texarkana for six days, but {{completed}} her scenes in the first two. While filming the cornfield scene, Wells was almost attacked by a bulldog, but the crew scared it away by shooting at it. Wells {{wanted to talk to}} the real-life survivor of her role, Katie Starks, but Katie refused. The Town That Dreaded Sundown was Wells' fourth film and her second time working with Pierce. During her stay, she did not read the script; she relied on the director, instead. She said that was the way she wanted it. Wells explained, [...] "Acting-wise, it's an extremely emotional role. I didn't want to pattern my interpretation after anything. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> my own feelings." [...] Being shot was a new experience for the actress. [...] "They planted a charge in the receiver, so I was standing there holding the phone, shaking, expecting the receiver to blow up in my face." ...|$|E

Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by {{a friend of the}} band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E

[...] She faced {{criticism}} {{from her parents}} over her decision to marry and start a large family so young. [...] She also felt snubbed by her peers, {{at a time when}} the feminist movement was blooming and educated women were establishing careers. [...] She later said, [...] "My parents were questioning my choices, my peers were. But [...] I was pretty resolute, pretty confident in what I was doing." [...] She taught early morning seminary to them and other children while her husband worked, first in business, then in politics. [...] She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> for a master's degree, perhaps in art history, but first taking care of her children, and later her health issues, forestalled that.

500|$|According to Baley, on July 29 Savedra {{informed}} the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, {{that the next}} reliable drinking water was seventy or [...] away, and {{there would not be}} a closer source until the coming rainy season. This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found. Udell disagreed, [...] "I contended that we had better travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, we could get the stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, and we should parish with starvation." [...] Despite his pleas, nobody <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found [...] west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not {{meet the needs of the}} entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.|$|E

[...] But Simpson said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> Taylor was informed and said, [...] "If Tom, wants to go on, he goes." [...] Noticing that his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were 'On, on, on.' The words 'Put me back on my bike!' were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling– now Cycling Weekly. Saltmarsh was not {{there at the time}} and was in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further [...] before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. He was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson beside the road. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before Dumas came with an oxygen mask.|$|E

500|$|On January 25, 1994, the Chandlers' {{lawsuit was}} {{settled out of}} court with $15,331,250 to be held in a trust fund for Jordan, $1.5 million for each of his parents and the family's lawyer slated to receive $5 million for a total of {{approximately}} $23 million (although another source showed Feldman was to receive $3 million based on a September 1993 retainer, for a total of $21 million). According to a motion passed to Judge Melville in 2004, leading up to the 2005 trial, Evan Chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with Jackson's insurer. [...] Jackson's insurance company [...] "negotiated and paid the settlement, over the protests of Mr. Jackson and his personal legal counsel" [...] and was [...] "the source of the settlement amounts"; as noted in a 2005 memorandum in People v. Jackson. It also noted [...] "an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements", as established by a number of precedents in California. Defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often, 'clearly' wrong (depending on the criteria of the court) or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case. That is, to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case, while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case. In 2004, Jackson's attorney Thomas Mesereau in People v. Jackson said [...] "People who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits. Michael Jackson now regrets making these payments. These settlements were entered into with one primary condition – that condition was that Mr. Jackson never admitted any wrongdoing. Mr. Jackson always denied doing anything wrong...Mr. Jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong." [...] Jackson explained why had he tried to settle: [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> with my life. Too many people had already been hurt. I want to make records. I want to sing. I want to perform again...It's my talent. My hard work. My life. My decision." [...] He also wanted to avoid a [...] "media circus".|$|E
