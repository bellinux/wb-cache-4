5|$|In the end, the Baedeker raids {{failed to}} cause any {{reduction}} in the RAF's raids over Germany. Civilian losses were considerable, with 1,637 killed, 1,760 injured, and 50,000 homes destroyed or damaged. In comparison to The Blitz this was relatively minor; 30,000 civilians were killed and 50,000 injured {{by the end of}} that campaign. Luftwaffe losses were 40 bombers and 150 aircrew. Although the night fighters were not particularly successful, accounting for perhaps 22 aircraft from late April to the end of June, their shortcomings <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to being addressed.|$|E
5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first {{indication}} that surprises <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Although clearly an arthropod that walked on the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E
5|$|Learning that British troops <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> the Boston Town Meeting met on September 12, 1768 and {{requested}} that Governor Bernard convene the General Court. Bernard refused, so the town meeting {{called on the}} other Massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at Faneuil Hall beginning on September 22. About 100 towns sent delegates to the convention, which was effectively an unofficial session of the Massachusetts House. The convention issued a letter which insisted that Boston was not a lawless town, using language more moderate than what Adams desired, and that the impending military occupation violated Bostonians' natural, constitutional, and charter rights. By {{the time that the}} convention adjourned, British troop transports had arrived in Boston Harbor. Two regiments disembarked in October 1768, followed by two more in November.|$|E

25|$|The Allies {{staggered}} {{into their}} base at Ciudad Rodrigo on 19 November. Two-fifths of the army's soldiers were either ill or missing. The humor of {{the rank and}} file was not improved when Wellington issued a nasty letter to his division and brigade commanders and it was leaked to the press. A total of 5,000 men were missing. While many of the missing <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to French prison camps, the majority had died from starvation or hypothermia. Though the Allied army had apparently been defeated, in fact much had been accomplished in 1812. The French had been ejected from the cities of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Seville, and Astorga, and the provinces of Andalusia, Extremadura, and Asturias.|$|E
25|$|In late 1995, Ó Sé {{returned}} to the limelight when he was appointed manager of the Kerry senior football team. The task ahead was enormous as Kerry had fallen down the pecking order in terms of championship aspirations. The county hadn't won an All-Ireland title since Ó Sé was a player almost a decade earlier in 1986. Kerry's last Munster title came in 1991; however, since then near rivals Cork had dominated the provincial series. In Ó Sé's first Munster campaign in 1996 Kerry reached the final. Cork, a team looking for an eighth title in ten years, provided the opposition, however, Ó Sé's touch worked the oracle as the Kingdom won by 0-14 to 0-11. It {{was a sign that}} Kerry <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back; however, a defeat by Mayo in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final highlighted the fact that the team was lacking in some quarters.|$|E

25|$|The British {{had escaped}} a {{potential}} disaster, because the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty) was unsupported by the 2nd Battle Squadron (Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender), when {{it failed to}} make contact with the raiding force. The worst British failure was in the exploitation of the intelligence provided by the code breakers at Room 40 (Sir Alfred Ewing), that had given the British notice of the raid. Some intercepts decoded during the action had taken two hours to reach British commanders at sea, by when they were out of date or misleading. News of the sailing of the HSF was delivered so late that the British commanders thought that the Germans <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> when they were returning. At sea, Beatty had sent ambiguous signals and some commanders had not used their initiative. On 30December, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, had ordered that when in contact with German ships, officers were to treat orders from those ignorant of local conditions as instructions only, not orders but he refused Admiralty suggestions to loosen ship formations, for fear of decentralising tactical command too far.|$|E
25|$|The Bulgarian state {{existed before}} the {{formation}} of the Bulgarian people. Prior to the establishment of the Bulgarian state the Slavs had mingled with the native Thracian population. The population and the density of the settlements increased after 681 and the differences between the individual Slavic tribes gradually disappeared as communications became regular between the regions of the country. By {{the second half of the}} 9th century, Bulgars and Slavs had lived together for almost two centuries and the more numerous Slavs <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to assimilate the Bulgars. Many Bulgars had already started to use the Slavic Old Bulgarian language while the Turkic Bulgar language gradually died out leaving only certain words and terms. The Christianization of Bulgaria and the establishment of Old Bulgarian as a language of the state and the Church under BorisI further accelerated that process and were the main means to bind together Bulgars and Slavs and to make the Slavs of Macedonia and the other reaches of the country into Bulgarians. The new religion dealt a crushing blow on the privileges of the old Bulgar aristocracy and furthermore by that time many Bulgars were presumably speaking Slavic. Boris I made it a national policy to use the doctrine of Christianity, that had neither Slavic or Bulgar origin, to bind them together in a single culture. As a result, by the end of the 9th century the Bulgarians had become a single Slavic nationality with ethnic awareness that was to survive in triumph and tragedy to present.|$|E
25|$|Fletcher {{was again}} {{mentioned}} in dispatches when serving as chief {{engineer at the}} second siege of Badajoz (19 May - 10 June 1811). The engineers suffered many casualties {{in their attempts to}} dig the thin rocky soils around a fort that had been repaired and reinforced since the last unsuccessful siege. Running short of ammunition and having sustained heavy losses; and with news that French reinforcements <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> Wellington withdrew his forces to Elvas on 10 June. Fletcher was also present when Ciudad Rodrigo (7 - 19 January 1812) and, on the third attempt, Badajoz (17 March - 16 April 1812) were captured. In the latter engagement it was Fletcher who identified the weak point in the defences and so ultimately decided where the main attack should be. On 19 March, Fletcher was shot in the groin when a French sortie in the fog reached the trenches where he and his engineers were working. His injury might have been much worse if it wasn't for a Spanish Silver Dollar in his pocket which took the main force of the musket ball. Fletcher's injury had him confined to his tent where Wellington, desperately short of good engineers, visited him daily for advice. Fletcher returned to England to recover, and was made a baronet on 14 December 1812, and awarded a pension of £1.00 per diem. He received the Portuguese award of the Order of the Tower and Sword; and the Army Gold Cross for Talavera, Bussaco, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Badajoz.|$|E

Ewell, were approaching Gettysburg from the north, from the towns of Carlisle and York. The five brigades of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes marched down the Carlisle Road but left it before reaching town to advance down the wooded crest of Oak Ridge, where they could link up with the left flank of Hill's Corps. The four brigades under Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early approached on the Harrisburg Road. Union cavalry outposts north of the town detected both movements. Ewell's remaining division (Maj. Gen.

500|$|Following the {{completion}} of Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, Sega began working on the next game in its Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, which was known in development as Sonic X-treme {{and would have been}} the first Sonic game to feature fully 3D graphics. Development of the game was started by Sega Technical Institute, a U.S.-based developer that had worked on several previous Sonic games, beginning on the Sega Genesis and subsequently moving to the Sega 32X. [...] In its earliest conception, Sonic X-treme was designed for release on the Sega Genesis as a side-scrolling platform game, much like previous Sonic games for the system. As new consoles {{and the beginning of the}} 32-bit era <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> the game was later moved to the Sega 32X and was known at this stage under the development names Sonic 32X and Sonic Mars, after the development name [...] "Project Mars" [...] used for the Sega 32X. [...] Even at this stage, the game's design changed wildly, including concepts such as an isometric viewpoint side-scroller. [...] Eventually, however, development of the game was settled on a full 3D platform game.|$|E
