5|$|Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller, DSO and Bar (4 April 1900– 1 March 1942) was {{a senior}} officer in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). His career spanned almost thirty years, {{including}} service in both world wars. At the helm of HMAS Stuart in the Mediterranean from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and flotilla commander. He then transferred to the South West Pacific as captain of the light cruiser HMAS Perth, and <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> his ship against heavy odds during the Battle of Sunda Strait in early 1942.|$|E
5|$|New York won the {{following}} week against Minnesota before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding a significant advantage in time of possession, they lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound New York's problems, Phil Simms <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> an injury that would sideline him {{for the rest of}} the year.

As the convoy, which consisted of 60 ships and 26 escorts, sailed near Iceland, a wolf pack of Kriegsmarine U-Boats attacked the convoy repeatedly over a four-day period. Some 20 U-boats participated, sinking 12 Allied ships, including , a troop transport that <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> 272 men—more than half of her passengers and crew; three U-boats were lost. Samuel Huntington departed the convoy and arrived at Clyde on 11 February.|$|E

5|$|Fusō and Yamashiro {{were the}} only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and both were lost {{in the early hours of}} 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire. Some eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves {{remained}} afloat and burning for an hour, but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding. Six battleships and eight cruisers were lying in wait for Yamashiro; she did not survive the encounter, and Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> his ship. Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived.|$|E
5|$|Monitor {{likewise}} did {{not survive}} the year. She was ordered to Beaufort, North Carolina, on Christmas Day, {{to take part in}} the blockade there. While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the Monitor took on water. Soon the water in the hold gained on the pumps, and then put out the fires in her engines. The order was given to abandon ship; most men were rescued by , but 16 <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> her when she sank in the early hours of December 31, 1862.|$|E
5|$|The {{next two}} seasons {{would be a}} {{regression}} for both the team and Sanchez as they failed to reach the playoffs. Fans and media critics called for a struggling Sanchez to be benched. He eventually was replaced {{towards the end of}} the 2012 season by Greg McElroy. Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury during the preseason in 2013; he was released after the season concluded and was subsequently signed by the Philadelphia Eagles. When Philadelphia's starter Nick Foles <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> an injury, Sanchez started the second half of the season for the Eagles, where he set career highs in completion percentage and passer rating, while also passing for 2,418 yards despite only starting 8 games.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{artillery}} officer Anders Gyllenspak, only 40 men, including himself, survived the sinking: Major Johan Klerk, 2 trumpeters, 14 sailors and 22 soldiers, {{which means that}} more than 800 had perished. Among them were half a dozen navy and army officers {{as well as the}} chief physician of the Admiralty and the fleet apothecary. Altogether around 1,400 men died when Kronan and Svärdet were lost, and in the days following the battle, hundreds of corpses were washed up on the east coast of Öland. According to the vicar of Långlöt parish, 183 men were taken from the beaches and buried at Hulterstad and Stenåsa graveyards. Lorentz Creutz's body was identified and shipped to his estate in Savolaks, Finland, where it was buried. The losses were even worse since Kronan was the flagship and was manned with the best sailors and gunners in the fleet. When Kronan and Svärdet went down, they took with them the navy's entire stock of 30- and 36-pounder guns. Altogether over 300tonnes of bronze guns worth nearly 250,000 silver dalers <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the ships, a sum that was slightly higher than the value of the ships themselves.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1957–58 season, the Celtics won 14 {{straight}} games, and continued to succeed. Russell averaged 16.6 points per game and a league-record average of 22.7 rebounds per game. An interesting phenomenon began that year: Russell was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player, but only named to the All-NBA Second Team. This would occur repeatedly throughout his career. The NBA reasoned that other centers were better all-round players than Russell, but no player was more valuable to his team. The Celtics won 49 games and easily made the first berth in the 1958 NBA Playoffs, and made the 1958 NBA Finals against their familiar rivals, the St. Louis Hawks. The teams split the first two games, but then Russell <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a foot injury in Game 3 and only returned for Game 6. The Celtics surprisingly won Game 4, but the Hawks prevailed in Games 5 and 6, with Pettit scoring 50 points in the deciding Game 6.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} game of the 2014–15 season, the 7th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a broken leg which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his {{shoulder}} ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41. With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field. The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the 4th worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history.|$|E

5|$|Flooding and {{landslides}} in Jamaica {{took their}} toll on property, agricultural interests, and infrastructure; fruit growers on the island sustained about $2.5 million (1935 USD) in losses. Just off the coast, an unidentified vessel <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> her entire crew in the hostile conditions. Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba, notably in and around Santiago de Cuba. There, the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris. Only four {{people died in the}} country, thanks to the extensive pre-storm preparations. The storm did the most damage along the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti, where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2,000 individuals, razed hundreds of native houses, and destroyed crops and livestock. The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of Jacmel and Jérémie; one early report estimated that 1,500 had been killed at the latter. Entire swaths of countryside were isolated for days, delaying both reconnaissance and relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the crewmen, soldiers, sailors and gunners alike, nothing has been recorded. The only source of information for these men has been through osteological analysis of the human bones found at the wrecksite. An approximate composition of some of the crew has been conjectured based on contemporary records. The Mary Rose would have carried a captain, a master responsible for navigation, and deck crew. There would also have been a purser responsible for handling payments, a boatswain, the captain's second in command, at least one carpenter, a pilot in charge of navigation, and a cook, all of whom had one or more assistants (mates). The ship was also staffed by a barber-surgeon who tended to the sick and wounded, along with an apprentice or mate and possibly also a junior surgeon. The only positively identified person who <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the ship was Vice-Admiral George Carew. McKee, Stirland and several other authors have also named Roger Grenville, father of Richard Grenville of the Elizabethan-era Revenge, captain during the final battle, although the accuracy of the sourcing for this has been disputed by maritime archaeologist Peter Marsden.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, 2016, Middleton {{was ruled}} out {{for six months}} after {{sustaining}} a left hamstring injury in preseason workouts that required surgery. On February 8, 2017, he made his 2016–17 season debut after missing the first 50 games with the hamstring injury. On a night when teammate Jabari Parker <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a knee injury, Middleton looked spry in limited action, scoring five points in 15 minutes in a 106–88 loss to the Miami Heat. Seven days later, in his fourth game back, Middleton scored a season-high 20 points in a 129–125 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He topped that mark on March 1, scoring 21 points to go with five rebounds and five assists in a 110–98 loss to the Denver Nuggets. Three days later, he set a new season high with 24 points in a 101–94 win over the Toronto Raptors.
