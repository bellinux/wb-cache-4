30|$|The {{diffusion}} length {{has to be}} less than the P-type wafer thickness of 300  µm. Note that the minimum minority carrier life time allows to limit the {{diffusion length}} less than 130  µm [20]. Thus, for realistic approach the diffusion length of 200  µm is considered here. To enhance the absorption, experimentally obtained textured wafer data were considered and inputted in this simulation. Both sides texturing option was enabled, and pyramid height of 1  µm with equal angles of 54.74 ° was considered for initial simulation. This is because in Ref. [18], the pyramid height of textured <b>wafer</b> <b>height</b> lies in the range of 1 – 3.5  µm, obtained following the etching solution of 0.763 wt% KOH– 4 wt% IPA. Finally, to emulate the sun, AM (air mass) 1.5 G and 100 number of time steps have been selected.|$|E
40|$|Future {{hypersonic}} vehicles require high temperature, {{dynamic seals}} in advanced hypersonic engines {{and on the}} vehicle airframe to seal the perimeters of movable panels, flaps, and doors. Current seals {{do not meet the}} demanding requirements of these applications, so NASA Glenn Research Center is developing improved designs to overcome these shortfalls. An advanced ceramic wafer seal design has shown promise in meeting these needs. Results from a design of experiments study performed on this seal revealed that several installation variables played a role in determining the amount of leakage past the seals. Lower leakage rates were achieved by using a tighter groove width around the seals, a higher seal preload, a tighter <b>wafer</b> <b>height</b> tolerance, and a looser groove length. During flow testing, a seal activating pressure acting behind the wafers combined with simulated vibrations to seat the seals more effectively against the sealing surface and produce lower leakage rates. A seal geometry study revealed comparable leakage for full-scale wafers with 0. 125 and 0. 25 in. thicknesses. For applications in which lower part counts are desired, fewer 0. 25 -in. -thick wafers may be able to be used in place of 0. 125 -in. -thick wafers while achieving similar performance. Tests performed on wafers with a rounded edge (0. 5 in. radius) in contact with the sealing surface resulted in flow rates twice as high as those for wafers with a flat edge. Half-size wafers had leakage rates approximately three times higher than those for full-size wafers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of wafer bow of Si carrier wafer to achieve high-yield BCB cap {{transfer}} in wafer-scale packaging. BCB caps are built-up on Si carrier wafer and then they are bonded and transferred to a target <b>wafer.</b> The <b>height</b> of BCB cap is 25 lm and the thickness of Si carrier wafer is 380 lm. Through several experiments, {{it is found that}} BCB cap transfer rate is mainly dependent on wafer bow of Si carrier wafer rather than that of the target wafer due to relatively large thickness of BCB caps. Therefore, Si carrier wafer bow with the BCB layers is investigated as a function of temperature. It is to figure out the effect of the wafer bow at certain temperature and applying pressure on BCB cap transfer rate. Through the study, it is found that zero wafer bow is very important for the cap transfer. Hence, aluminum metal layer is introduced to compensate the existing wafer bow of the Si carrier wafer...|$|R
40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{planarity}} increases with advanced IC technologies, nanotopography has arisen as an important concern in shallow trench isolation (STI) chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes. Previous work has shown that nanotopography, or small surface height variations on raw wafers 20 to 50 nm in amplitude extending across millimeter scale lateral distances, can result in substantial CMP-induced localized thinning of surface films such as oxides or nitrides used in STI [1]. This interaction with CMP depends both on characteristics of the <b>wafer</b> such as <b>heights</b> and spatial wavelengths of the nanotopography, and characteristics of the CMP process including the planarization length or pad stiffness. In thi...|$|R
40|$|Nanotopography is the nanometer-scale height {{variation}} {{that occurs}} over lateral millimeter length scales on unpatterned silicon <b>wafers</b> [1][2]. This <b>height</b> variation {{can result in}} excess thinning of surface films during chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of shallow trench isolation (STI) structures. The development of an accurate nanotopography CMP modeling and characterization procedure will allow for the proper diagnosis of potential problems due to wafer nanotopography in a given STI CMP process. In this work, a nanotopography modeling methodology is proposed which relates the length scale of nanotopography features to the length scale of the CMP process. A combined density/step-height polishing model indicates that when the nanotopography features occur over a range comparable to or shorter than the planarization length, appreciable thinning is predicted. A contact wear CMP model similarly shows that as the pad stiffness increases, film thinning also increases. These simulation {{results indicate that the}} effect of nanotopography on STI CMP may be a substantial concern...|$|R
40|$|Chemical-mechanical {{planarization}} (CMP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} demanding process steps in interconnect integration, because it is influenced by numerous variables. Among them is the roughness of the polishing pad. Therefore we systematically characterize the break-in process and the pad surface abrasion due to the pad-wafer contact in absence of conditioning. For this we use the pad roughness characterization methodology presented in [1] to extract important roughness parameters like the mean asperities radius of curvature and the asperity density. The subsequent comparison of the pad surface characteristics at different process stages allows the estimation of the break-in time required to achieve a steady state pad texture that enables stable removal rates from wafer to wafer. In addition, by characterizing the abrasion of the pad asperities due to their interaction with the <b>wafer,</b> the contact <b>height</b> between pad and wafer is estimated and the removal rate decay in the absence of conditioning can be modeled...|$|R
40|$|An ultra- thin Ti {{film with}} a {{thickness}} {{of less than}} 30 nm was deposited {{on the surface of}} a silicon wafer by the filtered arc deposition system. A novel technique was adopted to create a height step between the coated area and non-coated area (silicon wafer) during deposition. The surface morphology and thickness of the film was detected by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM results showed that the deposited film formed a smooth structure on the silicon <b>wafer</b> and the <b>height</b> step between the coating and silicon wafer was clear enough to give the thickness of the deposited film. The composition of the deposited film was detected by a combined use of Ellipsometry and AFM. Natural oxidisation of Ti (TiO 2) was found {{on the top of the}} Ti film after deposition, and the thickness of TiO 2 was determined by ellipsometry to be about 0. 6 nm.

30|$|Spinelli et al. [3] and Wang et al. [4] {{reported}} that dielectric nanostructures drastically decrease reflection from a Si wafer {{with the aid}} of geometrical Mie resonance. They fabricated Si nanostructure arrays on <b>wafers,</b> whose diameter, <b>height,</b> and period were comparable to those of the NC array used in this study. Hence, similar Mie resonance should {{play an important role in}} the significant antireflection effects of our NC array. The experimental reflectance was not identical to the FDTD reflectance over the entire wavelength range, similar to Spinelli et al.’s previous work [3]. The difference could be due to imperfections in the nanopatterns used in the experiments. For example, the height and diameter of the NCs could be slightly different, as shown in Figure  1 b, which results in less notable features of Mie resonance. However, the overall reflectance of the samples was comparable to the calculated data, which assumed an ideal regular NC array. Such tolerance of the periodic nanostructures is beneficial for cost-efficient fabrication of nanopatterned solar cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} silicon ingot slicing methods adopt contact {{forces in}} slicing {{that could easily}} cause higher kerf loss and a larger variation in {{the thickness of the}} sliced wafers. Wire-EDM is a potential process for slicing of silicon ingots into wafers. This work therefore demonstrates capability of wire-EDM in silicon wafer slicing through a RSM based experimentation involving use of molybdenum wires of 40 - 120 mu m in diameter. During the experiments <b>wafers</b> of various <b>height</b> ranging from 50 to 150 mm were fabricated and capability of the process was assessed in minimizing the kerf width. It was evident that the kerf width reduces from 250 mu m to 50 mu m, when sliced by a 40 mu m diameter wire, which amounts to a reduction in kerf loss by 300 %. The slicing speed on the other hand could be increased by 40 - 50 % to 2. 5 mm/min over the conventional abrasive slicing. A multi-objective optimization methodology adopted gives parametric conditions that give minimum kerf width at the highest slicing speed and the lowest surface roughness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In this paper, a 2 D {{axisymmetric}} quasic-static {{finite element}} model for chemical-mechanical polishing process (i. e., CMP for short) and quasi-Newton method were combined to develop a novel optimal model for the carrier surface morphology. Firstly, revolutions of the wafer and the pad were assumed {{to be the same}} and an axisymmetric uniformly distributed pressure form was given to establish a 2 D axisymmetric quasic-static model for CMP. Regarding the wafer-pad interface and the wafer-film interface as contact interfaces, a 2 D axisymmetric quasic-static {{finite element model}} was developed and a MARC software package was used to calculate the von Mises stress distribution of the <b>wafer</b> surface. Next, <b>height</b> of the contact interface between the carrier and the film near zone of the nonuniform von Mises stress distribution of the wafer surface was changed to be similar to square-wave series. Amplitude was considered as a design variable, and then quasi-Newton method was utilized to solve coefficients of the square-wave series under the condition of minimum nonuniformity of the wafer surface to obtain optimal square-wave morphology. Compared the simulated results under the conditions of the optimal square-wave surface and the flat surface of the carrier, it was found that nonuniformity of the wafer surface has been reduced remarkably under the optimal square-wave surface of the carrier and the improved rate reached to 89. 02 %...|$|R
40|$|Characterisation of {{defects in}} solar cell {{material}} is one step towards higher {{energy conversion efficiency}} of solar cells. The method {{used in this study}} allows detection across the wafer of defects causing radiative SRH recombination. In this experiment 30 unpassivated, full size mc-Si wafers from three different ingots are cooled to 90 K. Emissions after excitation with a 808 nm laser are detected by scanning the samples with a hyperspectral camera recording in the range 900 - 2500 nm, which includes both band-to-band photoluminescence (BB-PL) and defect related luminescence (DRL). Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) statistical analysis is used to separate the recorded emission into different signals. Even though surface recombination greatly influences the results, eight different signals were found for the most signal-rich wafers from one ingot (B 2). Although all samples from one ingot are believed to contain the same types of defects, emissions were only separated into a few signals for the most defect-rich samples. Wafers from the B 2 ingot are standard mc-Si wafers, with both grain size and number of emission signals successfully differentiated increasing with increasing height on the ingot. The wafers from the two other ingots are HPM Si wafers, and are more stable in respect to both grain size and number of signals differentiated from <b>wafers</b> from different <b>heights</b> on the ingot. Emission signals were identified as being of specific energy, but they were not always distinctively coupled with emission signals from literature. M-M...|$|R
40|$|A rapid, {{novel and}} {{convenient}} method {{was described in}} this thesis for creating nanotextured surface involving the microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis (MAHS) treatment of polymer films coated on surfaces. The procedure transforms the homogeneous polymer film into uniform islands of regularly shaped, micro- and nanometer-sized polymers. The regularly shaped polymer nanoislands were utilized as template for deposition of metal oxide by spin coating a metal oxide sol-gel precursor on the polymer nanotextured surface and generating regularly shaped, hollow metal oxide nanostructures after removal of the polymer template. The metal oxide nanostructures {{were used for the}} immobilization of proteins and antibacterial materials. The polymer nanostructure was obtained by spin coating polymer solution on clean silicon wafer followed with microwave treatment in proper condition. The polymer thin film was transferred into nanoislands on the silicon <b>wafer.</b> The diameter, <b>height</b> and density of the polymer nanoislands were controlled by varying the thickness of polymer thin film. The diameter is in the range from 26 nm to 83 nm for Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanoislands created by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis (MAHS). The transformation mechanism was studied via pursuing the transition and observing the formation process of the islands with atomic force microscope (AFM). The results illustrate the phenomenon could be partially explained by the mechanism of thin film spinodal dewetting from non-wettable substrate. However, there is some difference between the current theory and our experimental data. Reported spinodal dewetting often results thin film dewet from surfaces and form droplets randomly. While, microwave-assisted technique can induce not only thin film but also a film as thick as 3 μm to form uniform, ordered arrays in nano- or microscale. Glass nanobottles were fabricated from polymer template and used as ultrasmall containers of biomolecules on a surface of the substrate. Nanobottles of different sizes were prepared by using polymer nanoislands formed by dewetting of thin polymer films. An inorganic shell was coated on the polymer template by sol-gel process and the polymer was removed to create a well defined cavity. The bottle opening could be tailored by selective etching from 14 nm to 59 nm in size sufficient for the entry of most biomolecules of interest. Proteins including bovine serum albumin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), glucose oxidase (GOD) were immobilized in desired glass nanobottles by simple encapsulation technology. Both HRP and GOD maintain high activity and good reproducibility in the nanobottles. Porous TiO 2 in nanoscale was produced by using polymer nanoislands as template. The TiO 2 nanoarchitectures were produced by spin coating TiO 2 sol on the template followed by treatment with oxygen plasma, ozone or calcination to remove the polymer template. TiO 2 nanobottles formed after removal of the polymer template by calcination at 450 ℃ exhibit higher disinfection effect than plain titania films owing to the larger surface area...|$|R
