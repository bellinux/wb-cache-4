5|$|After {{fifteen years}} of off-again, on-again, conversations, The Koch Administration and the then-named NY Zoological Society (now Wildlife Conservation Society), signed a fifty-year {{agreement}} in April 1980, where the Central, Prospect, and Queens zoos would be administered by the Society. Specific plans for Prospect Park Zoo <b>were</b> <b>another</b> seven years in the making. By late summer 1987, an $18 million, {{two and a half}} year renovation plan was put forth to renovate Prospect Park Zoo and coordinate its venue with other facilities to avoid redundant programming.|$|E
5|$|Covert operations, however, <b>were</b> <b>another</b> matter. One {{result of}} the {{increasing}} PAVN road building effort in Cambodia was that the U.S. also upped the ante against the trail system in Laos by launching the first B-52 Stratofortress strike against the logistical system on 12 December 1965. In April 1967 the U.S. headquarters in Saigon finally received authorization to launch Daniel Boone, an intelligence gathering operation that conducted by the highly secret Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group or SOG.|$|E

To their north <b>were</b> <b>another</b> three machine-guns and a concrete pillbox. An anti-aircraft tower equipped with machine-guns stood to the south. At the River Orne bridge, the eastern bank south of the bridge had a pillbox with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. To the north of the bridge were two machine-guns. Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks.|$|E
5|$|During its service, 334 {{men of the}} {{regiment}} died from all causes, either killed in action, died of wounds or disease, and two were lost at sea. Almost two thirds of those, 202 men, were killed during the seven months they fought in the Gallipoli Campaign, while 130 died during the {{two years of the}} Sinai and Palestine Campaign. There were also 555 men wounded; 53 of those were unfortunate enough to have been wounded twice. The Gallipoli Campaign accounted for over half {{of the total number of}} wounded at 316 men; 22 of them were wounded twice. Then in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, there <b>were</b> <b>another</b> 239 men wounded, with 31 of those again wounded twice.|$|E
5|$|In a 1970 paper, Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani {{presented}} the so-called GIM mechanism {{to explain the}} experimental non-observation of flavor-changing neutral currents. This theoretical model required {{the existence of the}} as-yet undiscovered charm quark. The number of supposed quark flavors grew to the current six in 1973, when Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa noted that the experimental observation of CP violation could be explained if there <b>were</b> <b>another</b> pair of quarks.|$|E

Jordan has stated this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player. The White Sox <b>were</b> <b>another</b> team owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar <b>were</b> <b>another</b> favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry Division's three {{infantry}} regiments, {{which had}} a wartime strength of 3,000 each, were already below strength on their deployment, and heavy losses in the preceding two weeks had reduced their numbers further. The 21st Infantry had 1,100 men left, having suffered 1,433 casualties. The 34th Infantry had only 2,020 and the 19th had 2,276 men. There <b>were</b> <b>another</b> 2,007 men in the 24th Infantry Division artillery formations. Thus the division's total strength was 11,400. This was severely reduced from the 15,965 men and 4,773 vehicles that had arrived in Korea {{at the beginning of}} the month.|$|E

5|$|The Protestants <b>were</b> <b>another</b> {{group that}} began {{settling}} in Brazil {{at the beginning}} of the 19th century. The first Protestants were English, and an Anglican church was opened in Rio de Janeiro in 1820. Others were established afterwards in São Paulo, Pernambuco and Bahia provinces. They were followed by German and Swiss Lutherans who settled in the South and Southwest regions and built their own houses of worship. Following the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s, immigrants from the southern United States seeking to escape Reconstruction settled in São Paulo. Several American churches sponsored missionary activities, including Baptists, Lutherans, Congregationalists and Methodists.|$|E

Outside of Antananarivo, the Zana-tompo lived {{in the village of}} Ambohimalaza.|$|E
5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns <b>were</b> <b>another</b> endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{business}} routes of US Highway 10 {{in the state}} of Michigan. They serve as connections from the main highway into Reed City, Clare and Midland. Additionally, there <b>were</b> <b>another</b> two business routes that connected US Highway 10 (US10) to the downtowns of Flint and Pontiac. All of these business routes are, or were, former sections of US10 that were marked Business US Highway10 (Bus. US10) after the main highway was realigned to bypass the downtowns of the cities.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and <b>were</b> <b>another</b> form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there <b>were</b> <b>another</b> 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E

5|$|For {{symbolic}} memorials, numerous {{designs were}} possible, from simple monuments through to {{much more complex}} pieces of sculpture. Obelisks had been a popular memorial form in the 19th century and remained so in the inter-war years, including in Britain, France, Australia and Romania. One factor in this popularity was that obelisks were relatively cheap to build, while they also fitted well with the existing civic architecture in many towns. Memorial plaques <b>were</b> <b>another</b> popular memorial style around the world. Soldiers, either individually or in groups, were a popular sculptural feature in most countries, portrayed in various stances; typically these were allegorical, although in France {{the style of the}} soldier could also carry political meaning and reflect local political sympathies. Although the trend pre-dated the First World War, very few Western war memorials portrayed heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century; if soldiers were depicted, they were invariably ordinary soldiers, usually infantrymen. After the unveiling of the Cenotaph in London, it became a popular design in many other locations in Britain and Australia too.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century the {{territory}} that now makes up Guatemala {{was divided into}} various competing polities, each locked in continual struggle with its neighbours. The most important were the K'iche', the Kaqchikel, the Tz'utujil, the Chajoma, the Mam, the Poqomam and the Pipil. All were Maya groups except for the Pipil, who were a Nahua group related to the Aztecs; the Pipil {{had a number of}} small city-states along the Pacific coastal plain of southern Guatemala and El Salvador. The Pipil of Guatemala had their capital at Itzcuintepec. The Xinca <b>were</b> <b>another</b> non-Maya group occupying the southeastern Pacific coastal area. The Maya had never been unified as a single empire, {{but by the time the}} Spanish arrived Maya civilization was thousands of years old and had already seen the rise and fall of great cities.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{settlement}} {{was taking place}} in Poland since very early times. In 1264, Duke Bolesław the Pious of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the Statute of Kalisz, which specified {{a broad range of}} freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion. The act exempted the Jews from enslavement or serfdom and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements. Following a series of expulsions of Jews from Western Europe, Jewish communities were established in Kraków, Kalisz and elsewhere in western and southern Poland in the 13th century. Another series of communities were established at Lviv, Brest-Litovsk and Grodno further east in the 14th century. King Casimir received Jewish refugees from Germany in 1349, which assisted the acceleration of a Jewish expansion in Poland that was to continue until World War II. German urban and rural settlements <b>were</b> <b>another</b> long-lasting ethnic feature.|$|E
