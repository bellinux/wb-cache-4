[...] ("Look how the academy returns the pretty ones <b>we</b> <b>send</b> them!") Balzac himself attributed his condition to [...] "intellectual congestion", but his extended confinement in the [...] "alcove" [...] was surely a factor.

2500|$|Reception for Sagan's {{work was}} {{generally}} positive. In The New York Times Book Review, novelist James Michener praised Cosmos as [...] "a cleverly written, imaginatively illustrated summary of ... ruminations about our universe... His style is iridescent, with lights flashing upon unexpected juxtapositions of thought." [...] David Whitehouse of the British Broadcasting Corporation {{went so far}} as to say that [...] "there is not a book on astronomy [...] in fact not one on science [...] that comes close to the eloquence and intellectual sweep of Cosmos...

2500|$|In his Jewish Daily Forward essay, [...] "Breaking the Mold of the Sitcom," [...] Heinze {{analyzes}} {{his favorite}} TV comedy, Seinfeld, casting an affectionate {{eye on the}} show's creators, Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, and marveling at their success in probing [...] "the many gestures, innuendoes and gaps in the messages <b>we</b> <b>send</b> each other every day in every type of situation. Those, they know, contain the real meanings that pass back and forth {{beneath the surface of}} our conventions. Those are the explosives littering the minefield that is life in society." [...] Heinze is stunned that the show is able to pack so much original comedy into twenty-two minutes of airtime, and he has little sympathy for people who dismiss the show as being shallow or neurotically self-focused: [...] "People with little sense of humor have failed, time and again, to understand that the notorious self-centeredness of the show’s characters enables us to laugh at the selfish, neurotic traits we all share but prefer to disguise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ma Chao {{retreated to}} Hanzhong Commandery, where he {{borrowed}} {{troops from the}} warlord Zhang Lu and returned to attack Jiang Xu and his allies at Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). Jiang Xu sent a messenger to Chang'an to request for reinforcements. Xiahou Yuan and the officers in Chang'an held a meeting on whether to help Jiang Xu and his allies or not. Many of the officers thought that they should wait for orders from Cao Cao before making any move. However, Xiahou Yuan had a different opinion and he said, [...] "Our lord is 4,000 li away in Ye. By the time he receives our report, Jiang Xu and his allies are done for. Therefore, {{it is imperative that}} <b>we</b> <b>send</b> reinforcements to them immediately." [...] He appointed Zhang He to lead 5,000 infantry and cavalry as the vanguard and head towards Mount Qi via a narrow pass at Chencang (陳倉; present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi), while he supervised the supply train and followed behind with another army. When Zhang He's 5,000 strong army reached the Wei River, Ma Chao initially sent a few thousand Di and Qiang horsemen to resist the enemy, but later called for a retreat before both sides could engage in battle. Zhang He advanced further and seized the military equipment left behind by Ma Chao's forces. When Xiahou Yuan's army arrived, most the counties in Liang Province had been pacified.|$|E
