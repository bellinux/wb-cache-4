5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{study of the}} use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie in the UK in their 1959 book, The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren, which mapped the use of truce terms across England, Wales and Scotland. The Opies considered it the most important <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> schoolchild's vocabulary and one for {{which there was no}} adult equivalent. There has been little recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms, including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s, are still in general use. Studies conducted since the 1970s in English speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States with a number of terms deriving from older terms used in the UK, but many not.|$|E

These concepts have been found useful in automatic speech recognition systems for speaker adaptation.|$|E

25|$|Romanization {{includes}} any {{use of the}} Latin alphabet {{to transliterate}} Hebrew words. Usually it is to identify a Hebrew <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-Hebrew language that uses the Latin alphabet, such as German, Spanish, Turkish, and so on. Transliteration uses an alphabet to represent the letters and sounds of a word spelled in another alphabet, whereas transcription uses an alphabet to represent the sounds only. Romanization can do both.|$|E

25|$|Acute accents {{may be used}} to emphasise a <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> phrase, on the vowel in the {{stressed}} syllable. If the vowel {{is written}} as a digraph, an acute accent is put on both parts of the digraph. Although that rule includes ij, the acute accent on the j is frequently omitted (resulting in íj instead of íj́), as putting an acute accent on a j is problematic in most word processing software. If the vowel is written as more than two letters, the accent is put on the first two vowel letters.|$|E
25|$|Perceptual priming {{is based}} on the form of the {{stimulus}} and is enhanced by the match between the early and later stimuli. Perceptual priming is sensitive to the modality and exact format of the stimulus. An example of perceptual priming is the identification of an incomplete <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> word-stem completion test. The presentation of the visual prime {{does not have to be}} perfectly consistent with later testing presentations in order to work. Studies have shown that, for example, the absolute size of the stimuli can vary and still provide significant evidence of priming.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to realize that the word problem is in fact solvable for many groups G. For example, polycyclic groups have solvable word problems since the normal form of an arbitrary <b>word</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> polycyclic presentation is readily computable; other algorithms for groups may, in suitable circumstances, also solve the word problem, see the Todd–Coxeter algorithm and the Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm. On the other hand the fact that a particular algorithm does not solve the word problem for a particular group does not show that the group has an unsolvable word problem. For instance Dehn's algorithm does not solve the word problem for the fundamental group of the torus. However this group is the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups and so has a solvable word problem.|$|E
