25|$|Surface living {{animals such as}} the <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> {{typically}} have hydrophobic feet covered in small hairs that prevent the feet from breaking the surface and becoming wet. Another insect known {{to walk on the}} water surface is the ant species Polyrhachis sokolova. The pygmy gecko (Coleodactylus amazonicus), due to its small size and hydrophobic skin is also able to walk on the water surface.|$|E
25|$|Males {{may also}} use more {{indirect}} techniques {{to mate with}} females, such as intimidation. While most female water striders (Gerridae) have their genitalia exposed, females of the <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> species Gerris gracilicornis have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they tap on the water’s surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, {{it is in the}} best interest of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.|$|E
500|$|A {{dilution}} {{effect is}} seen when animals {{living in a}} group [...] "dilute" [...] their risk of attack, each individual being {{just one of many}} in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> decreases as group size increases.|$|E
50|$|Veliidae is {{a family}} of predatory insects in the {{suborder}} Heteroptera. They {{are commonly known as}} riffle bugs, smaller <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> or broad-shouldered <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> because the segment immediately behind the head is wider {{than the rest of the}} abdomen, unlike in the typical <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> (Gerridae), close relatives which are also in superfamily Gerroidea. Unlike some Gerridae, riffle bugs are small, typically about 4.5 mm in length.|$|R
50|$|Sudden {{increases}} in salt {{concentration in the}} water of gerrid habitats can trigger migration of <b>water</b> <b>striders.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>striders</b> will move to areas of lower salt concentration, resulting in the mix of genes within brackish and freshwater bodies. Nymphal density also affects the dispersal of <b>water</b> <b>striders.</b> The higher density of <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> in the nymphal stage results in {{a higher percentage of}} brachypterous adults developing flight muscles. These flight muscles allow for the <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> to fly to neighboring bodies of water and mate, resulting in the spread of genes. This spread and mixing of genes can be beneficial due to a heterozygotic advantage. Generally, <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> will try to disperse in such a way to lower the density of gerrids in one area or pool of water. Most do this by flight, but those that lack wings or wing muscles will rely on the current of their water body or flooding. Eggs in Halobates are often laid on floating ocean debris and thus spread across the ocean by this drifting matter.|$|R
50|$|Tenagogonus is a genus of <b>Water</b> <b>Striders.</b>|$|R
2500|$|While larger {{animals such as}} ducks {{can move}} on water by floating, some small animals move across it without {{breaking}} through the surface. This surface locomotion {{takes advantage of the}} surface tension of water. Animals that move in such a way include the <b>water</b> <b>strider.</b> Water striders have legs that are hydrophobic, preventing them from interfering with the structure of water. [...] Another form of locomotion (in which the surface layer is broken) is used by the basilisk lizard.|$|E
50|$|Gerris lacustris, {{commonly}} known as the common pond skater or common <b>water</b> <b>strider,</b> is a species of <b>water</b> <b>strider,</b> found across Europe.|$|E
50|$|Gerridae species {{use this}} surface tension to their {{advantage}} through their highly adapted legs and distributed weight. The legs of a <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> are long and slender, allowing {{the weight of the}} <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> body to be distributed over a large surface area. The legs are strong, but have flexibility that allows the water striders to keep their weight evenly distributed and flow with the water movement. Hydrofuge hairs line the body surface of the <b>water</b> <b>strider.</b> There are several thousand hairs per square millimeter, providing the <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> with a hydrofuge body that prevents wetting from waves, rain, or spray, which could inhibit their ability to keep their entire body above the water surface if the water stuck and weighed down the body. This position of keeping the majority of the body above the water surface is called an epipleustonic position, which is a defining characteristic of water striders. If the body of the <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> were to accidentally become submerged, for instance by a large wave, the tiny hairs would trap air. Tiny air bubbles throughout the body act as buoyancy to bring the <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> to the surface again, while also providing air bubbles to breathe from underwater.|$|E
50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>striders</b> {{are able}} to walk on top of water due to a {{combination}} of several factors. <b>Water</b> <b>striders</b> use the high surface tension of water and long, hydrophobic legs to help them stay above water. Water molecules are polar and this causes them to attract to each other.|$|R
50|$|The Gerridae are {{a family}} of insects in the order Hemiptera, {{commonly}} known as <b>water</b> <b>striders,</b> <b>water</b> bugs, pond skaters, water skippers, or jesus bugs. Consistent with the classification of the Gerridae as true bugs (i.e., suborder Heteroptera), gerrids have mouthparts evolved for piercing and sucking, and distinguish themselves by having the unique ability to walk on water. Gerridae, or <b>water</b> <b>striders,</b> are anatomically built to transfer their weight {{to be able to}} run on top of the water's surface. As a result, one could likely find <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> present in any pond, river, or lake. Scientists have identified over 1,700 species of gerrids, 10% of them being marine.|$|R

50|$|Gerridae {{generally}} inhabit {{surfaces of}} calm waters. The majority of <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> inhabit freshwater areas, {{with the exception}} of Halobates. Gerridae prefer an environment abundant with insects or zooplankton and one that contains several rocks or plants to oviposit eggs on. It has been studied by prevalence of <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> in varying environments, that <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> most prefer <b>waters</b> around 25 degrees Celsius. Any water temperature lower than 22 degrees Celsius is unfavorable. This is likely {{due to the fact that}} development rates of young are temperature dependent 5. The cooler the surrounding waters, the slower the development of the young is. Prominent genera Gerridae are present in Wales, the former U.S.S.R., Canada, U.S., South Africa, South America, Australia, China and Malaysia 5. None have been yet identified in New Zealand waters.|$|R
40|$|How novel genetic {{interactions}} evolve, {{under what}} selective pressures, {{and how they}} shape adaptive traits is often unknown. Here we uncover behavioural and developmental genetic mechanisms that enable <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> to survive attacks by bottom-striking predators. Long midlegs, critical for antipredator strategy, are shaped through a lineage-specific interaction between the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and a new target gene called gilt. The differences in leg morphologies are established through modulation of gilt differential expression between mid and hindlegs under Ubx control. Furthermore, short-legged <b>water</b> <b>striders,</b> generated through gilt RNAi knockdown, exhibit reduced performance in predation tests. Therefore, {{the evolution of the}} new Ubx–gilt interaction contributes to shaping the legs that enable <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> to dodge predator strikes. These data show how divergent selection, associated with novel prey–predator interactions, can favour the evolution of new genetic interactions and drive adaptive evolution...|$|R
5000|$|A {{well known}} {{work in the}} area of surface tension aided {{flotation}} was the analysis of <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> locomotion along the surface of water. [...] Using the idea of flexible structures, Ji et al. re-examined this problem by considering the compliance of a <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> leg. By modeling the leg as a compliant structure that deforms at the water surface (rather than pierce it), Ji was able to ascertain what added benefit this flexibility has in supporting the insect. Other studies on the <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> have examined the ways in which flexibility can affect wetting properties of the leg.|$|E

50|$|The thorax {{of water}} striders is {{generally}} long, narrow, and small in size. It generally ranges from 1.6 mm to 36 mm long across the species, with some bodies more cylindrical or rounder than others. The pronotum, or outer {{layer of the}} thorax, of the <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> can be either shiny or dull depending on the species, and covered with microhairs to help repel water. The abdomen of a <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> can have several segments and contains both the metasternum and omphalium.|$|E
50|$|Working with {{graduate}} student Yun Seong Song, Sitti also designed a tiny robot that, mimicking a <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> insect, can {{walk on the}} surface tension of water.|$|E
50|$|During forced copulation, male water striders (genus Gerris) attack females. As a result, a {{struggle}} occurs because the female is resistant. When the male <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> is successfully {{attached to the}} female, the female carries the male during and after copulation. This can be energetically costly to the female because she has to support the heavy weight of the male {{at the same time}} as she is gliding on the water surface. The speed of the female is usually reduced by 20% when the male is attached. The purpose of long copulation is for the male to achieve paternity assurance in order to restrict the female from other males. Long periods of copulation can strongly affect females because females will depart from the water surface after mating and discontinue foraging. The duration of copulation can be extremely long. For <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> Aquarius najas it was a total of 3 months. For <b>water</b> <b>strider</b> Gerris lateralis the time ranged from 4 to 7 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> exhibit forced {{copulation}} on {{the female}}. As a result, the female will {{struggle with the}} male to reduce the detrimental effects. Female struggle is a by-product of female resistance.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> have wings {{present on}} the dorsal side of their thorax, while other species of Gerridae do not- {{particularly}} Halobates. <b>Water</b> <b>striders</b> experience wing length polymorphism that has affected their flight ability and evolved in a phylogenetic manner where populations are either long-winged, wing-dimorphic, or short-winged. Wing dimorphism consists of summer gerrid populations evolving different length wings than winter populations within the same species. Habitats with rougher waters are likely to hold gerrids with shorter wings, while habitats with calm waters are likely to hold long-winged gerrids. This is due to potential for damage of the wings and ability for dispersal.|$|R

40|$|While <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> (Hemiptera: Gerridae) have {{a global}} {{distribution}} different species {{have adapted to}} very different habitat types. Freshwater <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> such as Limnogonus luctuosus live in areas along streams and rivers with little to no flow. Marine <b>water</b> <b>striders,</b> such as coastal species Halobates hawaiiensis, have adapted to life {{on the surface of}} the ocean. Since these types of <b>water</b> <b>striders</b> live in such different habitats, and face different environmental factors their food preference and behavior can be quite different. In this study, average density of L. luctuosus individuals was measured along the Opunohu River. Also, food preference, behavior, and the effects of increased density were tested in the laboratory for both L. luctuosus and H. hawaiiensis. Response time and frequency of approach to mobile and immobile prey items were recorded for H. hawaiiensis and L. luctuosus. H. hawaiiensis preferred immobile prey while L. luctuosus preferred mobile prey. Frequency of several behaviors (i. e. movements, moving away from others, approached by others, approaching others, attacking, being attacked, jumping, and cleaning) were compared between species, and within species at increasing densities. There were differences between species in the frequency of movements, approaching others, being approached, jumping, and cleaning. Density affected movements, moving away from others, jumping, and cleaning for H. hawaiiensis. Density affected movements, moving away from others, and cleaning behaviors for L. luctuosus. The different ecology of these two species can be used to explain why differences exist in both food preference and frequencyof behaviors...|$|R
