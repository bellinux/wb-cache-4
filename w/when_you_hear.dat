25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E

I knew that record was gonna go just because you never heard Mariah talk about this stuff. ... She's like, 'I packed up my Louis Vuitton.' She took it really on the ghetto side. I knew that was gonna strike people. Either it was gonna hit them in a wrong way or they was gonna love it.|$|E

It was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on April 26, 2003 under the title of [...] "Everytime I Try" [...] and SRU000530591 registration number with a given recording year of 2002. Spears named it the most personal song of the album along with [...] "Touch of My Hand", explaining, [...] "It's one of the songs that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear,</b> it's like the kind of song when you go to heaven. It kind of takes you away. You know, it takes you in to a very cool consciousness I think." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{based on}} a New Orleans funk sample, the song belies a strong go-go influence. [...] Harrison likened the two based on their heavy use of {{percussion}} and chant. Amerie stated, [...] "You don't hear go-go outside of D.C. ... I was like, 'We {{have to do it}} in an up-tempo way because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> it on the radio in D.C., it's fast.' ... So it's a fresh sound for everybody but people in the D.C./Maryland/Virginia area. They [...] know what it is." [...] The song is composed in the key of D # minor, moving at a tempo of 100 beats per minute in common time. [...] It uses four-measure phrases with a VIb-I-VIIb-VIb-IV chord progression. [...] The first four chords are played on the measure's downbeat, and off-beat syncopation is used for the fifth chord.|$|E
500|$|Tim Ashley {{wrote in}} The Guardian in 2009 that Khachaturian's {{popularity}} {{fell in the}} West, because of his image as one of Soviet music's [...] "". He argued, [...] "Such a view is simplistic, given {{that he had a}} major brush with the authorities in 1948. But it's also easy to see how he acquired his awkward reputation <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> his Violin Concerto, dating from 1940. It's an immensely attractive work, full of his trademark Armenian folk flourishes, and the swaying, hypnotic Andante is notably beautiful. But the unforced optimism of the outer movements now seems unthinking when we realise it was composed at a time when Stalin was giving Prokofiev and Shostakovich hell." [...] In 2003 conductor Marin Alsop opined that Khachaturian is [...] "very underperformed" [...] and [...] "somewhat underrated". She commented further: [...] "His music, of course, has {{a little bit of the}} edginess of the 20th-century sound, the dissonances coming in. But at the same time it marries this beautiful neo-romanticism and lush orchestration and the over-the-top approach, so I think, he can be quite relevant these days." ...|$|E

500|$|Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{commented that}} the [...] "menacing rhythm and chanted vocals" [...] on [...] "Diva", mark the album's biggest departure. Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times felt that the song was {{influenced}} by Beyoncé's husband, American rapper Jay-Z as it has a [...] "bad soft-core gangster rap". He also noted that its contains words that could get an [...] "explicit" [...] sticker by the chain stores. Similarly, Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix remarked that the song is [...] "particularly intriguing" [...] as it progresses through [...] "hard-knockish robbery scenarios" [...] which does not resemble Beyoncé's clean public image. Stacey Anderson of Spin magazine noted that [...] "Diva" [...] places a [...] "startling, sexy snarl over window-rattling bass". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted Beyoncé turns out [...] "modal-sounding hooks" [...] over 808 bass on the song. The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond described Sasha Fierce as [...] "suffer no such identity crisis, brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty...", reflected on [...] "Diva". James Reed of The Boston Globe described [...] "Diva" [...] as a [...] "glitchy, bass-heavy thumper with the most ridiculous chorus of the year". Reed nevertheless added that the song is [...] "insanely catchy, but then, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> something looped incessantly, no matter how mindless, it's bound to stick".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well {{received}} by former King Crimson member Greg Lake, the original lead vocalist and bassist on [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man." [...] When {{asked for his}} own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy, Lake gave a positive response. He stated, [...] "What I was pleased with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. I mean, that record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me. I think <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> Kanye West do it, or include {{it in his own}} song, it's relevant. He's speaking about that crazy world that we live in. It's as true now as it was then. It's an honor when something like that happens." [...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour. Lake went into detail regarding a typical performance of [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] at his concerts: ...|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
