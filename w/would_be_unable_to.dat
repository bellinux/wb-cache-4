5|$|On 30 June 2009 Eurostar raised {{concerns}} at the UK House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee {{that it was}} illegal under French law for the collection of information desired by the UK government under the e-Borders scheme, and they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> cooperate.|$|E

Activision issued a patch to correct this {{a few days after}} release.|$|E
5|$|Mehserle's {{trial was}} {{subsequently}} moved to Los Angeles following concerns that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> {{get a fair}} trial in Alameda County. On July 8, 2010, Mehserle was found guilty on a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. He was released on June 13, 2011 and is now on parole.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie Rocket is an {{unfinished}} film project written by David Lynch, who also intended to direct it. Begun after {{the success of}} Lynch's 1977 film Eraserhead, Ronnie Rocket was shelved after Lynch felt he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> find financial backing for the project. He instead sought out an existing script {{on which to base}} his next film, settling on what would become 1980's The Elephant Man.|$|E

5|$|The club {{lost their}} talismanic Turk Muzzy Izzet {{in the summer}} of 2004. Adams had {{previously}} stated his concern that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> regain their top tier status before he resigned as Leicester manager in October 2004, after a poor start to the Championship campaign dashed the club's hopes of an instant return to the Premiership.|$|E
5|$|The {{schedule}} for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period {{as they had been}} awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|E
5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O. Hall, who resigned for health reasons. Allen's appointment was controversial {{due to his}} strong ties to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and because of concerns that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> attend functions on Saturdays due to his faith's strict observation of the sabbath. Allen resigned from his leadership of the West Indies Union prior to becoming governor-general, however.|$|E

5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than at {{the other}} gates, so that Khalid <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E
5|$|Between the 30th and the 1st, The Sun {{reported}} that the remaining strikers had declared they would not interfere, but were confident the company <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> find sufficient workers without them, and that by remaining united, they could yet see their terms met. Given notice to report to work on Monday, July 30 or be discharged from the company, most chose discharge, but the company had little trouble in acquiring the workers needed to run the trains.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, {{but she was}} too busy. In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again been asked to return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were not good enough for Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the last}} Sergeant Flannagan had seen either of Billy Byrne or his companion. The trail had ceased at the open window of the washroom {{at the rear of}} the restaurant, and search as he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> had <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> pick it up again.|$|R

5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|The massive thrust {{through the}} Allied centre was {{conducted}} by 16,000 troops of Soult's IV Corps. IV Corps' position was cloaked by dense mist during the early stage of the battle; in fact how long the mist lasted was vital to Napoleon's plan: Soult's troops would become uncovered if the mist dissipated too soon, but if it lingered too long, Napoleon <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> determine when the Allied troops had evacuated Pratzen Heights, preventing him from timing his attack properly.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} {{launched}} on 7 July 1810 as two combined forces of British sailors, soldiers, sepoys and Royal Marines landed at separate beaches. Although {{a number of}} men were drowned in the heavy surf, {{the majority of the}} invasion force reached the beaches safely and marched inland, attacking French outposts as they approached the capital. Recognising that his demoralised garrison <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> defend Saint Denis and that the militia would take too long to mobilise, the French commander Colonel Chrysostôme de Sainte-Suzanne surrendered the island, its garrison and its stores to Rowley.|$|E
2500|$|The NTSB {{found that}} the flight crew <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> {{perceive}} any problem with the airplane until the propeller blade angle was between 24 and 26 degrees. They stated that the airplane would have [...] "become very difficult to control after the propeller reached the 22-degree stop. Therefore, it is most likely that the pilots of flight 2311 did not notice {{a problem with the}} airplane until the propeller began to overspeed and roll control was affected." [...] Thus, the flight crew <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> declare an emergency as the event was so sudden.|$|R
50|$|Hodja {{was called}} up to {{participate}} in the international tournament in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on 12-18 November 2014 he <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> join the U-21 national team due to an injury.|$|R

5|$|There was {{considerable}} local {{opposition to the}} Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing {{the size of the}} park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.|$|E
5|$|While at the Museum, Stearn became {{increasingly}} {{involved in the}} work of the Linnean Society during his Kensington years. He was also offered the George A. Miller professorship of botany at the University of Illinois (1966), but felt he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> leave his commitments in London. At the time of his retirement in 1976, he was still using a fountain pen as his only means of communication and scholarship, a fact commemorated by his retirement present of a Mont Blanc pen capable of writing for long periods without refills.|$|E
5|$|Although the Wehrmacht's {{offensive}} {{had been}} stopped, German intelligence estimated that Soviet forces {{had no more}} reserves left and thus <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East. The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December, when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. Even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men, only slightly outnumbering the Wehrmacht. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.|$|E
