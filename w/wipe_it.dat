25|$|When {{hostilities}} commenced {{between the}} Austrian Empire and Imperial France, Johann von Hiller led an Austrian army {{to attack the}} Illyrian Provinces. The Austrians made rapid gains in the south, but in Carinthia, Hiller's first bridgehead across the Drava River at Villach was eliminated by the Franco-Italian army of Eugène de Beauharnais, the viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy. When the Austrian general established a second bridgehead at Feistritz, Eugène sent Grenier to <b>wipe</b> <b>it</b> out. The minor victory only delayed the inevitable, {{and within a few}} weeks Eugène was compelled to abandon Illyria and fall back to the borders of the Kingdom of Italy.|$|E
500|$|Hutchinson {{claimed that}} she was a prophetess, {{receiving}} direct revelation from God. In this capacity, she prophesied during her trial that God would send judgment upon the Massachusetts Bay Colony and would <b>wipe</b> <b>it</b> from existence. She further taught her followers that personal revelation from God was as authoritative in a person's life as the Bible, a teaching that was strongly antithetical to Puritan theology. She also claimed that she could identify [...] "the elect" [...] among the colonists. [...] These positions ultimately caused John Cotton, John Winthrop, and other former friends to view her as an antinomian heretic.|$|E

[...] Jackson said that any Vaseline transferred from residue on Nurse's fingers was accidental and wiped off when pointed out. [...] Georges St-Pierre spoke to Sports Illustrated with regard to the controversy stating, [...] "I haven't seen the fight yet, but I remember at some point something happened and the athletic commission was complaining.

[...] However, St-Pierre offered Penn a rematch in the summer that Penn verbally accepted but is unlikely to happen due to the fact they have both since been scheduled for title defenses.|$|E
500|$|Davey {{performed}} a nationwide tour in late May 2007, debuting songs from her follow-up album which she initially {{referred to as}} Silversleeve. All {{but two of the}} songs were recorded in her home. The album, released under the title Tales of Silversleeve and produced by Liam Howe of Sneaker Pimps, was preceded by [...] "Reuben", its first single, on 21 September 2007. Davey explained the title choice, [...] "I had a runny nose when I was a child and let's just say I didn't <b>wipe</b> <b>it</b> with a tissue". This proved to be a successful move as it led to a Choice Music Prize nomination for 2007 Irish Album of the Year. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "even more imaginative" [...] than her debut and gave it four out of five stars. entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy described the record as [...] "Without doubt, one of the best albums of the year", noting [...] "there's a magic about Tales of Silversleeve that makes it an album you're almost afraid to listen to twice, in case it's not as good as you remember the first time". The Irish Independent's reviewer gave the album five stars, describing it as [...] "a record that she can be proud of". Jim Carroll, The Irish Times rock critic, called it [...] "The most charming pop album you'll hear in Zero Seven".|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Ahmadinejad, in [...] {{a speech}} praising the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, was {{translated}} by Iranian state-run media {{as saying that}} [...] "Israel must be wiped off the map." [...] A controversy erupted over the translation, with specialists such as Juan Cole of the University of Michigan and [...] Arash Norouzi of the Mossadegh Project {{pointing out that the}} original statement in Farsi did not say that Israel should be wiped off the map, but instead that it would collapse. The words [...] ‘Israel’, ‘map’, and ‘to wipe off’ [...] are non-existent in the Iranian speech's original. According to another IRNA translation, on the occasion of a commemoration of the anniversary of Khomeini's death on 3 June 2008, Ahmadinejad stated that [...] "The corrupt element will be wiped off the map." [...] Contextually, Ahmadinejad was quoting Khomeini's words about the imminent disappearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. In Katajun Amirpur's analysis, there is no implication in the text that Iran intended destroying Israel or annihilating the Jewish people, any more than Khomeini was suggesting with his words that the Russians, or the Iranian people themselves under the Shah would be extinguished. Ahmadinejad is on the record as stating that Iran had no plans to attack Israel. The statement itself was in fact a citation, with a minute verbal variation, of a remark made by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, which had created no furor at the time, but did so when Ahmadinejad quoted them in 2005. Dan Meridor, Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy said during an Al Jazeera interview that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had repeatedly said [...] "that Israel is an unnatural creature, it will not survive. They didn’t say, ‘We’ll <b>wipe</b> <b>it</b> out,’ you’re right, but, ‘It will not survive.’" [...] adding [...] "If Iran says this, and continues to pile up uranium that they enrich, and build missiles in big numbers, and have a nuclear military plan -- if you put all this together, you can't say, they don't really mean it." [...] The Washington Post's fact-checker editor Glenn Kessler says the interpretation gets murkier when Ahmadinejad's quote is set against other Iranian propaganda. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cites proof that the Iranian government releases propaganda that clearly says Israel should be [...] "wiped off." [...] Joshua Teitelbaum of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs discovered pictures of Iranian propaganda banners that clearly say in English: [...] "Israel should be wiped out of the face of the world." [...] In March 2016, Iran tested a ballistic missile painted with the phrase [...] "Israel should be wiped off the Earth" [...] in Hebrew. The missile is reported to be capable of reaching Israel.|$|E
