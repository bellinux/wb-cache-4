5|$|Cave 25 {{is longer}} than cave 24 with several small and big rooms. These rooms also have seating {{arrangements}} in niches which display irregular excavations denoting poor condition of the rock, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> stopped further work on this cave.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E

5|$|There are no dates {{available}} for post-caldera lava domes, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> arose from magma ascending through the caldera forming conduits, seeing as these domes are found only inside the caldera. The elevated temperatures of the caldera lake suggest that hydrothermal activity still occurs beneath Incapillo.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{was born}} on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> {{corresponds}} to 20July 356 BC, although the exact date is disputed, in Pella, {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of Macedon. He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Uranus {{is known}} to have 13 inner moons. Their orbits lie inside that of Miranda. All inner moons are intimately {{connected}} to the rings of Uranus, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> resulted from the fragmentation of one or several small inner moons. The two innermost moons (Cordelia and Ophelia) are as shepherds of Uranus's ε ring, whereas the small moon Mab is a source of Uranus's outermost μ ring. There may be two additional small (2–7km in radius) undiscovered shepherd moons located about 100km exterior to Uranus' α and β rings.|$|E

5|$|By about 5500BC, small tribes {{living in}} the Nile valley had {{developed}} {{into a series of}} cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badari, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, stone tools, and its use of copper.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the US 2nd Infantry Division {{suffered}} 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 {{captured and}} 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter. This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but {{able to prevent}} the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, most of <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> occurred at Yongsan.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} their {{distance}} from the planet, the irregular moons are Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso, a group that includes both prograde and retrograde objects. The five outermost moons {{are similar to the}} irregular moons of other giant planets, and are thought to have been gravitationally captured by Neptune, unlike the regular satellites, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> formed in situ.|$|E

5|$|Mimas is the {{smallest}} and least massive of the inner round moons, although its mass is sufficient to alter the orbit of Methone. It is noticeably ovoid-shaped, having been made shorter at the poles and longer at the equator (by about 20km) by the effects of Saturn's gravity. Mimas has a large impact crater one-third its diameter, Herschel, situated on its leading hemisphere. Mimas has no known past or present geologic activity, and its surface is dominated by impact craters. The only tectonic features known are a few arcuate and linear troughs, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> formed when Mimas was shattered by the Herschel impact.|$|E
5|$|One species, {{the cattle}} egret, was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century this bird colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The cattle egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is the glossy ibis, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> had a similar history.|$|E
5|$|Several of Josquin's masses {{feature the}} {{paraphrase}} technique, and they {{include some of}} his most famous work including the great Missa Gaudeamus. The relatively early Missa Ave maris stella, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> dates from his years in the Sistine Chapel choir, paraphrases the Marian antiphon of the same name; {{it is also one of}} his shortest masses. The late Missa de Beata Virgine paraphrases plainchants in praise of the Virgin Mary; it is a Lady Mass, a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|The Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone, {{from where}} Euchambersia is known, {{represents}} a floodplain that {{was covered in}} many small, relatively straight streams. The water level in these streams was probably seasonally dependent. Judging from pollen preserved in the Cistecephalus AZ, the pollen taxon Pityosporites (<b>which</b> <b>probably</b> originated from a plant similar to Glossopteris) was very common, forming some 80% to 90% of the pollen discovered (although the prevalent sediments {{would not have been}} ideal for pollen preservation).|$|E
5|$|The Eurymedon was {{a highly}} {{significant}} victory for the Delian League, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> ended {{once and for all}} the threat of another Persian invasion of Greece. It also seems to have prevented any Persian attempt to reconquer the Asiatic Greeks until at least 451 BC. The accession of further cities of Asia Minor to the Delian league, particularly from Caria, probably followed Cimon's campaign there.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler {{team has}} said that Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c are {{probably}} composed mostly of water with a thin hydrogen and helium atmosphere. In comparison to the outer planets of the system, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> have large hydrogen and helium atmospheres, Kepler-11c's proximity to its star has blown off most of its atmosphere. Kepler-11 and its six-planet system form what NASA considers {{to be the most}} compact and flattest planetary system yet discovered. Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c orbit Kepler-11 with a phenomenon called orbital resonance, a gravitational tugging that keeps their orbit stable at a 5.4 ratio.|$|E

5|$|The {{above-mentioned}} migration {{was undertaken}} by {{a part of}} the Jastorf population, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> included the tribes later called Bastarnae and Scirii in Greek written sources, noted because of their military exploits around Greece and Greek colonies in the later part of the 3rd century BC. Their route went along the Warta and Noteć rivers, then crossed Kujawy and Masovia, turned south along the Bug River and continued on to what today is Moldavia, where they settled and developed the Poienesti-Lukasevka culture. The route is marked by archeological findings, especially the characteristic bronze crown-shaped necklaces.|$|E
5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{noted in}} 1922 {{that the work}} of intense {{expression}} was singular in the sacred music of its period, with a convincing musical interpretation of the biblical text and its manifold shades of emotion. Paul Hindemith wrote a trimmed adaption <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> helped to keep the work in the repertory, and François Callebout wrote an organ version, making the work accessible for smaller choirs. It was first performed in Wiesbaden, where the composer studied, in 2003. The celebration of the Reger Year 2016 led to several performances.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Spain's {{enemies in the}} Straits prompted the Spanish king Philip IV to order Gibraltar's defences to be strengthened. A new mole and gun platforms were built, though the latter's usefulness was limited {{due to a lack}} of gunners. The town was an unsanitary, crowded place, <b>which</b> <b>probably</b> contributed to the outbreak in 1649 of an epidemic– reportedly plague but possibly typhoid– which killed a quarter of the population. English fleets returned to Gibraltar in 1651–52 and again in 1654–55 as temporary allies of the Spanish against French and Dutch shipping in the Straits.|$|E
