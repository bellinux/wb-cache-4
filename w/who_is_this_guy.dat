25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy?</b> Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|R
5000|$|Coming {{three years}} later in the same magazine, Cleve Cartmill’s “Deadline” {{provoked}} astonishment in the lunch table discussions at Los Alamos. It really did describe isotope separation and the bomb itself in detail, and raised as its principal plot pivot the issue the physicists were then debating among themselves: should the Allies use it? To the physicists from many countries clustered in the high mountain strangeness of New Mexico, cut off from their familiar sources of humanist learning, it must have seemed particularly striking that Cartmill described an allied effort, a joint responsibility laid upon many nations. Discussion of Cartmill’s “Deadline” was significant. The story’s detail was remarkable, its sentiments even more so. Did this rather obscure story hint at what the American public really thought about such a superweapon, or would think if they only knew? Talk attracts attention, Teller recalled a security officer who took a decided interest, making notes, saying little. In retrospect, {{it was easy to}} see what a wartime intelligence monitor would make of the physicists’ conversations. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> Cartmill, anyway? Where did he get these details? Who tipped him to the isotope separation problem? “and that is why Mr. Campbell received his visitors.” ...|$|R

The Altair computer with 7 kB of memory that BASIC required was still being tested and would not be ready until the next day. Roberts had booked Allen in the most expensive hotel in Albuquerque and the room was $40 more than Allen brought with him.

50|$|He became {{involved}} in musical theatre and wrote book and lyrics (with Roslyn Baws) for the rock musical Alison, a Haight-Ashbury Alice in Wonderland with music by many Beechwood songwriters including Larry Norman. Featuring Kay Cole (creator {{of the role of}} Maggie in A Chorus Line), Ted Neeley and Richard Hatch, it was presented in Los Angeles in 1968 and optioned for Broadway by his co-producer Hal James, producer of Man of La Mancha. In Boston in 1971 he co-produced and staged Hey Dad, <b>Who</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>Guy</b> Gershwin Anyway?, a colorful array of Gershwin tunes in rock style, and later George, Paul, Ringo, John and Gershwin, seamlessly melding the music of the Beatles and George Gershwin.|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} some {{evidence}} that Matthew Rabin existed before 1990, we had the pleasure of discovering him for ourselves when, in the early 1990 s, he sent each of us a copy of his manuscript "Incorporating Fairness into Game Theory and Economics" [2]. Matthew was, at this time, an assistant professor in Berkeley's economics department, having recently finished his graduate training at MIT. The paper was remarkable in many ways, and it induced us both to call around and ask: "Who is this guy Rabin?"

40|$|What {{follows is}} an {{interview}} with Professor John Mowitt of the University of Minnesota, which was conducted by e-mail throughout the Summer of 1999. Existing readers of parallax will be familiar with his name. Perhaps, also, you have read his book, Text: The Genealogy of an Antidisciplinary Object. 1 If so, you might already 'know' why he would/should be asked for his thoughts {{on the theme of}} this issue. But perhaps you have never heard of John Mowitt. This is certainly a possibility, a possibility which raises an interesting matter: so <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy?</b> Why should we listen to him? What authority will his words have? (Or perhaps my use of the title, 'professor', has provisionally pacified, or controlled such questioning.) Why interview him and not someone else - what might he 'know' about violence that singles him out for special attention? The implications and problems raised by these questions are surely generalizable, and should perhaps therefore be directed at everyone, all the time (Professor Mowitt himself jokingly acknowledged this matter, when, after the interview proper, I raised the question of an appropriate title. He suggested it might be called 'A Conversation with Who [...] . !?') ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{an episode}} of The SGU {{recording}} {{a few years after}} DeAngelis' death, Novella said, [...] "So we have two quotes today to close out the show. This one came from a listener. We get these emails all the time. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> just the most recent. The emailer said to us, 'I am a skeptic. I am a free thinker. I discard drivel and exonerate exactitude. I thank Perry DeAngelis.' So, our annual live show in New York is always our Perry DeAngelis memorial show; that's in fact how NECSS started, by us giving a show here to honor Perry. And so it's also good to note as we often do that we continue to get emails from people who just found the podcast, are going back through old episodes, like 'hey, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> Perry <b>guy?</b> He's awesome; why isn't he podcasting any more?'. Of course they discover that he died a few years ago, unfortunately. But his legacy still lives on and we will always remember him at NECSS." ...|$|R
5000|$|As released, {{the single}} {{incorporates}} {{the work of}} six different songwriters, two producers and executive producer Rob Dickins, the erstwhile chairman of Warner Bros, but according to Mark Taylor the creation of [...] "Believe" [...] was a [...] "strange one." [...] Originally written by Brian Higgins, Matthew Gray, Stuart McLennen and Timothy Powell and circulated on Warner as a demo for months, nobody wanted it. Mark Taylor said that [...] "everyone loved the chorus but not {{the rest of the}} song; As we were already writing other songs for Cher, Rob asked us if we could sort it out. Two of our writers, Steve Torch and Paul Barry, got involved and eventually came up with a complete song that Rob and Cher were happy with." [...] Once the demo version was agreed, Mark and Brian took over for the actual production, working at Dreamhouse; Mark said [...] "We knew the rough direction to take, because Rob had said he wanted to make a Cher dance record. The hard part was trying to make one that wouldn't alienate Cher's existing fans." [...] After the song's success, Cher claimed in a December 2000 BBC radio interview that she also co-wrote part of the song, saying [...] "I wrote part of Believe — the second verse. The first verse <b>was</b> <b>this</b> woman <b>who</b> <b>was</b> sad that <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>was</b> going, and the second verse was saying the same thing, so I changed it on the spot!" ...|$|R

So, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy?</b> Fairness In explaining who Matthew Rabin is, and why he deserved the Clark award, we will start with that remarkable fairness paper. Economists and game theorists have long used two standard assumptions in modeling behavior: rationality and selfinterest. These working assumptions persisted in spite of growing experimental evidence that both rationality and self-interest are “bounded. ” In game theoretic contexts, evidence that people care how much others get was abundant: In a standard one-trial prisoner’s dilemma game, where the rational selfish choice is to defect, roughly half the players cooperate.
