5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot}} of ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of {{controversy}} surrounding the cover art {{used for this}} album. Sepultura had initially planned on using another Michael Whelan cover art, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre. Monte Conner of Roadrunner sent the original artwork to Obituary, who used it on their album, Cause of Death. For years after the incident, Igor Cavalera was upset with Monte Conner for giving away their album cover. The artwork for Arise, however, was designed by Michael Whelan exclusively for the album.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> much.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|The 1975 Buick Electra 225 Limited was {{the longest}} four-door hardtop car GM ever built, as the Cadillac Sixty Special (which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> longer) was {{unavailable}} as a hardtop sedan since the mid-sixties. The model also ushered in a return of the six window configuration that Buick offered between 1959 and 1964.|$|E
25|$|The Cervo <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> sportier than it {{appeared}} at first sight, however.

ABS was optional, as was Full-time 4WD.|$|E

25|$|In 1900 {{the idea}} of {{different}} races playing {{together in the same}} match <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a novelty. Only in the West Indies and India were there significant numbers of coloured cricketers playing. Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji, an Indian prince (universally known as Ranji), had been playing in English cricket for a few years but otherwise coloured cricketers were rarely seen.|$|E

25|$|From 1990 through 1994, NBC only {{televised}} the All Star Game. NBC reportedly {{wanted to}} test the appeal of hockey, having recently lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS. Shortly thereafter however, NBC would gain the broadcast television rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) from CBS, thus there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a notion that NBC no longer really needed hockey.|$|E
25|$|The San Antonio Spurs {{started out}} as the Dallas Chaparrals of the {{original}} version of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Coached by player/coach Cliff Hagan the Dallas Chaparrals were one of 11 teams to take {{the floor in the}} inaugural season of the upstart ABA. The Chaps second season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a disappointment, as the team finished in 4th place with a mediocre 41–37 record. In the playoffs the Chaparrals quickly fell to the New Orleans Buccaneers.|$|E
25|$|This Ólavsøka {{tradition}} is {{very old and}} {{dates back to the}} time of the Norwegian rule.

In the 17th century this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> modified - now only meeting with all priests at Ólavsøka day.|$|E

In that position, Jaisimha scored Test hundreds against England in 1961–62 and 1963–64, and 134 against Ceylon in 1964–65. In the 1963–64 series against England he made 444 runs. In 1964–65, he batted in the middle order for Hyderabad and hit 713 runs. But failures in the Test matches led to him being dropped.|$|E
25|$|Representatives from 15 tribes {{agreed in}} June 1986 {{to adopt the}} name; there were no delegates from the three major groups of the T'boli, the Teduray. The choice of a Cebuano word <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> ironic but they deemed it {{appropriate}} as the Lumad tribes {{do not have any}} other common language except Cebuano. This marked the first time that these tribes had agreed to a common name for themselves, distinct from that of the Moros and different from the migrant majority and their descendants.|$|E
25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again.
