This name was only supposed to be used {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season, but lasted until November 2011. On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this will most likely be an interim name, as it is only being used to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium.

2500|$|... "This {{monument}} {{symbolizes the}} pinnacle of successful {{for the construction of}} the North–South Expressway that connects Bukit Kayu Hitam bordering with Thailand in the North to Johor Bahru in the Causeway bordering with Singapore in the South. The construction of the 848km expressway, across the peat swamps and forests and hill untapped granite hills, is an amazing achievement. Also impressive is the pragmatic way in which the combined efforts between {{the public and private sectors}} has resulted in this achievement. The expressways is the result of joint efforts of the Malaysian Highway Authority, a statutory body, which has been planned early and begin construction, with the Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan Berhad (PLUS) (North–South Expressway Project), a private company that was awarded concessions to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain the expressways.

2500|$|Since 1995, the United Nations Development Program {{has been}} keeping Gender-related Development Index (GDI), a ranking of {{aggregate}} statistics of development, with focus on gender inequality. Ivory Coast has consistently ranked in the lowest quarter of the GDI: dropping to 166 of 177 in 2007, from 145 in 2005. Out of the 156 countries with both HDI and GDI values, 150 countries have a better ratio than Ivory Coast's. This movement {{is in line with}} Ivory Coast's Human Development Index trend, which peaked in 1985, and has dropped ever since. While leading neighbors like Mali, Niger, Ivory Coast consistently lags Senegal, Ghana, and The Gambia. In comparison to Senegal and France, female life expectancy at birth is around 60 percent of French totals, and 14.1 years less than Senegal, but this trend roughly mirrors male life expectancy at birth Adult literacy rates are higher than Senegal's, but current female enrollment as a percentage of males is now less, and estimated earned income for females in Ivory Coast is dramatically less, while Ivorian men may expect to earn more than their Senegalese neighbors.

2500|$|The cadet {{training}} system at Virginia Tech has evolved throughout the decades, with each iteration seeking {{to improve the}} quality of leader produced by the program. [...] Beginning with the class of 2004, the current cadet {{training system}} was implemented. The new cadets officially begin Red Phase upon returning from pass at 1830 (6:30 pm) for their first study hours Sunday evening. A freshman cadet typically has eight-and-a-half hours of unstructured time during a weekday in which to attend classes, study, run errands, and workout. Red Phase, like the color red, is the most intense phase, and the new cadets continue to be trained by their cadre (juniors and seniors who were specifically trained to train the freshmen). They <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to learn topics from The Guidon, the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets book of knowledge and will be quizzed on topics from the Guidon during [...] "Freshmen Online", more commonly referred to as [...] "onlines". Onlines are conducted Monday through Thursday and last for one-half hour. Onlines typically go away at the end of Red Phase. To delineate the phases, the cadets and cadre go on the Caldwell March, envisioned as the direct replacement for [...] "Turn Day". The Caldwell March is named after the first student at Virginia Tech, William Addison Caldwell, and there is a statue of him on Upper Quad. William Addison walked [...] to be the first student at Virginia Tech, and to commemorate this historic walk, the Caldwell March was begun.

This usually takes place in October and the fall foliage adds to the spectacular views in marking the end of the arduous Red Phase.|$|E
2500|$|The first director's duty {{under section}} 171 {{is to follow}} the company's constitution, but also only {{exercise}} powers for implied [...] "proper purposes". Prior proper purpose cases often involved directors plundering the company's assets for personal enrichment, or attempting to install mechanisms to frustrate attempted takeovers by outside bidders, such as a poison pill. Such practices are improper, because they go beyond the reason for which directors were delegated their power. The all-important duty of care is found in section 174. Directors must display the care, skill and competence that is reasonable for somebody carrying out {{the functions of the}} office, and if a director has any special qualifications an even higher standard <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b> However, under section 1157 courts may, if directors are negligent but found to be honest and ought to be excused, relieve directors from paying compensation. The [...] "objective plus subjective" [...] standard was first introduced in the wrongful trading provision from the Insolvency Act 1986, and applied in Re D'Jan of London Ltd. The liquidator sought to recover compensation from Mr D'Jan, who failing to read an insurance policy form, did not disclose he was previously the director of an insolvent company. The policy was void when the company's warehouse burnt down. Hoffmann LJ held Mr D'Jan's failure was negligent, but exercised discretion to relieve liability on the ground that he owned almost all of his small business and had only put his own money at risk. The courts emphasise that they will not judge business decisions unfavourably with the benefit of hindsight, however simple procedural failures of judgment will be vulnerable. Cases under the Company Director Disqualification Act 1986, such as Re Barings plc (No 5) show that directors will also be liable for failing to adequately supervise employees or have effective risk management systems, as where the London directors ignored a warning report about the currency exchange business in Singapore, where a rogue trader caused losses so massive that it brought the whole bank into insolvency.|$|E
