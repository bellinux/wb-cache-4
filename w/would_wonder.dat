In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I <b>would</b> <b>wonder</b> why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band.

[...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E

I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it with one finger, you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E
