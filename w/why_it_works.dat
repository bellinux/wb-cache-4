500|$|Hail to the Thief has a {{score of}} 85 out of 100 on review {{aggregate}} site Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called Hail to the Thief [...] "Radiohead firing on all cylinders, a major work by major artists {{at the height of}} their powers." [...] Chris Ott of Pitchfork wrote that Radiohead had [...] "largely succeeded in their efforts to shape pop music into as boundless and possible a medium as it should be," [...] assigning it a [...] "Best New Music" [...] designation. Writing for New York, Ethan Brown said that Hail to the Thief [...] "isn't a protest album, and that's <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> so well. As with great Radiohead records past, such as Kid A, the music – restlessly, freakishly inventive – pushes politics far into the background." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that [...] "despite the fact that it seems more like a bunch of songs on a disc rather than a singular body, its impact is substantial", concluding that the band [...] "have entered a second decade of record-making with a surplus of momentum. In Mojo, Peter Paphides wrote that Hail to the Thief [...] "coheres as well as anything else in their canon".|$|E

It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there.

2500|$|Proponents of nonsubordination theory propose {{several reasons}} <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> best to explain {{domestic}} violence. [...] First, {{there are certain}} recurring patterns in domestic violence that indicate {{it is not the}} result of intense anger or arguments, but rather is a form of subordination. [...] This is evidenced in part by the fact that domestic violence victims are typically abused in a variety of situations and by a variety of means. [...] For example, victims are sometimes beaten after they have been sleeping or have been separated from the batterer, and often the abuse takes on a financial or emotional form in addition to physical abuse. [...] Supporters of nonsubordination theory use these examples to dispel the notion that battering is always the result of heat of the moment anger or intense arguments. [...] Also, batterers often employ manipulative and deliberate tactics when abusing their victims, which can “rang from searching for and destroying a treasured object of hers to striking her in areas of her body that do not show bruises (e.g. her scalp) or in areas where she would be embarrassed to show others her bruises.” [...] These behaviors can be even more useful to a batterer when the batterer and the victim share children, because the batterer often controls the family’s financial assets, making the victim less likely to leave if it would put her children at risk.|$|E
