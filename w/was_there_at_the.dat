25|$|Some sources {{attribute}} {{her debut}} to Venice at La Fenice, as Odabella in Verdi's Attila. She appeared {{in that role}} at Udine on 24 July 1847, and later as Lucrezia in I due Foscari in the same theatre. Later in 1847 she was singing Odabella in Rovigo, and it <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of that year, that Benjamin Lumley heard and ('struck with the splendid voice, the impulsive dramatic temperament, the spirit, and the captivating person') recruited her for the season of 1848 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, {{of which he was}} the impresario. The family objected that she was too young to face the English public, but Lumley was urged to proceed by the tenor Rubini: 'I tell you plainly, and with deep conviction, that you are making an excellent acquisition. A most beautiful voice – give her good models and a good maestro'. Sophie herself was delighted with the proposals. In the winter of 1847 she made several appearances at La Fenice.|$|E

500|$|Muriel Latow {{was then}} an {{aspiring}} interior decorator, {{and owner of}} the Latow Art Gallery in the East 60s in Manhattan. She told Warhol that he should paint [...] "Something you see every day and something that everybody would recognize. Something like a can of Campbell's Soup." [...] Ted Carey, who <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, said that Warhol responded by exclaiming: [...] "Oh that sounds fabulous." [...] According to Carey, Warhol went to a supermarket the following day and bought a case of [...] "all the soups", which Carey said he saw when he stopped by Warhol's apartment the next day. When the art critic G. R. Swenson asked Warhol in 1963 why he painted soup cans, the artist replied, [...] "I used to drink it, I used to have the same lunch every day, for twenty years." ...|$|E
500|$|Two other {{participants}} were profoundly affected. Firstly, Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as {{the player who}} let Chamberlain score 100 on him, although he only played 20 of 48minutes and {{was not on the}} court when it happened. On the other hand, the game immortalized little-used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the man who gave Chamberlain the 100-point assist. Decades later, The New York Times interviewed Ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as [...] "a walking footnote" [...] of one of basketball's greatest moments. The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain sitting on a bench, holding up a paper with a scribbled [...] "100". The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation: when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room, he took a paper and scribbled the number on it, and Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis who <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> game (not for professional reasons, but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat) took the now-famous photo. Cherry calls it the [...] "ultimate picture" [...] of Wilt Chamberlain.|$|E

500|$|The family {{settled in}} a small house loaned to them by Princess George of Greece at Saint-Cloud, on the {{outskirts}} of Paris, where Princess Andrew helped in a charity shop for Greek refugees. She became deeply religious, and on 20 October 1928 entered the Greek Orthodox Church. That winter, she translated her husband's defence of his actions during the Greco-Turkish War into English. Soon afterward, she began claiming that she was receiving divine messages and that she had healing powers. In 1930, after suffering a severe nervous breakdown, Princess Andrew was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, first by Thomas Ross, a psychiatrist who specialised in shell-shock, and subsequently by Sir Maurice Craig, who treated the future King George VI before he had speech therapy. The diagnosis was confirmed at Dr Ernst Simmel's sanatorium at Tegel, Berlin. She was forcibly removed from her family and placed in Dr Ludwig Binswanger's sanatorium in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. It was a famous and well-respected institution with several celebrity patients, including Vaslav Nijinsky, the ballet dancer and choreographer, who <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time as Princess Andrew. Binswanger also diagnosed schizophrenia. Both he and Simmel consulted Sigmund Freud who believed that the princess's delusions were the result of sexual frustration. He recommended [...] "X-raying her ovaries in order to kill off her libido." [...] Princess Andrew protested her sanity and repeatedly tried to leave the asylum.|$|E

2500|$|Little {{is known}} about his early life, not even his {{approximate}} birthdate, but he was probably {{from the village of}} Longueval in the Somme region of Picardy (scene of much heavy fighting during the Somme battles in 1916). [...] By 1498, court records indicate that he was employed by Anne of Brittany, and between 1502 and 1504 he was a singer at the Savoy court, where his high pay indicates the respect he was accorded as a musician. From there he went to Ferrara, where he was a singer between December 1503 and September 1504; therefore he <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time as Josquin des Prez. [...] It is presumed that he wrote his most famous composition, the passion setting Passio Domini nostri for Holy Week of 1504, the same event for which Josquin's famous Miserere was likely written.|$|E

Kılıçdaroğlu responded that political tensions would cease to exist if Erdoğan stopped making his polarising speeches for three days. One observer said it was a measure of the state of Turkish democracy that Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu could openly threaten, on 20 December 2015, that, if his party did not win the election, his country's Kurds would endure a repeat of the era of the [...] "white Toros", the Turkish name for the Renault 12, [...] "a car associated with the gendarmarie's fearsome intelligence agents, who carried out thousands of extrajudicial executions of Kurdish nationalists during the 1990s." [...] In February 2015, a 13-year-old child was arrested after allegedly criticising Erdoğan on Facebook. In 2016, a waiter was arrested for not serving tea to Erdoğan.|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was during}} the last {{struggle}} of his people, {{at the time of}} the Messiah craze in 1890-1891 that American Horse demonstrated as never before the real greatness of the man. While many of his friends were carried away by the new thought, he held aloof from it and cautioned his band to do the same. When it developed into an extensive upheaval among the nations he took his positive stand against it. Presently all Indians who did not dance the Ghost Dance were ordered to come into camp at Pine Ridge Agency. [...] American Horse was the first to bring in his people. [...] I <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time and talked with him daily. When Little was arrested, it had been agreed among the disaffected to have him resist, which meant that he would be roughly handled. This was to be their excuse to attack the Indian police, which would probably lead to a general massacre or outbreak. I know that this desperate move was opposed from the beginning by American Horse, and it was believed that his life was threatened.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After his firing, {{there was}} some {{indication}} that General Lebed intended {{to run for the}} presidency again in the 2000 Russian presidential election. His visit to the United States in January 1997 was viewed as an effort to win over American business interests as the best successor to Yeltsin, and included a meeting with Donald J. Trump at Trump Tower. Reportedly, he discussed potential construction projects in Moscow that Trump could be involved in. [...] "He invited me to Russia and I accepted, I thought he was terrific," [...] Trump said after the meeting. One Western analyst stated about Lebed, [...] "He may perceive that Yeltsin benefited greatly from support from the Americans in the last campaign. Bill Clinton made a trip to Moscow during the campaign. And the International Monetary Fund extended loans that enabled the Government to make credible promises to pay wages." [...] He also visited President Clinton's inauguration while he <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> invitation of Senator William Roth, who made the request at the behest of an unknown businessman. Overall Lebed was said to have left a good impression on the American businessmen that he met. During that time, he was described as being the most popular candidate for the Russian presidency.|$|E
