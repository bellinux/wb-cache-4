50|$|If {{the weather}} is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, {{and if it is}} unseasonably wet or if the plums are not {{harvested}} as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called brown rot. Brown rot is not toxic, and very small affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera, including November <b>moth,</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beauty</b> and short-cloaked <b>moth.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>willow</b> <b>beauty</b> (Peribatodes rhomboidaria) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is a common species of Europe and {{adjacent}} regions (Near East and the Maghreb). While it is found widely throughout Scandinavian countries, which have a maritime climate, it is absent from parts of the former USSR which are at the same latitude but have a more continental climate.|$|R
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor <b>moth,</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beauty,</b> white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, double square-spot, black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella.

40|$|To control {{insect pests}} with a virus, it is {{important}} to determine the optimum time for the treatment. However, before analysing this problem, a realistic model for the uninfected host must be developed. A model framework for this has been developed and applied to the pine <b>beauty</b> <b>moth</b> which is a major pest of lodgepole pine in Scotland...|$|R
40|$|The {{community}} {{composition of}} Carabid beetles, some species {{of which are}} known predators of pine <b>beauty</b> <b>moth,</b> was examined within a Scottish plantation forest. Sites differing in soil type and the species of trees planted were sampled with pitfall traps in most weeks of a 3 -year period. There were faunal differences between sites with lodgepole pine on deep peat and other sites in the study (lodgepole pine on iron-pan soil, species mixture of lodgepole and Scots pine, and pure stands of Scots pine). In general deep peat sites supported fewer species and individuals of carabids. Three Carabus species were implicated as likely predators of Panolis flammea pupae and each was less abundant on the sites with lodgepole pine. It is suggested that the susceptibility to pine <b>beauty</b> <b>moth</b> of lodgepole pine growing on deep peat substrates is at least partly attributable to impoverished predator faunas...|$|R

50|$|There {{are over}} 60 species of bird {{including}} curlew, whinchat, and both green and great spotted woodpecker. Amongst the numerous insects {{to be found}} are green and purple hairstreak butterflies, dark-bordered <b>beauty</b> <b>moth,</b> bog bush cricket and glow worm. Other wildlife seen here include fox, hare and harvest mouse. Hebridean sheep and Highland cattle graze during summer to keep down vegetation.|$|R
50|$|The ground colour of {{the wings}} is buff or grey, variably marked with darker fascia and a pale postdiscal crossline. The darker {{markings}} {{are not usually}} as strong as in the rather similar <b>willow</b> <b>beauty.</b> Melanic forms occur fairly frequently. The wingspan is 38-45 mm. One or two broods are produced each year. In the British Isles, the adults {{can be seen at}} any time between March and August; this time range may vary in other parts of this moth's range. The species flies at night and is attracted to light.|$|R
50|$|Ivies are {{of major}} {{ecological}} importance for their nectar and fruit production, both produced {{at times of}} the year when few other nectar or fruit sources are available. The ivy bee Colletes hederae is completely dependent on ivy flowers, timing its entire life cycle around ivy flowering. The fruit are eaten by a range of birds, including thrushes, blackcaps, and woodpigeons. The leaves are eaten by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera such as angle shades, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, scalloped hazel, small angle shades, small dusty wave (which feeds exclusively on ivy), swallow-tailed <b>moth</b> and <b>willow</b> <b>beauty.</b>|$|R

50|$|All {{species of}} yew contain highly {{poisonous}} alkaloids known as taxanes, with some {{variation in the}} exact formula of the alkaloid between the species. All parts of the tree except the arils contain the alkaloid. The arils are edible and sweet, but the seed is dangerously poisonous; unlike birds, the human stomach can break down the seed coat and release the taxanes into the body. This can have fatal results if yew 'berries' are eaten without removing the seeds first. Grazing animals, particularly cattle and horses, are also sometimes found dead near yew trees after eating the leaves, though deer are able {{to break down the}} poisons and will eat yew foliage freely. In the wild, deer browsing of yews is often so extensive that wild yew trees are commonly restricted to cliffs and other steep slopes inaccessible to deer. The foliage is also eaten by the larvae of some Lepidopteran insects including the <b>moth</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beauty.</b>|$|R

40|$|Multispecies sex {{pheromone}} trapping (trapping of {{more than}} one species in the same trap) for the pine shoot moth Rhyacionia buoliana, the pine moth, Dendrolimus pini, the nun moth, Lymantria monacha, the pine <b>beauty</b> <b>moth,</b> Panolis flammea and the pine sawflies Diprion pini and Neodiprion sertifer was evaluated. The catch from traps baited with the pheromone of a single species was compared with the catch from traps baited with pheromones for several species. The catch in the multispecies traps was significantly reduced in comparison with the single species traps for Dendrolimus pini, L. monacha and N. sertifer. Neodiprion sertifer was most likely inhibited by the Diprion pini pheromone. A follow-up study of Dendrolimus pini and L. monacha showed no pheromonal interference between them. Further studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of multispecies monitoring. However, for practical applications a slight decrease in catch, due to pheromonal interference, could probably be tolerated as long as the catch reflects total population density...|$|R
