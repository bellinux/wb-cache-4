40|$|Flooding {{and drying}} in space or space-time {{discontinuous}} Galerkin (DG) discretizations provides an accurate and efficient numerical scheme. Moreover, the space-time DG method is particularly suitable for moving or deforming meshes. The shallow water equations, which can exhibit flooding and drying {{due to the}} movement of water front, are considered and discretized with linear polynomial approximations. In the finite elements connected to the water front, the means (zeroth order term) are used to conserve the mass and momentum, and the slopes (first order term) are used to follow the front movement accurately, which contrasts finite volume schemes where the slopes have to be reconstructed. The front movement can be governed by a front equation in a restricted {{situation in which the}} front is single valued in either one of the horizontal coordinate directions. In general, however, the water line can be complicated and the topology of the domain can change as islands become flooded or fall dry. We are developing the following two approaches for this general case. In an Eulerian-Lagrangian space DG method, the free boundary nodes at the water line are allowed to move, while the time step is restricted and the mesh is locally updated to keep the dry and <b>wet</b> <b>mesh</b> around the water line well-behaved. In the space-time DG method a level set is introduced to demarcate the water line while the water depth and level set are matched properly. As a preliminary step, we have obtained numerical results for two exact solutions by prescribing the exact front movement. These are second order accurate in space and time...|$|R

The effectiveness of interfaces, such as filters, doors, window screens, and cabinets, which affect the concentration, exposure, or deposition of carbon fibers on both (internal and external) {{sides of the}} interface is examined. The transfer function of multilayer aluminum <b>mesh,</b> <b>wet</b> and dry, polyurethane foam, and window screen are determined {{as a function of}} air velocity.

50|$|Packing {{materials}} such as metal mesh, steel wool, or metal washers {{may be used to}} fill the chambers and further dissipate and cool the gases. These are somewhat more effective than empty chambers, but less effective than <b>wet</b> designs. Metal <b>mesh,</b> if properly used, may last for hundreds or thousands of shots of spaced semi-automatic fire, however steel wool usually degrades within ten shots with stainless wool lasting longer than regular steel wool. Like wipes, packing materials are rarely found in modern suppressors.|$|R

Patrick indicates that during his escape from captivity, he had to travel 200 Roman miles (about 185 statute miles) to find a ship {{to take him to}} Britain, i.e., a ship on the east coast of Ireland. Additionally, the Killala area's modern climate, among the coldest and <b>wettest</b> in Ireland, <b>meshes</b> well with Patrick's description of performing slave labor [...] "through snow and frost and rain." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine for}} the first and second {{iteration}} (v2.0) was a 149.8 cc single cylinder four-stroke engine with four valves and a single overhead camshaft.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{record of a}} late Pleistocene salamander, Batra- choseps (Plethodontidae; Bolitoglossini) from the Northern Channel Islands. Fos- sils were {{recovered}} in sediments by using 700 |Jim <b>mesh</b> <b>wet</b> sieving. Ocean currents could have transported {{any or all of}} the known seven families of sala- manders presently inhabiting coastal USA to the islands. We suggest that only the Plethodontini and Bolitoglossini were likely to successfully colonize the Pleis- tocene-age coalesced island, Santarosae, due to their lack of an aquatic larval stage. The recovery of Batrachoseps from Carrington Point implies a moist, or- ganic understory, but it does not dictate a particular habitat reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Natural gas {{is a vital}} {{component}} of the worlds supply of energy. In Norway all the gas can be found offshore where it needs to processed before transport. A {{vital part of the}} processing is gas and liquid separation. Current gas-liquid separators are big and expensive, and the offshore industry is looking for more compact separators. One of the more prominent technologies is the NNNGLseparator developed at NTNU. To further identify its possibilities, a thorough research program has been startedIn this thesis one-dimensional models describing pressure drop and separation performance of the NTNU Natural Gas Liquid Separator (NNGLseparator) for dispersed gas-liquid flows has been studied. Here modeling of separation performance was divided into cyclonic separation and droplet capture by the meshpad, and then combined in sequence. The droplet capture is assumed to occur before cyclonic separation. To analyze the impact of centrifugal force on droplet capture, the force was included in a previous proposed model describing droplet capture by a single fiber in the meshpad. With this as basis, modeling of total droplet capture for the meshpad was analyzed. Through this analysis we proposed an extension on the existing model for the case of the flow not following the rotation of the meshpad. The droplets that are not captured are then separated through cyclonic separation. To model this separation mechanism, a modified time of flight model was developed. The modification includes the mesh porosity, and a - factor describing the droplet s reduced radial velocity due to the obstructing meshpad. Existing models for pressure drop across fixed porous media were compared to experimental data to identify which model best applies to the meshpad used in the NNGLseparator. How this model performs in describing a rotating porous media was then analyzed for the two scenarios; fully developed flow before mesh entry and developing flow inside a rotating meshpad. Through this analysis an extension to the pressure drop model was proposed, which includes the tangential velocity difference between rotating mesh and gas flow. A previous proposed model for pressure drop across <b>wet</b> <b>mesh</b> pad was reviewed. This led to a discussion on how liquid hold up differs in the NNGLseparator from conventional fixed meshpads. The proposed one-dimensional models were then analyzed through a parametric study of the separator performance in terms of pressure drop and efficiency of droplet separation for different flow conditions and geometries...|$|R
40|$|Widespread use of {{petrochemicals}} {{often leads}} to accidental releases in aquatic environments, occasionally with disastrous results. Recent advances {{in the understanding of}} selectively wetting surfaces have {{led to the development of}} functionalized steel meshes with hydrophobic and oleophilic surfaces. These meshes can perform oil/water separation in situ, continuously, via capillary action. The goal of this study is to determine the potential of hydrophobic meshes as oil spill recovery devices. A fabrication method was developed using steel mesh dip-coated in a hot solution of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in xylene. The mesh gained a rough, hydrophobic coating of LDPE, with tunable pore sizes and surface roughness. The coating was characterized using microscopy techniques and contact angle analysis, in order to identify surface features relevant to oil/water separation. Oil was found to persistently <b>wet</b> the <b>mesh,</b> attenuating any effects from roughness. Next, a key performance metric, the water breakthrough pressure, was predicted using a modified version of the Young-Laplace equation incorporating an unpinned meniscus. The model was successful for meshes with pore radii between 7 - 220 tm, which could hold back up to 40 cm of water. Finally, a bench-scale apparatus was built to test the oil permeate flux at steady state under capillary-driven flow. The mesh successfully recovered oil from the surface of a pool of water, with less than 1 % water recovered by mass, with a representative flux of 1 L-m-²-s. These results were used to discuss implications for the feasibility of field-scale devices. by Daniel P. Prendergast. Thesis (S. M.)
