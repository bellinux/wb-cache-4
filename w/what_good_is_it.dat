Even if thou stoodest before me thou wouldst not know me, and couldst but do what I bid thee. The life in thee would be my life, and not thy life, Kallikrates." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> summer, {{that right}} till evening, when the corncrakes called, the larks would mount {{up into the}} light, to sing once more before nightfall. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> all, when {{she was out of}} tune, when she must only {{remember}} the burden and shame of school that day.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. Such fools, you mean! <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> to them? The moment they'd done it, the {{landlord}} put a rent of 5 pounds {{a year on}} them, and turned them out because they couldn't pay it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' {{cried the}} Queen, 'can nothing appease this enemy of ours? <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that I sent {{her more than}} fifty pounds of sweetmeats, and as much again of the best sugar, not to mention two Westphalia hams? She is as angry as ever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see it," [...] {{said this}} companion, a prosperous-looking gentleman {{with a gold}} watch-chain. [...] "This art for art's sake--I don't believe in it, I tell you.

60|$|TARLETON. [walking about] True. Fine. Good. Beautiful. All this damned materialism: <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to anybody? Ive got a soul: dont tell me I havnt. Cut {{me up and}} {{you cant}} find it. Cut up a steam engine and you cant find the steam. But, by George, it makes the engine go. Say what you will, Summerhays, the divine spark is a fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are beaten! Of {{course that}} beats you. It's Cossar! What can {{you hope to}} do now? <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to do {{anything}} now? You will breathe it in the dust of every street. What is there to fight for more? Rules of war, indeed! And now Caterham wants to humbug me to help him bargain. Good heavens, man! Why should I come to your exploded windbag? He has played his game ... murdered and muddled. Why should I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{from the}} front seat {{on the top of}} an omnibus on a sunny September afternoon, the Strand, and Charing Cross corner, and Whitehall, and the great {{multitude}} of people, the great uproar of vehicles, streaming in all directions, is apt to look a world altogether too formidable. It has a glare, it has a tumult and vigour that shouts one down. It shouts one down, if shouting <b>is</b> to carry <b>it.</b> <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> to trot along the pavement through this noise and tumult of life, pleading Utopia to that botanist? <b>What</b> <b>good</b> would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to recommend Utopia in this driver's preoccupied ear? ...|$|R
5000|$|The ominous {{approach}} of the survey line of Clathran battle and colony ships was sweeping through the galaxy, identifying, classifying, and exterminating all in its path. Known collectively as the [...] "Clathran Menace", it meant many things to many people. To most of the human race, it meant nothing, as they were being purposely {{kept in the dark}} by their [...] "superiors", so as not to cause any undue panic. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> to evacuate a city in the face of impending disaster if the only road out of town wasn't finished? ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{understand}} how justice aims at <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessary {{to look beyond}} particular good or bad things we might want or not want a share of as individuals, and this includes considering the viewpoint of a community (the subject of Aristotles Politics). Alone of the virtues, says Aristotle, justice looks like [...] "someone elses good", an argument also confronted by Plato in his Republic.|$|R
6000|$|But there arose {{to him the}} {{question}} whether all this had not arrived too late! Of <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> {{to open up the}} true delights of life to a man when you have so scotched and wounded him that he has no capability left of enjoying anything? As he sat lonely with his pipe in his mouth he thought for a while that he would decline the invitation. The idea of selling Chowton Farm and of establishing himself at some Antipodes in which the name of Mary Masters should never have been heard, was growing upon him. Of what use would the friendship of Lord Rufford be to him at {{the other side of the}} globe? ...|$|E

I didn't realize that I should {{have to spend the}} last years of my life alone. And I meant, when I gave my wife a house, to have it the best in the city. I spared nothing on it, as you see, neither care nor money. I had the best architect I could find, and used the best material. And <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to me? Only a reminder--of what might have been. But I've got a boy, Hodder,--I don't know whether I've ever spoken of him to you--Preston. He's gone away, too. But I've always had the hope that he might come back and get decently married, and live, here. That's why I stay. I'll show you his picture." ...|$|E
60|$|The Savoy Passes are, in fact, {{the gist}} of the War; the {{insoluble}} problem for Don Philip and the French. By detours, by circuitous effort and happy accident, your troops may occasionally squeeze through: but without one secure road open behind them for supplies and recruitments, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> Battles there are, behind the Alps, on what we may call the STAGE itself of this Italian War-theatre; but the grand steady battle is that of France and Don Philip, struggling spasmodically, year after year, to get a road through the COULISSES or side-scenes,--namely, those Savoy Passes. They try it by this Pass and by that; Pass of Demont, Pass of Villa-Franca or Montalban (glorious for France, but futile), Pass of Exilles or Col d'Assiette (again glorious, again futile and fatal); sometimes by the way of Nice itself, and rocky mule-tracks overhanging the sea-edge (British Naval-cannon playing on them);--and can by no way do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> more {{pleasant}} than marching with the troops; but still I can't understand <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{possible for me}} to do." ...|$|R

60|$|Birkin turned away, {{looking out}} of the window and letting go his consciousness. After all, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> this? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> hopeless to keep it up. He would sit on till Ursula came home, then speak to her, then go away. He would not accept trouble at the hands of her father. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> all unnecessary, and he himself need not have {{provoked}} it.|$|R
6000|$|Begirt with desperate Trades' Unionism and Anarchic Mutiny, many an Industrial Law-ward, by and by, who has {{neglected}} to make laws and keep them, {{will be heard}} saying to himself: [...] "Why have I realised five hundred thousand pounds? I rose early and sat late, I toiled and moiled, and in the sweat of my brow and of my soul I strove to gain this money, that I might become conspicuous, and have some honour among my fellow-creatures. I wanted them to honour me, to love me. The money is here, earned with my best lifeblood: but the honour? I am encircled with squalor, with hunger, rage, and sooty desperation. Not honoured, hardly even envied; only fools and the flunky-species so much as envy me. I am conspicuous,--as a mark for curses and brickbats. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> My five hundred scalps hang here in my wigwam: would to Heaven I had sought something else than the scalps; would to Heaven I had been a Christian Fighter, not a Chactaw one! To have ruled and fought not in a Mammonish but in a Godlike spirit; {{to have had the}} hearts of the people bless me, as a true ruler and captain of my people; to have felt my own heart bless me, and that God above instead of Mammon below was blessing me,--this had been something. Out of my sight, ye beggarly five hundred scalps of banker's-thousands: I will try for something other, or account my life a tragical futility!" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{the thing}} which all men have to ask themselves; which we too have to ask, and answer. This wild man felt it to be of {{infinite}} moment; all other things of no moment whatever in comparison. The jargon of argumentative Greek Sects, vague traditions of Jews, the stupid routine of Arab Idolatry: {{there was no answer}} in these. A Hero, as I repeat, has this first distinction, which indeed we may call first and last, the Alpha and Omega of his whole Heroism, That he looks through the shows of things into things. Use and wont, respectable hearsay, respectable formula: all these are good, or are not good. There is something behind and beyond all these, which all these must correspond with, be the image of, or they are--Idolatries; [...] "bits of black wood pretending to be God;" [...] to the earnest soul a mockery and abomination. Idolatries never so gilded, waited on by heads of the Koreish, will do nothing for this man. Though all men walk by them, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> The great Reality stands glaring there upon him. He there has to answer it, or perish miserably. Now, even now, or else through all Eternity never! Answer it; thou must find an answer.--Ambition? What could all Arabia do for this man; with the crown of Greek Heraclius, of Persian Chosroes, and all crowns in the Earth;--what could they all do for him? It was not of the Earth he wanted to hear tell; it was of the Heaven above and of the Hell beneath. All crowns and sovereignties whatsoever, where would they in a few brief years be? To be Sheik of Mecca or Arabia, and have a bit of gilt wood put into your hand,--will that be one's salvation? I decidedly think, not. We will leave it altogether, this impostor hypothesis, as not credible; not very tolerable even, worthy chiefly of dismissal by us.|$|E
5000|$|People hate America, and the Islamist {{movements}} {{feel their}} hatred and their impotence. Ramming America {{has become the}} shortest road to fame and leadership among the Arabs and Muslims. But <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> if you destroy one of your enemy’s buildings, and he destroys one of your countries? <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> if you kill one of his people, and he kills a thousand of yours? ...

3000|$|<b>What’s</b> <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> different… <b>it</b> allowed {{people to}} sort of sit back and go well this isn’t how lectures usually run. So it did capture everyone’s {{attention}} straight away. (Student 1) [...]...|$|R
60|$|As for me, I was dazed. Here was I, under sentence, after a farce {{of a trial}} wherein I {{was denied}} not only my right of trial by jury, but my right to plead guilty or not guilty. Another thing my fathers had fought for flashed through my brain--habeas corpus. I'd show them. But when I asked for a lawyer, I was laughed at. Habeas corpus was all right, but of <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> to me when I could {{communicate}} with no one outside the jail? But I'd show them. They couldn't keep me in jail forever. Just wait till I got out, that was all. I'd make them sit up. I knew something about the law and my own rights, and I'd expose their maladministration of justice. Visions of damage suits and sensational newspaper headlines were dancing before my eyes when the jailers came in and began hustling us out into the main office.|$|R
60|$|With {{reference}} to virtues and vices {{in a state}} of nature, Hobbes is wrong in declaring that man in this state is vicious, as not knowing virtue. He is not vicious, for the reason that he does not know <b>what</b> being <b>good</b> <b>is.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not development of enlightenment nor the restrictions of law, but the calm of the passions and ignorance of vice, which keep them from doing ill. Tanto plus in illis profitcit vitiorum ignoratio, quam in his cognitio virtutis.|$|R
5000|$|Suppose {{a brother}} or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, [...] "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed", but does nothing about his {{physical}} needs, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> In the same way, faith by itself, {{if it is not}} accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, [...] "You have faith; I have deeds." [...] Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.|$|E
5000|$|Science {{journalist}} John Horgan {{has expressed}} this {{view in the}} book The End of Science 1996. He wrote that a certain pervasive model within holistic science, self-organized criticality, for example, [...] "is not really a theory at all. Like punctuated equilibrium, self-organized criticality is merely a description, one of many, of the random fluctuations, the noise, permeating nature." [...] By the theorists' own admissions, he said, such a model [...] "can generate neither specific predictions about nature nor meaningful insights. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> then?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010-2011, {{the club}} was deemed [...] "too expensive" [...] by the National President Jafar Hilali, who wrote in Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace [...] "I ask myself a simple question. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to keep a {{training}} center with a budget of € 2.5 million, equal to three-quarters of the clubs in National?"(translated). In case of merger with Football Club de Mulhouse, the training center would have remained in Strasbourg but the club have played in Mulhouse. After {{the announcement of the}} bankruptcy filing, the players were free to choose their future course.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be a man!" [...] said I. [...] "You {{are scared}} {{out of your}} wits! <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> {{religion}} if <b>it</b> collapses under calamity?

50|$|Socrates uses {{a medical}} analogy to help define goodness: If eyes can be {{improved}} by adding sight to them, then a boys' character {{can be improved}} by adding goodness to it. As knowledge of what sight <b>is</b> necessary before <b>it</b> can <b>be</b> considered as an improvement, so too <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessary to have knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> before <b>it</b> <b>is</b> used to improve a character. Rather than try to define what the whole of goodness <b>is,</b> Socrates thinks <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> easier to define an aspect of goodness that is relevant to the question: bravery.|$|R
50|$|If {{the duties}} of the {{individual}} cannot make him realize the ultimate purpose of the same, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> if he belongs to the highest order bestowed with the greatest privileges. Consider a brahman diligently offering his prayers on a daily basis, totally immersed in the rituals that traditions and customs dictate. The class of brahman, according to the Smriti, was created to act as a mediator/representative between the rest of the populace and their beliefs, performing the rituals, on their behalf, for the greater good of the society. The class was to bring people closer, in the name of traditions, rituals, customs, and above all, belief.|$|E
5000|$|If {{anyone would}} come after me, he must deny himself {{and take up}} his cross and follow me. For whoever wants {{to save his life}} (or soul) will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in {{exchange}} for his soul? If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels. (34-38) ...|$|E
5000|$|Encasing {{the lone}} {{fortress}} from all sides, Zhuge Liang sent Jin Xiang, {{a friend of}} Hao Zhao, to convince the latter to betray Wei, but Jin was met with a stern refusal. Hao Zhao announced he would die defending the citadel, and asked the besiegers to attack. Yet, the Shu regent again sent his lobbyist to soften the defender. [...] "Our armies are enormous while you only have a tiny force, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to perish for nothing?" [...] said Jin Xiang. This time, however, Hao Zhao fitted an arrow and replied [...] "What I said earlier remains solid. As I know you, my arrow doesn't." [...] Upon hearing this, the attack began.|$|E
60|$|He well knew {{himself to}} be dying; but some think, {{expected}} that the end {{might be a little}} farther off. There is a grand simplicity of stoicism in him; coming as if by nature, or by long SECOND-nature; finely unconscious of itself, and finding nothing of peculiar in this new trial laid on it. From of old, Life has been infinitely contemptible to him. In death, I think, he has neither fear nor hope. Atheism, truly, he never could abide: to him, as to all of us, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> flatly inconceivable that intellect, moral emotion, could have been put into HIM by an Entity that had none of its own. But there, pretty much, his Theism seems to have stopped. Instinctively, too, he believed, no man more firmly, that Right alone has ultimately any strength in this world: ultimately, yes;--but for him and his poor brief interests, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> Hope for himself in Divine Justice, in Divine Providence, I think he had not practically any; that the unfathomable Demiurgus should concern himself with such a set of paltry ill-given animalcules as oneself and mankind are, this also, as we have often noticed, is in the main incredible to him.|$|R
60|$|In {{the study}} of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>Good,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very {{convenient}} to make a rough division of our subject into general and particular. There are first the interests and problems that affect us all collectively, {{in which we have}} a common concern and from which no one may legitimately seek exemption; of these interests and problems we may fairly say every man should do so and so, or so and so, or the law should be so and so, or so and so; and secondly there are those other problems in which individual difference and the interplay of one or two individualities is predominant. This is of course no hard and fast classification, but it gives a method of approach. We can begin with the generalized person in ourselves and end with individuality.|$|R
5000|$|Intrinsically, {{the book}} has small merit, except in {{as far as it}} {{presents}} and describes facts witnessed by the author. Even these are not always faithfully reported. <b>It</b> might <b>be</b> called a controversial document because of its violent partiality and hostility. It does not notice mitigating circumstances, and ignores <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> when <b>it</b> does not suit the author.|$|R
