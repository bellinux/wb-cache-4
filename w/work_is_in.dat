5|$|Reger's Hebbel Requiem {{is in one}} movement. It {{follows the}} overall form of the narrated poem, but with variations, {{resulting}} in a structure of different moods. The beginning is recalled {{in the middle and}} at the end. The following table is based on the score and on an analysis by Katherine FitzGibbon. The translation of the incipits is given as in the liner notes of the 2009 recording in the translation by Richard Stokes. The four-part SATB chorus is often divided. The <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> D minor and common time. The tempo marking is Molto sostenuto, and is sustained with only slight modifications (stringendo and ritardando) until the most dramatic section, marked Più mosso (faster) and later Allegro, returning to the initial tempo for the conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{philosophy}} {{and principles of}} Tulsidas are found across his works, and are especially outlined in the dialogue between Kakbhushundi and Garuda in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas' doctrine {{has been described as}} an assimilation and reconciliation of the diverse tenets and cultures of Hinduism. At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that his <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> accordance with various scriptures – the Puranas, Vedas, Upavedas, Tantra and Smriti. Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas elaborates on Tulsidas' Lokmangal as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world littérateur.|$|E
5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), a {{by-product}} of the composer's score for Scott of the Antarctic, has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood {{sense of the term}} nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.|$|E

25|$|The {{first use}} in a {{published}} <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> William Gunn's An Inquiry into the Origin and Influence of Gothic Architecture (London 1819).

25|$|The form of {{the symphony}} is startlingly original. Since the time of Joseph Haydn, a {{movement}} in a symphony would typically be unified by an approximately constant tempo and would attain variety by use of contrasting themes in different keys. Sibelius turned this scheme on its head. The symphony is unified by the key of C (every significant passage in the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> C major or C minor), and variety is achieved by an almost constantly changing tempo, {{as well as by}} contrasts of mode, articulation and texture.|$|E

Initial designs were created by KSS Design Group back in 2008, but long delays allowed for major changes to the scheme by a different company.|$|E
