5000|$|Early {{production}} [...] "B-47E-Is" [...] {{also known}} featured J47-GE-25 turbojets with 5970 lbf kN thrust, {{but they were}} quickly changed to J47-GE-25A engines, which featured a significant improvement {{in the form of}} <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection.</b> This was a scheme in which a water-methanol mix was dumped into the engines at takeoff, increasing mass flow and so temporarily kicking the thrust up to 7200 lbf kN. Methanol was apparently added to the water as an anti-freezing agent. The engines left a trail of black smoke behind them when <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection</b> was on.|$|E
50|$|The {{second stage}} of each turbine drove a {{planetary}} reduction gearbox, mated to a central driving unit pirated from the Kharkov-L1. The turbines were fitted with a <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|The Astafan III {{used the}} Astazou XVI core and a cooled turbine. The dry thrust rating at takeoff was 7.829 kN, and with <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection,</b> thrust rose to 8.429 kN ( [...] lbf).|$|E
5000|$|The basic Astafan II {{received}} its French certification in August 1972. Early Astafan IIs were rated for approximately 6.984 kN ( [...] lbf) dry thrust at takeoff power, or 7.495 kN ( [...] lbf) with <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection.</b>|$|E
5000|$|First {{run as a}} {{prototype}} in 1969, and first flown in 1971, the Astafan I {{was derived from the}} core of the Astazou XIV turboshaft. It was capable of outputting 6.072 kN ( [...] lbf) of dry thrust at takeoff power, or 6.517 kN ( [...] lbf) of thrust with <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection.</b>|$|E
50|$|The final versions, P, R and T, {{featured}} a two-speed supercharger for better allround performance. This {{allowed it to}} generate 1,000 PS at sea level as in the C/D models, but improved altitude performance considerably, delivering 940 PS at 4000 m. The R-2 subtype added MW 50 <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection</b> for added low-altitude performance, boosting power to 1,200 PS at 2,600 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|Valiant B.1: 39 pure bomber variants, {{including}} five pre-production Type 674s, which were powered by Avon RA.14 engines {{with the same}} 9,500 lbf (42 kN) thrust each as the earlier Avon 201 and 34 Type 706 full-production aircraft, powered by Avon RA.28 204 or 205 engines with 10,500 lbf (47 kN) thrust each, longer tailpipes, and <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection</b> for takeoff boost power.|$|E
5000|$|The Jetstream 31s {{were divided}} into two groups based on design features: 6 Jetstreams were {{equipped}} with Garrett turboprops with Automatic Power Reserve (which came from JetStream International, a USAir commuter. These were the ones with tail numbers N8xxJS), and the remaining 4 Jetstreams were equipped with Garrett turboprops with <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection.</b> After Amtran's acquisition of Chicago Express in 1999, the Jetstreams were [...] "retired" [...] and most found homes with other (mostly corporate) operators. One aircraft was written-off during an engine run-up immediately prior to its resale to another operator when one propeller struck a ground power unit.|$|E
50|$|One of the then-innovative {{features}} {{to be used}} by the V-1000 was its adoption of the Rolls-Royce Conway engine, the world's first turbofan engine. During takeoff, the Conway's power was to have been boosted by <b>water-methanol</b> <b>injection,</b> of which the aircraft was to carry 550 gallons within the inner wing root. Additionally, uprated versions of the Conway engine were under development, which would have been available for use on the V-1000. The flying controls of the wing consisted of multiple flaps, the inner set of which being single-slotted and the outer pair being double-slotted, two-section independently operated ailerons, and multi-section dive brakes set across various locations of the upper and lower wing surfaces. The tail surfaces were conventional and adopted a similar shape to that used for the wing; the tailplanes had a pronounced dihedral to keep them clear of the jet exhaust. The elevators were split into four separate sections while the rudder was divided into three separately-controlled pieces.|$|E
