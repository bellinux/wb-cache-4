50|$|The {{process was}} found unsatisfactory, {{perhaps because of}} {{difficulties}} in obtaining sufficient water supply, and was abandoned later in the 1890s. The wash may have been abandoned after an artesian bore was sunk at Ilfracombe in c.1897 and a <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> established soon after. Other steam-driven scouring works, popular in the early 1890s, had {{by the end of}} the decade been rendered obsolete by the establishment of a wide-ranging network of large, mechanised <b>wool</b> <b>scours</b> (e.g. the Blackall Woolscour). Over time the track and trolleys were removed to sugar mills and the <b>wool</b> <b>scours</b> at Cramsie (near Longreach) and Ilfracombe.|$|R

40|$|Restrictions on the {{disposal}} of agricultural effluents to the waterway means that alternative land based outlets are required in New Zealand. Willow, as a short forest rotation, represents a significant land use that could produce a high dry matter and benefit from the application of effluent irrigation. However, {{there has been little}} information on the effect of effluent irrigation on the growth of willow and the removal of nutrients. In order to assess the effects of dairy, piggery and <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluents on willow growth, a greenhouse experiment was established using the Manawatu sandy fine loam soil. A complete nutrient solution and nutrient - free tap water treatments were also included in addition to the effluent treatments. The design of the experiment was a 5 x 2 factorial combination of treatments with four replications in randomized blocks. Two factors (effluents and irrigation rates) each with 5 levels were examined, the levels of irrigation were 12. 5 mm, 25 mm, 37. 5 mm, 50 mm and 62. 5 mm per fortnight. The plant growth, production and macro-nutrients accumulation, and the soil pH, electrical conductivity, and total N, P and cations were monitored Irrigation with effluents affected the growth of willow cutting. The piggery and dairy effluent irrigation increased the willow growth and nutrient accumulation followed the increase in DM yield. The piggery and dairy irrigation accounted for 32 % and 18 % increase in total DM yield over tap water; while the <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent resulted in 17 % decrease in comparison with tap water. Irrigation with dairy, piggery and <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluents onto the Manawatu fine sandy loam soil, caused a significant increase in pH and EC. The significant change in pH and EC was attributed to the soluble salts in these effluents, especially K in the <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent. The recovery of N from these effluents was very small and was less than that of P and K in soil. Chemical analysis of willow, treated with dairy, piggery and <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluents up to 8 weeks, showed a relatively high concentration of N, P and K in leaf, and had a very high K and a very low Mg concentration in leaf with <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent irrigation. However, the efficiency of the N, P and K nutrient accumulated by willow was inversely related to the concentration of these effluents and the DM yield of willow cutting was positively related to the irrigation rates. It was evident that willow cutting was too young to require a large quantity of nutrients at the early growth stage and there was a risk of nutrient loss with increasing irrigation rate. The application of <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent caused a very high pH and EC, and the willow cutting growth decreased at > 37. 5 mm/fortnight irrigation rates. The reasons for the detrimental effects of <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> effluent on soil properties and willow growth need to be investigated further. The results suggested {{that it is possible to}} enhance the willow growth and adjust the soil fertility by application of dairy and piggery effluents irrigation...|$|R

50|$|Originally {{part of the}} {{township}} of Cleveland, early industry included a brickworks established by James Maskell on the eastern bank of Hilliards Creek in 1852 and fellmongery (<b>wool</b> <b>scour)</b> owned by a Thomas Blackett Stephens until the early 1860s. Joseph Clark ran cattle on Ormiston from 1855 until he relinquished the lease in 1858.|$|R
50|$|Despite an {{outbreak}} of scab in 1853 which caused the loss of 17,000 sheep, the property prospered during this early period as a successful sheep run. A <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> and pressing plant were established on the Boyne River, allowing wool to be cleaned and baled before being backloaded by teamsters who arrived with supplies. This continued until the early 1890s when, due {{to the spread of}} spear grass, the owners were forced to dispose of the sheep and restock with cattle.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{fellmongering}} {{appears in the}} early 1850s in the Moreton Bay region. A different process to <b>wool</b> <b>scouring,</b> fellmongering processed sheepskins in order to remove the wool in preparation for tanning. The wool was washed and dried, and the skins were processed into leather.|$|E
50|$|The falls {{was named}} after Charles Coopey, who once owned the land {{adjacent}} to the falls.

50|$|The fellmongery {{operation}} (which {{also included}} a <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> and slaughteryard) operated until the early 1920s. The land was transferred to Jessie Ferguson by 1932, followed by George McLeod Ferguson in 1951. Allotment 4 was subdivided into Lots 1 and 2 in 1969, and the lots resumed by the Redland Shire Council for park and recreation purposes in 1970 and 1975 respectively. The site appears {{not to have been}} used for any further industry or development, with Fellmonger Park now being at the location of the site.|$|R

50|$|The plant, {{offered for}} sale in 1913, was {{acquired}} by Western Queensland Meat Export Company. The Melbourne-based company which already owned a boiling down works and a <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> in Barcaldine made progressive improvements and modifications to the machinery {{to increase the efficiency}} of the scour and therefore its capacity, more than doubling the 1913 output by 1918 to 7640 bales, the largest output in its history. The years of peak production were 1916 to 1920. Business declined in the 1920s with other scours in the region closing temporarily or permanently. The general management of the scour was overseen by Allan Martin Ferguson from 1913 until his death in 1933. Members of the Ferguson family continued to manage the complex until 1957.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wool</b> <b>scouring,</b> one of {{the methods}} for {{cleaning}} impurities from wool after shearing, began {{as an alternative to}} sheep washing in Australia (e.g. Beaconsfield Station Sheep Wash) in the 1840s and had almost replaced it by the 1890s [...] Initially scouring was done by manual methods such as pot and stick or hand box, but by the early 1890s steam driven mechanised scouring dominated the industry.|$|E
50|$|It {{was some}} 30 {{years before the}} site was again {{proposed}} {{for use as a}} fellmongery. Thomas Alford obtained a permit from the Cleveland Divisional Board in July 1894 to erect a <b>wool</b> <b>scouring</b> and fellmongering works on allotment 4 of section 100, the site of Stephens' earlier fellmongery. Although situated on the site of Stephens' earlier fellmongery, just a small section of his original holdings were taken up by Alford.|$|E

25|$|At {{the mill}} the <b>wool</b> is <b>scoured</b> in a {{detergent}} {{to remove grease}} (the yolk) and impurities. This is done mechanically in the opening machine. Vegetable matter can be removed chemically using sulphuric acid (carbonising). Washing uses a solution of soap and sodium carbonate. The wool is oiled before carding or combing.|$|R
50|$|Following {{damage caused}} by a {{windstorm}} in 1933 the rear verandah was enclosed and extended and the kitchen built in its present location. At about this time the originally corrugated iron gabled roof was also replaced by a corrugated iron hipped roof. In about 1942 an air raid shelter was excavated {{to the east of}} the rear of the house, but there is now no clear above ground evidence of this feature. Another notable feature of the house is the use of laced hoop iron to provide screening for the verandah. The hoop iron was originally used at the <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> to bind <b>wool</b> bale packs and wool bales. Townspeople found the material ideal to create shaded semi-enclosed verandahs. The technique was once seen on most Ilfracombe houses, but now survives only at the Langenbaker house.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{textiles}} briefly {{returned to}} Addingham and Low Mill {{in the form}} of a Norwegian-based company, Straum (UK), who started production of <b>scoured</b> <b>wool,</b> but this business closed in 2002.|$|R
50|$|Crude lanolin {{constitutes}} about 5-25%of {{the weight}} of freshly shorn wool. The wool from one Merino sheep will produce about 250-300ml of recoverable wool grease. Lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special <b>wool</b> <b>scouring</b> detergent to remove dirt, wool grease (crude lanolin), suint (sweat salts), and anything else stuck to the wool. The wool grease is continuously removed during this washing process by centrifuge separators, which concentrate it into a wax-like substance melting at approximately 38°C (100°F).|$|E

40|$|A {{convenient}} {{method for}} measuring the clean colour (Y and Y-Z) and photostability Δ(Y-Z) of small samples of fleece wool (0. 5 g) is described. <b>Scoured</b> <b>wool</b> samples are compressed to a constant density in disposable polymethyl methacrylate spectrophotometer cells and the wool colour is measured using a standard textile laboratory reflectance spectrophotometer. Packing <b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> into cells ensures that the irradiated fibre surface is robust and individual fibres are unable to move relative to one another during irradiation and measurement. A UVB (280 – 320 nm) source was used to ensure all samples regardless of initial yellowness were yellowed following exposure and photobleaching was avoided. An apparatus capable of irradiating up to 48 <b>scoured</b> <b>wool</b> samples in one batch is described. The precision of photostability measurements was assessed and the relative error in Δ(Y-Z) was 5. 7 %. An initial study on 75 fleece wool samples with a high range of initial yellowness showed a moderate linear correlation (R 2 = 0. 68) between initial yellowness and Δ(Y-Z). <br /...|$|R
50|$|Teamsters or {{carriers}} as {{they were}} sometimes known, provided an essential service of carrying goods and stock across trackless country to the new stations of western Queensland. The first teamsters into a new country were limited {{to the use of}} drays, which were more manoeuvrable than wagons. Among the essential equipment of these first teamsters were axes to clear tracks of land, picks and shovels to make creek crossings and a piece of brightly coloured rag. The rag was tied to a wheel so that its revolutions could be easily counted. These rough measurements of distance gave carriers a guide for cartage charges and provided a bush standard which remained in use until the introduction of surveyors and roadmakers. Ilfracombe provided work for teamsters up until a branch railway line was opened from Jericho to Blackall in 1908. At this time many teamsters traded in their horse and ox and replaced them with motor lorries. Others hung up their reins and looked for work with the railways or at the <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> which opened in Ilfracombe in 1898.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} one of the first {{established}} along Cooper Creek, taken up in 1871 by John Conrick. Conrick and five companions, all under the age of 21, overlanded a herd of about 1,000 cattle to the property from Warrnambool to stock the station. The Conrick family later took up the Chasleton lease and remained on the station for the next 83 years. From 1892 to 1934 the property was running mostly sheep with only a few cattle. Remnants of fences and an old <b>wool</b> <b>scour</b> can still be found on the property. At one point a flock of 46,000 head of sheep were grazing on the property resulting in the land collapsing and the station being vacated for a time. In the late 1940s the Tancred brothers invested in the company with Harry Tancred later appointed as the chairman of directors. Shortly afterward the Lake Pure lease was acquired. Cattle grazing, which had been confined to the channels and wetlands, was expanded after bores were sunk in the plains away from the channel country allowing stock to roam further. The entire area was struck by drought in 1946 with many cattle dying and properties destocking.|$|R
