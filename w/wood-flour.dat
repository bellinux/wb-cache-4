40|$|ABSTRACT: Composites of wood in a {{thermoplastic}} ma-trix (woodâ€“plastic composites) {{are considered}} a low main-tenance solution to using wood in outdoor applications. Knowledge of moisture uptake and transport properties would be useful in estimating moisture-related effects such as fungal attack and loss of mechanical strength. Our objectives were to determine how material parameters and their interactions affect the moisture uptake and transport properties of injection-molded composites of <b>wood-flour</b> and polypropylene and to compare two different methods of measuring moisture uptake and transport. A two-level, full-factorial design was used to investigate the effects and interactions of <b>wood-flour</b> content, <b>wood-flour</b> particle size, coupling agent, and surface removal on moisture uptake and transport of the composites. Sorption and dif-fusion experiments were performed at 208 C and 65 or 85 % relative humidity {{as well as in}} water, and diffusion coeffi-cients were determined. The <b>wood-flour</b> content had the largest influence of all parameters on moisture uptake and transport properties. Many significant interactions between the variables were also found. The interaction between <b>wood-flour</b> content and surface treatment was often the largest. The diffusion coefficients derived from the diffu-sion experiments were different from those derived from the sorption experiments, suggesting that different mecha...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop filled polymer {{composites}} and blends from sustainable resources, the primary objective {{that needs to be}} considered {{is the nature of the}} interface between the natural filler and the polymer matrix. A fundamental understanding of filler-filler interactions and the filler-matrix interface is critical to the design and manufacture of biopolymer composite materials and the interfacial properties of such materials. The improvements achieved can lead to increase market share of such materials in more demanding applications. The early part of this thesis focuses on the efficacy of lignocellulosic fillers like <b>wood-flour</b> as a low-cost filler in Poly(lactic) acid (PLA) <b>wood-flour</b> biocomposites. A primary emphasis is on evaluating the effect of <b>wood-flour</b> on the mechanical, impact and thermal performance of the resulting biocomposites. The early part of this thesis also investigates the role that surface modification can play in improving interfacial interactions between PLA and <b>wood-flour.</b> The hydrophilic nature of lignocellulosic fillers introduces challenges in developing biopolymer composites with superior mechanical and thermal performance. Hence, a critical part of materials design for developing biopolymer composites is to deploy surface modification strategies to overcome the hydrophilic nature of lignocellulosic fibres. The implementation of surface modification through a variety of wet and dry techniques and a combination of both, do not always lead to improvements in interfacial adhesion. This lack of effect is primarily attributed to the heterogeneous structure and variation in the chemical composition of lignocellulosic fibres, which can vary from species to species for different varieties of biomass sources. In order to address the technical challenges, this thesis focuses more closely on the role of surface modification. Initially, surface modification of the filler or polymer matrix is investigated and compared. In the middle chapters, the role of pre-treatment through chemical (alkaline) or physical processes (plasma) is conducted in conjunction with chemical treatment in order to evaluate the influence on the practical adhesion at a macro level. And finally, the influence of pre-treatment and chemical modification is assessed on a micro level for their effect on the PLA composites themselves. The interfacial properties of PLA/wood-flour composites were evaluated using two strategies: the first approach evaluated chemical modification of <b>wood-flour</b> using methylene diphenyl isocyanate (MDI), whilst the second strategy focused on the physical modification of PLA using polyethylene acrylic acid (PEAA) as an impact modifier. MDI was found to improve the interfacial adhesion between PLA and <b>wood-flour</b> and this was confirmed by Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA). The analysis indicated that MDI was present at the interface between PLA and <b>wood-flour</b> but also distributed to some degree within the PLA matrix. In comparison, PEAA was found to lower the tensile strength of the biocomposites but increased the impact performance. The enhancement in impact performance was due to the formation of a separate phase observed within the PLA matrix, which comprised spherical domains. The presence of these domains impeded crack propagation, resulting in higher impact strength. The heterogeneous nature of lignocellulosic materials and their varying chemical composition, contribute to their reduced surface functionality. In an effort to promote increased surface functionality, a pre-treatment process was used in conjunction with chemical modification. A macro-scale method was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of silane modification performed in conjunction with alkaline pre-treatment on the surface chemical and physical characteristics of a model wood substrate. Three silanes with different chemical end groups were used to modify the surface of wood. PLA film was bonded to the model wood surface using a melt press and the level of practical adhesion was assessed by peel adhesion testing. Surface characterisation studies proved that alkaline pre-treatment and subsequent chemical modification with an amino silane produced the highest peel fracture energy following peel adhesion. The macro scale, peel adhesion method for evaluating the effectiveness of different surface modification techniques was used to assess the suitability of plasma techniques for modifying the surfaces of a model wood substrate. Surface treatment using plasma based techniques has the potential to be a more benign approach to activate the surfaces of lignocellulosic substrates. Low-pressure plasma treatment was conducted on pinewood veneers using a custom built 13. 5 MHz Inductively Coupled Plasma Chamber. A dual plasma pre-treatment process that involved a combination of continuous wave and pulse mode was found to be more conducive to optimising surface active groups. The results of XPS analyses showed that plasma treatment based on a dual process was more effect than a single process plasma treatment due to the higher levels of oxygen relative to carbon (O/C) and O functional groups. The main peaks that proved the benefits of the dual plasma process was the higher atomic ratio of oxygen, which was attributed to a higher incidence of surface hydroxyl groups. Plasma treatment alone of the wood veneer produced a more homogeneous surface morphology, compared to unmodified wood veneer. The appearance of nano-like nodules were more even in height and furthermore, evenly distributed across the wood veneer surface. AFM was successfully used to define the surface morphology that was created following plasma treatment and chemical grafting using an amino silane and two polyethyleneimines with different molecular weight. AFM also showed that grafting with the amino silane did not alter the surface morphology. AFM phase imaging showed variations in PEI grafting onto plasma modified wood veneer. Peel adhesion studies showed that plasma pre-treatment combined with chemical modification (ex-situ) lead to significant enhancements in the fracture energies of wood-PLA laminates that were superior to those following low-pressure plasma treatment alone. The findings of the macro scale studies were used to prepare PLA based composites and evaluate the effect on the mechanical and thermal performance. PLA biocomposites were produced from <b>wood-flour</b> subjected to pre-treatment using alkaline treatment or low-pressure plasma and then chemically modified (ex-situ) using an amino silane and two polyethyleneimines. A micro extruder was used to compound PLA <b>wood-flour</b> formulations and mini injection moulder was used to prepare sample test bars. The results of mechanical testing showed that pre-treatment using a low-pressure plasma dual process (CW+P) combined with chemical modification (ex-situ) produced composites with enhancements in the flexural and impact properties of the resulting composites. Low-pressure plasma treatment of <b>wood-flour</b> alone did not enhance the mechanical and impact performance, compared to untreated <b>wood-flour</b> and <b>wood-flour</b> subjected to alkaline treatment. DMA testing also showed the benefits of using low-pressure plasma treatment combined with chemical treatment, due to enhanced interfacial properties of the resulting biocomposites. Low-pressure plasma treatment of lignocellulosic fibre/fillers is a useful approach and an alternative to more conventional chemical pre-treatment processes including alkaline treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of {{preparing}} superfine <b>wood-flour</b> with physical method, when the size of <b>wood-flour</b> particle reaches to the corresponding level, a single wood cell will be destroyed. In {{the process of}} analyzing micro-nano wood-flourâ€™s cutting power, the process of cell disruption of the wood cell needs to be computed. Based on the relevant theory of finite element and structural mechanics, this article builds a structure mode of 12 lever hexagon truss model to simulate the cellular structure. There are 6 levers outside to simulate the cell and 6 levers inside to simulate the internal pressure. This establishes a single cell stress model to analyze its stress. It can be obtained that when {{the size of the}} force acting on the node reaches the unit force, the minimum tensile stress of the bar element is bigger than the macroscopic tensile strength of the wood. According to the structural characteristics of the cell wall, this paper compares the tensile stress along the grain of the bar element with the tradition cutting stress. Using tensile strength as the criteria to test the rupture failure of Cryptomeria fortunei cell, the wood cellâ€™s disruption force can be concluded. When preparing superfine <b>wood-flour</b> with Cryptomeria fortunei as experimental raw materials, the calculated results of applying the traditional cutting theory to calculate the cutting force has proved the analysis structure of Cryptomeria cell micromechanics with the method of finite element and structural mechanics, {{so that it can be}} concluded that certain cutting force can make Cryptomeria fortunei cells disruption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Compatibilization between polypropylene(PP) and <b>wood-flour</b> was {{achieved}} by means of direct reactive extrusion of glycidyl methacrylate(GMA), PP, <b>wood-flour,</b> and other additives. Impact cracking surfaces of the PP/wood-flour composites(WPCs) was observed via scanning electron microscope(SEM), and mechanical properties of the WPCs were tested. The effect of comonomer styrene(St) and antioxygen triphenyl phosphite(TPP) on the reactive compatibilization was also evaluated. Experimental {{results indicated that the}} anchoring strength of interface in the composites was obviously strengthened after direct reactive extrusion. The tensile and flexural strength of the WPCs were obviously improved, but the elongation at break and notched impact strength slightly declined after reactive compatibilization by GMA and dicumyl peroxide(DCP). The addition of St and TPP improved the mechanical properties of the WPCs. At 1. 5 % of GMA, 0. 3 % of DCP, 1. 5 % of St and 1 % of TPP in the extrusion composition of WPC, the tensile strength, flexural strength, elongation at break and notched impact strength respectively increased by 39 %, 31 %, 28 % and 29 % comparing to those of the WPC without reactive extrusion...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{performance}} of fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites strongly depends on solid fiberâ€“matrix adhesion to allow stress transfer between the phases. Fiber surface modification with coupling agents is generally needed to induce bond formation between the fiber and the polymer. This {{study investigated the}} effects of coupling agentâ€™s functional monomer (acrylic acid vs. maleic anhydride) and base resin (polyethylene (PE) vs. polypropylene (PP)) types on the tensile and flexural properties of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) â€“wood-flour composites. The interfacial adhesion between wood flour and HDPE matrix was examined using environmental scanning electron microscope. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} types of functional monomer and base resin are important factors determining the effectiveness of functionalized coupling agents for HDPEâ€“ <b>wood-flour</b> composites. Maleic anhydride-functionalized polyolefins perform better than acrylic acid counterparts whereas PE-based maleated coupling agents are more effective than PP-based counterparts in improving the strength properties of HDPEâ€“wood-flour composites...|$|E

In this study, Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) were compounded with PVC, <b>wood-flour,</b> and foaming agent in an internal mixer. The wood flour amount was constant at 40 phr. For CNT and chemical foaming agent, different levels of 0, 1, 2 phr and 0, 3, 6 phr were considered respectively. The samples were foamed via batch process using a compression molding machine at 180 Â°C.

Also, the maximum tensile strength and modulus were increased by up to 20 % and 23 % respectivel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this study, {{effect of}} MAPE (maleic {{anhydride}} polyethylene) as the compatibilizer on the mechanical properties of <b>wood-flour</b> polyethylene composites {{has been investigated}} by using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). Composites were made at 25 % and 50 % by weight fiber contents and 1 % and 2 % compatibilizer respectively. Controls were also made at the same fiber contents without the compatibilizer. Static mechanical tests including tensile and bending tests were performed. Temperature scans in the range of- 110 to + 100 Â°C was also conducted. Results indicated improvements in the mechanical properties due to the compatibilizer addition. Storage modulus values {{were higher in the}} case of coupled composites especially at 50 % fiber loading. Glass transition was hard to detect in all composite systems while increasing fiber content slightly shifted alpha transition to higher temperatures. MAPE had negligible effects on the main transitions but the effect of fiber content on the intensity and temperature of alpha transition seemed to be proportional to the fiber content. Mechanical loss factor spectra showed that at 50 % fiber content, the compatibilizer caused a reduction in tan 8 values indicating less energy loss when the compatibilizer was present. 1...|$|E
40|$|The use of wood-derived fillers by the {{thermoplastic}} {{industry has}} been growing, fueled {{in part by the}} use of wood-fiberâ€“ thermoplastic composites by the construction industry. As a result, the durability of wood-fiberâ€“thermoplastic composites after ultraviolet exposure has become a concern. Samples of 100 % high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and HDPE filled with 50 % <b>wood-flour</b> (WF) were weathered in a xenon arc-type accelerated weathering apparatus for 2000 h. Changes in surface chemistry were studied using spectroscopic techniques. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to verify the occurrence of surface oxidation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to monitor the development of degradation products, such as carbonyl groups and vinyl groups, and to determine changes in HDPE crystallinity. The results indicate that surface oxidation occurred immediately after exposure for both the neat HDPE and WF/HDPE composites; the surface of the WF/HDPE composites was oxidized {{to a greater extent than}} that of the neat HDPE. This suggests that the addition of WF to the HDPE matrix results in more weather-related damage. The results also show that while neat HDPE may undergo crosslinking in the initial stages of accelerated weathering, WF may physically hinder the ability of HDPE to crosslink, resulting in the potential for HDPE chain scission to dominate in the initial weathering stage...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professor Steven Cramer; Pages: 149. Over the past decade, {{there has been a}} growing interest in the development of consumer and industrial products composed of wood fillers combined with thermoplastic resins. The use of wood flour as a reinforcing filler for thermoplastics has several benefits. Wood fillers have the advantage of being renewable, inexpensive, lightweight, and non- abrasive to processing equipment. Both materials can be obtained from post-consumer or post-industrial recycling sources. Little information is available concerning the engineering characteristics of wood- plastic composite panels. Recently. there has been an increasing interest in using this type of material for a variety of structural applications. To quantify the material performance, several different <b>wood-flour</b> thermoplastic formulations ranging from 0 % to 60 % wood filler content by weight were produced and tested according to the ASTM D 1037 standard for wood-based panels. A matched set of specimens underwent the accelerated aging process outlined in the standard. It was found that by increasing the ratio of wood filler, the material performance properties were altered. The modulus of elasticity and water absorption increased, while the coefficient of thermal expansion and ultimate stress values decreased. The aging process had very little effect on the 0 % wood filler content samples and decreased the material performance in some properties for the higher wood percentage panels. The results were compared with conventional wood-based panel products. Included were particleboard, hardboard, plywood, medium density fiberboard, and oriented. strandboard. Though the stiffness of wood-plastic composite panels were generally less than conventional wood-based products, many other material properties were similar...|$|E
40|$|Starch {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and easily {{obtained}} natural polymers, making it attractive as a potential bio-based alternative to synthetic polymers. The plasticisation of starch is complex due to the extensive hydrogen bonding between chains. This study shows that a simple quaternary ammonium salt combined with hydrogen bond donor (HBD) forms effective modifiers that produce flexible plastics with good mechanical properties that are comparable to some polyolefin plastics. Starch-based plastics can be formed by the same processes as current commercial plastics, giving similar mechanical strength to some polyolefin plastics. The processing conditions are shown to significantly affect the structure of the polymer which has a concomitant effect upon the mechanical and physical properties of the resulting plastic. Using a glycerol based modifier results in a totally sustainable and biodegradable material which can be formed by extrusion, pressing, vacuum forming and injection moulding. Most significantly, it is shown that these plastics are environmentally compatible, recyclable, bio-degradable and compostable. This study has demonstrated the optimisation of the parameters for a range of techniques that are currently used in processing this type of plastic. These include: temperature profiling for both compression moulding and extrusion, residence time in the extruder, drying time and pressing time. Glycerol/choline chloride is the plasticiser that was found to give optimal properties and has been used for most of this study. The optimum ratio is shown to be 1 : 3 by weight plasticiser: starch. In addition, five different systems of fillers have been added to the starch based plastics to study their effect on tensile strength and strain, glass transition temperature, viscoelasticity, crystallinity, morphology and rheology. The chemical changes have also been investigated after the addition of the five fillers which are eggshell, <b>wood-flour,</b> silk, zein and lignin. Furthermore, the fillers have an effect on stabilising water content in thermoplastic starch. Water uptake and water loss have been examined using thermogravimetric analysis, water absorption isotherms, water absorption capacity and contact angle. Finally, some applications have been presented for protecting these plastics from surrounding moisture...|$|E
