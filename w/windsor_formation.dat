40|$|The Seventy Mile Range Group is a Cambro-Ordovician, dominantly {{submarine}} volcano sedimentary succession {{that occurs}} within the Mount Windsor Subprovince of northern Queensland, Australia. Detailed facies {{analysis of the}} Mount <b>Windsor</b> <b>Formation</b> and Trooper Creek Formation, between Coronation homestead and Trooper Creek prospect (approximately 15 km strike length), has clarified the facies architecture {{in this part of}} the Seventy Mile Range Group. The rocks have been affected by regional greenschist facies metamorphism and deformation, and hydrothermal alteration is intense around VHMS deposits. The Mount <b>Windsor</b> <b>Formation</b> comprises associations of rhyolitic to dacitic autoclastic breccia and coherent facies, 100 - 500 m thick, which form submarine lavas, domes and syn-volcanic intrusions. The Mount <b>Windsor</b> <b>Formation</b> (300 - 3500 m thick) is conformably overlain by the Trooper Creek Formation (500 - 4000 m thick). The Trooper Creek Formation is divided into two members, the Kitchenrock Hill Member and the overlying Highway Member. The new stratigraphic scheme is based on mappable compositional and lithological variations which reflect changing provenance. The Kitchenrock Hill Member (90 - 110 m thick) includes rhyolitic to dacitic syn- and posteruptive volcaniclastic facies, minor syn-sedimentary intrusions and rare siltstone units. Some volcaniclastic units contain rounded clasts with geochemical and petrographic properties which suggest they were sourced from the Mount <b>Windsor</b> <b>Formation.</b> Rounded clasts were reworked prior to deposition and imply that the source areas were subaerial or shallow marine. The Highway Member comprises compositionally and texturally diverse volcano-sedimentary facies, including rhyolitic to basaltic lavas and intrusions, andesitic scoria- and bomb-rich breccia, dacitic to rhyolitic pumice breccia, and volcanic and non-volcanic sandstone and siltstone. The presence of turbidites, hyaloclastite and fossils within the Kitchenrock Hill Member and Highway Member suggest that the depositional setting for the Trooper Creek Formation was largely submarine and below storm wave base. The exception is in the upper part of the Highway Member at Trooper Creek prospect, where microbialites, gypsum molds, and traction current structures indicative of wave activity, collectively suggest a depositional environment above stonn wave base. The lithofacies exposed at Trooper Creek prospect suggest that shoaling of the succession occurred in response to construction of a small, submarine andesitic volcano which temporarily emerged above sea level. Growth of the edifice involved: (I) eruption of lava and intrusion of synsedimentary sills; (2) strombolian-style volcanism in a near-stonn-wave-base environment; (3) hydrovolcanic interactions above storm wave base and possibly subaerially; and (4) post-eruptive and possibly syn-eruptive degradation of the volcanic edifice. When subsidence due to compaction and/or tectonism outpaced accumulation, the depositional environment returned to below storm wave base. Syn-eruptive pumiceous and crystal-rich sediment gravity flow deposits in the Trooper Creek Formation were sourced from rhyolitic to dacitic eruptions at volcanic centres which are either; located outside the study area, not exposed, or not preserved. The abundance of pyroclasts (principally pumice, shards and crystals) reflects the importance of explosive magmatic and/or phreatomagmatic eruptions, and suggests that the source vents were in shallow water or subaerial settings. Some key units may be traceable for over 30 km, and are an important framework for exploration within the Trooper Creek Formation. The Highway Member includes the products of intrabasinal, non-explosive silicic to intermediate eruptions that formed lava- and intrusion-dominated volcanic centres. The volcanic centres are: (1) dominated by syn-sedimentary sills and cryptodomes; (2) comprise thick (> 5 km) lava complexes; or (3) form lava-lobe hyaloclastite domes, up to 500 m thick and at least 1. 5 km long. The Cu-Au-rich Highway-Reward massive sulfide deposit is hosted by one small syn-sedimentary intrusion-dominated volcanic centre. Detailed mapping of contact relationships and phenocryst populations suggest the presence of more than thitteen distinct porphyritic units in a volume of I x I x 0. 5 km.

40|$|The Mount Windsor subprovince is an {{important}} relic of Upper Cambrian to Lower Ordovician sedimenta-tion and volcanism inthe {{northern part of the}} Tasman orogenic zone. Volcanic-hosted massive sulfide mineral-ization occurs at several stratigraphic horizons within the volcano-sedimentary p ckage and one major mine is operational within the belt. Major and trace element data and Nd isotope ratios are presented for the least altered coherent units from the three major volcanic-bearing formations inthe Mount Windsor subprovince. The data are used to discriminate four major phases of volcanism and related intrusive activity derived from three isotopically discrete sources and to assess the geodynamic setting in which the volcanism occurred. The earliest phase of mafic volcanism has minor and trace element characteristics suggesting analkaline intraplate or rift association a d it was probably produced by partial melting of attenuated subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The overlying Mount <b>Windsor</b> <b>Formation</b> silicic volcanics have Nd isotope characteristics (eNd(480 Ma) =- 4. 7 to- 12. 8) that suggest they were produced by partial melting of underlying Precambrian ernstal rocks. Marie voleanies of the overlying Trooper Creek Formation include a low TiO 2 suite and a high TiO 2 suite with a range of distinguishing chemical characteristics butsimilar Nd isotope ratios (â€¢sd(480 Ma / = 3. 8 - 2. 3), which indicate derivation from relatively depleted asthenospherie mantle variably modified b...|$|E

40|$|The Bay St. George subbasin {{is one of}} {{two major}} {{depressions}} filled by Carboniferous sediments in insular Newfoundland. It is the northeast extension of the larger Maritimes Basin. It contains approximately 10 km of sediments ranging in age from Late Devonian to Late Carboniferous of which strata of the Anguille Group (Famennian - Tournaisian age) and the Codroy Group (Visean age) are described here. Both groups contain mostly nonmarine terrigenous clastic sediments with marine strata only within the Codroy Group. [...] The subbasin is believed to have formed as a pull-apart trough, rather than as a simple rift, adjacent to, and west of, the northeasterly trending Long Range fault, a major strike-slip structure {{that is part of the}} Hercynian Cabot Fault system in western Newfoundland. Dextral, strike-slip movements began in Middle or Late Devonian time and ended in Early Carboniferous (middle Visean) time. Three basin-fills, each approximately 3000 m thick, filled the pull-apart sequentially so that the oldest fill now occurs in the southwest and the youngest fill in the northeast. The first two basin-fills of Famennian and Tournasian age (Anguille Group), were deposited within an elongate, 30 km wide trough which initially formed between divergent faults near the southern margin of the Precambrian Steel Mountain anorthosite and which with time enlarged southwestward. The third basin-fill is made up of middle Visean strata (basal part of the Codroy Group). By this time, the subbasin had broadened to 60 km, and was irregular in shape, consisting of several subsiding depressions separated by fault-bounded archs. Wrench movements ceased in middle Visean time and the subbasin was subsequently influenced by block faulting when sediments of the upper part of the Codroy Group were deposited. [...] The Anguille Group comprises Famennian redbeds (Kennels Brook Formation), and Tournaisian deepwater lacustrine black shales and mudstones, and turbidite and deltaic sandstones (Snakes Bight Formation), gray, fluvial-deltaic sandstones and shales (Friars Cove Formation), and red braided stream sediments (Spout Falls Formation). Gray conglomerates of the Fischells conglomerate member of the Spout Falls Formation formed a local alluvial fan on the northwestern margin of the subbasin. [...] The Codroy Group of middle to late Visean age consists of marine and nonmarine rocks that appear to overlie conformably the Anguille Group. The basal Ship Cove Formation is a thin, subtidal to intertidal, laminated limestone (Windsor subzone A). Subsequent marine sedimentation includes sulphate and chloride evaporites that accumulated in sabkhas and shallow salinas (Codroy Road Formation and lower Jeffrey's Village Member of the Robinsons River <b>Formation</b> - <b>Windsor</b> subzones A and lower B). Associated carbonates and fine grained, gray to red siliciclastic rocks of the Codroy Road Formation and Jeffrey's Village Member formed in shallow seas, in lagoons, on shorelines and rarely as bioherms. Some nonmarine redbeds are intercalated with the basal marine deposits, and increasingly dominate the upper part of the Jeffrey's Village Member and the overlying Highlands Member of the Robinsons River <b>Formation</b> (<b>Windsor</b> subzones B and C). These redbeds were laid down on playa flats, on coastal and alluvial plains and on alluvial fans. Younger strata of the Codroy Group are confined to the southwest of the subbasin. Flood plain and alluvial fan were deposited there together with minor lacustrine and shallow marine rocks of the Mollichignick and Overfall Brook Members of the Robinsons River Formation and deltaic rocks of the Woody Cape <b>Formation</b> (<b>Windsor</b> subzones D and E). [...] Detritus for the groups was principally derived from uplifted Lower Paleozoic crystalline and volcanic terranes southeast and northeast of the subbasin. Lower Paleozoic platformal carbonates and quartzites and Taconic allochthonous ophiolite and flysch sequences were an important local source area for the Anguille Group northwest of the subbasin. [...] Evaporites and calcretes suggest that the Carboniferous climate was dominantly semiarid. Aridity was most intense during the middle Visean but humidity increased during the late Visean...|$|R
40|$|In the Cambro-Ordovician Mount Windsor subprovince, {{well known}} for its massive sulfide deposits, silica iron oxide exhalites possess complex textural and geochemical {{features}} that provide an insight into the very early stages of typical massive sulfide deposit development. In exploration they are also useful for identifying hotter systems most likely to host massive sulfide deposits. Three examples were mapped and sampled from outcrop and analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, major and trace elements, REE, and Nd and Sr radiogenic isotopes. They share a common evolutional history. Early microbially mediated silica iron oxyhydroxides (stage 1), which grew with very little clastic sediment incorporation, probably developed an Fe, U, V, Mo, As, Ag, Cd, P, Y, Be, Mg, and REE element association that has also been documented from metalliferous sediments on the modern sea floor. This stage is commonly overprinted by siliceous veins (stage 2), indicating that the exhalites directly overlay diffuse hydrothermal upflow zones. Less commonly, the silicification assemblage includes pyrite. Y, U, Be, V, and Mg positive correlations with Fe survived the subsurface silicification. Ag, As, Mo, Sb, REE, and Ba were leached from stage 1 zones during stage 2, presumably liberated during recrystallization of iron oxyhydroxide and were reprecipitated in narrow crosscutting zones within stage 2 silicification. The depositional mechanism is not well understood, but radiogenic isotope trends indicate that interaction between hydrothermal fluid and detrital silicates preferentially precipitated some of these metals. The hydrothermal transition from low-temperature (less than 100 degrees C) oxidized to higher temperature (more than 150 degrees C), H 2 S-bearing volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) -style fluids in some systems {{is evidenced by the}} addition of Cu, Pb, Zn, Tl, Mn, Se, and possibly Eu, mainly as trace elements in pyrite. The Sr and Nd isotope systematics of the jaspers can be explained for stage 1 by mixing of seawater, clastic, and hydrothermal end members, giving rise to complex isotopic populations. The stage 1 signatures are supplanted by relatively simple isotopic compositions with increasing stage 2 alteration intensity. This replacement is best expressed in plots of resistant detrital elements and metals such as As, Se, Zn, and Pb versus epsilon Nd and 87 Sr/ 86 Sri. The hydrothermal component has epsilon Nd(480 Ma) - 2, best explained by leaching of the underlying Trooper Creek Formation (epsilon Nd (480 Ma) = + 3. 8 to - 7. 3) rather than leaching of deeper Mount <b>Windsor</b> <b>Formation</b> rhyolitic volcanics (epsilon Nd (480 Ma) = - 4. 7 to - 12. 8). There is no support for a magmatic fluid, because no match exists with the known Trooper Creek Formation epsilon Nd(480 Ma) magmatic populations (epsilon Nd (480 Ma) = - 4. 1 to - 7. 3 and + 3. 8 to - 0. 9). The radiogenic isotopes support a shallow convecting model with jasper deposition from rockbuffered seawater. The evolution of fluids from cooler, oxidized to hotter, reduced conditions, either records heating induced by arrival of a subsurface thermal plume or the propagation of extensional faults deeper into a layered convective system...|$|E
