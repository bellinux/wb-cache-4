5|$|In a 2002 {{review in}} The New York Times, film critic Dave Kehr compares the film with Stella Dallas (1937) for the {{thematic}} similarity {{of the series}} of sacrifices made by the female lead, and with Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> (1939) as an epic mirroring social upheavals. Film critic Mark Cousins and author Tejaswini Ganti agree that the film is the Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> of Indian cinema.|$|E
5|$|Across all releases, it is {{estimated}} that Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> has sold over 200 million tickets in the United States and Canada, and 35 million tickets in the United Kingdom, generating more theater admissions in those territories than any other film. In total, Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> has grossed over $390 million globally at the box office; in 2007 Turner Entertainment estimated the gross to be equivalent to approximately $3.3 billion when adjusted for inflation to current prices, while Guinness World Records arrived at a figure of $3.44 billion in 2014, making it the most successful film in cinema history.|$|E

5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> set {{a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold {{the record of the}} longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted. The running time for Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> is just under 221minutes, while Lawrence of Arabia (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while Lawrence of Arabia comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E

These rotary transformers have a cylindrical, {{rather than a}} disc-shaped, air gap between windings. <b>The</b> rotor <b>winding</b> is a spool-shaped ferromagnetic core, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> placed like thread on a spool.

In 1998, she traveled to New York to help promote a special showing of Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> In 2003, she appeared as a presenter at the 75th Academy Awards. In 2004, Turner Classic Movies produced a retrospective piece called Melanie Remembers {{in which she was}} interviewed for the 65th anniversary of the original release of Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> In June 2006, she made appearances at tributes commemorating her 90th birthday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.|$|E

5|$|At {{least ten}} films have held {{the record of}} 'highest-grossing film' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915. Both The Birth of a Nation and Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> spent twenty-five {{consecutive}} years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg holding the record on three occasions and James Cameron—the current holder—twice. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind,</b> first published in 1936, the fictional character Rhett Butler warns a group of upper-class secessionists of the folly of war with the North in terms very reminiscent of those Sherman directed to David F. Boyd before leaving Louisiana. Sherman's invasion of Georgia later plays {{a central role in}} the plot of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the highly}} {{successful}} releases of Gone <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> and Rebecca, Selznick began a three-year liquidation of Selznick International Pictures {{in order to}} draw profits {{for himself and his}} outside investors. He developed and sold film projects to other producers and studios, and arranged loan outs of his contracted artists. Without outside backers he formed David O. Selznick Productions, Inc., which in 1941 became owner of one-fourth of United Artists.|$|E

5|$|Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> {{has been}} criticized as {{historical}} revisionism glorifying slavery, but nevertheless, it has been credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest films of all time; it has placed in the top ten of the American Film Institute's list of top 100 American films since the list's inception in 1998, and in 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|Hollywood was in {{the midst}} of a widely publicized search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's {{production}} of Gone <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> (1939). At the time, Myron Selznick—David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical agent—was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made a request to Myron Selznick that she be considered to play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{the sails}} were {{replaced}} and the mill re-thatched and restored by local craftsmen {{at a cost}} of a £100,000; the mill was re-opened later that year. The work was funded by the Grantscape Community Heritage Fund. Although the sails do not rotate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> they are moved 90 degrees four times per year for maintenance. Before the restoration work was undertaken surveys revealed that the mill was used as a roost for long-eared and lesser horseshoe bats. It was ensured that the bats would still have access after the restoration.|$|E
