5|$|As a result, {{leaves of}} the codex were {{scattered}} in several places of the monastery, from where they <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> several occasions by people from France, Russia, and Italy. The first was Pierre Séguier (1588–1672), who bought 14 leaves which, known later as Fragmenta Coisliniana, and {{became a part of}} the Fonds Coislin. They were held in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In 1715 Bernard de Montfaucon published text of these 14 leaves. He made a few mistakes corrected by Tischendorf (in 1865). Tischendorf observed in Paris additional passage. Montfaucon used the manuscript for his palaeographical studies.|$|E

5|$|In late 1969, Zappa {{broke up}} the band. He often cited the {{financial}} strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some {{took it as a}} sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, a bounty was levied on J.lagostoma {{in order to reduce}} its numbers. Hunters were paid 6 pence (alternatively paid in rum) for every hundred claws collected. In 1879, the total bag for the island {{comprised}} 66 cats, 4,013 mice, 7,683 rats and 80,414 land crabs; in the eight years to 1887, bounties <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> more than 330,000 crabs. The current population is much smaller, and the low level of recruitment and lack of juveniles suggests that the species may become endangered.|$|E

5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero, also {{referred}} to as the Virgin Islands dwarf gecko, was discovered in the summer of 1964 by biologist Richard Thomas during a collecting trip along the dry, wooded slopes of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands. The holotype for Sphaerodactylus parthenopion, MCZ 77211, was an adult female collected on 12 August 1964 on a hillside above Pond Bay. A total of eight paratypes <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> Virgin Gorda and used to describe the new species.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1905, {{traffic on}} Beverley Beck more than trebled, from 33,498 tons to 101,540 tons. Coal and other {{minerals}} accounted for around {{one quarter of}} the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, flour and scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> 28,169 tons of cargo. Traffic on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, cottonseed, wheat, flour and artificial manures. In 1922, £7 of income was received from pleasure craft using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to road competition, and closed in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England (1066–1071), Norwich was radically redesigned. Norwich Cathedral was built {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Tombland and much of the old town to the southwest of Tombland was cleared for the motte of Norwich Castle. A new Norman town was built west of the Castle, in an area known as Mancroft. The new town at Mancroft included a market of its own to provide for the Norman settlers and merchants moving into the area, and possibly also to supply the castle's garrison. The exact date of the foundation of the market at Mancroft is not recorded, but it is known to have been operational by the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086. Granting the right to trade in Norman England {{was a part of the}} Royal Prerogative and, as with most fairs and markets of the period, the market at Mancroft was operated under licence from the King. The King's Clerk had jurisdiction over all trade conducted at the market, and tolls and rents <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the King.|$|E

5|$|Trade on {{the lower}} river was carried in barges and keels. During the early 1800s as trade was increasing, so the river was {{simultaneously}} silting up. Around 1800, vessels carrying 60 tons could reach the port facilities at Spalding; however, by the 1820s, ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as the river silting had worsened. Trade records indicate that in 1829, vessels carried just under 20,000 tons to and from Spalding, and by 1835 this had increased to over 34,000 tons. There was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels, and with later improvements, carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1837, barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use the port. Because the river was maintained for drainage, some commercial traffic continued despite the railways, and tolls of £478 <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> <b>on</b> 11,690 tons in 1888. Coal for Spalding gasworks arrived by boat until the early 1900s, and the last regular trade was the carriage of corn, hay and straw from Spalding to Fosdyke, where the cargo was transferred to larger ships. All commercial carrying had ceased {{by the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E
