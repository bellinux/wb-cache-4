For example, from television: Jerry Springer, from literature: John Kennedy Toole, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of A Confederacy of Dunces, Shirley Ann Grau, Pulitzer Prize for Fiction winner, and Andrew Breitbart, conservative journalist; from business: David Filo, co-founder of Yahoo!, and Neil Bush, economist and brother of President George W. Bush; from entertainment: Lauren Hutton, film actor and supermodel, and Paul Michael Glaser, TV actor of [...] "Starsky and Hutch"; from fine arts: Sergio Rossetti Morosini, artist and conservator; from music: conductor and composer Odaline de la Martinez, {{who was the first}} woman to conduct at a BBC Proms concert in London; from government: Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House who famously coordinated the first Congressional Republican majority in 40 years, and Luther Terry, former U.S. Surgeon General who issued the first official health hazard warning for tobacco; from medicine: Michael DeBakey and Dr. Regina Benjamin, President Obama's Surgeon General; from science A. Baldwin Wood, inventor of the <b>wood</b> <b>screw</b> pump and Lisa P. Jackson, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator under President Obama; from sports: Bobby Brown, former New York Yankees third baseman and former president of the American League. A former graduate residence hall on campus was also named for Engineering graduate Harold Rosen, who invented the geosynchronous communications satellite. Douglas G. Hurley, NASA astronaut and pilot of mission STS-127, became the first alumnus to travel in outer space in July 2009.|$|E

50|$|When a screw {{is driven}} without a pilot hole, or with too small a pilot hole, {{the core of}} the screw may bind and lead to the screw being broken. The {{appropriate}} pilot hole will prevent binding while providing sufficient friction to keep the screw from loosening. For common <b>wood</b> <b>screws,</b> the pilot providing clearance for {{the core of the}} screw may be followed by a larger bit to shallower depth to provide clearance for the larger, unthreaded shank of the <b>screw.</b> For standard <b>wood</b> <b>screws,</b> special pilot drill bits are manufactured to produce the correct hole profile in a single operation, rather than needing several different drill bit sizes and depths.|$|R
50|$|The {{metal screw}} {{did not become}} a common {{fastener}} until machine tools for their mass production were developed {{toward the end of}} the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> screws made of metal to be used in wood in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of machine screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).|$|R
50|$|Today {{the threads}} of {{threaded}} fasteners (such as machine <b>screws,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>screws,</b> wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) {{are usually not}} cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread forming and rolling and cutting with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern screw machines. These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not screw-cutting lathes {{in the sense of}} employing single-point screw-cutting.|$|R

50|$|Where a {{fastener}} forms its own thread in the component being fastened, {{it is called}} a screw.

50|$|The first {{production}} run rifles had a 33-inch barrel. Early models had {{the bottom of}} the octagon portion of the barrel rounded. In 1805 this was changed and the bottoms were left octagonal, which resulted in a slightly heavier barrel. The <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> used were hand forged. All first {{production run}} rifles were given a serial number.|$|R

50|$|Wooden {{tables are}} {{constructed}} using lumber boards. Protection for the wood (stain, paint, or wood protectant that repels water) is necessary {{to protect it from}} cracking, warping, or rotting due to moisture. The table-top and bench-top boards are attached to the trusses or beams using <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> or nails. The legs can be secured with carriage bolts fastened by nuts and washers.|$|R
50|$|Ramapo Iron Works, {{located near}} present-day State Route 17 {{at the base}} of Terse Mountain, was a {{producer}} of first cut nails made in American, <b>wood</b> <b>screws,</b> cotton cloth, and spring steel {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. Its founder, Jeremiah H. Pierson, was influential in building the Nyack Turnpike and the New York & Erie Railroad across the county. A cotton mill is still standing on the east side of the road.|$|R
2500|$|The process languished until 1867, when Harvey J. Harwood of Utica, New York filed {{a patent}} for the {{cold-rolling}} of threads on <b>wood</b> <b>screws.</b> [...] Further efforts to cold-roll threads on screws followed, but none seemed {{to meet with}} much success until Hayward Augustus Harvey (1824-1893) of Orange, N.J. filed his patents of 1880 and 1881. [...] Charles D. Rogers of the American Screw Co. of Providence, Rhode Island made further refinements {{to the process of}} rolling threads onto screws.|$|R

50|$|Lag screws (US) or {{coach screws}} (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also {{referred}} to as lag bolts or coach bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large <b>wood</b> <b>screws.</b> Square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1 standards, and the head is typically an external hex. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 1/4 in to 1+1/4 in, and lengths from 1/4 to 6 in or longer, with the coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).|$|R
30|$|According {{to average}} values, the {{chipboard}} screws {{had a higher}} WR than <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> at both 12 and 28  % moisture contents. This may be because the chipboard screws give less damage the <b>wood</b> fibres during <b>screwing</b> depends on their thread. Regarding moisture contents, the screw WR at 12  % MC was higher than at 28  % MC for both screw types. This result shows that wood have the more moisture contents the more soften. Tangential surfaces (radial direction) had a higher WR in both moisture contents than the other surfaces (Table  2). This {{may be caused by}} the arrangement of wood cell and fibre angle orientations. The effects of the screw type, moisture content, and surfaces on the screw WR were statistically significant (p <  0.001).|$|R
50|$|Six {{hardened}} steel <b>wood</b> <b>screws</b> passing through slightly oversize holes {{just in front}} of the pivot point stopped the bridge from being pulled towards the neck end of the guitar. The upper portion of the screws is smooth, not threaded. These six screws are often mistakenly assumed to be the pivot point rather than the hidden knife edge. This design works, in spite of the friction caused by the edges of the six holes sliding up and down the screw shafts when vibrato is applied.|$|R
