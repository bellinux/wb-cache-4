5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> minutes.|$|E

In addition, PTWs can also be a good com-promise to face in inner-city parking problems.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{traces the}} emergence of a local culture of movie-going in the Netherlands Indies (present-day Indonesia) from 1896 until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. It outlines the introduction of the new technology by independent touring exhibitors, the constitution of a market for moving picture shows, the embedding of moving picture exhibition within the local popular entertainment scene, and the Dutch colonial authorities’ efforts to control film consumption and distribution. Focusing on the cinema as a social institution, in which technology, race and colonialism converged, moving picture venues in the Indies – ranging from canvas or bamboo tents to cinema palaces of brick and stone – are perceived as liminal spaces in which daily interactions across boundaries could occur within colonial Indonesia’s multi-ethnic and increasingly polarized colonial society. This dissertation makes an important contribution to recent developments in the study of {{the emergence of}} the new medium of film. Traditionally, the emphasis has often been on Europe and North America, and it was assumed that cinema arrived much later in other parts of the world, especially in former colonial territories. By shifting the focus from the study of film production to exhibition and consumption, this dissertation reveals that screenings in the Netherlands Indies took place much earlier than was hitherto known. In fact, already in October 1896 a French entrepreneur exhibited films in Batavia (Jakarta), thus ten months after the Lumière brothers had their first commercial debut in Paris, and the same exhibitor also made films in the Indies in early 1897. As this study shows, over the following decade, new technologies for projecting moving images, along with the latest films on offer, often arrived in far flung locations <b>within</b> just <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> weeks from their first appearance on screens in the West. Such screenings were presented by exhibitors of various nationalities and ethnicities, and were similarly attended by spectators from all levels of colonial society.

The offensive broke Army Group A, and much of Germany's remaining capacity for military resistance. The Soviet forces crossed the Silesian border on 19 January and Harpe was relieved of his command and replaced by Generaloberst Ferdinand Schörner on 20 January. Schörner established his headquarters at Oppeln. Here Strachwitz, on crutches, went to see Schörner, requesting a front command to defend his homeland. Schörner declined the offer and Strachwitz insisted on another assignment. Bending to the request, Schörner initially kept him in his staff where Strachwitz conceived the plan of creating a specialized Panzerjagdbrigade (tank-hunting brigade). The 3rd Guards Tank Army conquered Oppeln and Groß Strehlitz on 23 January 1945. The following day Groß Stein fell {{into the hands of the}} advancing Red Army and Strachwitz's palace and entire estate were confiscated.

40|$|Abstract Background Health systems {{research}} is increasingly being conducted in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Such research should aim to reduce health disparities between and <b>within</b> countries as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> global justice. For such research to do so, ethical guidance {{that is consistent}} with egalitarian theories of social justice proposes it ought to (amongst other things) focus on worst-off countries and research populations. Yet who constitutes the worst-off is not well-defined. Methods and Results By applying existing work on disadvantage from political philosophy, the paper demonstrates that (at least) two options exist for how to define the worst-off upon whom equity-oriented health systems research should focus: those who are worst-off in terms of health or those who are systematically disadvantaged. The paper describes in detail how both concepts can be understood and what metrics can be relied upon to identify worst-off countries and research populations at the sub-national level (groups, communities). To demonstrate how each can be used, the paper considers two real-world cases of health systems research and whether their choice of country (Uganda, India) and research population in 2011 would have been classified as amongst the worst-off according to the proposed concepts. Conclusions The two proposed concepts can classify different countries and sub-national populations as worst-off. It is recommended that health researchers (or other actors) should use the concept that best reflects their moral commitments—namely, to perform research focused on reducing health inequalities or systematic disadvantage more broadly. If addressing the latter, it is recommended that they rely on the multidimensional poverty approach rather than the income approach to identify worst-off populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} contribution of this thesis is through its conceptualisations of human more-than- human encounters on the allotment that {{break down the}} boundaries of subjectivities. This work extends knowledge of cultural food geography by investigating how people engage with the <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> the plot and learn to grow food. The conceptual tool by which this occurs is set out as processes of visceral learning <b>within</b> <b>a</b> framework <b>of</b> <b>mattering.</b> Therefore this work follows the material transformations <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> across production consumption cycles of allotment produce. This is examined through processes of bodily adaptions to the <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> the plot. The processes of growing your own food affords an opportunity {{to focus on the}} processes of doing and becoming, allowing the how of food growing to take centre stage (Crouch 2003, Ingold 2010, Grosz 1999). Procuring and producing food for consumption is enacted through the human more-than-human interface of bodily engagement that disrupts dualisms and revealing their complex inter-relationships, as well as the potential of visceral research (Roe 2006, Whatmore 2006, Hayes-Conroy 2008). Therefore, this is an immersive account of the procurement of food and the development of food knowledge through material, sensory and visceral becomings, which occur <b>within</b> <b>a</b> contextual frame of everyday food experiences. This study is contextualised in the complexities of contemporary food issues where <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> access, foodism and sustainability shape the enquiry. However the research is carried out at a micro-geographies lens of bodily engagements with food matter through grow your own practices on allotments. Growing food on new allotments is the locus of procurement reflecting a resurgence in such activities following from the recent rise in interest in local food, alternative food networks (AFNs) and food as a conduit for celebrity in the media (Dupuis & Goodman 2005, Lockie & Kitto 2000, Winter 2003). Moreover, the current spread of the allotment is examined as transgressing urban/rural divides and disrupting traditional perceptions of plot users. This allows investigations into spaces where community processes can unfold, providing a richly observed insight into the broadened demographics of recent allotment life...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable Built Environments Senior Capstone ProjectFor over a century, Pima Indians living {{just south}} of Phoenix, Arizona on the Gila River Indian Reservation have {{suffered}} from an epidemic of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Over half of the Pima population living on the reservation is diagnosed with diabetes while the socioeconomic conditions of the tribal community are in an unstable and dilapidated state (Unnatural Causes 2008). 	Fifty percent of the Pimas living on the Gila River Indian Community {{live below the poverty}} level (Unnatural Causes 2008). Displacement from traditional customs and neglect from the U. S. federal government {{are just some of the}} detrimental impacts the people have faced over the last century (Unnatural Causes 2008). The discussions within this paper will attempt to address how and why the Pima Indians have experienced such severe changes in lifestyle and economy over the last century and what affect this has had on the physical health of the people in the community. By addressing these overarching issues, one should find that socioeconomics and conditions of physical health are strongly connected. Looking even closer though, specifically at the epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the contributing risk factors that this population suffers from, one will begin to question how <b>within</b> just <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> 3 decades the number of diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes doubled among the Pima and how the rates are some of the highest recorded in the entire world. Moreover, the underlying issue is not simply a cause of poor diet, change in activity levels and unfavorable genetics, rather - being robbed of a critical natural resource, forced to adapt to unfavorable economic changes and in the end, the U. S. government failure to intervene – are truly the underlying causes that have impacted the health of the Pima Indians of Southern Arizona. 	The Pimas are people of their natural environment. Having a long history of living along the Gila River, the Pima were water irrigation engineers (Unnatural Causes 2008). Cultivating local crops, living off the land and providing for themselves using waters of the Gila River in an arid climate is as much a part of their culture as is their ancestral bloodline. 	The research presented in these discussions will look at the identical ancestry of Pima Indians living in Southwestern Sonora, Mexico in the Sierra Madre Mountains of Maycoba in order to evaluate the Pima tribe’s predisposition to the disease. The significance of looking at these groups is that their genetic history is the same based upon linguistic and genealogy studies (Schulz, Bennett, Ravussin, Kidd, Kidd, Esparza, Valencia, 2006). However, the Pima living in Sonora have not seen the same ever-increasing rates of type 2 diabetes or even obesity, as their northern counterparts have. Notably, the Mexican Pima have not experienced the same environmental changes (i. e. drought) either. Subsequently, the Pima of Sonora have been able to continue their traditional ways of life including subsistence farming and healthy diet and exercise. A historical background of the Arizona Pimas will be provided, from their cultural traditions as irrigation engineers to their participation in federal subsidy programs and their current economic state. In-depth historical accounts will also be made for the history of water law in the Southwestern United States, including what drove white settlers’ demand for water west of the Mississippi over the course of two centuries, to the attempts to mitigate the severity of drought on Native American reservations through multiple legislative acts. Information regarding the Mexican Pima’s current economy, levels of physical activity and typical diet will be presented in comparison to the present health and economic conditions of the Arizona Pima...|$|R
