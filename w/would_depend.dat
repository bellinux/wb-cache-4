5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{not include}} the 1985 winner, Bernard Hinault. An El Mundo Deportivo writer believed LeMond, Moser, and Saronni to be the favorites to win the overall crown. In addition, the writer felt that Pedro Muñoz had the best chances to win the race, out of all the Spanish riders entering the event. Atala-Ofmega sports director Franco Criblori believed that Saronni's results <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on what form he could maintain in the mountains. In addition, Criblori thought Dutchman Johan van der Velde and Swiss rider Niki Rüttimann were two foreigners to consider for a high place in the general classification.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence {{that his client}} would not be playing in the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail {{that he would be}} happy to stay and that any move <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on the club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all four in a 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E

5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Harald is {{reported}} in the sagas to have gone to Jerusalem and fought in battles in the area. Although the sagas place this after his expedition to Sicily, historian Kelly DeVries has questioned that chronology. Whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on whether it took place {{before or after the}} 1036 peace treaty between Michael IV and the Fatimid Caliph Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah (in reality the Caliph's mother, originally a Byzantine Christian, since the Caliph was a minor), although it is considered unlikely to have been made before. Modern historians have speculated that Harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to Jerusalem (possibly including members of the Imperial family) following the peace agreement, as it was also agreed that the Byzantines were allowed to repair the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Furthermore, this may in turn have presented Harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on Christian pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|Chapter X {{examines}} whether {{patterns in}} the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, {{but not at the}} same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the Americans would share <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on what they had to offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. It would be the biggest and most complex British test series.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined {{in a manner that is}} directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E

25|$|According to Kelly's theory, {{the manner}} of {{accessing}} stored information <b>would</b> <b>depend</b> on whether the culture was mobile or more settled.

Kelly has observed similar techniques within the modern Australian Aborigines, who use features on the landscape as visual cues to retrieve information. On the other hand, societies that were less mobile but not completely settled would create local replications of the landscape to access information, such as circles of timber or stone, sequences of mounds and other prehistoric built environments.|$|E
