Yet fuel consumption and other aspects of the vehicle operation were, during Project Mercury, as much, if not more, the responsibility of the ground controllers. Moreover, hardware malfunctions went unidentified, while organizational tensions between the astronaut office and the flight controller office—tensions that NASA did not resolve until the later Gemini and Apollo programs—may account for much of the latter-day criticism of Carpenter's performance during his flight.|$|E

In fact, as it turns out, the gypsy curse that was used on Angel was meant to be used on Zheng, turning him into the 'vampire champion', but it didn't take, and Zheng is determined to find out why Angel's soul was restored and his wasn't. A battle for survival between the pair ensues, which Angel wins. Supposed to be set early in the second season of Angel. Collected in Angel: Long Night's Journey.|$|E

Deep Blue went to sleep within his new body, leaving Masaya with no memories of <b>who</b> <b>or</b> what he really is, but retaining some of Deep Blue's disgust for the way humans were treating the environment. Despite being the primary antagonist, Deep Blue does not actually appear until the end of the sixth volume of the manga. Deep Blue is cold natured, cruel hearted, and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Upon awakening, he attacks and injures Ichigo as he does not share Masaya's love for her, and kills Quiche without any hesitation when challenged to a duel. This allows Masaya to temporarily re-emerge and release Mew Aqua inside his body, killing them both.|$|E

[...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club ranked the album B+, {{considering}} it the [...] "tightest Pearl Jam album in a decade", describing the album as a comeback [...] "filled with straight-up, riff-a-riffic rock songs." [...] Mojo gave the album three out of five stars. The review said, [...] "elf-titled with good reason: Pearl Jam sound reborn, vital." [...] Kyle Anderson of Spin gave the album three out of five stars. He said that [...] "rather than rage against the time machine, they seem to be having fun... Pearl Jam are taking themselves less seriously, and it fits them like a snug flannel shirt." [...] Mat Snow of The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars. In the review he stated that Vedder [...] "musters absolute conviction in writing and singing lyrics of male teenage angst." [...] Snow observed, [...] "And though few of these 13 numbers have the drama of tracks by the <b>Who</b> <b>or</b> Led Zeppelin, from whom the band draw much of their style, Pearl Jam play like men on a mission."

500|$|Dylan's two {{previous}} albums, The Times They Are A-Changin' and Another Side of Bob Dylan both {{ended with a}} farewell song, [...] "Restless Farewell" [...] and [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe" [...] respectively. [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] concludes Bringing It All Back Home in consistent fashion. Much speculation has surrounded <b>who</b> <b>or</b> what the [...] "Baby Blue" [...] to whom Dylan is singing farewell is. Although Dylan himself has remained mute on the subject, Dylan scholars {{believe that it is}} probably an amalgam of personalities within Dylan's social orbit. One person who has been regarded as the subject of the song is folk singer Joan Baez. Dylan and Baez were still in a relationship and were planning to tour together, but Dylan had been growing as an artist and as a person and may have already been planning to leave the relationship. Another possibility is a singer-songwriter named David Blue. A friend or acquaintance of Dylan's from his days in New York's Greenwich Village, Blue is pictured on the cover of Dylan and the Band's The Basement Tapes album wearing a trench coat. Yet another possibility is Dylan's one-time friend, folk singer Paul Clayton. Although Clayton had been Dylan's friend throughout 1964, and had accompanied Dylan on the road trip across the United States on which [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] were written, by 1965 he may have become more devoted to Dylan than Dylan was comfortable with, and Clayton's use of amphetamines may have made him difficult to be around. However, author Paul Williams, in his book Performing Artist: Book One 1960–1973, counters that [...] "Dylan may have been thinking of a particular person as he wrote it, but not necessarily", adding that the song has such a natural, flowing structure to it, that it could [...] "easily have finished writing itself before Dylan got around to thinking about who 'Baby Blue' was." ...|$|E
